            When the flu strikes, it can feel relentless: rising fever, hacking cough, stuffy nose and sore throat. For many people, relief can come in the form of Tamiflu, a prescription antiviral medication used to treat and even prevent the illness.
    


            But some people may not realize that Tamiflu isn't the only option.
    


            Other flu treatments are available in the United States. These alternatives sometimes fly under the radar, in part because some are targeted for specific populations. But Xofluza, a one-dose pill, is approved for people 5 years and older – and can be a strong alternative for some people who may otherwise be prescribed Tamiflu. 



            Antiviral medications tend to work best when started within two days after symptoms begin, so having easy access to treatment options is key for treating the flu most effectively.
    


Tested positive for flu during the holidays? Here's what you should do



            To treat flu this season, there are four antiviral drugs recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Tamiflu or oseltamivir, Xofluza or baloxavir, Relenza or zanamivir, and Rapivab or peramivir.
    


            Tamiflu is used to treat flu in people ages 2 weeks and older, and to reduce the chance of getting the flu in people 1 year and older. The medicine is administered in liquid form or capsules, and typically must be taken twice daily for five days when used for flu treatment. When used for prevention after exposure, it is typically taken once daily for 10 days. Available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu, it may cost about $50 or less without insurance. The most common side effects include nausea and vomiting.
    


            As another option, Xofluza is administered as a single-dose tablet and approved for ages 5 and older. It can be used to treat or prevent the flu, and it may cost nearly $200 without insurance, but eligible patients can use coupons to lessen costs. The most common side effects include diarrhea and vomiting.
    


            “The most common complaint I hear about is vomiting from Tamiflu,” Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician based in Texas and author of the Baby 411 book series, said in an email. She referenced a 2023 study that showed about 18% of people experience vomiting with Tamiflu versus 5% with Xofluza.
    


            The study also found that about 5% of people get diarrhea with Xofluza compared with none taking Tamiflu. “I've also had a few pediatric patients experience moodiness with Tamiflu, which is reported in the literature,” she said.
    


Flu is spreading ahead of holiday gatherings



            The “biggest difference” between Tamiflu and Xofluza is that Xofluza can stop viral shedding in one day while Tamiflu may take about three days, Brown said.
    


            That means the rest of the household may have less exposure to the flu and fewer people may come down with it, but “both antivirals will help reduce the duration of the misery by a couple of days,” Brown said. For instance, with treatment, some people may experience five days of flu symptoms instead of seven.
    


            Rapivab is one of the other prescription medications approved to treat flu. The drug is approved for ages 6 months and older, given once as an intravenous infusion by a health care provider. It may cost up to about $1,000 without insurance, and the most common adverse reaction in adults tends to be diarrhea.
    


            Lastly, Relenza is the other recommended flu medication. It is inhaled in powder form, and typically administered using an inhaler device twice a day for five days. The prescription drug is approved to treat flu in ages 7 and older, and for preventive use in ages 5 and older. It may cost up to about $90 without insurance. Side effects include allergic reaction, dizziness or irritation of the nose, and it is not recommended for people with breathing problems, such as asthma.
    


            Among the recommended flu treatments, Tamiflu tends to be the go-to flu medication for most patients. But Xofluza is becoming more widely used, Brown said.
    


            However, it may not always be available in pharmacies, recommended by providers or covered by insurance.
    


            “I suspect it is region-dependent,” Brown said about access to treatment.
    


            “When one part of the country has surging flu cases, there is higher demand. We have not encountered this issue in Austin,” she said. For instance, this flu season, she has only had one Xofluza prescription that she needed to send to a different pharmacy because the first pharmacy was out of stock.
    


            But overall, “Xofluza is rising in popularity over Tamiflu,” Brown said.
    


            “One dose. Fewer side effects. More insurances are covering the cost of it now and manufacturer coupon makes it less expensive than in previous years,” she said, adding that she prefers it for her patients. “But all of the factors above–cost, ability to swallow a pill, availability can impact that decision.”
    


Flu variant driving up cases across the US



            Another factor that may impact decisions: There is a growing concern about the influenza virus developing resistance to Xofluza.
    


            “This is more in the minds of the practitioner – and I think it has been one of the reasons it hasn't been used more frequently – the influenza virus can develop resistance to baloxavir, to Xofluza, during the course of treatment,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
    


            “That happens sometimes around 10% of the time, so it's not trivial. And that's why I think the longer-term Tamiflu continues to be favored – that and the side effect of diarrhea,” he said. “So, Tamiflu tends to be recommended more frequently, despite the fact that you do have to take it for five days.”
    


            Xofluza resistance has appeared to occur even more frequently in younger children, Dr. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer of the influenza division at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call earlier this month of the CDC's Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA).
    


            “This emergence of baloxavir resistance is associated with a longer duration of symptoms,” Uyeki said during the call. “Fortunately, transmission of a baloxavir-resistant virus from person to person has been very, very limited. It's been reported, but it appears to be very uncommon and there's no circulation of baloxavir-resistant viruses or oseltamivir-resistant viruses in the general population.”
    


Flu season in the US is heating up, driven by new subclade K variant



            National influenza experts discussed on the COCA call that Tamiflu or oseltamivir is preferred for treating hospitalized patients and people with progressive illness.
    


            Xofluza is not recommended during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, for outpatients with complicated or progressive illness, severely immunosuppressed people or hospitalized patients, because of the lack of information on its use for these groups.
    


            But there are situations for which Xofluza may be preferred.
    


            “For a patient with known or suspected influenza B, baloxavir has much greater efficacy against influenza B compared to oseltamivir,” Uyeki said during the call, adding that the medication is “generally well tolerated.”
    


            “A single dose of baloxavir is not associated with many side effects and fewer side effects compared to oseltamivir,” he said. “For patients, I think every patient would prefer a single oral dose of baloxavir versus five days, twice-daily of oseltamivir treatment.”
    


            At the end of the call, Uyeki added that researchers should continue studying the potential benefits of treating flu patients with a combination of antiviral medications, especially those with severe disease.
    


            “I think we need more data for treatment of influenza in hospitalized influenza patients, so severe influenza,” he said. “And for that we need more data for a combination antiviral treatment, for example oseltamivir-plus-baloxavir.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has wished merry Christmas to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has revealed.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Peskov said that Putin had already sent a telegram with greetings to Trump, adding that “there is no indication that a phone conversation between the two leaders is planned for today.”

Under the Trump administration, relations between Russia and the US have been notably warmer than during the tenure of former President Joe Biden.

Putin and Trump have been engaged in active talks over settling the Ukraine conflict and reinvigorating bilateral relations, holding a high-stakes summit in Alaska in August aimed at ending hostilities between Moscow and Kiev, though the talks failed to produce a breakthrough.

In June, Putin also called Trump on his 79th birthday, with the two discussing Iran and the Middle East during a 50-minute conversation. The leaders also held a phone call on October 16, during which Putin congratulated Trump on helping mediate the peace agreement in Gaza.

Last year, several weeks before Trump's inauguration, Putin refrained from sending any Christmas greeting to most Western leaders as well as the US President, explaining that America has positioned as an “unfriendly” country towards Russia.

An 18-year-old Russian woman has been caught planting an improvised explosive device on a car in the city of Stavropol on orders from Ukrainian special services, the Federal Security Service (FSB) reported Friday.

The agency said the woman was coerced through a phone scam that convinced her she was under criminal investigation and could receive leniency by performing what the Russian authorities consider an attempted terrorist attack.

The Ukrainian handler arranged the delivery of an IED with an explosive power equivalent to 400 grams of TNT, the FSB said. The suspect was instructed to place it under a vehicle at the parking lot of a military base in southern Russia. The woman is a resident of the neighboring Krasnodar Region.

The agency released footage of the arrest and an interview with the suspect, in which she expressed regret.

Earlier this week, the FSB reported thwarting two separate Ukrainian terrorist plots in Kaluga and Tyumen regions. In both cases, male suspects were killed in firefights during arrest attempts, according to the law enforcement service.

Moscow has accused Kiev of escalating terrorist activities on Russian soil as its frontline forces face setbacks. The Russian authorities say scams are routinely used by Ukrainian intelligence to pressure citizens into committing crimes.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has advised the country's citizens to refrain from traveling to Germany, warning that they could face persecution on national grounds there.

During a briefing on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova drew attention to repeated incidents in which Russians were subjected to “unjustified harassment” by Berlin under the pretext of EU sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict.

The restrictions extend even to goods purchased for personal use within the bloc, leading German customs officials to seize items from Russian citizens as they leave the country, she said. Purchases worth more than $300 (€353) are affected. As a result, people are not only being “robbed in broad daylight,” but are also missing their flights due to bureaucratic delays and are forced to buy new tickets, Zakharova added.

Moscow addressed the German authorities over the incidents but received no reply, the spokeswoman noted.

Public figures such as the head coach of Zenit St. Petersburg football club, Sergey Semak, have also been mistreated, Zakharova said.

Earlier this month, the wife of the former PSG player, Anna Semak, complained on social media that she and her huband had to pay a hefty fine for a pair of shoes, glasses, and a scarf they purchased in Germany at a Munich airport, while the items were taken from them.

“We strongly urge citizens of our country to refrain from traveling to Germany unless absolutely necessary,” Zakharova said.

According to the spokeswoman, Germany has been “de facto transformed into a ‘lawless territory' for people of a certain nationality – in this case, people from Russia... The German law enforcement officers have become punishers, pursuing Russians with maniacal persistence. They bully them and do not even hide this fact.”

Germany has been Ukraine's main backer in the EU since the escalation of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022, providing the country with almost €44 billion ($52 billion) in aid. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has repeatedly called Moscow a threat to Berlin and the whole bloc.

The Russian authorities reject claims of harboring any aggressive plans against the EU, saying they are only being made by Western politicians to distract the public from domestic problems and justify increased military spending.

WASHINGTON, December 26. /TASS/. The United States' plans to supply weapons to Taiwan will not bring Washington the results it hopes for, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, told TASS, stressing that China's determination to defend its sovereignty must not be underestimated.

""The ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces on the island attempt to advance their independence agenda and resist reunification through military buildup, squander the taxpayers' money to purchase weapons, and even risk turning Taiwan into a ""powder keg."" Such moves will not reverse the inevitable failure of ""Taiwan independence,"" and will only push the Taiwan Strait into the danger of military conflict at a faster pace. For the U.S., assisting the ""independence"" agenda by arming Taiwan will only backfire, and using Taiwan to contain China will never succeed,"" he emphasized in response to a recently published Pentagon report on the development of China's military, which asserted that Beijing aims to ensure by the end of 2027 the capability to wage a war against Taiwan and to win it.

Liu Pengyu emphasized that earlier ""the US blatantly announced its plan to sell massive advanced weapons to China's Taiwan region."" ""This move grossly violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu·s, infringes on China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, undermines peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and sends a gravely wrong signal to ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this, and has immediately lodged serious protests with the US side,"" he stressed.

""No one shall underestimate the firm will and strong capability of the Chinese government and the Chinese people in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he added. According to him, the United States must ""immediately stop the dangerous act of arming Taiwan."" ""China will take resolute and strong measures to defend its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,"" he reiterated, asserting that the Taiwan issue is fundamental for Beijing and remains ""the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.""

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian earlier criticized reports from the US Department of War, asserting that they deliberately distort China's defense strategy and serve as tools to sow discord in China's relations with third countries.

 

US arms supplies to Taiwan

 

The US government earlier announced its approval of the sale of several arms packages to Taiwan, including HIMARS missile systems, anti-tank missiles, and drones, with a total estimated value of $11.1 billion.

Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te wrote in a late November article for The Washington Post that Taipei will allocate an additional $40 billion for defense, specifying that the funds will be used to purchase weapons from the United States.

Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949, when remnants of the Kuomintang forces led by Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) fled there after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War. According to Beijing, supported by most countries including Russia, Taiwan is part of the PRC. The United States severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established them with China. While adhering to the One China policy, Washington continues to maintain unofficial ties with Taipei and supply the island with weapons. China estimates that US military aid to Taiwan has exceeded $70 billion over the past several years.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 26. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky's heavy reliance on British intelligence was a big reason why Kiev abandoned the Istanbul talks in 2022, Andrey Klimov, a member of the Supreme Council of the United Russia party and the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, said in an interview with TASS.

According to Klimov, in the first months of the special military operation, there was a real chance to end the conflict through political and diplomatic means. ""Kiev was ready for it. And the Turks, who helped us organize the meetings in Istanbul [in the spring of 2022], also saw some light at the end of the tunnel. Not bright, not clearly defined, but it was there,"" Klimov said, adding that subsequent British involvement, specifically the visit of then Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Kiev, derailed the negotiating process.

""There are persistent rumors, and I believe they are close to the truth, that Zelensky is essentially working for MI6, the British foreign intelligence agency,"" Klimov said. ""At the very least, British intelligence is looking after him."" He suggested that this oversight serves a few purposes. ""You can protect someone, or you can restrict their freedom, or you can keep tabs on them. Perhaps all of that at once,"" Klimov said.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The database includes dangerous foreign criminals detained in the past 11 months by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS agency that locates and deports illegal migrants.

When Trump began deploying troops to US cities, Janessa Goldbeck's Vet Voice Foundation was ready – now they're preparing for what may be next

Whatever the worst-case scenario, Janessa Goldbeck has probably imagined it. In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup. Last year she advised local leaders on the hypothetical of troops being deployed to their streets for immigration enforcement.

Then Donald Trump won and Goldbeck's nightmare came true.

“It's a little surreal to see something that we've been talking about and thinking about and stressing out about,” the chief executive of Vet Voice Foundation, a non-profit advocacy organisation, says via Zoom from her home in San Diego, California. “When we first did War Game, the film, some folks would ask during our press tour, ‘Do you think you're scaring people? This feels a little hyperbolic?' It doesn't feel good to say I told you so in this moment.”

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has sought to politicise the military like no other commander-in-chief before him and use it as a cudgel against Democratic-led states and cities. He has deployed thousands of national guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans and Washington DC, triggering protests from local officials and residents.

Having read the Project 2025 policy document, Goldbeck saw this coming. Last year Vet Voice Foundation, which mobilises veterans and military families to defend US democracy, ran exercises with local elected officials, activists and journalists to prepare for a second Trump administration conducting aggressive immigration enforcement. It has now become a vital resource for governors, state attorneys general and mayors trying to weather the storm.

Goldbeck, 40, explains: “This year the vast majority of our work has been supporting litigation to halt or slow down national guard deployments, providing subject expert witnesses, retired generals, to talk through with staff what the footprint of these deployments might look like and how to prepare, and training for activist groups on who the guard is, who they're not – the difference in the uniforms that the guys at ICE are wearing versus the national guard.

“Then serving as advisers for governors and mayors who are living day to day through this, helping them shape their communications and ensure that things don't become more violent. That's been a huge line of effort for us.”

It would be a mistake to assume that all national guard members are Make America Great Again (Maga) diehards eager to do Trump's bidding. In every city except the capital, their role has eventually been restricted by courts to guarding federal property. Some have told Goldbeck that it is tedious and unfulfilling work.

“There's a wide range of feelings for the folks I've spoken to, ranging from boredom – this is a waste of time – to anger because they've been taken away from their families and their jobs. Most guardsmen make more in their civilian jobs than they do when they're deployed but they signed up to serve their communities, to either serve overseas to protect the homeland or to respond in cases of a natural disaster.

“They did not sign up to be ICE – immigration enforcement – and they did not sign up to police their friends and neighbours or to be deployed into ‘hostile territory' where the governors, local police have said actually, we do not want you here.”

Last month, two West Virginia national guard members were shot in a targeted ambush near the White House by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who had previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and arrived in the US in 2021. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe survived and has been released from hospital.

Goldbeck comments: “After the horrific killing of the guardswoman in DC, there's the question of: is the president putting these folks in danger unnecessarily? The answer to that, I believe, is absolutely yes, especially when they're not necessarily trained for the mission they're being asked to execute. But also they're targets of opportunity for any madman who wants to create chaos or has a vendetta or a mental health crisis or whatever it is.”

Then there is embarrassment. In Washington the national guard have been seen picking up litter, helping commuters with luggage and feeding squirrels. Goldbeck continues: “I spoke to one mother of a guardsman in DC who said she'd had a phone call with him and he said, ‘Mom, they're calling us the national gardeners on the internet,' because they're out there picking up trash. This is a combat vet who was a law enforcement official in his real life.

“That's humiliating to our service members. It just goes to show how deep this president's disdain is for people who serve in uniform and how little he understands about the actual ethos of the military and what it's there to do.”

The deployments come in broader context that has seen Trump expand presidential power. He has sought to sideline Congress, gut the civil service, flout the law, weaponise the justice department against his perceived enemies and coerce law firms, media and universities. Goldbeck warns that he could use the military to cling to power.

“I hope that people have learned that this administration, this president, mean what they say, even it if sounds absurd or anti-American or anti-democratic. They mean it. I absolutely think that this president wants to remain in power much longer, for as long as he can.”

She adds: “My fear is that this is all a lead-up to potential use of the guard or the US military around the next election cycle. I'm not just dreaming about that. It's because it's been spoken about by very senior members of this administration and the president himself. That is incredibly alarming. It is not American to conduct elections with troops in the streets and to intimidate voters. It's very authoritarian.”

Goldbeck's own story is testimony to the diverse, non-monolithic nature of the military. She was raised in San Diego by parents she describes as “children of the 60s and 70s” who were “vegetarian pacifist Hindus”. Her mother was an elementary school teacher and her father drove a tow truck.

She attended Northwestern University, studying journalism and African studies. A study abroad programme in Uganda and Rwanda educated her on the unfolding genocide in Darfur, Sudan, sparking her passion for activism. Returning to the US, she became the national student leader of a movement to compel the government to protect civilians in Darfur.

Goldbeck's activism in Washington brought her into contact with military and security personnel. She observed a disconnect between humanitarian workers and the security forces that enable their operations. To bridge this gap and gain a “master's degree, so to speak, in military”, she decided to join the Marine Corps at age 25.

This decision was a shock to her family. When she told her parents she was joining the Marine Corps, they were “horrified” and said: “These are not the values we raised you with.” This was the opposite of their reaction when she came out as gay, to which they responded, “We love you no matter what.” But over time, her parents came to take pride in her service.

Goldbeck commissioned as a Marine Corps officer in 2012 and served for seven years as a combat engineer officer – a role she defines as someone who “builds things and blows things up” – while advocating for fellow female and LGBTQ+ service members. She spent years in Europe training US-allied countries but her final duty station brought her back home to oversee the integration of the west coast boot camp to include both male and female candidates.

Goldbeck left the Marine Corps in 2019 for two primary reasons: her mother becoming seriously ill and the election of Trump. She felt she could not remain silent in uniform and “wanted to be involved in pushing back” against what she saw happening to the country.

A few weeks after leaving the service, her local member of Congress retired, and Goldbeck was recruited to run for the seat. Although she did not win, the experience led to an offer to lead the Vet Voice Foundation, which represents about 2 million veterans, military family members and supporters.

The foundation has been heavily involved in protecting public lands, citing a deep connection between veterans and the outdoors for healing and reconnecting with family. Following the supreme court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the foundation has advocated to ensure that female service members stationed in states with restrictive abortion laws could travel to get necessary medical care.

Earlier this year Goldbeck testified to a Senate forum that the justice department was laying the groundwork for voter roll purges that disproportionately target groups including servicemen and women who move frequently or vote absentee. She noted that more than 30% of veterans have a service-connected disability and for many in-person voting is not feasible.

Joining all the dots, she is concerned that the military's status as an apolitical institution is under threat from Trump. She says: “This administration is doing harm to the world and to the nation in a lot of different ways but one of my chief concerns is about this generational harm that it's doing to the professionalism and the apolitical nature of the military.”

In this, she argues, Trump is being aided and abetted by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence. In a recent speech to senior officers at a military base in Quantico, Virginia, Hegseth railed against “woke” culture, railed against “fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon” and insisted: “No more beardos.”

Goldbeck responds: “Pete Hegseth is unequivocally the least qualified person who ever led the department of defense.”

Hegseth has also gone on the record with the opinion: “I'm straight up saying we should not have women in combat roles”. This is anathema to Goldbeck, who put herself forward for infantry officer training, a position then closed to female marines, and later worked with advocacy groups to successfully repeal the policy.

Meeting on Sunday will follow flurry of US, Russian and Ukrainian talks, but Putin has shown little sign of softening

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to travel to the US for a planned meeting with Donald Trump on Sunday, as Washington continues to push for a possible peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow.

The Ukrainian president said the visit would take place at a location in Florida – widely expected to be Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort – in what would be the latest development in a diplomatic push that began in November with the circulation of a 28-point US plan shaped with input from Russian officials.

“We are not losing a single day. We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on Friday, adding that “a lot can be decided before the New Year”.

Zelenskyy later told journalists the high-stakes meeting with Trump was planned for Sunday and would focus on some of the most sensitive parts of the peace talks, including Ukrainian security guarantees and reconstruction.

“This meeting is specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can,” Zelenskyy said.

He added that the proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”.

“Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. He later added: “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.”

The plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin's demands. Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato's article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms.

“Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree,” to the peace proposals, Zelenskyy told reporters.

Washington has not publicly confirmed the meeting.

The announcement follows a burst of diplomatic activity last weekend in Miami, where Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff met separately with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, as well as Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

US officials described the discussions as “constructive”, though Moscow has played down expectations of progress and there are few signs that Vladimir Putin is prepared to soften his maximalist demands to end the full-scale invasion.

At a closed-door meeting with Russia's business elite on Wednesday evening, the Russian president reportedly reiterated his demand that Ukraine hand over the entire eastern Donbas region as part of any peace deal.

According to Kommersant, one of Russia's best-connected newspapers, Putin also indicated openness to a limited territorial exchange with Ukraine, with Moscow potentially exchanging small areas of land Russian forces occupy in Ukraine's northern Kharkiv and southern Zaporizhzhia regions.

Zelenskyy has previously said Ukraine would be open to withdrawing “heavy forces” from parts of Donbas it still controls, but only if Russia mirrored the move as part of a US-backed initiative to create a “free economic zone” in the region.

It remains highly uncertain that Moscow would accept either a suggested demilitarised buffer zone or a withdrawal of its forces, even as other sticking points remain, including control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that Kyiv says should be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine.

On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin's top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, had held a call with the US administration after Moscow received an updated US proposal on a potential peace deal, although there were no signs that a breakthrough had been reached.

Russia has repeatedly said it was prepared to continue fighting in Ukraine if no peace deal were reached, saying it was confident it could achieve its war aims through military means.

Yet while Moscow has made slow, grinding progress on the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have in recent days pushed Russian troops out of the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region.

It marked a rare successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, prompting frustration among pro-war Russian bloggers over what many described as overly upbeat and unrealistic battlefield briefings.

“On the Kupyansk front, large-scale territorial losses have come to light, caused by the systematic submission of false reports that exaggerated the Russian armed forces' successes in the battle for Kupyansk and surrounding settlements,” the popular Telegram channel Rybar, which has close links to the defence ministry, wrote.

In late November, senior Russian generals briefed Putin that Russian troops had “completed the liberation of Kupyansk”, prompting Zelenskyy to travel to the city's outskirts to “show the world that Putin is lying”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Cláudio Valente and one of victims, Nuno FG Loureiro, both studied at notoriously challenging Técnico in Lisbon

As investigators in Massachusetts work to piece together a motive for the murders of two Brown University students and an MIT physics professor, former classmates of the suspected gunman and one of the victims have been asking if the roots of the tragedy lie in their shared experience at a top university in Portugal.

The suspected gunman, Cláudio Valente, and one of those killed, Nuno FG Loureiro, studied at the prestigious and notoriously challenging University of Lisbon engineering and technology school, known locally as Técnico, both graduating in 2000.

Contemporaries of the two men describe the academic environment as emotionally gruelling. Only one was willing to go on the record, but several others expressed similar opinions.

Valente was described as brilliant and competitive, but willing to help his colleagues out. He finished top of his class, with an average grade of 19 out of 20, an unusually high score for Técnico. Loureiro, who was said to be an excellent student but more easygoing than Valente, finished with an average grade of 16 out of 20.

Classmates say that, at the time, the two men appeared socially well adjusted.

Nuno Morais, 48, now a researcher at the Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine in Lisbon, said he and his fellow classmates, shaken by the news of Loureiro's killing, had been “racking their brains” for any signs that something was wrong.

“Having known Cláudio and having had a good relationship with him, we can't find any other explanation than a serious mental health problem – exacerbated by resentment for not having achieved the academic career he dreamed of,” he said.

Soon after his graduation in Lisbon, Valente enrolled at Brown University as a promising young doctoral student of physics, but dropped out after a few months in early 2001 and returned to Portugal to work as a programmer for an internet provider.

Loureiro studied at Imperial College London and then Princeton University, later working at the UK's Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. He joined MIT in 2016 as a professor of nuclear science and engineering, eventually becoming the director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center at the institute.

Valente and Loureiro's classmates said they suspected that the highly competitive atmosphere of academia may have taken a mental toll.

“I don't remember any specific situations directly involving Nuno and Cláudio during our graduate degree, but the culture in these schools remains the same – a hyper-competitive environment where students who struggle are humiliated and made to feel they can only succeed if they are the best of the best,” said Morais.

According to his peers, Valente was crushed by his failure to complete his PhD.

Morais said: “The only connection I can make with Cláudio's trajectory and what happened was his disappointment with the experience at Brown. Those of us who work in academia dream of pursuing a PhD at a major American university. Cláudio aspired to have a brilliant academic career, comparable to Nuno's, and this dream was prematurely destroyed, generating frustration.” .

He said his current work included mentoring and supporting students, which had made him aware of how normalised emotional distress and high pressure are in academia. He said that over the years higher-education institutions such as MIT and Caltech had taken steps to relieve student pressure because of high suicide rates. Portugal lags on this matter, he said.

“Portuguese schools now have therapist offices to assist students, but there's a great delay in fighting bullying and harassment inside the institutions. The prevailing culture is still one in which senior figures behave in ways that are prejudicial to mental health and that continues to be tolerated. Tragedies like this should prompt us to think very carefully,” Morais said.

A spokesperson for Técnico said the school was not aware of any connection between the shootings and Valente and Loureiro's time at the university.

“From what we have been reading in the media, they seemed to have a normal, collegial relationship. We are unable to see how something that happened 30 years ago can be connected to what happened now, but the school is going to come together to reflect and discuss,” they said.

Valente returned to the US in 2017 through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme and was granted a green card. He was living in Miami.

On Friday morning, after Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced she had paused the visa scheme under Trump's direction to “ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme”.

“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she wrote in her social media statement.

Such comments, and the Trump administration's subsequent move to further narrow the pathways to legal immigration using the crime as a pretext, caused outrage among Valente and Loureiro's peers.

Morais said: “[This puts] the focus of the problem in the wrong place. Access to weapons and the hyper-competitive culture of some universities are closer to the root causes of these shootings than migration.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","The positive climate news that you might have missed","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/12/27/2003849575","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

So much climate news comes out in any given week that it can be hard to keep up with it all. Much is gloomy, but there are positive developments all the time — so many, in fact, that it is easy to miss some of the things that have been happening.

For the past few years, I have been compiling year-end lists of the more neglected good and bad climate stories to give an idea of the immense amount of change as the world transitions to new sources of energy amid a gathering environmental crisis.

Here is my selection of major developments over the past 12 months.

DECARBONIZATION

You might not know it from the prevailing mood of defeatism, but in some parts of the world, decarbonizing electricity is approaching its endgame. Roughly three-quarters of power generation in the UK and Europe this year came from non-fossil sources, putting them in about the same place as Brazil and Canada, whose vast hydroelectric resources traditionally gave them some of the cleanest grids.

With more renewables added each year, projects under construction and in late-stage development should put Europe's grid between 80 and 90 percent clean energy, the level at which further advances will start to get far more difficult without massive battery usage, new flexible technologies or both. That means a looming slowdown in renewable deployment, something that many will regard as some sort of failure. In fact, it is a testament to the monumental achievement so far and an example the rest of the world should now emulate.

PEAK CEMENT

As much as 8 percent of the world's emissions come from the production of cement — but the collapse of China's real-estate boom is turning that tide. The country's output through October was the lowest since 2009, suggesting that the full-year total will be in the region of 1.7 billion tonnes. Combined with the sluggish 1 to 2 percent pace of growth forecast in the rest of the world, that suggests global consumption will be the lowest since 2012.

There might be further to fall. China still consumes 1.2 tonnes of cement per capita, about four times the rate of the rest of the world — but construction starts, a leading indicator for demand, are collapsing even faster, with commercial groundbreaking at its weakest since 2005.

Developed countries use only about 16 percent of global cement and China is now developed in all but name. A boom like the one we saw over the past decade will never return. Even India and sub-Saharan Africa would not be big enough to take its place.

GLOBAL EVS

If you were looking only at the parlous state of electric vehicle (EV) sales in some developed markets — the US, say, or Japan or Italy — you might think the entire technology is faltering. Far from it. Plug-in cars have been comprising more than half of all sales in China and just under one-third in Europe in recent months. More dramatic, though, is what has been happening in less-noticed developing countries.

EVs have had a sales share of more than 20 percent in recent months in Turkey, Thailand and Vietnam, while Indonesia is not far behind. Markets as diverse as Nepal, Ethiopia, Laos, Armenia and the United Arab Emirates are adopting EVs far faster than many developed countries. Among sales of passenger vehicles worldwide in the September quarter, 27.3 percent came with a plug, according to BloombergNEF.

If you think the EV revolution is losing speed, it is probably just a sign that your own domestic market is getting left behind.

I did a similar what-you-missed exercise last year. You can read the piece to decide whether my predictions came to pass or not, but here is my attempt at an unbiased assessment:

 ‧ A New Dawn for Solar:  China's solar industry has endured a season in hell. We argued that rising sales and thinner spending would restore profitability. China's six large solar players have indeed cut capital expenditures to about half of last year's level, but new rules at home and ongoing trade protectionism elsewhere mean BloombergNEF expects installations this year to rise only about 16 percent — a pedestrian pace for the sector.

Far from returning to the black, losses are deepening, with little sign of relief in sight.

 ‧ Europe Goes Electric:  Sales of plug-in cars in Europe hit a speed bump late last year, leading many to predict that the region's shift to EVs was stalling. We argued that the slowdown was temporary, with performance this year likely to far outstrip predictions of 3.2 million sales. That looks to be on the money. By the end of September, the year-to-date growth rate was 28 percent, which should translate into nearly 3.9 million sales across the full year, just a pip short of the 4 million number we pegged.

‧ Charging Up the Grid: A key element of electricity bill increases after Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the pivotal role played by surging gas in setting the cost of power across the entire market. We argued that the rise of lithium-ion was likely to shave these peaks by giving batteries a bigger role and flattening the extreme spikes seen in previous years.

That seems to be playing out in some places: Wholesale prices in Australia's main grid fell about 8 percent from a year earlier in the September quarter, thanks in part to reduced volatility and batteries undercutting gas.

The course of the energy transition never did run smooth — but I have noticed over the past few years of writing these lists that events in retrospect look much better than the depressing prospect you get from a cursory look at the news. Let us hope that pattern plays out next year, too.

Last week, Taiwanese media reported that Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois Wu (吳志中) secretly visited Israel, a country with whom Taiwan has long shared unofficial relations but which has approached those relations cautiously. In the wake of China's implicit but clear support for Hamas and Iran in the wake of the October 2023 assault on Israel, Jerusalem's calculus may be changing. Both small countries facing literal existential threats, Israel and Taiwan have much to gain from closer ties.

Four people died, including the 27-year-old suspect, and 11 people sustained injuries.
At Taipei Main Station, the suspect threw smoke grenades near two exits and fatally stabbed one person who tried to stop him.

Geopolitical pressures have compelled both countries to recalibrate their priorities, even as their core security challenges remain unchanged.
However, what is striking is the visible decline in the attention India once received from Taiwan.

MediaTek Inc (聯發科), the world's largest mobile phone chip designer, yesterday said it is working closely with Japan's Denso Corp to build a custom automotive system-on-chip (SoC) solution tailored for advanced driver-assistance systems  and cockpit systems, adding another customer to its new application-specific IC (ASIC) business.

This effort merges Denso's automotive-grade safety expertise and deep vehicle integration with MediaTek's technologies cultivated through the development of Media-

Tek's Dimensity AX, leveraging efficient, high-performance SoCs and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to offer a scalable, production-ready platform for next-generation driver assistance, the company said in a statement yesterday.

“Through this collaboration, we are bringing two industry leaders together to support the most demanding requirements of global automotive manufacturers and system integrators, exceeding benchmarks in safety, power efficiency, and AI-enabled perception to advance the future of assisted driving,” said Mike Chang (張豫臺), a corporate vice president and general manager of automotive business at MediaTek.

MediaTek aims to shape the future of intelligent mobility and enable rapid deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems across global markets through its partnership with Denso, the company said.

The partnership with Denso is the first ASIC project from an auto client, based on the announcements made by MediaTek so far. MediaTek has said it is developing a chip for a cloud service provider (CSP), the first ASIC project secured by the company.

Some analysts consider the expanding ASIC market to be a new growth driver for MediaTek, which is expected to grow 113 percent annually next year, outpacing the 66 percent growth estimated for graphic processing units (GPU), according to an International Data Corp (IDC) forecast.

IDC attributed the strong growth to major cloud service providers' ambition to invest in building their own AI server accelerators for data centers to improve the total cost of ownership by reducing the use of expensive GPUs.

MediaTek expected the company's first ASIC project to generate US$1 billion in revenue next year and to contribute billions of US dollars in 2027, making the data center ASICs one of the company's incremental revenue contributors. 

Other ASIC projects should contribute revenue from 2028 and beyond, MediaTek told investors.

Within two years, the company aims to gain a 10 to 15 percent share of the world's cloud ASIC market, valued at US$50 billion, it said.

As of Friday, TSMC had 1.88 million shareholders, the most since the week of April 25 and an increase of 31,870 from the previous week, the data showed.
The number of shareholders jumped despite a drop of NT$50 (US$1.59), or 3.38 percent, in TSMC's share price from a week earlier to NT$1,430, as investors took profits from their earlier gains

Completed early this year and undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, according to two people with knowledge of the project.

Earthquakes do not care about borders. Neither do floods, hurricanes or the diseases that follow them. When disaster strikes anywhere in the world, the international system is supposed to respond based on need, not politics.

Organizations like the WHO exist specifically to coordinate amid global health emergencies and make sure that medical expertise and disaster relief reach people quickly, regardless of what flag flies over their government buildings.

The whole point of having international health institutions is that disease and disaster are universal problems that require universal solutions.

However, that mission keeps running into a much older problem, which is that international organizations are still made up of governments and governments often care about politics more than they care about human life.

The WHO has spent years refusing to acknowledge Taiwan, a country of 23 million people with one of the world's best healthcare systems, as if it does not exist. Taiwan has been blocked from participating in the WHO since 2016, not because of anything related to public health, but because China, in its delusion, considers Taiwan part of its territory, and uses its considerable diplomatic influence to make sure other countries and international organizations treat Taiwan accordingly.

The WHO went along with Beijing's demands, signing agreements that essentially gave China veto power over whether Taiwan gets included in global health discussions. That might seem like an internal diplomatic matter, the kind of issue that seems purely political, except that when you exclude a country from the organization meant to coordinate responses to health emergencies, people actually die because of it.

Taiwan is not just kept out of meetings and conferences, the exclusion is more comprehensive than that. Taiwan cannot access WHO technical guidelines in real time, cannot participate in disease surveillance networks that track outbreaks as they develop and cannot coordinate directly with the international system when disasters happen.

When other countries face health emergencies, they can request WHO assistance and get connected to a network of member states ready to help. Taiwan has no formal channel to offer assistance or request it, which means that even when the nation has exactly what a disaster zone needs, there is no official mechanism to coordinate a response.

Countries have to decide individually whether to accept Taiwan's help and that decision is almost always shaped by whether it will damage their relationship with China.

An earthquake in Myanmar on March 28 showed what the policy looks like when people are actually dying. The magnitude 7.7 quake killed more than 3,600 people and Myanmar's government immediately started accepting international help. Chinese rescue teams crossed the border, along with teams from India, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates. Taiwan assembled a 126-member rescue unit with six search dogs and 15 tonnes of specialized equipment, the kind of disaster response team that takes years to train and requires serious resources to maintain. They waited on standby for 48 hours while Myanmar's military government decided whether to let them in.

The answer was no, international aid was sufficient.

Burmese students in Taiwan were watching as their hometowns got destroyed, posting about neighbors and family members still buried while a team that could help them got rejected. Taiwan's team, with everything needed to pull survivors from rubble and decades of earthquake response experience, got sent home because letting them in would have irritated Beijing.

This is not the first time. In April 2015, when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed more than 8,700 people in Nepal and left more than 21,000 injured, Nepal's government turned down Taiwan's offer to send a search and rescue team, citing the lack of diplomatic ties and the physical distance between the two countries.

The distance excuse was nonsense, given that Nepal accepted rescue teams from countries much farther away, but the real reason was obvious enough. Countries that want to maintain good relations with China have learned that accepting Taiwan's help comes with diplomatic costs, so when disaster strikes and people are trapped under rubble, governments do the math and decide that keeping Beijing happy matters more than getting every available rescue team on the ground as fast as possible.

Taiwan has answered this exclusion not with withdrawal, but with three decades of relentless medical humanitarian work. While the WHO pretends it does not exist and governments reject its rescue teams to avoid offending China, Taiwan has built one of the most active international medical assistance programs in the world.

Their doctors and rescue workers keep showing up in countries that will accept them, training foreign medical professionals, performing surgeries in places where specialized care is rare and responding to disasters whenever they are on the ground. The work continues because Taiwan has apparently decided that lack of official recognition is not a good enough reason to stop helping people.

Taiwan has been doing this work for decades regardless of whether anyone officially recognizes it. The Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps has sent 422 medical missions to 50 countries since 1995, with more than 20,000 volunteers performing surgeries and training local doctors in places such as Bolivia, India, Indonesia, Liberia, Paraguay, Peru and the Philippines, as well as African nations.

The Taiwan International Healthcare Training Center has trained more than 2,100 healthcare professionals from 80 countries since it was established in 2002, teaching specialized medical techniques that those doctors take home and use to save lives in their own communities.

None of that expertise gets channeled through the WHO or counts in any official international health coordination, but Taiwan keeps sending doctors and rescue teams anyway because the work matters more than the recognition.

Almost every other disputed territory in the world gets some form of WHO engagement, even if unofficial. The WHO works in Palestinian territories, Kosovo and other places where sovereignty is disputed, because health needs do not wait for political settlements. Taiwan is effectively the only place where the WHO has decided that one country's political objections outweigh all public health considerations.

The WHO was created to save lives during health emergencies, not to enforce one country's territorial claims, but that is exactly what it does when it excludes Taiwan. The cost is not paid by diplomats in Geneva or politicians in Beijing. The cost is paid by people trapped under rubble, patients who never receive treatment and communities facing outbreaks that spread further than they should have.

Both small countries facing literal existential threats, Israel and Taiwan have much to gain from closer ties.

Russia overnight on Dec. 26 launched drone attacks at Ukraine's sea port and energy infrastructure in Odesa and Mykolaiv oblasts, as well as railway infrastructure in Volyn Oblast, authorities reported.  

Odesa and its surrounding oblast have come under frequent attack this December with Russia targeting ports, roads, energy infrastructure, and residential areas. Frequent drone and missile strikes have caused widespread power outages in the area and delayed repairs, leaving some residents without electricity and entire areas cut off due to disrupted transportation networks.

Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper reported on Dec. 26 that Russian attacks had damaged energy and port infrastructure. Rescue and emergency services were working on the ground to address the aftermath of the attacks, he said.

Russia'a drone attacks on ports in the oblast resulted in damage to terminals, warehouses, barges, and ships flying the flags of Slovakia and the Republic of Palau, according to Community and Territorial Development Minister Oleksii Kuleba. 

Kuleba also said that that attacks on energy infrastructure caused partial power outages in Odesa Oblast, and that repair crews were working to restore power.

Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, DTEK, said Russia attacked two of its facilities in the southern part of the oblast, causing ""significant damage.""

A terminal in Mykolaiv Oblast was also hit by Russian drones, Kuleba said. As a result of the attack, a ship flying the Liberian flag was damaged. 

Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitalii Kim reported that Russian drone attacks on the city of Mykolaiv and its surrounding resulted in partial power outages.

In Volyn Oblast, which neighbors Poland, Russian drones damaged a locomotive and a freight car near Kovel train station, Kuleba said, adding that employees of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine's state railway company, were cleaning up the aftermath.

""Despite Russia's deliberate terror, Ukraine's logistics system continues to function,"" he added.

No casualties among civilians were reported in the oblasts.

Don't lose hope. Despite older generations' doomsday prophecies and belated apologies for the state of the world, today's young people are now on the brink of leading the greatest era of rebuilding and growth this century

If you are under 30, there's a message you've likely received many times during this painful year: You're inheriting the wreckage of a once-great world, and your life will be less prosperous, peaceful or productive than the one older generations have enjoyed. You've heard it apologetically from your parents and their peers, ominously from the media, and perhaps angrily from your own mind. You may even be among those who've vowed not to bring children into “this world.”

I get it. The unprecedented period of global growth and betterment that lasted from about 1990 to 2010 predated your adult life. Instead you've watched, over the last decade and especially over the last year, as older generations and their leaders have crashed the planet ecologically, allowed autocratic-minded figures and intolerant extremists to seize key parts of the democratic world, set out to replace human labour via resource-guzzling data centres, and left you a future seemingly without decent jobs or affordable housing and a catastrophically diminished world order.

But this is a dangerously shortsighted vision. 

Today's end-time pessimism is a fallacy. It's built on path dependency: the notion that the downward curve on the graph will continue, that the current decline has become irreversible. And it's built on this century's underlying belief among liberals and moderate conservatives that we must be passive victims of history, rather than its agents.

In fact, it is much more likely that Gen Z has come of age at a fortuitous time. We are not approaching the end, but coming to a beginning.

People who are young today will very likely be the heirs to the greatest period of rebuilding, growth and new invention of this century – not as a matter of choice or ideology, but out of urgent necessity. They face a role comparable to those who were young in 1946, when the decades of rebuilding after the Second World War had only begun.

At that time, surrounded by the endless ruins of nations and institutions and economies and the threat of terrifying new technologies, prospects for the new generation looked grim. The young adults of 1946 were surrounded by severe inflation, unemployment, food shortages and the worst government debt in history. Western countries struggled with fears that the forces of nationalism and authoritarianism that had propelled the war were about to come sweeping back, supported by a miserable generation suffering declining living standards, without any of the glory of the war years.

Yet the opposite proved true. The boomers inherited an era of renewal. The rebuilding of the world's economies and the creation of new international structures and institutions led to the greatest explosion of economic growth, well-being and international co-operation in human history, one that propelled two decades of full employment and upward mobility and an unprecedented spread of democracy and human development.

This comparison might have seemed hyperbolic before the catastrophic events of 2025. The collapse of the United States into a shockingly extreme form of far-right strongman rule – one that even cautious and conservative analysts now freely call fascism – has rapidly threatened the security, institutional and democratic stability of the free world. It became a global threat earlier this year when Washington made the promotion of extreme-right and racially intolerant governments in European democracies its official international-security policy. “The decades of the Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe,” Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative chancellor, declared this month. “It no longer exists as we know it.”

And 2025 capped off the three consecutive hottest years in recorded history, leading scientists to declare that a dangerous atmospheric warming of 1.5 C (at least temporarily) is now unpreventable. That occurred as the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter, withdrew from virtually all climate agreements and aggressively pushed its own economy away from renewable energy and electric vehicles and toward coal, while constricting global trade with punitive tariffs and shutting down the world's largest sources of humanitarian, medical and military aid. 

After a decade of democratic governments backsliding into de facto authoritarianism and illiberalism, this year marked a nadir: The Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance declared that 2025 saw the worst decline of democratic freedoms this century.

Unlike the Second World War, today's global emergencies won't have a clear end date. The rebuilding has to begin while multiple crises are still taking place, and while major countries are opposed to solutions. But that also has precedent: The rebuilding of the 1940s began before the Second World War was finished, and often before its end was a sure thing (the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions that still regulate the world economy were being created while the war was at its peak). And of course, that age of rebuilding took place amid the Cold War, and thus on two isolated but competing tracks – one democratic and one authoritarian – which is also similar to what's happening today, with China's share of climate rebuilding already substantially under way.

Building a climate-resilient and non-emitting world, and restoring the world's institutions of governance, economy and security in the absence of the United States, will be a massive undertaking that will occupy decades and cost more than any project in world history. It will require, and create, great amounts of economic growth over long periods, and will be a major source of employment. Current fears that artificial intelligence will destroy job markets will likely be answered by this need: Given the soon-to-be non-growing size of the global workforce, both human and non-human employment will likely be maxed out, for a considerable time, by the looming demands of such projects.

In fact, the rebuilding has already begun – albeit only in some places. Both Canada and Germany this year elected governments that wouldn't otherwise have been very popular with voters, but won rare cross-party support because they were singularly focused on building new institutions and relationships to replace the hole left by the disappearance of the United States, in security, trade and climate. While you may not agree with the targets or quantities of Mark Carney's or Friedrich Merz's security and “nation-building” investments, their popularity speaks to a mass public appetite for programs intended to build a new world rather than tear down the old one.

There will be an era of rebuilding, even if we do not know when it will fully begin, how long it will last, or whether it will fully succeed. It will not be the product of a choice, a specific ideology or belief system: It will arise from necessity. We have brought the political and ecological challenges of the world to the point of unavoidable crisis, and the sane majority will have no option but to act.

The big question is whether we have a sane majority.

Although extremist regimes have rarely attracted a majority of voters (including in the United States), they excel at manipulating the electoral system to gain power. It is entirely possible that France or Germany could end up with a neo-fascist government for a time. What if support for parties of hate and isolation is not declining but growing, especially among the young?

There is strong reason to believe that it isn't. 

The past year was marked with dramatic uprisings by young people, especially in poorer countries, that sought to overthrow entrenched dynastic authoritarian regimes and to restore or introduce something resembling democratic or at least more normal and accountable government. These “Gen Z revolutions” began in Bangladesh, where students and other people under 30 successfully drove the resignation of a long-serving and corrupt ruling family in late 2024 and delivered a democratic moment that continues to inspire hope. They continued this year with regimes forced out of office in Nepal, Mongolia, Madagascar, Peru and Bulgaria, with major protest movements continuing in a dozen other countries.

There's reason to be skeptical of the “Gen Z” branding: It has always been people under 30 who have dominated protests, riots and revolutions, everywhere in the world. Virtually any mass uprising could have been named after whatever generation happens to be in its teens and twenties at the time.

But there is something measurably distinct about under-30s in many countries. The voting waves that have brought authoritarian-minded governments to power have, with only a few exceptions, been dominated by people in their 40s and 50s. And the principal victims of the decline in economic conditions and freedoms created by these governments have been the youngest generations.

There is substantial evidence that a majority of young people in most countries – democratic or otherwise – strongly desire a change in the system to one that is more representative and reformist, especially on issues such as inequality and climate change, not less.

A major meta-analysis of multiple international surveys conducted this year by professors Bobby Duffy and Paolo Morini at King's College London found that, contrary to some headlines and small-scale surveys wrongly suggesting that democracy has fallen out of favour among the young, the authoritarian-minded population under 30 is exceptionally small – under 6 per cent in Britain – and that more detailed studies showed a desire among youth to replace those elected populist governments that have shortchanged them. “They have significant issues with how the political system has not delivered for them,” Prof. Duffy said, “but they're not looking to tear it up and replace it with autocratic leadership.” Their results were supported by a Pew Research Center study that found that in 10 countries (including Canada), the proportion of under-35s who want dramatic economic-system changes to reduce inequality was typically 50 per cent again larger than older groups.

The economic harm of tariffs and protectionism, and the increased inequality and reduced freedoms caused by far-right governments, tends to accrue disproportionately to the young. And these regimes oppose climate-change policy – one of the top two things that young people in most countries say they are disproportionately concerned about, even more than earlier generations were at the same age. So it's quite likely that Gen Z uprisings will become more widespread, and increasingly successful, as demographic change makes that cohort a larger share of the electorate.

Much of the current end-times pessimism is rooted in the way we think about the climate crisis. Too often this century, the message has been one of loss: “Unless we do something painful, this is going to be devastating, and potentially fatal to human civilization.” But it should have been one of cost and opportunity: “Solving this is going to be expensive and labour-intensive – and the longer we delay, the more expensive and challenging it will be.”

We have now reached the point where the climate emergency is actually taking place, and will surely get worse before it gets better.

That doesn't mean we will quietly await our tempestuous fate. Majorities in most countries understand the need for very large-scale public investments to reduce the risk. 

It means we now face a triple challenge: First, to replace our carbon-based energy and transportation sources with non-emitting ones; second, to develop and implement new technologies and methods to reverse existing warming; third, to erect vast amounts of infrastructure to protect our cities and farmlands against existing warming and ocean-level increases while keeping them productive.

The last decade has seen the publication of several global estimates of the investments required to end, and then reverse, atmospheric warming (usually by 2050) from the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and from groups of scholars. All estimate that de-carbonizing electrical generation and transportation is the single largest need, the sine qua non: If the largest economies can manage that, we're most of the way there.

Most estimates say that about 1,000 gigawatts of renewable and nuclear energy capacity will need to be constructed for each of seven years to meet a 2050 goal; in 2024, only 585 gigawatts were added, although major investments in China and Europe are raising that number.

This will require investments of around US$5-trillion by 2030, or about 2 per cent of world GDP – about double what humans are currently spending. The world is on track to meet about 85 per cent of this required renewable growth, in large part thanks to Chinese investments. In fact, one clear way for liberal democracies to win popular support back from the autocrats is to start outdoing them in climate investment.

Most estimates say the world will need to retire or retrofit perhaps 2-billion internal-combustion passenger cars by 2050. Electric cars now represent around 25 per cent of light vehicle sales worldwide, up from 14 per cent in 2022. Half of that production was in China, and a quarter of it in Europe; the United States and India have lagged behind. Charging infrastructure and battery production will also require enormous public and private investments.

Some of the biggest opportunities come from our pending need to de-carbonize commercial land and sea transportation (the latter is estimated to require a trillion dollars in investment by 2050), steel and concrete making, and eventually air travel – some of which still require the development of new technologies. If we are unable to electrify some of those sectors, we will need to invest even more heavily in carbon capture and CO2 removal, an underperforming sector that will require even more trillions of investment.

Because we have waited until the crisis is upon us, some of our largest investments – and our least optional investments – will be needed not to prevent but to protect us from the effects of the warming and ocean-level rises that will happen regardless. Massive sea barriers will be needed in most maritime cities. Drought-resistant crops will need to be engineered and cultivated throughout large regions, as well as new irrigation solutions and urban infrastructure. 

The notion of investing an estimated US$150-trillion over 30 years may sound implausible, especially after the devastating political and economic events of 2025. But that ignores the fact that most worldwide economic activity in the coming decades will contribute to this goal, directly or indirectly. About half the world's economies, according to estimates by the Energy and Carbon Intelligence Unit, are now “absolute carbon decoupled” – that is, every dollar of economic growth in those countries now causes a decrease, rather than a rise, in greenhouse-gas emissions (because most investments result in the replacement of ecologically inefficient technology). China and most of Europe are there; Canada is just barely decoupled but faltering; the United States is not, although a return to its 2024 policies would soon get it there.

That illustrates why the ecological crisis is so intimately tied to the political crisis; it also suggests why a decade of democratic backsliding is unlikely to hold. Tariffs and closed borders and military misadventures don't just choke off growth and lower living standards –they choke up the atmosphere.

Sooner or later, an excluded generation will begin to clear the air, and step clear of the wreckage. The rest of us ought to stop apologizing to them, and get ready to thank them.

Beverley McLachlin and Michel Bastarache are the only two former Canadian Supreme Court judges of the post-1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms era to have published memoirs.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Roaming the stacks at my friendly neighbourhood library recently, I stumbled on an incredible trove of autobiographies by the great Canadian Supreme Court judges of the past 50 years. Peter Cory, the last of the Second World War veterans to serve on the court, wrote about his formative experiences and how they shaped his legal views on the protection of human dignity. Brian Dickson, born in 1916, wrote about how he had grown up in a vastly different world and yet was the right man to become chief justice in 1984, just as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was about to transform this country.

Uh, sorry … that was mean. There's no trove. No autobiography by Cory or Dickson. Almost no books, ever – a near-complete silence – from the country's top judges of the post-1982 Charter era, outside of a 2019 memoir and novels by retired chief justice Beverley McLachlin and a memoir by Michel Bastarache, also out in 2019.

It's an incalculable loss to the country, a loss felt by anyone who wishes to understand the evolution of Canada and get to know some of the people who helped it along. A loss brought about by a cultural reticence that, whatever its original purposes, makes little sense in the modern world. As Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard Wagner himself has said, without transparency there is no trust.

A new generation of judges is redefining what Canada's top courts look like

The contrast with the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court could hardly be starker. Amazingly, six of the current nine justices have published autobiographies or legal works. The latest book, published in September, is by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution has a bit on her life and family background, then sets out her views on constitutional law, how she arrives at her legal opinions and how the court works. It's a good book because it guides readers engagingly through an otherwise closed world. 

Richard Albert, a Canadian who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law, calls judicial autobiographies essential “because they humanize the judiciary,” which fosters trust and understanding. They also offer insight into a court's internal dynamics and inspire young people.

“When chief justice Beverley McLachlin details her climb from modest beginnings, it provides a powerful, tangible message, especially to young people, that someone like them can scale the Mount Everest of law,” said Albert, a former law clerk to McLachlin.

Supplied

Of course, complete candour on either side of the border is unlikely. Coney Barrett and her colleagues may spend decades together on the bench. Still, her book is well-written and at times revealing. 

For instance, if there's a knock at the door when the court is meeting privately to discuss a case, the junior judge (the most recent appointee) has to get up and go see who it is. Coney Barrett doesn't comment on the practice, but really? For every knock, over who knows how many years, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who happens to be the court's only Black woman, has to answer the door? Someone thinks this is a good idea?

More important, Coney Barrett describes her philosophy of originalism (in which the Constitution's historical meaning is given primacy), explaining why she sided with the majority in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, ending the nationwide right to an abortion. “The court's role is to respect the choices that the people have agreed upon, not to tell them what they should agree to.” 

Some Canadians may wish to fire back that, in this country, constitutional rights aren't about majority rule but rather protection from the majority, by assessing text, values, purposes and how other democratic countries treat such things – Coney Barrett takes the insularity of originalism, its U.S.-only lens, as a given. She has high praise for Brown v. Board of Education, the court's historic 1954 desegregation ruling, but doesn't address the obvious point that this was the court telling people what they should agree to.

In any event, how could a Canadian be critical? A book is better than no book, which is what we have in Canada. And if one wishes to hear another point of view, retired U.S. Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, just last year, published Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, not Textualism.

As for the two Canadian memoirs, they are good: McLachlin writes beautifully about her childhood. The family's ranch in the high foothills near Pincher Creek, Alta., was for her father “the landscape of dreams,” but for her sociable mother “it was unutterably lonely.” 

Despite ‘modest' start, Supreme Court of Canada marks 150 years of transformative rulings

The remarkable memoir of Bastarache, the court's first Acadian judge, was written as a letter to his two children, both of whom died of a rare disease when they were small; the form allows for a confiding, honest directness and simplicity of expression. His final summing-up is truly heartbreaking.

Why are Canada's Supreme Court judges, who in their rulings refer annoyingly to their “teachings,” as if they are biblical sages, as silent as so many sphinxes? I asked Frank Iacobucci, the first Italian-Canadian on the court. Long ago, he said, he learned that the judiciary is like the navy – the “silent service.” He would hate for the judges to lose their candour, behind closed doors, for fear of being outed in a book some day.

Still, he's thinking of writing his memoirs. He's 88 and as accomplished as any 10 people. What a life story. His parents were labelled enemy aliens during the Second World War and had to report regularly to the RCMP. He himself was told he had the wrong “name” for the law. As an exemplar of what this country is, he's hard to beat.

Enough of the silent service already. We're the poorer for it as a country.

One day, a great library.

The US said the strike against 'Islamic State' targets came at the request of the Nigeria. Trump had previously threatened military action to protect Christians in Nigeria from what he described as a ""genocide.""

President Donald Trump said he had ordered the US military to launch ""powerful and deadly"" strikes against targets of the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS) group in northwestern Nigeria.

The strike comes after months of Trump threatening military action against what he labeled an ""existential threat"" to Christianity in Nigeria, a claim that the country's government rejects.

The US military's Africa Command (AFCOM) said the strike had been conducted at the request of the Nigerian authorities in the northwestern Sokoto State.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was ""grateful"" for the support and cooperation with the Nigerian government.

Nigeria's Foreign Ministry confirmed the ""precision hits on terrorist targets,"" adding that the government is guided by its intention to safeguard all citizens' life, regardless of faith. 

According to a statement posted on social media, terrorism against any of the country's religious communities ""remains an affront on Nigeria's values and  to international peace and security.""

Analysts have said Nigeria's security crisis affects both Christians, who live mainly in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north.

Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said the anti-terrorist operation had ""nothing to do with a particular religion."" Tuggar did not rule out further attacks.

“It's Nigeria that provided the intelligence,"" he told broadcaster Channels TV.

Tuggar said he was on the phone with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of the bombardment. ""It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the US. We are working with other countries as well.""

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the reason for the strike was the Islamist group's targeting of ""primarily innocent Christians,"" which he said had reached levels ""never seen for many years.""

""Under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper,"" Trump's post read.

The US State Department recently announced its intention to restrict visas for Nigerian nationals involved in violence against Christians in the country.

Washington also designated Nigeria a ""country of particular concern"" under the International Religious Freedom Act.

Nigeria has been battling a deadly Islamist insurgency in its northern regions.

According to Nigeria's National Human Rights Commission, at least 2,266 people were killed by bandits or insurgents in Nigeria during the first half of 2025 — surpassing the total number of such deaths in all of 2024.

Particularly Boko Haram has concentrated their attacks in the northwestern state of Sokoto.

A splinter group known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) has also carried out attacks in northeastern Nigeria, particularly in the Borno state.

Iswap has also been involved in clashes with Boko Haram, as it is one of at least three Boko Haram splinter groups active in Nigeria.

Japan is seeking to bolster its defense capabilities in the face of ""the most severe"" security environment since the end of World War II.

The Japanese Cabinet on Friday approved a record budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget will include more than 9 trillion yen for defense, setting an all-time record.

This comes as Tokyo looks to strengthen its coastal defense due to the rising tensions in the region, while seeking to double its spending on weapons to 2% of its gross domestic product.

The draft budget for 2026, which will officially begin in April and still requires the parliament's approval, is up 9.4% from 2025.

The Japanese government pledged to reach its 2% goal by March, two years earlier than planned, also due to pressure from its ally the US.

A briefing document by the Japanese Defense Ministry states that Tokyo ""faces the most severe and complex security environment"" since the end of the Second World War, adding the situations required to ""fundamentally strengthen"" its defense capabilities.

Due to Japan's struggles with manning its military, the country sees unmanned weapons as essential to its defense efforts, with drones playing a vital role.

To ensure quick weapons procurement, Tokyo plans on relying on imports, potentially from allies Turkey or Israel.

The background to the country's arms race is the risk of China taking military action against Taiwan, with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi saying Tokyo could intervene should Beijing's statements about forcing its rule on the self-governing island come to fruition.

Earlier this month, Chinese aircraft carrier military drills near the southwestern part of Japan resulted in protest as a Chinese jet locked their radar on a Japanese jet, which is considered possible preparation for firing.

Tokyo's current defense strategy from 2022 names China as the country's biggest strategic challenge.

Ukraine said it used British Storm Shadow missiles to attack the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery. Zelenskyy said he spoke with Trump's envoys on how to end the war. 

This blog has now closed. Read below for a round-up of the developments in Russia's war in Ukraine on December 25, 2025.

Ukraine used British Storm Shadow missiles to attack a Russian oil refinery on Thursday, the Ukrainian military has said.

They have previously used the British missiles to attack targets inside Russia.

""Units of the air force of the armed forces of Ukraine successfully struck the Novoshakhtinsk oil products plant in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation with Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles,"" the statement said.

It went on to add that the Ukrainian army allege the plant of being one of the main suppliers of petrol products in southern Russia ""and is directly involved in supplying the Russian Federation's armed forces.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he held good talks with US President Donald Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner as they continued to discuss bringing an to the Russian war.

""We discussed certain substantive details of the ongoing work,"" he wrote in a post on social media. ""There are good ideas that can work toward a shared outcome and the lasting peace.""

He went on to thank the two envoys for their constructive approach.

""We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable,"" he added.

Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov is set to speak with the two envoys again Thursday.

Zelenskyy's post came a day after he announced a new 20-point plan, agreed on by US and Ukrainian negotiators, which is now being reviewed by Moscow. 

However, the Ukrainian president conceded on Wednesday that there were some points in the document that he did not like.

Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said talks with the United States on ending the war in Ukraine are making ""slow but steady"" progress, according to the state-run TASS news agency.

Speaking on Thursday, Zakharova said negotiations with Washington were advancing. She also urged the US to oppose what she described as attempts by Western European countries to derail the talks.

Zakharova also reiterated Russia's readiness to sign a legally binding non-aggression agreement with a European or NATO country, a proposal previously raised by President Vladimir Putin.

With the majority of Christians celebrating Christmas today, Pope Leo XIV called on the faithful to pray ""for the tormented people of Ukraine.""

""May the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue,"" he added, calling for ""the clamor of weapons"" to cease.

His appeal comes just a day after details on a new peace plan were revealed to the public, with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Kyiv and Washington were united behind the proposal. On Thursday, Moscow said it was analyzing documents on the suggested deal.

The question of territorial concessions in eastern Ukraine remains unresolved in the 20-point peace plan presented by Volodymyr President Zelenskyy, and Russia has given no indication it was willing to withdraw from the area.

In a rare public move, the Kremlin said they had contacts with France regarding Laurent Vinatier, a French national currently serving a three-year sentence in Russia.

Vinatier, previously a researcher with a Swiss conflict mediation NGO, had been jailed in mid-2024. He was convicted for failing to register as a ""foreign agent"" under Russia's draconian law aiming to curb foreign influence, and is now facing charges of espionage.

 ""Indeed, a proposal was made to the French regarding Vinatier,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

 ""The ball is now in France's court,"" he added, without providing details.

Separately, the lawyer for Vinatier's family said his family hopes that the researcher could be freed during the holiday season, including Orthodox Christmas most Russian celebrate on January 7th.

""We have every confidence in French diplomacy, which is doing its utmost,"" the lawyer said.

As Russian strikes continue, Ukrainians remain skeptical about Russian aggression ending anytime soon. DW reports from Kyiv on the Christmas mood and what a US-proposed demilitarized ""free economic zone"" could mean for eastern Ukraine.

For the second time this week, Poland scrambled jets in response to a potential threat to its air space amid the fighting in Ukraine.

""Polish fighter jets intercepted, visually identified, and escorted a Russian Federation reconnaissance aircraft out of the area of responsibility,"" after detecting it was flying near Polish airspace.

The intercept took place above international waters of the Baltic Sea, according to the Polish military.

Israel has killed at least 400 Palestinians and injured over 1,100 others since the ceasefire began in October.

Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. Please support us with a tax-deductible donation today.

Human rights groups have reiterated that the “ceasefire” deal in Gaza hasn't stopped Israel from continuing its genocide of Palestinians, killing hundreds in the 12 weeks since the agreement began.

Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said in a statement on Thursday that “the genocide in Gaza is not over.” 

“Since the ‘ceasefire' was declared on 10 October 2025, Israel has been continuing its onslaught on the ground,” the group said. “The so-called ceasefire has been in effect for 75 days. In practice, Israel is continuing its campaign of killing, destruction, displacement and complete control of Palestinians' lives in Gaza. The international community must stop enabling this façade and take action to help the people of Gaza.”

B'Tselem noted that Israel has killed 405 Palestinians and injured 1,114 since the ceasefire began on October 10 as of Monday, through continued strikes and military attacks. 

Just last week, Israeli forces bombed a wedding in Gaza, killing six Palestinians and wounding others as the couple sought to have a moment of joy amid the violence. Gaza officials have said that Israel has committed 875 violations of the ceasefire thus far.

Gaza health officials have also said that several Palestinian children and infants have died due to exposure to cold, wet winter conditions. The UN says that Israel has been blocking food, shelter, and other essential humanitarian supplies like medicine since March, leaving millions exposed to the harshest conditions.

“Refusing to let it in is a choice — one that deprives people inside Gaza of the means to survive and recover,” the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday.

B'Tselem noted that, as of December 16, Israel had only allowed 57 percent of 556 planned aid missions to proceed. 

Israel has claimed in public statements that it is allowing the requisite 600 trucks of aid in per day since the ceasefire began, but even Israel's own internal accounting suggests that authorities have only allowed in 459 trucks per day on average, with a significant proportion consisting of commercial goods; the UN reported earlier this month that only 113 trucks of UN-coordinated aid have been allowed to enter per day on average.

Israel is also continuing to exert control over Palestinians' lives in other ways, including its ongoing occupation past the “yellow line” in Gaza as well as its continued demolition of buildings in Gaza.

“Nearly 1 million people who lived east of the line before the genocide are now crowded west of it in unlivable conditions,” said B'Tselem.

Amnesty International Secretary General Agnès Callamard shared B'Tselem's statement, noting that Amnesty has also warned of the farce of the ceasefire. “This is [Amnesty's] conclusion as well. Israel's genocide in Gaza is continuing,” Callamard said. 

Amnesty warned last month that Israel is “continuing to deliberately inflict conditions of life calculated to bring about [Palestinians'] physical destruction” in Gaza, even after receiving all of the remaining living Israeli captives.

“The ceasefire risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal. But while Israeli authorities and forces have reduced the scale of their attacks and allowed limited amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the world must not be fooled,” Callamard warned.

 Beijing's Strategy to Create Stability Through Dependence

 Amara Thiha

Nearly five years after a military coup in 2021 unseated its civilian government, Myanmar has become extremely fragmented. A civil war flared after the coup, killing thousands and leaving upward of 18 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Today, the central government under the military junta effectively controls less than half of the country's territory. A variety of ethnic armed organizations and other rebel groups jostle for land, resources, and sway, running large regions of the country on their own terms.

Such a fractured political landscape could produce endless instability that might threaten investments in Myanmar or even spill beyond the country's borders. But China, Myanmar's most powerful and influential neighbor, no longer fears this fragmentation. Instead, Beijing believes this turmoil is here to stay—and that it can manage the chaos. For much of the civil war, Beijing reluctantly worked with both the military junta and local armed groups near its border while holding out hope for the junta to emerge dominant and unify the country, which would stabilize Myanmar and make it easier for China to operate there. Now, Beijing seeks to actively maintain its influence by simultaneously providing the junta with conditional economic and humanitarian aid and pressuring ethnic armed organizations on its border into compliance. China is using its massive economic leverage to force rival groups to the negotiating table on its terms.

Myanmar's election, which begins on December 28, is unlikely to produce a democratic transition. Although domestic political parties and local elites hope that the election creates an opening for some loosening of political restrictions, most external observers have already dismissed the elections as obviously unfree and unfair. But leaders in China view the polls as a crucial step toward their goal of managing the country. The election provides an opportunity to formalize a hybrid political system in which the military junta maintains its political authority behind a veneer of civilian administration. Military leaders will retain the symbols of state power, but the elected civilian parliament will process budgets and sign contracts. This will grant China the necessary administrative reliability it needs to invest in projects in Myanmar: whereas the junta's decrees are fragile because they are subject to leadership turnover, territory loss, or sanctions, civilian-ratified procedures offer more continuity and provide legal leverage for Chinese firms regardless of which local group claims dominance in a part of the country.

The election will not solve fragmentation in Myanmar. Instead, it will help China institutionalize it in a way that reduces risk for itself. Beijing believes it can tolerate a divided Myanmar so long as the main power holders remain dependent on China for trade, energy, and administrative coordination. This means that no single group can secure access to key resources, cross-border channels of commerce, or official approvals without running it by Beijing first. Chinese diplomatic, security, and economic agencies support this approach because they believe they have the tools to adjust pressure on competing groups effectively enough to limit the risk that this managed chaos will devolve into wider instability. If this strategy succeeds, it represents a new pathway for China to operate in one of the world's most volatile countries.

Even before the 2021 coup, numerous ethnic armed organizations ruled various parts of Myanmar. Since then, the civil war has fragmented the country even further. The military junta in the administrative capital of Naypyidaw retains international recognition and occupies most major cities, while strong ethnic armed groups, such as the Arakan Army and the United Wa State Army, exercise de facto administrative, military, and economic control over large, strategically vital territories.

In late 2023 and 2024, a joint military offensive of antigovernment rebels and ethnic armed groups, known as Operation 1027, seized more than 40 major towns and administrative centers. The government's counteroffensive, which started in early 2025 and was supported in part by agreements brokered by China, enabled the military to regain some areas it had lost. But according to the think tank ISP-Myanmar, the junta has regained only about 11 percent of the territory previously ceded in northern Shan State, on China's southwestern border. In much of the country, the government at best maintains isolated garrisons near key natural resource extraction sites and transport corridors.

But the junta's weakness is no guarantee of rebel success. The various opposition groups are too disunited to mount a decisive national takeover. These groups include the National Unity Government, the political leadership in exile composed of elected officials deposed in the 2021 coup; bands of militias known as the People's Defense Forces, some of which operate under the command of the National Unity Government; and a variety of other autonomous ethnic armed organizations that also oppose military rule. This motley resistance has been hampered by its divided political and command structures and a lack of weapons. Although Operation 1027 displayed impressive coordination among opposition groups, the ongoing infighting among rebels, including over natural resources and their attendant revenues, has undercut any attempt at forming and executing a collective strategy to topple the junta.

China sees utility in this fractured political landscape. It has cultivated direct ties to both the military junta and the most capable armed organizations around the country. This strategy of befriending all sides serves important Chinese material goals: securing access to Myanmar's deposits of critical minerals and routes overland to the Indian Ocean.

In 2023, Myanmar became China's largest external supplier of heavy rare earths. These elements, such as dysprosium and terbium, are key components in electric vehicles, defense systems, and advanced electronics. In 2023, China imported about 41,700 metric tons of heavy rare earths from Myanmar—more than 90 percent of China's overall supply.

But Myanmar's central government does not possess these mineral resources. The richest deposits are located almost exclusively in northern Kachin and Shan States, within the de facto jurisdictions of various ethnic armed organizations. Groups such as the Kachin Independence Organization and the United Wa State Army exercise authority over key mining hubs and operate these sites beyond the reach of the junta. Only by working with these ethnic armed organizations can China ensure its supply chain.

Beijing also wants maritime access to the Indian Ocean by promoting the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor from Kunming, the capital of China's Yunnan province, to the Chinese-backed Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and gas pipelines in Myanmar's Rakhine State. China currently relies on exporting goods and importing energy through the Malacca Strait in Southeast Asia, a narrow waterway that is vulnerable to a naval blockade and where adversaries could cut off supplies to China in a regional crisis. Having direct access to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar will strengthen China's energy security and strategic autonomy in the Indo-Pacific.



Although the central government in Naypyidaw formally operates the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port, the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed organization, has functional control because its territory encircles the project and its allies dominate the lengthy inland pipeline route stretching from China to the Indian Ocean. But China retains leverage over the Arakan Army because Beijing is the principal external sponsor of the port and the main source of future investment, financing, and decision-making connected to its development. It uses this leverage to effectively compel the Arakan Army to protect Chinese infrastructure even as the group battles the central government for regional dominance.

Its dealings in Myanmar have taught China that transactional dealmaking with competing local authorities is unavoidable in a fragmented political environment. But China has also learned that without more legal cover, temporary agreements with local armed groups are too fragile to support long-term investments. China wants standardized contracts, national-level permits, and legal guarantees, which protect its investments in case local power holders try to arbitrarily revise terms or a new group seizes power. Only a central state, even a weak one, can provide the basis for these national frameworks.

This combination of local rule and national administrative authority makes the junta and local ethnic armed groups dependent on one another, and, in turn, on Beijing. Central leaders in Naypyidaw need the revenue that projects such as mining and infrastructure partnerships bring, which encourages them to negotiate access and profit sharing agreements with the groups that physically govern the territory. Ethnic armed organizations, meanwhile, need national-level administrative approvals from central officials that will grant them Beijing's endorsement. China thus uses procedural demands and the promise of future investments to secure stable and workable arrangements with different groups.

Given how dispersed power is in Myanmar, any attempt to bring all groups together in a unified coalition, such as through attempts to broker national peace, is a distant dream. Instead, if Beijing can manage these relationships by creating interdependencies, it can get what it wants without slow and politically fraught national peace talks.

China's internal bureaucratic structure makes it more likely that it can carry out this strategy in Myanmar. The division of labor between powerful central agencies in Beijing and experienced local authorities near the border mirrors and reinforces Myanmar's fragmented political order, allowing China to more easily engage both the junta as a sovereign national authority and armed organizations as de facto power holders. By separating responsibility for national and local issues into different parts of its own bureaucracy, China can stabilize economic corridors in Myanmar and protect investment projects on a case-by-case basis without needing full political consolidation.

Central institutions in Beijing, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the People's Liberation Army, handle state-to-state diplomacy and cultivate ties with their counterparts in Myanmar's military leadership in Naypyidaw. The MFA, for instance, secures formal agreements, such as the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, a Chinese-led initiative to coordinate development and infrastructure among countries in the Mekong River basin. The MFA is also responsible for the diplomatic legwork necessary to carry out major infrastructure projects, including signing sovereign agreements to formalize state participation and reduce risk for Chinese state-owned enterprises operating in Myanmar.



Although the MFA has the ultimate diplomatic authority to represent Beijing, it does not and cannot enforce peace in the borderlands. Instead, most stabilizing operations are carried out on the ground in Myanmar by local police and intelligence agencies headquartered in Yunnan, the southwestern province that borders Myanmar. The Yunnan branches of the Ministry of Public Security, China's national law enforcement agency, and the Ministry of State Security (MSS), its intelligence agency, have decades-long relationships with ethnic armed groups. They have deep knowledge and experience of how to manage and coerce Myanmar's ethnic armed organizations that their counterparts in Beijing lack. The Yunnan branch of the MSS, for instance, analyzes the political and security situation on the ground and mediates between Myanmar's government and non-state actors.

These local divisions of China's security and intelligence agencies broker cease-fire agreements, conduct anti-scam operations, and provide stability. They rely on China's economic leverage to ensure that local groups support its interests. Ethnic armed organizations that run customs operations and infrastructure in northern Shan and Kachin states, the site of much critical minerals extraction, rely on Chinese logistics, currency, and banking systems to function. Chinese agencies operating out of Yunnan province are able to selectively open and close trade routes; regulate groups' access to fuel, electricity, and financing; and provide incentives to encourage cease-fires among competing groups when necessary.

Each of these local institutional branches implements its mission independently, which frequently generates friction inside China's massive bureaucracy. Conflict occurs most often when the mandates of the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security overlap. But the agencies are broadly aligned with Beijing's strategic objectives, and the Chinese Special Envoy for Asian Affairs—a top diplomat appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who has the authority to coordinate between agencies and meet with both official and nonstate groups—can step in to mediate between separate wings of the bureaucracy to prevent China's own bureaucratic fragmentation from undercutting its larger goals.

The central question in Myanmar no longer whether the military junta in Naypyidaw or the exiled democratic government can restore national unity but whether Beijing can sustain a system built on permanent fragmentation. After the election, Beijing's projected succession plan would keep the country's current leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, as interim president while shifting responsibilities to a group of senior commanders. This aims to ensure that no single figure can emerge as an heir apparent, which Beijing hopes will prevent the possibility that a competing power base inside Naypyidaw could grow large enough to disrupt a future leadership transition and break China's carefully crafted balance.

Beijing has shown that it is willing to use direct mediation tactics, economic leverage, and joint monitoring mechanisms to shape the internal power dynamics of Myanmar—going further than it has anywhere else in the world. Even if this approach works, however, China's influence remains geographically limited. Much of China's focus is on the strategic northern and western borderlands of Myanmar, which is where China needs to mine critical minerals for its supply chain and secure port access for energy security. And the local security and intelligence agencies based in Yunnan, which make it possible for China to work with volatile ethnic armed organizations on the ground, have the bandwidth and experience only to deal with areas that directly touch on their provincial interests. Their influence does not extend to the central plains and the eastern and southern border states.

This limited Chinese reach creates room for other regional and international actors to play a role in Myanmar and balance China's outsize influence. India and Thailand are deeply involved in Myanmar's west and south because they coordinate border security with both the central government and rebel groups operating along their borders, facilitate cross-border trade, and manage humanitarian access points for refugees fleeing Myanmar. In addition to Thailand, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations can promote quiet political dialogue among opposition groups and then collectively with the junta without aligning with any side. The United States and its allies, meanwhile, can help build local administrative capacity, deliver emergency medical services and food aid, and reinforce safe humanitarian channels beyond China's primary zones of engagement.

By piecing together a patchwork of negotiated local arrangements, China is seeking a pragmatic alternative to propping up a single unified national power. The pieces are in place for China to succeed, but there is a high risk of turbulence spiraling out of control. The more that China strikes to deals to empower rebel groups along its border, the more it erodes the central government's authority. If the central government is weakened too much it could trigger a total state collapse, which would result in a surge in cross-border crime, refugee flows, and unchecked ethnic rivalries and violence. Ultimately, Beijing is betting that it can sustain a delicate balance to get what it wants in Myanmar despite ongoing disorder.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

THEODORE BUNZEL is Managing Director and Head of Lazard Geopolitical Advisory. He has worked in the Political Section of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and at the U.S. Treasury Department.

TOM DONILON served as U.S. National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Council on Foreign Relations.

 America Needs a Defense Against Drones

 Theodore Bunzel and Tom Donilon

On June 1, Ukraine's security services launched a covert strike on five air bases across Russia. More than 100 attack drones smuggled into Russia in plywood cabins on trucks driven by unsuspecting Russians destroyed bombers sitting on tarmacs as far away as the Belaya air base in Siberia, around 3,000 miles from Kyiv. According to Ukrainian government sources, the strikes took out about one-third of Russia's long-range bomber force and cost Moscow roughly $7 billion. Dubbed Operation Spiderweb, it was one of the most spectacular and daring attacks to date of the war in Ukraine. It was also a dramatic warning of a growing threat to American soil.

In an essay in Foreign Affairs in January 2022, one of us (Donilon) warned of this threat. Back then, America's vulnerability to this possibility seemed to be a “failure of imagination,” echoing the 9/11 Commission's famous conclusion about the United States' failure to anticipate the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Today, the drone threat is no longer difficult to imagine. States can use them to sow economic disruption or to spy on sensitive sites, lone-wolf actors can use them for political violence, and hobbyists can accidentally crash them into critical infrastructure.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have taken steps to protect the country from drones, such as specifying federal roles and responsibilities, banning drone flights over certain sensitive sites and special events, and investing in counterdrone technology and its deployment. Recent legislation goes even further to close jurisdictional gaps. But despite this progress, the United States has not kept pace with the threats. Vulnerabilities remain, including inadequate systems for identifying and restricting drones in U.S. airspace, limited funding for advanced counterdrone systems capable of protecting sensitive infrastructure and mass gatherings of people, and supply chain risks tied to China's dominance of the global drone market.

The United States, in other words, still lacks a comprehensive drone defense. The good news is that the country and its partners have the means and ability to mitigate the domestic threat from drones, and there is bipartisan consensus in Washington for doing so. They just need the bureaucratic and political will to act before a crisis forces them to.

The risk from drones has evolved dramatically since 2022. Russia's war against Ukraine has demonstrated the lethality of drones, which according to Ukrainian government estimates are now responsible for 70 percent of all casualties. The war in Ukraine has also served as a testing ground and innovation accelerant for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), including the mass production of first-person-view drones, the development of fiber-optic drones that can travel for miles and cannot be thwarted by radio frequencies, and long-range strike drones that are ever more capable of effectively hitting targets such as energy and civilian infrastructure. Skilled drone pilots can guide their payloads into the open hatch of a tank and have been recording such attacks to score propaganda points for Kyiv or Moscow. Ukraine is manufacturing some four million drones a year—by some estimates more than all NATO countries combined—while Russia is making around two million per year. Mounting a defense, meanwhile, has been difficult, with neither Russia nor Ukraine able to find scalable and broad countermeasures to protect itself against the onslaught.

During this time, drones have become ever more present in U.S. skies as well. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, more than 800,000 drone operators are registered in the United States. But the number of actual drones is far higher because of the many hobbyists operating small drones that fall below registration thresholds and because operators can use a single registration to fly multiple drones.Drones are now being used for everything from monitoring crop health to assisting firefighters and law enforcement. And the day when drones deliver goods to your front door may not be far off: in 2024, Amazon's Prime Air service secured FAA approval for its drones to fly beyond the operator's visual line of sight, laying the foundation for the company to scale such operations.

Yet while drones can deliver major economic benefits, their proliferation heightens the risk of accidents and complicates the ability of law enforcement agencies to distinguish legitimate activity from potential threats. The United States has already experienced a series of confusing drone-related incidents. In December 2023, Langley Air Force Base in Virginia experienced 17 consecutive nights of mysterious drone flyovers that forced the temporary relocation of F-22 Raptor aircraft and the suspension of training operations. Witnesses described formations as long as 20 feet traveling at 100 miles per hour. But despite weeks of investigation, the FBI, the Pentagon, and NASA were not able to identify the operators. Over the following year, more than 350 drone incursions were detected across 100 different U.S. military installations.

Last December, meanwhile, a wave of drone sightings concentrated in New Jersey set off a media frenzy. The governor reported nearly 50 sightings in a single night as the FAA imposed restrictions on flights around critical infrastructure. Once again, authorities were unable to determine the origin of the drones or even corroborate the sightings. These incidents highlight the challenge of identifying who is responsible for unknown UAS—and, just as important—determining which authorities are responsible for dealing with them.

Part of the problem is that drones are easily accessible to dangerous actors as varied as lone wolves, criminal organizations, and adversarial states. In the hands of individuals, cheap drones can be tools for terrorist acts. In July 2024, for instance, a 20-year-old used one to survey the rally grounds in Butler, Pennsylvania, before taking aim at Donald Trump during a campaign appearance. States, meanwhile, can deploy drones to cause economic disruption: consider recent hybrid attacks in Europe, which European officials attribute to Russian intelligence. In September, unusual drone activity forced temporary closures of the main airports in Copenhagen and Oslo. The next month, similar incidents near the Munich airport derailed flights for more than 3,000 travelers. Russian authorities denied involvement, but the incidents cost millions. Such examples show how hostile actors in a moment of future tension could employ drones to surveil sensitive sites, destroy commercial or military targets, or conduct plausibly deniable economic disruption in the United States.

American policymakers have taken several steps to address the drone challenge. In 2022 the Biden administration released a plan that recommended—but did not universally implement—measures such as creating a national database to track incidents, training counterdrone operators, enlisting state and local law enforcement in counterdrone activities, investing in new technology, and passing legislation to clarify which authorities would be responsible for what. In June, Trump issued an executive order, “Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty,” which directed the FAA to tighten regulations on drone flights over sensitive sites and expanded law enforcement powers and funding to counter unauthorized drone activity.

This month, Congress passed legislation, provisions of which had been supported by both the Biden and Trump administrations, to enhance and extend federal agencies' authorities to use defensive measures against drones. It also grants new authority to state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies to protect certain sites, including sports arenas and concert venues, once their employees are trained and certified by the Department of Justice. These actions deserve credit and will help close some of the jurisdictional gaps that have impeded an effective threat response. Yet several challenges remain that require additional and prompt action.



Most urgently, the United States needs an integrated national system for detecting drones, identifying and attributing potential threats, and executing a response in real time. The FAA tried to address part of this issue with its Remote ID Rule, which became fully enforceable in March 2024 and requires registered drones to fly with a “digital license plate” that broadcasts their identification and location information. Compliance has been slow, and enforcement has been tepid, however: a Government Accountability Office report found that in many cases, state and local law enforcement were not even aware of the Remote ID requirement. The federal government should provide greater resources to the FAA to facilitate full implementation. Still, given the limits of the Remote ID technology and its integration with state and local systems, the more advisable path may be to replace the program altogether with a new, more agile technology developed in collaboration with industry.

To complement identification efforts, the FAA, in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, should establish a single catalogue of restricted airspace and institute “hard” geofencing requirements—software guardrails built into every drone—that would automatically block them from flying over these sensitive areas. The European Union requires drone manufacturers to incorporate geo-awareness systems that warn or restrict operators from flying into prohibited zones, but in the United States such measures remain voluntary and depend on the manufacturer's discretion. In fact, in January 2025, DJI, a Chinese company and the world's largest drone manufacturer, rolled back geofencing software that had previously prevented U.S. drones from flying in FAA-restricted areas. By making hobbyist and commercial drones easier to identify and barring them from sensitive areas, authorities will be able to more quickly distinguish inadvertent disruptions from nefarious threats.

The United States also needs to double down on counterdrone measures. Today, the most advanced of these systems use directed-energy weapons—high-powered lasers and microwaves that disable or destroy drones—that complement existing electronic warfare tools, including GPS spoofing, radio-frequency jamming, and remote takeover technologies that can neutralize drone swarms. But these systems can run into the tens of millions of dollars. By contrast, the drones they are combating often cost just a few hundred dollars—an unsustainable asymmetry.

The Defense Department should thus boost funding and R & D to develop agile and innovative counterdrone technologies. The Pentagon has already earmarked significant resources for the effort, and Congress recently ordered the formation of a joint interagency task force to better coordinate acquisition and deployment. But the government needs to allocate billions of dollars more to make it scalable. Because large numbers of drones can overwhelm even the most sophisticated air defense systems, an effective strategy will rely not just on one device or system but on intentionally layered defenses that integrate physical, electronic, and kinetic counterdrone measures.

The United States will then need to focus on deploying these counterdrone systems where they are most needed, such as around critical infrastructure. Airports are an obvious target: the FAA recorded 411 illegal drone incursions at airports in the first quarter of 2025 alone, an increase of more than 25 percent over the same period in 2024. Mass gathering sites, such as stadiums and concert venues, will also need their own enhanced defenses, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup games and the United States Semiquincentennial on July 4, 2026. The FBI has reported that it is only able to protect around 0.05 percent of the more than 240,000 events eligible for its oversight. This is an unacceptable gap that puts the American public at risk.

Data centers are the new frontier in this domain; as firms invest hundreds of billions of dollars into the build-out of artificial intelligence, these sites are increasingly becoming national security assets. With plans to build new AI data centers approaching the size of Manhattan, major tech companies previously focused on cyber defenses will need strong policy incentives and assistance to protect such sites from physical attacks, including from drones.

AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT

At the same time that the United States is working on its drone defenses, it also needs to play offense and develop a whole-of-government strategy to address the supply chain risks from Chinese dominance of the drone market. Today, 80 percent of the U.S. consumer drone market is held by a single Chinese company. This dominance opens the risk that Chinese drones could transmit sensitive information back to Beijing—as well as the possibility that they might be remotely hacked to sow disruption. In late December, the Federal Communications Commission placed all foreign drone companies on its Covered List, effectively banning new models of foreign drones in the U.S. market. This will help address the vulnerability from new Chinese drones in U.S. airspace, but it will not affect foreign drones already in widespread use or restrict the import and sale of drones previously approved for the U.S. market. And even with the ban, it will take time to diversify away from Chinese manufactured drones. The United States will need greater incentives to encourage both manufacturing and non-Chinese drone use if it wants to develop a competitive drone market.

The United States should also lean into the opportunity to learn from partners on the frontlines of drone warfare, including Ukraine, Israel, and now, several of its European NATO allies. Ukraine has been at the vanguard of creating lower-cost counter-drone methods, such as interceptor drones that can ram hostile counterparts, to help defend itself against relentless Russian attacks. Israel, which has faced recurring drone attacks from Iran and its proxies over the last several years, has invested in advanced systems to identify, track, and intercept drone threats in crowded airspace. And NATO recently proposed a “drone wall” to detect and intercept threats along its eastern flank. The United States should coordinate with NATO on counterdrone initiatives and form working groups with Ukraine and Israel to exchange technology and best practices. These discussions should include not just representatives of the U.S. military but also the Department of Homeland Security, the FAA, the FBI, and other authorities.

Given the urgency of the threat and the magnitude of the legal, technical, and policy challenges at hand, Congressional leaders should also convene a blue-ribbon commission to examine recent domestic and international incidents; develop an integrated system for identifying, tracking, and mitigating drone threats that spans civilian and military applications; devise a way to adequately fund the development and deployment of drone detection and mitigation technology; and address critical vulnerabilities in U.S. supply chains for drones. The commission should be small, with no more than five members and a well-resourced staff working in both classified and unclassified dimensions, and it should be charged with delivering concrete recommendations within 12 months on how to strengthen the U.S. counterdrone posture across the government as a whole. Such a commission is typically created after an attack or major disaster, but the United States can seize the moment now.

The drone threat is no longer theoretical. It is here, it is accelerating, and it will only grow more challenging. The United States still has the means to shape the environment before a crisis forces its hand, but the window is closing. The federal government must act fast to eliminate regulatory gaps, build a layered defense, and find the political will to fund and deploy counterdrone systems at scale. If it does not take these steps by choice, it will be forced to take them—and more—in the wake of a preventable tragedy.

            Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty of abuse of power on Friday in the biggest trial yet in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, a ruling that could have significant political repercussions.
    


            The judge had yet to deliver the full verdict and sentencing.
    


            Malaysia and US investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1 billion allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.
    


            Najib has been charged with four counts of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of more than 2.3 billion ringgit ($569.45 million) from 1MDB.
    


            “The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him,” Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in an ongoing reading of the verdict.
    


            Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.
    


            Najib, 72, has been in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia's top court upheld a verdict convicting him of corruption for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.
    


            Najib last year apologized for mishandling the scandal while in office but had consistently denied wrongdoing, saying repeatedly that he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier, Jho Low, about the source of the funds.
    


            Judge Sequerah in reading the verdict had earlier said evidence had revealed Najib had an “unmistakable bond and connection” with Low, who acted as the then prime minister's “proxy and intermediary” in 1MDB affairs.
    


            Low, who has been charged in the United States for his central role in the case, denies all wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.
    


            Najib has maintained he was misled by Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that funds deposited into his account were donations from the Saudi royal family.
    


            But Sequerah said Najib's argument was “implausible” and dismissed letters on the donations produced by Najib that allegedly originated from the Saudi royal family, saying they were not corroborated by evidence and were probably forgeries.
    


            “The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious … the evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds,” Sequerah said.
    


            The verdict came just days after another court denied a bid by Najib to serve his jail sentence under house arrest - a decision that reignited tensions within current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration.
    


            Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation, campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.
    


            Some UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest and others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the earlier ruling.
    


            Anwar on Tuesday called for calm, urging all parties to accept the court verdict with “full patience and wisdom.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump says violence in Nigeria targets Christians. The reality is more nuanced","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/25/africa/trump-nigeria-attacks-on-christians-explainer-intl-hnk","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 03:14:00 GMT","


            After months of warning that the US could take military action to stop violence against Christians in Nigeria, President Donald Trump announced on Christmas Day that he had done just that – delivering a strike on Islamic State terrorists in the country's northwest.
    


            US Africa Command said it conducted the strikes in Sokoto state, which borders Niger to the north, “in coordination with Nigerian authorities.” AFRICOM's initial assessment is that “multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps,” according to a news release.
    


            Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar told CNN Friday that he had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio prior to the strike and that Nigerian President Bola Tinubu gave the “go ahead.”
    


            Details are still emerging about the strike, which came after Trump threatened to suspend aid to Nigeria over violence against Christians, even calling on his secretary of defense to “prepare for possible action” against Africa's most populous nation in November.
    


            But the reality on the ground is more nuanced than Trump's characterization suggests, experts and analysts have told CNN this year. Both Christians and Muslims – the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people – have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists.
    


            In the wake of the strike, Yuggar said Nigeria's focus is “to fight against terrorism, to stop the terrorists from killing innocent Nigerians, be (they) Muslim, Christian, atheist, whatever religion.”
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            Nigeria has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks.
    


            The country has roughly equal numbers of Christians – predominantly in the south – and Muslims, who are mainly concentrated in the north.
    


            Sokoto state, in Nigeria's northwestern corner, is bordered to the north by Niger, and is home to 4 million people – the majority of whom are Muslim.
    


            The violence in the country's northwest is mainly driven by criminal bandit groups, analysts say, but growing links with Islamic State-affiliated jihadists have created a hybrid crime-terrorism threat.
    


            “The region where the strike has actually taken place is dominated by criminal bandits, who have been tormenting rural villages and towns with some form of ISWAP (a Boko Haram breakaway group known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province) presence in that region, but not really specifically in Sokoto,” Oluwole Ojewale, a Dakar-based African security analyst told CNN Friday.
    


            In 2012, the Islamist group Boko Haram issued an ultimatum, ordering Christians in the northern region to leave while calling on Muslims in the south to “come back” to the north. Most targeted killings in recent years have been in the north.
    


            Security analysts said Lakurawa, a lesser-known group prominent in northwestern states, could have been the target of Thursday's strikes. Lakurawa – an offshoot of Boko Haram – has become increasingly deadly this year, often targeting remote communities and security forces, and hiding in the forests between states. In January, Nigeria's authorities declared the group a terrorist organization and banned its activities nationwide.
    


            Ansaru, an al-Qaeda-aligned jihadist group that also splintered from Boko Haram, operates in the country's northwest and north-central regions and is known for its kidnappings, attacks on civilians and cooperation with transnational jihadist actors.
    


            Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to land and water.
    


            Nigeria has not named a specific organization that was targeted on Thursday.
    


            The US strike could “disrupt ISIS operations in the short term, but the long-term issues that surround violence in Nigeria are extremely complex,” said CNN military analyst and retired US Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, pointing to the economic factors at play.
    


            “The way most of these strikes work is that they need to be part of a larger campaign, and what we're not seeing here is that larger campaign.”
    


            Yes – though that's only part of the picture.
    


            John Joseph Hayab, a pastor who leads the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the country's northern region, agrees with Trump's claim of “systematic killings of Christians” in that area.
    


            The scale of the killings has reduced in the last two years, he said. However, this year has seen a spate of high-profile attacks in predominantly Christian pockets of the north, which has drawn international attention and condemnation.
    


            In April, gunmen believed to be Muslim herders killed at least 40 people in a mostly Christian farming village. Two months later, more than 100 people were massacred in Yelwata, a largely Christian community in the southeastern state of Benue, according to Amnesty International.
    


            The killings have been seized upon among parts of the Christian evangelical right in the US. In August, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom.
    


            Muslims have also been victims of targeted attacks by Islamist groups seeking to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic law.
    


At least 50 worshippers were killed in August when gunmen attacked a mosque in the northwestern state of Katsina, and many similarly brutal attacks have been carried out in Muslim communities by Boko Haram and other armed groups in the north.
    


            “Yes, these (extremist) groups have sadly killed many Christians. However, they have also massacred tens of thousands of Muslims,” said Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian human rights advocate specializing in security and development.
    


            He added that attacks in public spaces disproportionately harm Muslims, as these radical groups operate in predominantly Muslim states.
    


            What little data exists also does not support Trump's claims that Christians are being disproportionately targeted.
    


            Out of more than 20,400 civilians killed in attacks between January 2020 and September 2025, 317 deaths were from attacks targeting Christians while 417 were from attacks targeting Muslims, according to crisis monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data.
    


            The organization did not include the religious affiliation of the vast majority of the civilians killed.
    


            Oyewale said that Trump's “binary framing of the issue as attacks targeting Christians does not resonate with the reality on the ground.”
    


            Nigeria is already divided along political and religious lines, Oyewale said, who added that the US president's rhetoric “goes a long way to actually open the fault lines of division that already exist in the country.”
    


            In November, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the US International Religious Freedom Act – which suggests his administration has found that Nigeria has engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, (and) egregious violations of religious freedom.”
    


            But the Nigerian government rejected claims that it was not doing enough to protect Christians from violence. At the time, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said that “the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality.”
    


            However, several experts and analysts told CNN they believed the government needed to better protect all citizens – as people are being impacted by mass killings regardless of their religion or background.
    


            Encapsulating the voices of other prominent politicians and leaders across Nigeria on Friday, former Senator Shehu Sani said on X: “The narrative that the evil terrorists only target one faith remains absolutely false and misleading,” before adding: “The ultimate security and peace in our country lies with ourselves and not with the US or any foreign power.”
    


            Tinubu has not yet publicly commented on Thursday's strike, but earlier in the day, had shared a Christmas message on social media.
    


            “I stand committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect Christians, Muslims, and all Nigerians from violence,” he wrote.

The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning.

The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year.

A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens.

“Clothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,” said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management.

Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it.

If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel.

If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again.

And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%.




Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling.

If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility.

“It can be quite expensive,” said Sarkis. “And if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you'll get. You'll get another return and you'll lose a customer who's unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.”

Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff — think a bathing suit or a bra — is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that.

And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental — and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free.

“Refurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,” said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.

If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said Cardiff University logistics and operations management lecturer Danni Zhang.

If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season.

Another tip: in-person shopping is better than online because purchases get returned less often, and in-person returns are better, too — because those items get resold more often. Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances.

“If I can return in-store, then I definitely will,” Zhang said. “The managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.”

Obviously the best thing consumers can do is minimize returns. Many shoppers engage in “bracketing behavior,” or buying multiple sizes of the same item, keeping what fits, and returning the rest.

“This behavior of bringing the dressing room to our homes is not sustainable,” said Faires.

If you're buying for someone else, you can also consider taking the guesswork out of the equation and going for a gift card.

“I know we do really want to pick up something really nice to express our love for our friends or our family. But if we are more sustainable, probably the gift card will be much better than just purchasing the product,” Zhang said.

Sarkis wants to see companies provide more information in product descriptions about the environmental impact of returning an item, or how much of the purchase price factors in return costs.

“But I don't know if they want to send a negative message,” he said. “If you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.”

Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already Amazon is requiring customers pay in certain situations.

On the tech side, Blue Yonder's recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them.

“Having that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,” said van Gendt. “So that's a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.”

Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.

The patriotic spectacle will kick off celebrations nation-wide leading up to Independence Day.

After the crystal ball drops on New Year's Eve in New York City, it will rise again, sparkling in red, white and blue to usher in 2026 and kick off months of celebrations for the nation's upcoming 250th birthday.

The patriotic touches at this year's Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what's ahead: hundreds of events and programs, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

“I'm telling you right now, whatever you're imagining, it's going to be much more than that,” said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organize the semiquincentennial anniversary. “It's going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.”

Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from where the ball is dropped, to make the changes to this year's ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop event on July 3, the eve of the nation's birthday, “in the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it,” Rios said.

It will mark the first time in 120 years there will be ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year's Eve, she said.

A New Year's Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogram), 5-foot- (1.5-meter-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs. Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilograms).




The only years when no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly “dimout” during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.

This year, the stroke of midnight will also mark the official launch of America Gives, a national service initiative created by America250. Organizers hope to make 2026 the largest year of volunteer hours ever aggregated in the country.

On the following day, America250 will participate in the New Years Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, with a float themed “Soaring Onward Together for 250 Years.” It will feature three larger-than-life bald eagles representing the country's past, present and future.

“We want to ring in this new year from sea to shining sea. What better way to think about it than going from New York to California,” Rios said. “This has to be community-driven, this has be grassroots. We're going from Guam to Alaska, from Fairbanks to Philadelphia, and everything in between.”

President Donald Trump has also announced the “Freedom 250” initiative to coordinate additional events for the 250th anniversary.

Rios said she sees the wide range of celebrations and programs planned for the coming months, from large fireworks displays and statewide potluck suppers to student contests and citizen oral histories, as an opportunity to unite a politically divided nation. 

“If we can find something for everyone ... having those menus of options that people can pick and choose how they want to participate,” she said. “That's how we're going to get to engaging 350 million Americans.”

NEW YORK (AP) — When Cami Teacoach's son turned three she set out to find volunteer opportunities they could do together. He made Valentine cards for senior citizens. They hiked and picked up trash. He helped harvest produce at community gardens and made seed balls out of mud, throwing them into the forest to promote wildflower growth.

Teacoach had reached out to many organizations looking for volunteer projects that she could do with her young child, but most places said no, so she came up with her own.

“Everyone was like, ‘A 3-year-old can't do that,'” Teacoach said. “And I was like, ‘No, I swear, he really can if you would just give him a chance.'”

Volunteering with children can instill confidence in youngsters, teach social and problem-solving skills and provide unique ways for families to bond. During the holiday season, many people seek such opportunities, looking for ways to give back. 

But often nonprofit organizations seek helpers who are at least 18 years old. Finding volunteer work to do as a family with young children can be challenging, but there are opportunities, if you persist.

“There's a million different ways to help people and volunteer. So many families want to do this and literally just don't know where to start,” said Polly Lagana, executive director of Volunteer New York!, which connects people with service opportunities. “In a turbulent time in our world, families — and parents in particular — are very interested in showing their kids how they can help out and how they can give back.”

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

Children excel at activities such as sorting coats, packing groceries and following through on tasks, said Sapreet Saluja, executive director of New York Cares, which works with organizations to develop volunteer programs in New York City.




“I've been very impressed with the detail-orientation and the precision and the following of directions and the care that some kids I've seen, as young as six, take to the tasks that they're doing,” Saluja said. “It's been explained to them that this is to benefit someone, and it's important, and they're following the directions and they want to get it just right. And in many cases, they're more detail-oriented than the adults, which I think is very inspiring.”

To get started, look for organizations in your community that match volunteers with family-friendly projects and reach out to ask if there's a minimum age requirement.

Here are some other ways to involve little ones in projects that help the community.

Children prefer to have agency and information to make a decision, so include them when you're choosing an activity, Lagana said.

“Let them know what problem you're trying to fix in your community, and maybe one or two options of how that problem can be fixed,” Lagana said. For example, you can explain there are people who don't have enough food, and children in the hospital who might not have blankets, and then ask, ‘Which one do you think you want to help out with?' she suggested.

Consider volunteering for a mission that you can explain to your child, such as cleaning up litter at a park. 

“Kids are unbelievably curious. They ask questions about what they're doing, what they're seeing, what they're feeling, what they're hearing, and it opens up a dialogue,” Saluja said. “It helps you see even at a young age some of the challenges that society is facing and it gives you agency to know that you can be a part of the solution.”

Children understand hunger, and they can help alleviate the problem. They can sort grocery boxes at a food pantry or help deliver sustenance to home-bound individuals.

Aviva Davis was about eight years old when she and her brother Brendan began helping her parents deliver Meals on Wheels to senior citizens and medically frail individuals in Denver. Initially, they rode in the car with their parents and helped bring food to the door. When they were older, they took turns driving.

“It definitely opened my eyes to what the world is like outside of our bubble. We saw all sorts of different things and I saw not everyone lives the same way,” said Davis, now 17. “But even at such a young age I could realize it's amazing what we're doing that we could help people that aren't as lucky as we were.”

Davis became a resource at school for fellow students looking to volunteer. She still does monthly meal deliveries with her parents.

“It's a great chance for us to catch up as a family,” said her father, Seth Davis. “When we're not all on our phones, you get some pretty cool quality time.”

Her brother is now in college, but when he's home, they do deliveries altogether. 

“The older they get, the harder it is to get that time together,” said their mother, Bonnie Davis, who found the Meals on Wheels opportunity after extensive research.

When Teacoach couldn't find organizations willing to accept her toddler, she started a group in Pittsburgh called VolunTOTs, which creates service opportunities for children as young as 3. The children and their parents pack 500 boxes of groceries to distribute to families in need, play bingo with seniors in nursing homes and make dog treats for an animal rescue center, among other projects.

Parents have told Teacoach their children's conduct improves after volunteering. “They feel so good about themselves, they were a helper, and that translates into better behavior,” she said.

Stephanie Bernaba's family started “Tough Cookies,” a project where they bake and deliver cookies to veterans, when her son Matthew was in eighth grade and had to complete a service project for school. 

“Going up to the houses, it was very nice, because they're mostly living alone. A lot of their family or friends died,” said Michael Bernaba, 14, now a freshman at The Prout School in Wakefield, Rhode Island. “It's just nice to be there and bring it to them ... They were very happy, especially for someone to bring them treats like that.”

The project also helped the teens learn social skills and meet people in various stages of life and health conditions, Stephanie Bernaba said.

“We went to the first couple of places and I was really scared, because I'm more of a shy person,” Matthew Bernaba, now 15, said. “For the first couple of deliveries I was more to myself, and as we kept going, we talked more with the veterans and got to hear great stories from them.” 

Children can be more willing to try new activities with a buddy, so consider signing up with people you know. 

You can also connect with a nonprofit in need of a service and invite other families over to do a project together, as Lagana's friends have done, organizing clothing donations or assembling snack packs in living rooms.

Bonnie Davis organized a drive for menstrual supplies, and families gathered in her backyard to assemble the baskets. She also turned half of her son's graduation party into a volunteer project assembling kits of bean soup. 

“It's a win for everybody. You get quality time, you're raising your children with what feels like good values, and people benefit,” she said.

President Donald Trump said the United States launched a “powerful and deadly” strike against forces of the Islamic State group in Nigeria, after accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the targeting of Christians.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said the United States launched a “powerful and deadly” strike against forces of the Islamic State group in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to rein in the targeting of Christians. 

In a Christmas evening post on his social media site Thursday, Trump did not provide details or mention the extent of the damage caused by the strikes in the northwestern state of Sokoto. 

A Defense Department official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss details not made public, said the U.S. worked with Nigeria to carry out the strikes and that they'd been approved by Abuja.




Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the cooperation included exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination in ways “consistent with international law, mutual respect for sovereignty and shared commitments to regional and global security.” 

The Associated Press could not confirm the extent of the strikes' impact.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Nigeria is battling multiple armed groups, including at least two affiliated with IS, an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the less-known Lakurawa group prominent in the northwestern states, where the gangs use large swathes of forests as hideouts.

Security analysts said the target of the U.S. strikes could be the Lakurawa group, which in the last year has increasingly become lethal in the region, often targeting remote communities and security forces.

“Lakurawa is a group that is actually controlling territories in Nigeria, in Sokoto state and in other states like Kebbi,” said Malik Samuel, a Nigerian security researcher at Good Governance Africa. “In the northwest, there has been the incursion of violent extremist groups that are ideologically driven,” he said, blaming the incursion on the near absence of the state and security forces in hot spots.

Trump said the airstrikes were launched against IS militants “who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians.” Residents and security analysts have said Nigeria's security crisis affects both Christians, predominant in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north.

“Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria's values and to international peace and security,” the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. 

Nigeria's government has previously said in response to Trump's criticisms that people of many faiths, not just Christians, have suffered attacks at the hands of extremist groups.

Trump ordered the Pentagon last month to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria to try and curb what he called Christian persecution. The State Department recently announced it would restrict visas for Nigerians and their family members involved in killing Christians there.

And the U.S. recently designated Nigeria a “country of particular concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.

Trump said U.S. defense officials had “executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing” and added that “our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper.”

Nigeria's population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts, including Boko Haram, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.

But attacks in Nigeria often have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.

The U.S. security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or canceled. U.S. forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any larger-scale military intervention in Nigeria.

Trump has nonetheless kept up the pressure as Nigeria faced a series of attacks on schools and churches in violence that experts and residents say targets both Christians and Muslims.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted Thursday night on X: “The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.”

Hegseth said that U.S. military forces are “always ready, so ISIS found out tonight — on Christmas” and added, “More to come…Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation” before signing off, “Merry Christmas!”

BEIJING (AP) — Beijing imposed sanctions on Friday against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington annoucned large-scale arms sales to Taiwan. 

The sanctions entail freezing the companies' assets in China and banning individuals and organizations from dealing with them, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.

The companies include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, L3Harris Maritime Services and Boeing in St. Louis, while defense firm Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey is one of the executives sanctioned, who can no longer do business in China and are barred from entering the country. Their assets in the East Asian country have also been frozen. 

The announcement of the U.S. arms-sale package, valued at more than $10 billion, has drawn an angry response from China, which claims Taiwan as its own and says it must come under its control. 

If approved by the American Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to the self-ruled territory.

“We stress once again that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China－U.S. relations,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. “Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing.”

The ministry also urged the U.S. to stop what it called “the dangerous moves of arming Taiwan.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Taiwan is a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations that analysts worry could explode into military conflict between the two powers. China says that the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S. 




China's military has increased its presence in Taiwan's skies and waters in the past few years, holding joint drills with its warships and fighter jets on a near-daily basis near the island. 

Under the American federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. Beijing already has strained ties with Washington over trade, technology and other human rights issues.

Retired NYPD inspector Paul Mauro joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the unknown motive of the shooter suspected of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor after being found dead in a New Hampshire storage unit.

New details are emerging about the suspected gunman in the killings of an MIT scientist and two Brown University students, with a top Portuguese nuclear fusion official telling the Daily Mail the suspect may have fixated on the victim as a symbol of success he never achieved.

Authorities say Nuno Loureiro, 47, a world-renowned fusion-energy researcher and director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was shot on Dec. 15 and died hours later. Police believe the gunman was Claudio Neves-Valente, 48, a onetime physics prodigy from Portugal who later died by suicide after a multistate manhunt.

The case widened dramatically after authorities identified Neves-Valente as the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University days earlier. Police say Neves-Valente opened fire on Dec. 13 inside a campus building, killing two students and injuring nine others. Investigators later confirmed he was also responsible for the Dec. 15 fatal shooting of Loureiro at his Brookline, Massachusetts, home.

Neves-Valente was a Portuguese national and former Brown student who studied physics from the fall of 2000 through the spring of 2001 before withdrawing from the program by 2003, according to Brown University President Christina Paxson. She emphasized that Neves-Valente had no recent affiliation with the university at the time of the campus shooting.

According to the Daily Mail, Dr. Bruno Goncalves, president of Portugal's Institute of Plasma and Nuclear Fusion, said Neves-Valente did not maintain any known relationship with Loureiro in the decades after they studied together there, underscoring that the attack was not the result of an ongoing rivalry or dispute.

Instead, Goncalves said Neves-Valente may have fixated on what Loureiro had come to represent.

""The strongest theory is that Claudio saw Nuno as a symbol of the academic and professional success that he himself had failed to achieve,"" Goncalves said.

He stressed that the resentment was one-sided and did not exist during their student years.

""It's not a rivalry that existed at the time,"" Goncalves said, adding that it ""developed later.""

Goncalves also rejected claims that institutional pressure or academic culture bore responsibility for the violence, telling the Daily Mail that Portugal's elite technical universities provide psychological support and that many graduates successfully transition into other careers.

""It was not the course,"" he said. ""It was how Claudio chose to respond to the course.""

While noting that Neves-Valente may have struggled after leaving elite academia, Goncalves emphasized that others in similar circumstances did not resort to violence.

""It's strange,"" Goncalves said, according to the Daily Mail, ""that he didn't just try to make something of himself in another field, like many IST students do.""

Law enforcement officials said Loureiro had no recent contact with Neves-Valente and described the attack as a deliberate, unilateral act of criminal violence carried out against a victim unconnected to his personal or professional failures.

At the time of his death, Loureiro was widely regarded as one of the leading figures in fusion-energy research.

Loureiro met last year with Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), both at MIT and at an international fusion summit in Rome that brought together senior government officials, scientists, and global energy leaders.

He was also recently named a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the highest honor awarded by the U.S. government to early-career researchers, with recipients recognized at the White House.

Goncalves told Fox News Digital previously that Loureiro was ""leading one of the top research institutes in fusion"" and was ""very well known and recognized internationally for his contributions and his leadership.""

Loureiro lived in a Brookline condominium with his wife and three daughters. His mother-in-law was visiting at the time of the shooting, according to the Daily Mail. Friends and neighbors described the family as quiet and close-knit, and authorities have said there is no indication Loureiro anticipated any threat.

Secretary Kennedy spoke in Martinsburg, W.V., where Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill banning food dyes.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spent the first year of President Donald Trump's second administration trying to implement his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) vision. But his mission hit a roadblock during the holiday season when an Obama-appointed judge issued a ruling siding with a conglomerate of dye companies to stifle a landmark ban on artificial food additives.

During his first trip as America's lead healthcare official in March, Kennedy spoke in Martinsburg, W.V., alongside Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who said his state's ban plan and the Democrat scion's choice to visit the area first shows the ""MAHA"" movement ""begins right here in West Virginia.""

By Wednesday, a federal judge in the Mountain State, Judge Irene Berger of the Southern District of West Virginia, blocked those plans, siding with food dye manufacturers and issuing a preliminary injunction halting Charleston's ability to enforce the policy Morrisey championed at Kennedy's event.

Berger issued a 30-page ruling blocking enforcement of HB 2354, a law drafted by Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Upshur, which bans food and pharmaceuticals that have been ""adulterated"" with artificial compounds including butylated hydroxyanisole, Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.

GUT IMBALANCE MAY BE DRIVING AMERICA'S FOOD ALLERGY EPIDEMIC, EXPERTS WARN

Knowingly contaminating food with such artificial dyes and compounds would have resulted in a potential misdemeanor charge and $500 fine, according to the Wheeling News-Register.

Red 3 is already banned by the FDA, in part due to lab tests on rats that found development of thyroid issues and cancerous side effects, according to NIH and HHS documents.

The case was brought by the International Association of Color Manufacturers, a K Street organization that alleged the bill causes economic harm to its member companies, that it lets Charleston ""usurp"" Washington's power to regulate food safety and also interferes with interstate commerce, a federal concern.

""The statute arbitrarily and irrationally targets color additives no U.S. agency — state or federal — nor any court has ever found to be unsafe,"" IACM said in a statement announcing its suit, adding that the ban also lacks ""scientific evidence.""

While Berger ruled in IACM's favor, she also rejected their claim that the policy was an unlawful bill-of-attainder, or law singling out a person or group, according to the News-Register.

In a statement, Morrisey said he ""respectfully disagree[s] with [the] ruling.""

LEADING 'BIOHACKER' REVEALS WHY RFK JR.'S HEALTH CRUSADE 'COULDN'T COME AT A BETTER TIME'

""[W]e believe this decision is premature and incorrectly decided. West Virginia will continue to defend its authority to protect the health and well-being of our citizens, especially children,"" he said.

""We are reviewing our legal options and will continue to press forward with our efforts to get harmful crap out of our food supply.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Kennedy's office for comment.

In her ruling, Berger wrote that while several food additives were specifically named in the law, its use of the term ""poisonous and injurious"" lacked ""criteria guiding its determination"" — an omission that could unfairly harm dye manufacturers.

""If a parent notifies [the West Virginia Department of Health] that they believe their child is sensitive to a color additive, is that a sufficient basis for a color additive to be deemed ‘poisonous and injurious,' or must the WVDOH conduct a further investigation? It is far from clear,"" Berger said, according to West Virginia MetroNews.

She also argued that since the law has not taken effect yet, it will not harm Charleston's ability to regulate public health and safety.

JUNK FOOD BANNED FROM SNAP BENEFITS IN 6 MORE STATES, A WIN FOR MAHA ADVOCATES

Republicans slammed the ruling, with Del. David Elliott Pritt of Thurmond faulting ""Big Food"" for challenging the law in the first place.

""Imagine being so addicted to profit that you would go to court to fight for your company's ability to willingly and knowingly continue to poison the kids of this state and nation because you refuse to alter your formulas,"" Pritt said, calling that viewpoint ""pretty evil.""

Some in the private sector have heeded Kennedy's warnings about the dangers of food additives, with Walmart planning to remove synthetic dyes and some artificial sweeteners and fats from its generic store brands in the U.S. by January, according to Fortune.

West Virginia House Health and Human Resources Committee Chairman Evan Worrell, R-Huntington, told MetroNews that the law was never about politics but protecting children from ""unnecessary chemical additives"" that are already banned in other countries.

During his Martinsburg appearance, Kennedy said that the increasing epidemic of social loneliness and ""dispossession,"" as well as the ""crises we have in mental health, in suicide, in ADD, ADHD"" are all linked.

""And [linked] particularly to the dyes. It's very clear the dyes that Governor Morrisey is banning … are linked in very strong studies to ADHD and to cancers.""

California, Virginia, Utah and Arizona have since sought to enact similar bans largely focused on school lunches.

Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., announced the death of his longtime aide and campaign manager on Christmas Day, a passing which ""shocked"" those who knew her during the holiday. 

The congressman and Senate candidate posted about the passing of his deputy chief of staff and campaign manager Tatum Dale on Thursday, noting the contributions she made not only to his current office, but to his mission to serve in statewide office. 

""For over 15 years, Tatum was the heart and soul of my team,"" Barr posted to X. ""With Tatum's leadership, my office favorably closed thousands of cases for Kentuckians—helping veterans, seniors, and families throughout our district. She fought to deliver funds to support dozens of community projects across our Commonwealth.""

Barr praised Dale's 15 years of service and dedication to Kentuckians, as political allies and rivals alike honored her legacy and expressed condolences. (Andy Barr via X)

""She loved helping people and was a servant of others, just as Christ envisioned us all to be. Maybe that's why her birth in heaven is a shared birthday with our Lord and Savior,"" Barr continued. ""While our hearts are broken, our team finds peace and hope knowing that Tatum is now home with Christ, resting comfortably in the arms of her Savior.""

Barr's run to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell, who announced his retirement in February, has been a battle between GOP candidates in the early stages of the race. 

Despite the competition, former Kentucky attorney general and gubernatorial candidate Daniel Cameron set aside their differences to weigh in on the passing of Dale. 

""Tatum Dale was a friend,"" Cameron posted on social media. ""She will be truly missed.""

""Makenze and I will be praying for her family and all of Team Barr,"" Cameron added.

Cameron's post was joined by several others who posted to social media in remembrance of the staffer.

GOP strategist and communications director for Montana Governor Greg Gianforte said he was shocked by the news and that ""Tatum was one of those hardworking people who seemed to be at every GOP event.""

Dale originally joined Barr's Washington, D.C., office in 2013 as a scheduler. She then returned to Kentucky, where she served as a district representative, field operations director, district deputy director, district director and deputy chief of staff.

She was born in Murray. Kentucky, and attended the University of Kentucky, according to Barr.

The cause of death is not currently clear.

""She made me a better Congressman, our staff better public servants, and we will all miss her forever,"" Barr posted. ""From Murray to Lexington and everywhere in the Commonwealth that she touched, we hope you will all join us in praying for Tatum's family and friends—and be forever inspired by her memory to serve others.""

John Bennett Ramsey details how new DNA technology could help solve JonBenet Ramsey's decades-long murder case, while calling on President Donald Trump to aid in the search for his daughter's killer. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital) 

It's been nearly 30 years since JonBenet Ramsey's haunting Christmastime murder — and there's renewed optimism that investigators could be closer than ever to solving it.

Boulder police, who have made little visible progress in the case over the years, said this month that the investigation ""remains a top priority.""

""Techniques and technology constantly evolve,"" Chief Stephen Redfearn, of the police department in Boulder, Colorado, said in a video statement. ""This is especially true with technology related to DNA testing.""

JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER, POLICE MEET FOR 'IMPORTANT' DISCUSSION OVER UNSOLVED CHILD PAGEANT STAR'S MURDER

This combined image shows JonBenet Ramsey before her 1996 murder as well as her father, John Ramsey, in a 2022 interview with Fox News Digital. The case remains unsolved, and he has advocated for years for authorities to conduct new DNA testing on evidence from the Dec. 26, 1996 homicide.

JonBenet's father, John Ramsey, met with Boulder police last January and said it was ""an important meeting."" He told Fox News Digital earlier this year that he urged the department to accept help from a private genetics lab with a track record of cracking other cold cases.

In a September interview with Fox News Digital, he implored President Donald Trump to get involved in the case.

""I told the DA that money should not be a restrictor here,"" he said during an interview at CrimeCon in Denver. ""I need to get Donald Trump on them. He'll stir things up one way or the other, but somehow we've got to get them to do that.""

He said he believes that ongoing advances in forensic genetic genealogy could be the key to solving the case.

""I am absolutely convinced that's the gold standard today,"" Ramsey said. ""So I've been pushing that pretty hard in terms of what I think ought to happen, and I don't know that they're doing it. I know they listen, but I don't know where they are mentally, in terms of making that happen.""

Ramsey echoed his sentiments in an interview this month with the Daily Mail, when he added that leaders at advanced DNA laboratories had informed him about how investigative genetic genealogy only requires a minuscule sample to yield results – while also insisting he believes there is a 70% chance his daughter's killer could be named within months. 

""IGG is a very powerful tool – just use it,"" Ramsey told the outlet. ""If they do it and they come up empty-handed, at least that way I can say thank you, you've tried everything you can so far.""

""It's that simple. But if you're just following up leads that come in, that's primitive.""

JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER ASKS TRUMP FOR HELP IN DAUGHTER'S UNSOLVED MURDER CASE

Ramsey also pointed to a list of potential suspects compiled by legendary homicide detective Lou Smit in the 1990s, with Smit theorizing his daughter's killer was someone who held a grudge against Ramsey, the outlet reported.

""Lou Smit's list [of potential persons of interest] is 700 people long,"" Ramsey told the Mail. ""There's so many leads – but using DNA makes this case solvable.""

Ramsey, who was previously a vocal critic of the Boulder Police Department over its handling of the case, is now praising investigators in light of the new developments. 

""It's encouraging,"" Ramsey told NewsNation. ""The key really in progress has been the addition of new leadership there. It was not very good for 25 to 26 years. And now, knowing Chief Redfearn from the outside, I've met with him three or four times. I'm impressed with him. I think he's sincere and honest.

""The problem with the old leadership was the old guard. These people that were in that police department had never investigated a murder.""

Although Boulder police in the past have been resistant to sacrificing what few samples they have left to new testing, Redfearn is a new leader in the department and may change course.

There are items in the case that have never been tested.

""The most important one was the garrote that was used to strangle my daughter,"" Ramsey told the Mail. 

""That had to have DNA evidence on it because it was a very complex knot, I'm told, and the assumption is that this creature couldn't have tied that wearing gloves – so that was a real piece we want to be either tested or re-tested.""

An autopsy revealed that JonBenet died of strangulation and a blow to the head, and DNA testing ruled out her family as suspects early on.

Boulder police say they've followed up on ""every lead"" they've received over the years, including interviewing more than 1,000 people and sorting through more than 21,000 tips.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Where ‘Stranger Things' Lost Itself","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/stranger-things-season-5-volume-2-review/685465/","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:05:00 GMT","

The Netflix drama's final season settles for “compulsively watchable.” Is that all we get?

This article contains spoilers through the penultimate episode of Stranger Things Season 5.

In the third season of Stranger Things, Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) learned a pivotal lesson as she stood inside Starcourt Mall, the then-new watering hole for the then-still-pubescent kids of Netflix's supernatural drama. Eleven, the show's telekinetic heroine, who grew up in a lab, became dazed by the number of clothing options at the Gap. “How do I know what I like?” she asked her friend Max (Sadie Sink). “You just try things on until you find something that feels like you,” Max replied. She was talking about fashion, but the advice applied just as well to the challenge of leaving adolescence behind: Coming of age is a process of trial and error, of working toward what seems true to you.

For years, Stranger Things was changing too. The first season of the '80s-set series—about underdogs triumphing over the terrors of another dimension called the Upside Down—became, after its 2016 premiere, one of Netflix's most successful original productions. Each subsequent installment ventured into the proverbial fitting room: The second season leaned further into gore and took tonally challenging swings, including an episode exploring Eleven's past to give its most enigmatic female character a voice. Season 3 explored how Reagan-era consumerism permeated its tweenagers' lifestyles just as they began dealing with romantic relationships. The fourth examined conspiracy theories through a particularly unnerving, mind-manipulating villain, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower); he targeted a grieving Max, testing the friends' bonds as they tried to protect her and understand her pain at the same time.

In the fifth and final season, however, Stranger Things has stalled. This time around, as the gang tries to stop Vecna from ending the world, the show seems uninterested in furthering anything other than its already complicated plot. The cast has expanded several times over, to the point that most scenes look like a crowd awkwardly playing human Tetris. The action sequences resemble previous set pieces, and much of the dialogue amounts to exposition. A new, faceless threat called “exotic matter” takes the crew's resident nerd, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), multiple scenes to explain. Across the three episodes of Volume 2, the last batch before the series finale, characters regularly express their confusion about what's going on. I found myself nodding along with them.

Read: Where Stranger Things loses its magic

For fans watching to see how Eleven and her friends save the day, much of this stagnation is probably bearable. The show remains compulsively watchable; each episode ends on a cliff-hanger. But Stranger Things initially had much more potential than mere bingeability. It pushed the boundaries of television as a medium, eschewing standard act breaks and run-time constraints while injecting cinematic visuals and frequent mood shifts. It also cemented Netflix as an early winner of the streaming wars by consistently breaking viewership records and generating cultural conversation. A litany of brands has capitalized on the show's popularity; it has multiple spin-offs (including a Tony-winning stage play); and its massive fandom has spawned conventions worldwide. Stranger Things had the opportunity and the budget to probe more daring themes and storytelling techniques. Instead, in its final hours, what was once an epic about growing pains and the end of childhood becomes algorithmic—as if settling for “compulsively watchable” is more than enough.

Of course, the franchise was built on recycling. From the beginning, Stranger Things has relied on '80s pop-culture touchstones, drawing heavily on the elements and aesthetics of Steven Spielberg's blockbusters and Stephen King's best sellers. In its earlier seasons, the pastiche tended to be poignant and the familiarity fresh: Characters drew on teen-movie tropes but weren't one-note, and the story arcs found novel angles to archetypal dynamics. (Think of the pint-size Dustin becoming best pals with Joe Keery's high schooler, Steve.)

Season 5, meanwhile, has noticeably flattened its ensemble, leaning on simplistic personality traits and pilfering from previous arcs. One of the show's new supporting players, Derek (Jake Connelly), is defined entirely by the two nicknames he has: “Dipshit Derek” and “Delightful Derek.” A tired love triangle reemerges. Much of the plot otherwise hinges on recovering Holly (Nell Fisher), the younger sister of Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Nancy (Natalia Dyer), from the Upside Down, a redux of the first season's story. One episode features three—three!—separate sequences of characters reconciling after encountering life-or-death scenarios. I was moved by the first; by the third, I felt only indifference.

Read: Stranger Things comes to an exhausting end

Glimmers of depth still show up amid this shallow approach. Will (Noah Schnapp) has long served as the show's most sensitive character, in part because he's secretly queer and crushing on Mike. Yet the scene where he comes out feels shoehorned in, arriving between Eleven learning of a harrowing plan and the crew storming a military base to enter the Upside Down. Will's speech is also packed with distracting reminders of the period backdrop. He insists to his friends that his sexuality doesn't affect their shared interests (among other things: malted milkshakes, renting videos, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Steve Martin). The conversation even ends with a group hug, referencing a key moment from the first season; the callback comes across more like fan service than earned sentimentality. Unlike the show's previous coming-out sequence—when Robin (Maya Hawke) gently coaxed Steve into understanding why she wasn't interested in him—Will's monologue clunkily interrupts the plot. What should have been an intimate reveal becomes another chance for Stranger Things to remix itself.

Sticking the landing is tough for any program, and harder still for a critically acclaimed, fandom-fueling genre saga. Game of Thrones certainly couldn't withstand the weight of people's expectations, let alone its overstuffed plot. Stranger Things hasn't dropped the ball as dramatically in its final season. It has, however, sacrificed nuance by refusing to challenge itself—or to deviate from the brand it has built in the cultural imagination. The series once proved that it could mature alongside its cast, blending its fantastical swings with grounded themes of friendship, grief, and that classic, youthful challenge of discovering who you are as the world changes around you. “The impeccable trick Stranger Things pulled off in its first season was how seamlessly it wove together the opposing qualities of comfort and fear,” my colleague Sophie Gilbert wrote in 2017. Eight years later, the show isn't making viewers nostalgic or giving them nightmares. It's just telling them what happens next.

It's not just okay for some things in life to be hard—it's essential.

The first aphorism I ever read was on the Quotable Quotes page of Reader's Digest, one of only two publications available in my house growing up. (The other was Time magazine.) I must have been about 8 years old when I came across the following sentence by Gerald Burrill, then the Episcopal bishop of Chicago: The difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.

At the time, I had no idea what an aphorism was. I was just 8. And I had no idea what Gerald Burrill's observation meant. But I knew there was something special about that sentence and the others I discovered on the Quotable Quotes page. I loved the puns, the paradoxes, the clever turns of phrase. And I was amazed at how such a compact statement could contain so much meaning.

As a kid, that aphorism stuck with me, even more so many years later when I finally understood what the bishop was getting at—that drudgery is a habit-forming enemy of joy, and that staying in a dead-end job leads nowhere. I've been obsessing about the respective depths of ruts and graves for more than 50 years now, wondering every morning whether I'm simply walking to work or slowly burying myself.

This is the awesome power of aphorisms, and it is what sets them apart from the trite sound bites of social-media influencers and the platitudes of self-help gurus: Aphorisms do not make you feel good about yourself. That Burrill saying doesn't offer an easy fix or a neat solution. In fact, it doesn't offer a fix or a solution at all. It is a great example of aphoristic intelligence at work. It makes us reconsider what we're doing, or not doing, with our lives.

Take the familiar saying “Love means never having to say you're sorry.” Apart from the inaccuracy—in my experience, love means having to say you're sorry on a regular basis—this is not an aphorism, because it's too easy. It induces complacency. It doesn't make you think. Much more confrontational, much more provocative, and therefore much more aphoristic is this, from the Polish writer Magdalena Samozwaniec: Love is that short period of time when someone else holds the same opinion of us as we do of ourselves.

Lila Shroff: The people outsourcing their thinking to AI

Or this wry insight from the Harlem Renaissance writer Jean Toomer: People mistake their limitations for high standards. Or the wisdom in this cynical definition by the legendary humorist Ambrose Bierce:

Misfortune n. The kind of fortune that never misses.

Or the rueful truth of this observation by the 17th-century French aristocrat François, Duc de La Rochefoucauld:

How comes it that our memories are good enough to retain even the minutest details of what has befallen us, but not to recollect how many times we have recounted them to the same person?

In some ways, aphorisms are perfectly suited to our era of short-form communication. They're concise, catchy, easily consumable. But so much of our discourse, online and IRL, is anti-aphoristic—rage bait, trash talk, knee-jerk toxicity, gauzy affirmations, hashtag claptrap. And now comes that upstart other AI, artificial intelligence, promising to reduce our cognitive loads to zero by proffering frictionless friendships and sycophantic agreeability, and doing all of our creative thinking for us.

Aphorisms are different. They are the antithesis of the half-baked hot take and nothing like the machine-made flattery that's now permeating so many informational environments. A platitude is a placebo for the mind; an aphorism is a wake-up call. Aphorisms provoke debate; they don't promote dogma. Though they're short, aphorisms spur considered reflection, not Pavlovian partisanship. At a time when polarization is so amped up, aphorisms can serve as psychological circuit breakers, interrupting our comfortable assumptions and prodding us to open our minds, unclench our fists, and think for ourselves.

Have an important life decision to make? Heed the artist Jenny Holzer's advice: Playing it safe can cause a lot of damage in the long run.

Holzer's line is a cautionary tale about how taking no chances in your career, your relationships—your life—can ultimately be hazardous. Or consider this idea, from the French poet, painter, filmmaker, and boxing promoter Jean Cocteau: Mirrors would do well to reflect a little more before sending back images.

Cocteau's aphorism is a quippy but bracing reminder to look at ourselves differently in order to see others differently.

Charlie Warzel: A tool that crushes creativity

Dealing with aging, impairment, and death; confronting adversity and struggling with relationships; working through creative blocks and personal challenges—all of these things are supposed to be hard! The difficulty is the point. Where artificial intelligence makes things that are supposed to be hard seem like they're easy, aphoristic intelligence accepts that things that are supposed to be hard are, in fact, really hard. Aphorisms gleefully increase our cognitive loads by immersing us even further in the difficulty and reminding us of what's at stake.

Many researchers studying AI warn that tools such as ChatGPT, if overused, may promote dependence on technology and potentially trigger what they call metacognitive laziness—delegating challenging tasks to external tools instead of learning and doing them ourselves. Equally if not more concerning is the risk of metaphysical laziness—delegating challenging existential tasks to external tools instead of learning and doing them ourselves.

If a chatbot is calling my elderly parent for me, offering me nothing but relentless affirmation and validation, and writing all my texts, emails, and thank-you notes (not to mention my poems, screenplays, and novels), then I have become a spectator to my own mental and emotional life. My critical and creative thinking withers, and the very nature of thinking itself shifts from introspection to outsourcing, from seeing the big picture to painting by numbers. As the Austrian aphorist Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach once put it: Those who were carried to a goal should not think they've reached it.

More want to leave the country than ever before. That's not the only way they're escaping.

Young American women, it seems, want out of America. A Gallup poll in November found that 40 percent of US women ages 15 to 44 say they would move abroad permanently if they had the opportunity. That percentage is up 10 times since 2014, and it is shared by neither other American demographic groups nor young women in other developed economies.

These women seem to want to leave at least in part because of Donald Trump. Gallup found that this trend began in summer 2016, shortly after Trump became the Republican nominee for president. It continued to climb during the Biden presidency, but there's a 25-point gap in the desire to leave between those who approve of the country's leadership and those who don't. That suggests that getting away from Trump plays at least some role in the appeal of the fantasy of expatriating.

But the desire to leave America can also express itself in ways that sound, at first glance, apolitical.

A recent BBC article about the trend spoke to a 31-year-old who decided to move from LA to Lisbon in 2021. “There's not a strong work-life balance in the US,” she said. “I wanted to live somewhere with a different pace, different cultures, and learn a new language.” In Portugal, she says, she feels “more like a whole person again.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Well, sure: Who hasn't wanted a better work-life balance than the one the US offers? Who hasn't wanted more than a minimal social safety net; a capitalist hustle culture; and a guiding belief that everything must be earned, including things like child care and health insurance, which in other countries are considered human rights that the government will take care of for you?

It's the child care, it seems, that is increasingly the last straw for women — the way it's becoming both more compulsory and more difficult to do.

In the same article, the BBC quoted a 34-year-old who moved from the US to Uruguay after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. “I have children, and I don't plan on having more, but the increasing governance of women's bodies terrified me,” she said. She added, “People don't realise how far behind the US is on maternal care, parental leave, and healthcare, until they leave the country.”

America is a hostile country if you're having children. Child care is so expensive that it can eat up the salary of at least one parent, which frequently leads to women leaving the workforce to take care of their children. Parental leave is rarely mandated: Press secretary Karoline Leavitt has made much of her decision to go back to work three days after giving birth. We have the highest maternal mortality rate of any high-income country, and we have for a long time. And if, for all these reasons and many others, you get pregnant and you find that you'd prefer not to be, it's become increasingly difficult to act on that choice in a safe and legal way.

So a person might wonder: Why not simply leave? Go somewhere that doesn't make you choose between work and children, somewhere you can leave behind both the stresses of capitalism and the pressures of family life. Somewhere you can have kids and also afford to spend time with them.

We often talk about the idea of fleeing America and its feeble social safety net as a liberating, progressive act, as though by leaving the US a person has the chance to become James Baldwin in Paris. But the idea of escaping the work-life balance trap has darker echoes in contemporary American pop culture. When I think of the fantasy of the ex-pat through this lens, it comes to look strikingly similar to the fantasy of the trad wife.

Trad wife influencers have become some of the most discussed figures on social media, hitting the viral sweet spot of content that is both aesthetically soothing and politically inflammatory.

Trad wives post online about their lives as stay-at-home wives and mothers. Most of the popular ones are thin and conventionally pretty, and they post videos of themselves making their children's favorite cereal from scratch, wearing full makeup in sun-drenched kitchens. More controversially, many creators who identify as trad wives promote the idea of living according to what they call Biblical principles, submitting to their husbands, and musing over how much better life is when women are out of the workplace.

Trad wife influencers, like the ex-pat fantasy, started trending up in 2016, when the prototype, Alena Kate Pettitt, published her first book, Ladies Like Us. In 2020, the popularity of these influencers crossed from niche to mainstream, as a population confined to their homes looked for ways to start romanticizing domestic drudgery.

The political stuff attracts attention, but it's the aesthetic of the domestic work made beautiful and aspirational that maintains an audience. A 2025 study from King's College London found that while only 7 percent of female viewers of trad wife videos approved of the idea of men as sole household decision makers, 79 percent were attracted to the “calm, relaxed lifestyle” trad wives appear to maintain — a life where you have enough time in the morning to whip up a scratch-made batch of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

Part of the trad wife fantasy is the idea that while you get to spend unlimited time with your children, you are simultaneously pursuing a lucrative career. The most successful of the trad wife influencers can make astonishing amounts of money, enough to pay for those expensive Aga stoves. This means that the trad wife of fantasy is a woman who has escaped the trap of trying to have both family and work in the US, just like the ex-pat of fantasy. But there's a key difference: For the trad wife, family and work are the same thing. Her family is her work, her art, her aesthetic labor.

Much has been written already about the escapism of the romantasy trend, and why it's grown as a way to deal with the horrors uncovered by Me Too and its long, vicious backlash. Romantasy, as Daniel Yadin wrote for the Drift, allows its presumed-female readers the fantasy of opting out of unpredictable and potentially violent human men and going for fairies or gentle blue aliens instead.

I have begun to read the fantasy of fleeing the US and the fantasy of the trad wife as versions of the same escapism, translated to motherhood. Both fantasies thwart the trap American capitalism lays for all its women. They are about finding a way to have a job and have a family, and not let either one ruin your life.

They are also among the most potent and widespread of the fantasies with which women are presented right now. The Christmas movie industrial complex must realize this, which is why the two happy endings possible for the discontented city career girls of the genre are to either move back to their hometowns or to become royalty in small but idyllic European countries.

It has been nine years now since the publication of the infamous Access Hollywood tape was followed swiftly by the election of Donald Trump. It has been seven years since the outrage over Trump's election powered the ferocious rage of Me Too. It has been three years since Trump's Supreme Court appointees led the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, taking away women's federally mandated legal right to an abortion. It has been two years since Trump was found criminally liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll, and one year since America went ahead and elected him for a second term anyway.

American women spent years in furious feminist activity. Women sued state governments and federal governments; they exposed their employers and sued them, too; they told their most private stories of harassment and abuse and discrimination, risking their careers and sometimes outright losing them.

All this they did — to, in the end, little apparent result. Now, as the backlash to Me Too continues to play out, the fantasies women are exploring are all about a kind of exhausted resignation — an opting out.

Why not imagine leaving the workforce? Why not imagine leaving home? There's no way to win, a woman might think, if we stay as we are. So if the fight is pointless, why not simply walk off the battlefield?

What Katie Wilson thinks national Democrats should learn from her win.

The election was divisive, pitting an established moderate against an upstart progressive in the large, Democratic city. For a while it seemed like it would be close, but in the end the progressive won definitively, powered by a relentless focus on affordability and adept use of short-form video.

Mamdani? New York? You must be confused — I'm talking about Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson.

The 43-year-old political neophyte, whose term begins next month, joined Today, Explained guest host Astead Herndon to talk about her social media strategy, why she thinks the popular new political strategy known as abundance is insufficient on its own, and the other most famous new mayor in America.Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Can we get a sense of how you arrived at this point, for those who are unfamiliar with you? How did this race come to be, and how did you win?

It's been a wild ride this year. One year ago today I had absolutely no thought of running for any elected office, let alone mayor.

I've spent the last 14 years as a community organizer and coalition builder running an organization called the Transit Riders Union, and I jumped into this race in March. In February, we had a special election on approving a funding source for our new social housing developers. So we had this social housing developer in Seattle, which was approved by voters last year. And this year, there was a citizens' initiative to enact a tax on wealthy corporations to fund that social housing developer. And our current mayor was kind of the face of the opposition campaign to that measure, which passed by a landslide in February.

So to me, that kind of showed that our current mayor was very out of touch with the challenges that Seattle residents are facing around affordability and specifically housing affordability. And I realized that there was a lane there.

I think coming into this year, everyone basically assumed that he was going to coast to reelection, because he'd been very successful at building the kind of institutional business-labor coalition that's considered necessary to win an election in Seattle.

And so I jumped in and quickly realized that it was part of a larger moment, with Mamdani in New York City and the affordability crisis that people around the country, and especially in high-cost cities like Seattle, are facing today.

You mentioned the Mamdani comparison, which I know has happened frequently. Should we see this as a kind of win for Democrats seeking ideological change, generational change — or is it both?

I think there's a lot of aspects to it. I think that the affordability crisis really is a big part of this. Coming out of the pandemic, we saw these high rates of inflation, and it's gotten to the point where in cities like Seattle, it's not just the lowest-income households that are feeling the pinch. People who have decent jobs, who consider themselves to be middle-class, are just looking around and saying, “I don't know how much longer I can hold on in this city.”

Housing costs, child care costs, grocery costs, restaurant costs — everything is so expensive. And so I think that's a really important part of the moment that we're in.

There's also local factors, and here in Seattle we have an escalating homelessness crisis. Our rates of unsheltered homelessness are just off the charts, even compared to our peer cities. And so that was also a factor here.

And then obviously there's kind of a generational aspect to this, and there's to some extent a reaction against Trump's election. This is maybe related to the generational shift, where people are looking for a new, bolder kind of leadership that can meet the moment. There's a certain kind of transactional establishment-Democratic Party politics that obviously failed to meet the moment last year that people are kind of reacting against, and looking for something new.

You mentioned that you think this doesn't happen without the kind of focus that you and some others have put on the question of affordability. I wanted to go back to your history in community organizing. It seems as if you've been living with these issues for a long time. 

How will we define the affordability issue in general? Are we talking housing costs, health care costs? What do you think is under the umbrella that is really pinching people right now?

It's really all of the above, but I think in cities like Seattle, housing is really at the core, and it's also at the core in terms of the levers that the government can pull to make things better.

I moved to Seattle over 20 years ago, and my husband and I rode the Amtrak with our stuff in boxes and found an apartment, or just a room in someone's basement, that we could rent for $400 a month and got part-time jobs, and [we] kind of found our feet.

That kind of story is just not possible today. It's this kind of pressure-cooker environment.

Yeah, I was thinking, $400. Great!

I mean, this was back in 2004, but there's this sense of just immense pressure where you're just hustling 24/7 just to pay your basic bills. And I think that the housing crisis is really kind of at the core of that. Again, in cities like Seattle where housing costs have risen much faster than inflation, much faster than wages.

I want to also ask about how you translate that into a campaign: Activating people as a “coalition of renters” — a term I've heard people use — and bringing folks to the ballot box is a little bit of a different thing. 

One of the things we noticed was a campaign ad that you ran about a high cost of pizza. Can you tell me how you took your focus as a community organizer and translated it into the mayoral race? And specifically about that ad?The pizza ad, I'll say — it is funny because I'm totally not a social media person in my personal life at all. And so then having to become a social media person and be in videos was a little bit of a thing for me, but I did it and with some success …We're all YouTubers now! Get used to it.

I think it's so important — and this is really something that I hope to carry into the mayor's office — that we're able to really have an honest conversation with the public where we're educating people about policy. And it's not just about slogans. It's actually about, okay: Why is the cost of pizza so high? How is this related to housing costs? And we have to treat voters like adults and believe that they can actually understand things, and you need to make things simple enough that you can explain it in a few-minute video. But you can actually communicate quite a lot in a few-minute video.

I really think that that kind of public education and having a real conversation with the public about the challenges that we're facing and why they exist and what the solutions are — I think that's super important, and I think that that's something that I really want to continue for the mayor's office.

We talked to Ezra Klein about his book Abundance, and it made an argument that rings true to some of our conversation. One of its core points is that blue cities have not delivered for their constituents, and that they prioritize things like process or red tape over the kind of delivering that you're talking about. 

I wanted to know what you thought of that argument. He specifically makes one point in relation to housing, saying how people need to embrace the supply side, or the role of real-estate markets, to build new housing supply. 

Is that a transition that you had to come to, or was that something that was natural to you to see? 

I feel like some of the book's themes are not at all new in Seattle for some years. We've had an urbanist left in Seattle that's basically on board with the abundance agenda when it comes to housing, that really recognizes the role that zoning and land use laws have played in slowing housing production. And that [group] is 100 percent there on changing those laws and on permit reform. That's something that has been in the air here for some time.

I do think that there are some limitations in the kind of desire to have this narrative around our problems, [that they exist] because well-meaning liberals, progressives put all these rules and regulations in place. I think there's a lot of other big factors too that are also important.

I would love to hear you draw out what you think are some of the things that go beyond that, and the ways you try to shape your politics around other forces too.

They begin the book with this description of life in 2050 once the abundance agenda has been achieved. And it sounds great. And one of the things that they mentioned is that we have a lot more leisure time now. The work week has been shortened because productivity is so much higher. And when I got to that, I just immediately began thinking of the level of social upheaval and frankly, class struggle that would have to take place in the next quarter-century in order for major productivity gains to actually result in a shorter work week.

So I think there's just a power analysis maybe that is a little bit missing from their narrative, which is fine if they're just aiming to be like, “Here are a few things that we should do.” But if they're pitching it as more of a story that explains everything, then I think that there's definitely some things that are missing.

Why do you think national Democrats were at such distance from their own voters in the last year, and what do you think they should take from campaigns like yours?

I think it goes back to a lot of the things that we've been talking about. To use this mayoral election as that capsule, the incumbent mayor had kind of built all the interest groups around him who were going to support his reelection, but he didn't realize that his constituents were worried about paying the rent or paying for their child care, and he wasn't speaking to that effectively.

So I really think it's about really just understanding where people are at and speaking in a way that resonates with them, and also painting a picture of a future that we want and that we can build together. And there needs to be this sense that you actually believe in it.

This is not just like, message-tested, focus group-tested, consultant speak, or whatever, that you're putting out into the world, but it's actually something that you believe in and that you feel yourself. People want that genuineness and that sense of integrity and vision, and that's what wins. That's something you can't buy.

Bitcoin's 30% slide from its all-time high is creating conditions financial advisers say are likely driving more tax-loss harvesting in digital assets than in previous years.

While the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value is down 5% year-to-date, the equity benchmark S&P 500 has gained roughly 18% in the same time period. This divergence gives investors holding both assets a clear incentive: sell underwater cryptocurrency positions to offset their stock gains before Dec. 31, especially those who bought the digital asset near its October peak.

Stock futures are little changed after the Christmas holiday break this morning, but the three major averages are still headed for weekly gains.

Here's what to know:

Nvidia agreed to buy assets from chip startup Groq for $20 billion in cash, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday.

In addition to the nonexclusive licensing deal, Groq's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra and other senior leaders ""will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,"" the startup said in a blog post.

The deal is Nvidia's largest purchase ever by a large margin. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition before this one came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. 

That embarrassing Gmail address from high school? You might be able to change it soon.

According to an update on Google's account help page, account holders can now replace their existing @gmail.com address and still retain all data and services.

However, as CNBC's Dylan Butts reports, the change only appears in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the new capability may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.

Waymo paused its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday ahead of expected heavy rain in the area, the Alphabet-owned company said in its self-driving ride-hailing app.

The pause came days after the company said it will update its fleet to better perform during power outages. On Dec. 20, Waymo paused service during a blackout in San Francisco that caused some of its autonomous vehicles to stop in mid-traffic, contributing to or causing gridlock.

Whether it's boots, jackets or bags, tariffs and supply chain bottlenecks are driving up prices of leather goods for retailers and consumers alike.

Tapestry, which owns handbag giants Coach and Kate Spade, has already seen higher costs. Company executives told investors in August that tariff-related expenses could total $160 million and eat into profits.

The Yale Budget Lab estimates that prices for leather goods will stay nearly 22% higher for at least the next one to two years in part because of heavy tariff exposure, particularly across China, Vietnam, Italy and India.

Here are some stories we recommend making time for this weekend.

On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new ""Trump-class"" battleship, declaring it would be ""the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built."" He hailed the ships as ""some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,"" promising they would ""help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.""

But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.

While labeling the new surface combatants as ""battleships"" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.

Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that ""there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail."" 

He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.

""A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,"" Cancian said.

Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as ""a prestige project more than anything else."" 

He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.

""Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,"" Loo said. 

He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a ""bomb magnet.""

""The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,"" Loo said.

Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.

The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.

Clark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. ""This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.""

Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.

Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.

According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new ""golden fleet"" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.

Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.

However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. 

""This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,"" he wrote.

Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.

Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.

The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.

Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.

The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.

RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. ""At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.""

A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.

Waves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, because of mudslides.

Atmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.

The system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.

Roads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors. 

""It's really a crazy Christmas,"" said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.

Lopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.

""We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,"" he said. 

Davey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather's house.

""I wanted to help them out because I wasn't confident that they were going to live,"" Schneider said Thursday. ""Fortunately, they all lived. They're all okay — just a little bit scared.""

Arlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.

""It could be a whole lot worse,"" she said. ""We're here talking.""

With more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.

""We're ready,"" he said. ""It's all hands on deck at this point.""

A falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.

Areas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. 

More wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created ""near white-out conditions"" and made mountain pass travel treacherous. 

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.

The state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.

In this article

Google just unveiled a Christmas gift for Gmail users who are still stuck with their embarrassing email addresses from high school.

In a long-requested change, account holders can now replace their existing @gmail.com address with a new one while retaining all data and services, according to an update to Google's account help page. 

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.

The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.

The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses ""usually cannot be changed."" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. 

Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. 

Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.

Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.

However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. 

Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.

Silver breached the $75 mark for the first time on Friday, ‍while gold and platinum ‍hit record highs, buoyed by ‍expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and geopolitical tensions that fueled safe-haven demand.

Spot silver jumped 4.5% to $75.20 per ounce, after hitting ‌an ‌all-time high of $75.62, marking a 161% year-to-date surge driven ​by supply deficits, its designation as a U.S. critical mineral, and strong investment inflows.

Spot gold was up 1.1% at $4,526.92 per ounce, after hitting a record $4,533.14 earlier. U.S. gold futures for February delivery added 1.3% to $4,559.

""Expectations ⁠for further Fed easing in 2026, a weak dollar and heightened geopolitical tensions are driving volatility in thin markets. While there is some risk of profit-taking before the year-end, the trend remains strong,"" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals.

Markets are anticipating two rate cuts in 2026, with the first likely around mid-year amid speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump could name a dovish Fed chair, reinforcing expectations for a more accommodative monetary stance.

The U.S. dollar index was on track for a weekly decline, enhancing the appeal of dollar-priced gold for overseas buyers.

On the geopolitical front, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria, Trump said on Thursday.

""$77/oz and then $80 ‍in silver is within reach by year-end. For gold, the next objective is $4,686.81, ‌with $5,000 likely in the first half of next year,"" Grant added.

Gold ⁠remains poised for its strongest annual gain since 1979, underpinned by Fed policy easing, central bank purchases, ETF inflows, and ongoing de-dollarization trends.

On ‍the physical demand side, gold discounts in India widened to their highest in more than six months this week as a relentless price rally curbed retail buying, while discounts in China narrowed sharply from last week's five-year highs.

Elsewhere, spot platinum rose 8.7% to $2,411.46 per ounce, having earlier hit a record high of $2,448.25, ⁠while palladium climbed nearly 10% to $1,850.76.

The U.S. auto safety regulator said on Wednesday it has opened a defect investigation into Tesla Model 3 compact sedans over concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable in an emergency.

The Office of Defects Investigation said the probe covers an estimated 179,071 model year 2022 vehicles.

The investigation was opened on Dec. 23 after the agency received a defect petition alleging that the vehicles' mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled and not intuitive to locate during emergencies.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company's vehicles rely primarily on electronic door latches, which open via buttons rather than traditional mechanical handles.

While Tesla includes a manual door release for use in emergencies or power failures, experts have long argued that the mechanical releases are not consistently visible, labeled or intuitive, particularly for rear-seat passengers.

Last month, Tesla was sued over a fiery Wisconsin crash that killed all five occupants of a Model S, who were allegedly trapped inside because of a design flaw that prevented them from opening the luxury sedan's doors.

The automaker has also been sued by families of two college students killed in a Cybertruck crash November last year in a San Francisco suburb, after allegedly being locked in the burning vehicle because of its door handle design.

The opening of a defect petition does not mean a recall will be issued, but it marks the first step in a regulatory review process that could lead to further action if safety-related defects are confirmed.

The auto regulator, NHTSA, said in September it had opened a preliminary evaluation into about 174,290 Model Y cars over reports of electronic door handles becoming inoperative.

The United States carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government, President Donald Trump and the U.S. military said on Thursday, claiming the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

""Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

The U.S. military's Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the British Broadcasting Corp the strike was a ""joint operation"" targeting ""terrorists"", and it ""has nothing to do with a particular religion"".

Without naming ISIS specifically, Tuggar said the operation had been planned ""for quite some time"" and had used intelligence information provided by the Nigerian side. He did not rule out further strikes, adding that this depended on ""decisions to be taken by the leadership of the two countries"".

The strike comes after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an ""existential threat"" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Reuters reported on Monday the U.S. had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.

Nigeria's foreign ministry said the strike was carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the United States, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

""This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,"" the ministry said in a post on X.

A video posted by the Pentagon showed at least one projectile launched from a warship. A U.S. defense official said the strike targeted multiple militants at known ISIS camps.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth thanked the Nigerian government on X for its support and cooperation and added: ""More to come...""

Nigeria's government has said armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and U.S. claims that Christians face persecution do not represent the complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But it has agreed to work with the U.S. to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south.

Police said earlier on Thursday a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people and injured 35 others at a mosque in Nigeria's northeast, another region troubled by Islamist insurgents.

In a Christmas message posted on X earlier, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu called for peace in his country, ""especially between individuals of differing religious beliefs.""

He also said: ""I stand committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect Christians, Muslims, and all Nigerians from violence.""

Trump issued his statement on the strike on Christmas Day while he was at his Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago Club, where he has been spending the holiday. He had no public events during the day and was last seen by the reporters traveling with him on Wednesday night.

The U.S. military last week launched separate large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria, after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected ISIS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.

The internet was becoming mainstream in the late 90s, but Miro Mitev was head-down exploring something that wouldn't become popular for decades: AI.

Now an asset manager, Mitev was an early adopter of AI in finance after discovering the capabilities of neural networks in 1997 while studying at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.

He told CNBC he saw the potential of neural networks for financial forecasts. ""I fell in love with these kinds of possibilities,"" he said.

Mitev spent his 25-year career forecasting for banks and tech firms like Siemens. He founded SmartWealth Asset Management, whose decisions are made entirely by a network of AI systems. Its latest fund, IVAC, is eyeing $2 billion in assets under management and has an annualized returns target of 14-15%.

Despite no human involvement in the AI's decisions, Mitev said that ""humans are the most important part of the equation"" as they're the ones selecting training data, inputting variables, building the parameters, and consistently tweaking the model. 

Once a model is created, ""it's very dangerous to start intervening,"" Mitev said. Indeed, trusting the model is his golden rule, he added.

Instead, humans should ensure that there are no errors in the data or calculations, and introduce new data so that the model is up to date.

""The worst is to overrule the results, and this is what happens very often,"" Mitev said, adding that people ""don't trust"" AI at first. ""Even if we, as humans, don't see the result now, if we look back after two months, three months, we say, 'Oh, actually, we were wrong,'"" he added.

The forces driving the market — optimism, pessimism, speculation — are very human. Even the European Central Bank has warned that the current AI bull run may be driven not by detailed technical analysis but by fear-of-missing-out. 

Mitev said that taking the emotion out of investing proves better results; SmartWealth Asset Management has seen gains of 407.63% across a 10-year period to Nov. 1 2025, compared with an industry benchmark of 145.34% over the same period, according to a graph a representative for the firm shared with CNBC. 

It's ""not possible"" to know what will happen in one year, Mitev said, but he can see up to one month ahead with his model. ""Evaluating this information and making informed decisions based on this consistently proves to be providing better results than the human.""

The constant monitoring and introduction of new data are important points, given that AI systems do ""hallucinate"": generating false information. Mitev said models' mistakes were down to ""overfitting,"" data issues or model misspecification.

Overfitting is where the algorithm pays too much attention to what Mitev called ""noise."" He said this was data ""which is not meaningful"" because it doesn't reveal a true cause-and-effect relationship with stock performance. 

Rigorous design, validation, and live environment testing, serve as an antidote to this, Mitev added. It means that, although his fund strategy is executed entirely by a series of algorithms, humans still play a crucial role in making sure it's effective.

""It's actually a process that evolves over years ... and this is the reason why in-house development of these kind of technologies is very important,"" he added – especially for anyone looking to differentiate their AI play.

Oops, something went wrong

Along with , the price has also shown 1.4% gains on December 26 and is eyeing a breakout past $3,000 resistance. Market experts believe that sailing past this would open the gates for its rally to the all-time highs of $4,954. Moreover, the whale accumulation for ETH has accelerated over the past month.

For the past few days, the Ethereum price has been consolidating under $3,000 after losing the crucial support. Earlier today, ETH bounced back from the $2,900 lows as volatility resumed amid $3.8 billion in ETH options expiring.

Crypto analyst Ted Pillows said Ethereum attempted to break above the $3,000 level but failed to hold the move. He noted that unless ETH successfully reclaims this zone, the price could revisit the $2,800 support level in the near term.

Furthermore, a whale wallet has been aggressively accumulating ETH in large quantities. On Dec. 25, a large investor purchased approximately $16.09 million worth of Ethereum (ETH), as reported by crypto analyst Ted Pillows.

According to the analyst, the same whale has accumulated a total of $130.7 million in ETH over the past three weeks. This clearly shows sustained large-scale buying interest despite recent market volatility.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that whale investors have purchased approximately 220,000 Ethereum (ETH) over the past week, representing an investment of roughly $660 million.

Another crypto analyst, Javon Marks, said Ethereum price is showing a hidden bullish divergence similar to the setup seen in 2023. This suggests the asset may be on the verge of a strong upside move. According to Marks, such a breakout could push ETH beyond its previous all-time high near $4,954.

He added that a successful move to that level would open the door for a potential rally toward the $8,500 range.

$3.8 billion of spot Ethereum options expired on Dec. 26, stirring market volatility. The max pain point for ETH currently sits at $3,000.

On the other hand, spot Ethereum ETF outflows have continued throughout this week. 2026 will be crucial for the Ethereum price as the blockchain undergoes two major network upgrades.

The roadmap includes the Glamsterdam fork, expected in mid-2026, followed by the Hegota fork later in the year.

$27B crypto options expired on Deribit, with BTC near $88K and ETH $2,950, signaling potential market volatility and key resistance levels ahead.

Bitcoin eyes $100K if $90K breaks, ETH struggles below $3K, while XRP and SOL show mixed signals after major options expiry.

Around $27 billion worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum options expired today on Deribit, one of the world's largest crypto options exchanges. Bitcoin is trading near $88,000, while Ethereum is hovering close to $2,950, as traders brace for possible volatility. 

With such a large amount of contracts settling at once, the expiry could have a massive impact on the crypto market

Bitcoin accounts for the biggest share of today's expiry, with over $23.6 billion in BTC options rolling off. Data from Deribit shows 268,000 option contracts settled at the same time, clearing a major amount of risk from the market in a single session.

Despite the size of the expiry, trader positioning still leans positive. The put-to-call ratio stands at 0.38, which means more traders were betting on higher prices than lower ones. 

The “max pain” level, where most option holders would see losses, was near $96,000. This level often acts like a price magnet around expiry, even if briefly.

Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has remained stuck in a tight range, repeatedly testing both sides. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that sellers have failed to push BTC below $86.5K, showing strong buyer support. 

However, every move above $90K has been rejected, highlighting heavy selling pressure at that level.

Analysts say $90,000 is the key barrier. A clear breakout above it, backed by strong volume, could restore bullish momentum and open the path toward the $100,000 mark.

Ethereum is also under the spotlight, with nearly $4 billion in ETH options expiring. Although ETH has seen small price gains, traders remain cautious rather than confident. The max pain level sits near $3,100, keeping pressure on the price.

Ethereum has once again failed to hold above the key $3,000 level, which is worrying traders. Crypto analyst Ted noted that unless ETH clearly moves back above $3,000, the risk of another drop stays high.

If the price falls below $2,800, selling pressure could increase quickly. Below that, the next strong support lies around $2,600, $2,500, where buyers stepped in during earlier sell-offs.

XRP options show continued pressure, with traders closely watching the $1.80 support level. A break below this could lead to further downside.

Solana shows a more balanced picture. Options data remains neutral, and SOL has already seen a small recovery around $123. 

As 2026 approaches, this option's expiry could act as an important turning point for the token.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

When options expire, contracts settle, removing market risk and often causing short-term price volatility in BTC and ETH.

A massive expiry clears a large amount of market risk at once, which can increase short-term volatility. The “max pain” price often acts as a temporary magnet, but the overall trend depends on broader market sentiment.

Large expiries can influence market sentiment, affecting XRP support at $1.80 and Solana's price recovery around $123.

Smart contracts are programs that run on blockchains and automatically carry out actions when conditions are met. Think of them as “digital agreements” that execute themselves without needing banks, brokers, or lawyers. They are reshaping industries from finance to supply chains and are forecast to become a multi-billion-dollar market in the coming decade. For anyone who wants to explore how this technology is built and used, blockchain technology courses are a practical way to start.

At their core, smart contracts are just code. They use “if/when … then …” logic. For example, if money arrives in an account, then release the asset to the buyer. Unlike a paper contract, no one needs to enforce it manually. The blockchain ensures it happens.

Ethereum made Smart contracts popular by letting developers write them in languages like Solidity. Today, they're used across multiple platforms, including Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. The global smart contracts market was valued at about USD 2.72 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to USD 24.67 billion by 2034, showing just how rapidly adoption is rising.

The process is straightforward but powerful:

A key component is the use of oracles. These are data providers that feed external information—like weather data or price feeds—into the blockchain so contracts can respond to real-world events.

Smart contracts are not limited to one sector. They're shaping many industries:

These practical uses explain why businesses are exploring more applications each year. For professionals interested in analytics in this space, a Data Science Certification can provide skills to connect blockchain with big data and machine learning.

Despite their promise, smart contracts are not without challenges:

The field is evolving quickly. A few important developments stand out in 2025:

The shift toward smart contracts is about more than technology. It's about reducing friction, lowering costs, and increasing trust in digital systems. They automate tasks that once required lengthy processes and intermediaries.

For professionals aiming to lead in this fast-moving space, learning how to align technology with business is crucial. That's where the Marketing and Business Certification can help. It focuses on how innovations like smart contracts can drive business growth and customer engagement.

Smart contracts are becoming the backbone of digital transactions. They are fast, efficient, and capable of reshaping entire industries. While risks and legal uncertainties remain, innovation is solving many of these issues through AI, interoperability, and improved security.

By understanding how smart contracts work and where they fit, you'll be better prepared to use them, build with them, or even create new opportunities around them.

Pudgy Penguins launched as an NFT project in 2021 and was acquired by entrepreneur Luca Netz in April 2022 for $2.5 million in Ethereum. 

The Pudgy Penguins project showcased its animated penguin characters on the Las Vegas Sphere's exterior screens during Christmas week. The display went live on Christmas Eve across the venue's high-resolution LED panels, which are visible along the Las Vegas Strip.

Pudgy Penguins launched as an NFT project in 2021 and was acquired by entrepreneur Luca Netz in April 2022 for $2.5 million in Ethereum. Netz then pivoted the business model beyond digital collectibles into physical toy production as NFT revenue declined across the market.

The company now generates millions in toy sales, though Netz acknowledged that margins remain thin in the consumer products space. What started as a strategy to extend the operating runway has become a core revenue stream, positioning the project to close 2025 with an estimated $50 million in total revenue.

Pudgy Penguins has built a social media presence of approximately 2 million followers on Instagram, where the company focuses its significant marketing efforts. The physical product expansion has helped insulate the project from broader NFT market weakness.

The NFT sector faced substantial headwinds throughout 2025, with first-quarter transaction volumes dropping 63% year-over-year to $1.5 billion from $4.1 billion in the same 2024 period. March sales plunged 76% to $373 million compared to $1.6 billion a year earlier, though select collections including Pudgy Penguins showed relative stability.

Total NFT market capitalization reportedly fell to approximately $2.5 billion in December, marking the lowest level of 2025. Despite widespread declines, certain segments found traction during the year.

Real-world collectible-backed NFTs emerged as an area of strength, particularly trading cards linked to physical assets. Platform Courtyard.io connects authenticated Pokémon cards to on-chain tokens that can be traded or redeemed for the underlying physical item.

CryptoSlam data shows Courtyard processed over 230,000 transactions and generated roughly $13.9 million in sales during the past 30 days. Courtyard CEO Nicolas le Jeune emphasized the use of blockchain as a tool rather than the primary value proposition, noting that NFTs provide improved ownership experience for assets that derive value from their physical backing.

Law enforcement agencies are being warned to expect more cases involving stablecoins and other digital assets, according to a recent FinTRAC report.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Canada is playing catch-up with the United States on the regulation of stablecoins after warnings from the tech industry that our country risks missing out on the latest crypto craze. 

Stablecoins are a type of digital money whose value is tied to national currency or other financial assets to maintain steady prices. 

The proposed Stablecoin Act provides a regulatory framework for stablecoins pegged to the Canadian dollar that will be overseen by the Bank of Canada.

Stablecoins are being envisioned as an alternate form of payment. This is in contrast to other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, which are more akin to speculative investments. 

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem is emphasizing the importance of stablecoins having sturdy purchasing power.

Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say

BoC's Macklem lays out high-level vision for stablecoin regulation

“We want stablecoins to be good money, like bank notes or money on deposit at banks. That requires a few critical elements,” Mr. Macklem said during his year-end speech in Montreal.

“A stablecoin must be pegged at a one-to-one ratio to a central bank currency and be backed by high-quality liquid assets so that it can always be converted to cash at par.” 

Unfortunately, those are the same attributes that make stablecoins attractive to financial criminals such as money launderers, terrorist financiers and sanctions evaders. 

That's why it is not enough for Canada to focus on ensuring that stablecoins function like “good money.” It must also be able to detect when they're being used to wash illicit funds.

Indeed, law enforcement agencies are being warned to expect more cases involving stablecoins and other digital assets, according to a financial intelligence report by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FinTRAC.

The confidential document – titled “Trends in Large Virtual Currency Transaction Reports and Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Implications” – was prepared by the federal anti-money-laundering watchdog in March, 2024.

The redacted document was obtained by Ottawa-based researcher Ken Rubin through a request made under the Access to Information Act, and then shared with The Globe and Mail.

“The rapid rise of stablecoins has raised concerns about their role in financial crime,” the FinTRAC report states.

Rita Trichur: Financial crime loopholes in U.S. stablecoin law offer a cautionary tale for Canada

Ryan Wedding organization allegedly used cryptocurrency to launder drug money

It notes that the Financial Action Task Force, a global body that sets standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has flagged several characteristics of stablecoins that create such risks. 

“These include: anonymity through the use of unhosted wallets, global reach, price stability, which allows actors to layer the proceeds of crime derived from more volatile virtual assets such as Bitcoin or Ether,” the FinTRAC report says.

(As an aside, the task force is currently reviewing Canada's anti-money-laundering regime. A final report is expected next June.)

FinTRAC's findings are based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of Large Virtual Currency Transaction Reports. 

Regulated businesses must submit LVCTRs to FinTRAC when they receive virtual currency with a value equivalent to $10,000 or more in a single transaction, or in two or more transactions within 24 hours. (Although LVCTRs do not necessarily prove suspicious activity, it is widely recognized that digital currency transactions are being increasingly exploited by criminals.)

FinTRAC's analysis is based on 148,358 LVCTRs received from January, 2022, to December, 2023. Those reports encompassed 953,295 virtual currency transactions totalling $14.7-billion from 118 businesses, according to the analysis. 

USDT, a stablecoin issued by Tether that is pegged to the U.S. dollar, accounted for the largest share of total transaction value, amounting to $5.2-billion over the roughly two years.

Another stablecoin tied to the U.S. greenback, issued by Circle and known as USD Coin or USDC, generated the third-largest total transaction value during that same period – roughly $2.1-billion, according to the FinTRAC report. 

That burst of activity means stablecoins are “increasingly prominent in money laundering cases,” even if many of those digital assets have features to “reverse transactions” and seize funds tainted by crime.

A U.S. indictment alleging that former Canadian Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding and his accomplices made extensive use of cryptocurrencies, including the stablecoin Tether, to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking is a timely reminder of how suspected criminals could abuse digital currencies. 

Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act was updated in 2020 to ensure money-services businesses that deal in virtual currencies register with FinTRAC. 

Even so, Canada must take care not to replicate any of the glaring loopholes present in the U.S. stablecoin law. 

That means ensuring that foreign stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, cannot participate in any centralized or decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer transfers without robust regulatory oversight. 

Canada must also make certain that secondary-market participants, including digital asset exchanges, custodians and brokers, all have reporting obligations under the updated act. 

The Carney government should also offer assurances that anonymizing technologies, such as mixers and other intermediaries that obscure funding sources, are captured by existing and proposed legislation.

Canada should consider bolstering client due diligence for stablecoin issuers. 

After all, legitimate stablecoin advocates aren't the only ones anticipating all the money to be made – old-fashioned fiat currency, that is – once final rules are in place.

Financial criminals are salivating about potential profits, too.

The cobblestone streets of Lugano, Switzerland are better known for their Mediterranean-style piazzas and high-end boutiques than for radical economic shifts. But look closer at storefronts along Via Nassa, and the familiar “Visa” and “Mastercard” stickers have a new neighbor: a bright yellow “Plan ₿” decal.

In this lakeside enclave, Bitcoin is no longer just a digital asset tucked away in a cold wallet. It is a functional currency used to buy everything from a morning espresso to a Big Mac and even to settle municipal tax bills.

The vision behind a decentralized Plan ₿

Launched in 2022 as a partnership between the City of Lugano and Tether, Plan ₿ was not designed as a marketing stunt. It was conceived as a structural overhaul of the city's financial rails.

While countries such as El Salvador have pursued top-down Bitcoin mandates, Lugano's approach is quintessentially Swiss: voluntary, highly organized and focused on reducing merchant friction.

The ecosystem rests on three pillars: Bitcoin BTCUSD for sovereign value, Tether's USDt USDTUSD for price stability in larger commerce and the LVGA token, a local stablecoin that powers a city-wide loyalty program.

The merchant experience and organic growth

For local shopkeepers, the transition to crypto is driven less by ideology and more by the bottom line. Traditional credit card processors in Switzerland can charge merchants upward of 3% per transaction. By contrast, Bitcoin payments made via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol that enables instant, low-fee transactions, often cost less than 1%.

One local shop owner describes the shift as an organic process. It's “like a tree growing,” he told the BBC. “This tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.” While crypto payments currently account for only a small share of his daily sales, the infrastructure is already in place, waiting for the “mass” in mass adoption.

To bridge the gap, the city distributed free smart POS terminals, provided by GoCrypto, to more than 350 merchants. These devices handle the technical heavy lifting. The merchant enters the price in Swiss francs (CHF), the customer scans a QR code, and the merchant can choose to receive the settlement instantly in CHF to avoid volatility or retain the crypto.

The circular economy

Lugano's operational backbone is the MyLugano app. This is where the “how-to” of daily life in the city becomes tangible.

When users pay with crypto at participating local shops, they receive up to 10% cashback in LVGA tokens.

These tokens are not just digital points. They are pegged to the Swiss franc and accepted for city services, public parking and even childcare fees.

This creates a self-sustaining loop. A tourist might pay for a luxury watch in USDT, earn LVGA cashback and then use that “digital change” to pay for a boat ride across Lake Lugano. By keeping value within these digital rails, the city reduces reliance on certain traditional banking fee structures, keeping more transaction value within the local ecosystem.

Governance on the blockchain through taxes and fines

Perhaps the most radical “how-to” in Lugano is how residents interact with the state. Lugano is one of the few places in the world where all municipal invoices, from property taxes to parking tickets, can be paid using Bitcoin or Tether. 

The process is remarkably mundane, which is exactly the point. An invoice arrives with a standard Swiss QR code. The resident scans it with a wallet, confirms the exchange rate, which is locked in for a short window to prevent slippage, and the debt is settled. The city's administration describes this as a “complete automation” of financial flows, reducing the administrative burden on the local treasury.

Institutional infrastructure and the 2025 milestone

The momentum behind Plan ₿ reached a new peak in October 2025 during the fourth annual Plan ₿ Forum. The event drew a record 4,000 participants from 64 countries, representing a 140% increase in attendance since the project's inception. This growth is not merely about tourism; it reflects a deepening level of institutional interest.

In 2025, Lugano further consolidated its position by issuing its fifth digital bond on SDX, the SIX Digital Exchange, demonstrating that blockchain infrastructure extends beyond retail payments to sophisticated municipal debt markets.

The city has also become a magnet for brain gain, attracting more than 110 crypto-related startups that have relocated to the region, drawn by the regulatory clarity provided under Switzerland's FINMA framework.

The skeptical manager's perspective on risk

However, any professional analysis must account for friction. Not everyone in Lugano is a believer. Local critics, including university students and some academics, remain wary. The primary concern is not the technology itself, but custodial risk.

In Switzerland, traditional bank deposits are protected by state-backed guarantees. Crypto assets held in digital wallets, however, do not benefit from the same protections. “If the platform where my digital wallet is recorded fails or goes bankrupt, my cryptocurrencies disappear,” warns Sergio Rossi, an economics professor at the University of Fribourg.

Finally, while the technical infrastructure may be fully in place, “psychological adoption” remains a generational challenge. Many residents still view Bitcoin primarily as an investment rather than as a medium of exchange.

Blueprint for the future

Lugano's experiment suggests that large-scale Bitcoin integration may depend less on ideology and more on practical user interfaces. By focusing on three specific workflows, the city has created a repeatable model for municipalities worldwide:

Provide free hardware to merchants to remove the “entry fee” for adoption

Ensure the currency can be used for routine obligations such as taxes, not just discretionary purchases like luxury goods

Use a local loyalty token to keep value circulating within the city.

As the world watches central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with a mix of curiosity and concern, Lugano offers a contrasting model: a city experimenting with private, decentralized and stable digital assets, positioned as an alternative to state-issued digital currencies.

According to Ukrinform, the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine (SZRU) stated this on its website.

""The Central Bank of Russia has developed a concept for regulating the cryptocurrency market that is more likely to cement state control over digital assets than pave the way for their development. The proposed model formally defines the legal status of cryptocurrencies, but in fact embeds the market in a strict system of currency and financial supervision,"" the SZRU said.

According to the document, digital currencies and stablecoins are recognized as currency valuables. They may be bought and sold, but their use as a means of payment within the territory of the Russian Federation is prohibited, which entrenches the monopoly of the ruble in domestic circulation.

Thus, the SZRU emphasized, crypto assets are finally stripped of any function as alternative money and reduced to a narrow investment instrument.

The circulation of cryptocurrencies is allowed exclusively through controlled intermediaries — exchanges, brokers, and trust managers. A separate regulatory regime is introduced for depositories and exchange offices.

The concept also introduces a strict classification of investors.

""Qualified"" market participants are given relative freedom of action, with the exception of transactions with anonymous cryptocurrencies. ""Unqualified"" investors are limited to a list of the most liquid assets and a limit of 300,000 rubles per year through a single intermediary. Although the regulator allows cross-border transactions – the purchase of cryptocurrencies abroad and transfers outside Russia – such actions are subject to mandatory declaration to tax authorities. This once again underscores the fiscal focus of the Central Bank of Russia's approach.

""As a result, the proposed model does not liberalize the digital asset market, but preserves it within the framework of strict control. Tightening regulatory barriers and restrictions for investors will curb legal domestic demand and, contrary to the stated goals, may only strengthen illegal channels for cryptocurrency circulation in Russia,"" the SZRU concluded.

As Ukrinform reported, the Russian authorities are trying to plug budget gaps through penalties and fines imposed on the population and businesses.

            Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news' editorial.        

Insurance is one of those areas that can often feel so impersonal. Customers are frequently reduced to data points, and customers typically view insurance agents as little more than sales channels. The whole process has become a confusing quagmire of policies and premiums. 

But I see the possibility for something better in the industry. Insurance can be shaped by people rather than by policies, moving from a cold, transactional model to one grounded in personal connection and trust. That evolution is driven by blockchain technology.

The traditional insurance model is a series of impersonal transactions. Customers buy a policy, pay their premiums, and when something goes wrong, they file a claim. No wonder it feels more like a business deal than a relationship.

For too long, customers and agents have had no meaningful connection beyond the occasional transaction. This distance breeds skepticism and disengagement.

The solution is to re-center the insurance industry around relationships. Transparency can build confidence, and ownership can foster loyalty on both sides. Transparency will also support compliance and eliminate misrepresentation, ensuring that everything is visible and there is no manipulation of the system.

Blockchain technology is the path to this transparency and ownership. This innovation keeps insurance data transparent in a way that everyone controls. Instead of the insurer holding all the information, customers own and manage their policy details. When customers can help tailor an insurance policy to their history and needs, the experience becomes far more personal.

On the blockchain, policy updates can occur instantly and transparently. That way, customers don't have to wait or wonder about the status of their claims and rewards because they are already ‌part of the process. This involvement builds trust and makes insurance feel like a partnership.

Because blockchain technology can securely collect and share a customer's verified information, insurers can offer personalized policies that exactly fit their needs. For instance, information about a customer's safe driving habits or home security can make their policy much more relevant. Suddenly, insurance is less like a clinical transaction and more like an ongoing relationship.

Best of all? The new technology enables a mindset change by helping agents remember that behind every policy is a human being seeking security. After all, our shared mission should be so much more than selling coverage. We are partners in lifelong protection. We are creating spaces where everyone shares in long-term value.

Agents of insurance companies typically have fixed roles with limited control or ownership. But imagine a company where agents don't just work for a paycheck; they are active entrepreneurs who have a real stake in the company's success. Blockchain technology helps make this possible.

Blockchain allows companies to issue digital tokens that represent ownership. When agents earn or buy these tokens, they gain real ownership in the ecosystem. They are no longer just workers. They are part-owners and benefit directly when the company does well.

With this insurance innovation, important decisions can be made through secure voting systems. It gives agents a genuine voice. Decentralizing control allows employees to propose ideas, vote on policies, and help steer the company's direction like true entrepreneurs.

Smart contracts also automatically reward agents based on their sales or contributions without delay. This fairness motivates agents to innovate and take initiative, much like how entrepreneurs are motivated to invest effort for clear returns.

Insurance companies need to revive and refocus their mission. The goal was never to be centered on sales and profits. Instead, the true vision is to protect people and build stronger communities, but this vision will only succeed with a focus on long-term value. Combining blockchain technology with a renewed purpose-driven culture is the way to make this happen.

Blockchain securely tracks contributions, performance, and impact over time. With smart contracts, companies can fairly and automatically reward employees, agents, and partners who help create lasting value, such as keeping customers happy or improving community safety.

When a company rallies around a mission to help people and make a difference, employees and partners join in to work with the company toward bigger goals. This purpose-driven culture can be tracked on the blockchain. Celebrating positive impacts with transparent ownership and reward systems allows everyone in the company to share in the success. It encourages everyone to adopt a focus on long-term thinking and sustainable growth. When insurance companies use this exciting innovation to reward those who truly build lasting value, it makes the whole company stronger.

The transformation of insurance from cold transactions to warm relationships is already underway. We are using technology to build systems that foster trust with every interaction and put people front and center. We won't find the future of insurance in products or premiums; it's in purpose and partnership.

zkPass Listing on Bithumb: A Game-Changer for Privacy and Korean Crypto Trading

In a significant move for the Asian cryptocurrency landscape, South Korea's premier exchange, Bithumb, has announced the listing of zkPass (ZKP) for trading against the Korean Won. This zkPass listing is not just another token addition; it's a powerful endorsement of privacy-enhancing technology within a major regulated market. Scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. UTC today, this event signals growing institutional interest in projects that prioritize user data sovereignty. For traders and blockchain enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic concepts meet mainstream financial accessibility.

Bithumb is one of South Korea's largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, its decision to list a token like ZKP carries substantial weight. This move provides zkPass with immediate access to a vast pool of liquid capital and a sophisticated investor base. Moreover, it validates the project's underlying technology—zero-knowledge proofs—in a market known for its rigorous compliance standards. The zkPass listing effectively bridges the gap between cutting-edge privacy protocols and everyday traders seeking exposure to this innovative sector.

For those new to the concept, zkPass is a protocol built around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). In simple terms, this technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. Imagine proving you are over 18 without showing your birthdate. zkPass applies this to digital identity and data verification. The zkPass listing on a major fiat gateway like Bithumb highlights a growing real-world application for ZKPs beyond theoretical use cases.

The South Korean market is a powerhouse, known for its high retail participation and tech-savvy population. Listing ZKP for direct won trading simplifies the investment process, removing the need for USDT or BTC pairs. This direct fiat on-ramp could lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for zkPass. Furthermore, it sets a precedent. Other exchanges may follow suit, and more privacy-focused projects might seek listings, thereby diversifying the offerings available to Korean investors. The zkPass listing could be the catalyst for a new wave of sophisticated digital asset adoption in the region.

While the announcement is bullish, investors should proceed with informed caution. The regulatory environment for privacy-enhancing tokens remains complex and can change rapidly. Price volatility is often high following a new listing as the market seeks equilibrium. Additionally, the success of zkPass will ultimately depend on the widespread adoption of its protocol, not just its token's trading activity. Therefore, while the zkPass listing is a monumental step, its long-term impact hinges on the project's execution and broader market trends.

The listing of zkPass (ZKP) on Bithumb is a landmark event that transcends a simple exchange announcement. It represents a growing convergence between institutional crypto platforms and fundamental blockchain values like privacy and self-sovereignty. This move provides legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility to a crucial technological innovation.

zkPass Listing on Bithumb: A Game-Changer for Privacy and Korean Crypto Trading

In a significant move for the Asian cryptocurrency landscape, South Korea's premier exchange, Bithumb, has announced the listing of zkPass (ZKP) for trading against the Korean Won. This zkPass listing is not just another token addition; it's a powerful endorsement of privacy-enhancing technology within a major regulated market. Scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. UTC today, this event signals growing institutional interest in projects that prioritize user data sovereignty. For traders and blockchain enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic concepts meet mainstream financial accessibility.

Bithumb is one of South Korea's largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, its decision to list a token like ZKP carries substantial weight. This move provides zkPass with immediate access to a vast pool of liquid capital and a sophisticated investor base. Moreover, it validates the project's underlying technology—zero-knowledge proofs—in a market known for its rigorous compliance standards. The zkPass listing effectively bridges the gap between cutting-edge privacy protocols and everyday traders seeking exposure to this innovative sector.

For those new to the concept, zkPass is a protocol built around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). In simple terms, this technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. Imagine proving you are over 18 without showing your birthdate. zkPass applies this to digital identity and data verification. The zkPass listing on a major fiat gateway like Bithumb highlights a growing real-world application for ZKPs beyond theoretical use cases.

The South Korean market is a powerhouse, known for its high retail participation and tech-savvy population. Listing ZKP for direct won trading simplifies the investment process, removing the need for USDT or BTC pairs. This direct fiat on-ramp could lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for zkPass. Furthermore, it sets a precedent. Other exchanges may follow suit, and more privacy-focused projects might seek listings, thereby diversifying the offerings available to Korean investors. The zkPass listing could be the catalyst for a new wave of sophisticated digital asset adoption in the region.

While the announcement is bullish, investors should proceed with informed caution. The regulatory environment for privacy-enhancing tokens remains complex and can change rapidly. Price volatility is often high following a new listing as the market seeks equilibrium. Additionally, the success of zkPass will ultimately depend on the widespread adoption of its protocol, not just its token's trading activity. Therefore, while the zkPass listing is a monumental step, its long-term impact hinges on the project's execution and broader market trends.

The listing of zkPass (ZKP) on Bithumb is a landmark event that transcends a simple exchange announcement. It represents a growing convergence between institutional crypto platforms and fundamental blockchain values like privacy and self-sovereignty. This move provides legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility to a crucial technological innovation. For the crypto community, it's a clear signal that privacy is not a niche concern but a mainstream demand, now accessible through one of Asia's most important trading venues.

Trust Wallet users lost more than $7 million shortly after it released an updated version of its extension for the Chrome web browser. The stolen funds will be reimbursed, said Changpeng Zhao, a co-founder of crypto exchange Binance, which owns the utility.

The breach, flagged Dec. 25 by onchain detective ZachXBT, was confirmed by the wallet team. 

""Community alert: A number of Trust Wallet users have reported that funds were drained from wallet addresses within the past couple hours,"" ZachXBT posted on Telegram. ""While the exact root cause has not been determined coincidentally the Trust Wallet Chrome extension pushed a new update yesterday.""

Crypto wallets store the keys to users' cryptocurrency holdings, and malicious actors who gain access can authorize transfers of funds to destinations they control. Crypto theft rose to $6.75 billion this year, according to a Chainalysis report. The number of personal wallet compromises surged to 158,000 from 64,000 last year, though the amount stolen accounted for 20% of the total, down from 44%, it said.

The breach affects version 2.68 of Trust Wallet's browser extension, the wallet team posted on X, urging users not to open that version and to upgrade to version 2.69. ""Mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions are not impacted.""

Uniswap Labs' and Uniswap Foundation's ""UNIfication"" proposal to activate protocol fees for the largest decentralized exchange in crypto and burn millions of UNI received overwhelming support from voters, transforming the token from a purely governance mechanism into a value-accruing asset.

The proposal received more than 125 million votes in support over the five days of voting with just 742 dissenting.

Uniswap sees an average of about $2 billion a day in trading volume and generates an annualized $600 million in fees, according to DeFillama data. Until now, it has routed all the fees to liquidity providers, leaving UNI as a governance-only token with no direct economic link to the platform's activity.

Some of those fees will now be routed to an onchain mechanism designed to burn the tokens, directly linking protocol usage to token supply reduction and potentially boosting the market price. A full100 million UNI from the treasury — worth over $590 million at current rates — will be also burned in a retroactive move intended to reflect fees that could have accrued had protocol fees been active since Uniswap's creation in 2018.

The UNI token has gained 2.5% in the past 24 hours to $5.92.

As 2025 draws to a close, bitcoin BTC$87,242.74 faced a tough year, down about 7% year-to-date, while gold, the S&P 500 and technology stocks continue to hit all-time highs. 

As a result, public bitcoin mining stocks have shown stark contrasts, driven largely by diversification into artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI. 

IREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft's backing. 

Cipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack. 

Hut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement: a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.

In contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners. 

Marathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year. 

Core Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date. 

Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.

This year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.

What's the Most Distant Galaxy? And Why Does It Matter?

Record-breaking objects can tell us about the most powerful events in the cosmos—sometimes

As a science communicator, I don't think a week goes by without a press release hitting my inbox informing me of astronomers finding some new record-breaking object.

Sometimes it's the smallest planet yet discovered or the most iron-deficient star. But a very common claim is a distance record: the farthest galaxy from Earth ever seen, for example.

When it comes to these sorts of record breakers, I have complicated feelings, built over decades of writing about them. Such announcements must be parsed carefully because sometimes they're not that big of a deal—but sometimes they signal a sea change in what we can do or understand.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Distance records are an excellent proxy for the state of the art in astronomy. Finding extremely faraway galaxies is hard. In general, objects get smaller and fainter with distance (although bizarre exceptions do sometimes apply), so huge telescopes are needed to spot them at all.

Then comes the difficulty of actually determining their distance. We can't do this directly; it's not like we can hop onboard the starship Enterprise and keep our eyes on the odometer as we warp our way there. So we gauge distances in other ways.

The most well established method is to observe redshift: The universe is expanding, and as it does so, space sweeps galaxies along with it. Light leaving a distant galaxy loses energy as it fights that expansion, so by the time it reaches us, its wavelength is stretched, which is what astronomers call a redshift. For historical (and mathematical) reasons, we say that a photon with its wavelength stretched out by a factor of two has a redshift of one; if the wavelength is three times longer, the redshift is two, and so on. Because the velocity at which a galaxy recedes from us is related to its distance, finding the redshift of a galaxy can be used to measure that distance.

That's not an easy task either because converting redshift to distance involves understanding some rather arcane features of the universe—such as how much normal matter, dark matter and dark energy it contains, to name only a few. But we have accurate enough numbers for those parameters to get a decent grasp on distances.

And this is where “record-breaking” really comes in. I'll sometimes see a paper or announcement about a new galaxy that breaks the previous record—but it'll have a redshift of, say, 7.34, when the previous record was 7.33. That difference is pretty small! And depending on your preferred values for cosmic parameters, the difference might add up to just a million light-years. In our example of an object at a redshift of 7.34, we're talking distances of around 13 billion light-years, so the record-breaker is not exactly lapping the other galaxy. Also, it's not really telling us too much about the nature of the cosmos to simply find a galaxy that ekes out a win over another by a nose (or, I suppose, a spiral arm).

On the other hand, there are times such records do tell us something important.

When I was working on the Hubble Space Telescope in the late 1990s, it was becoming common to find objects with a redshift of around 6.0 because the observatory was designed, in part, to be able to see extremely distant galaxies. Some objects were found that might be even more distant, but many were difficult to confirm. Over time, astronomers using Hubble and other telescopes managed to glimpse galaxies even farther away using clever techniques such as fortuitous gravitational lensing.

Then, in 2021, our capabilities took a giant leap with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. Its infrared eye is more sensitive to extremely redshifted objects, and its huge 6.5-meter mirror outmatches Hubble's smaller optics for gathering photons. Soon papers were published with claims of galaxies at redshifts of 10, 11 and even higher—and while many of those preliminary measurements wound up being spurious, several were ultimately confirmed out to redshifts greater than 14. This is one of those times that a record breaker is important: it's telling us that we have a new way to observe the cosmos, which usually results in a new era of astronomical discovery.

For what it's worth, at the time of this writing the current record holder is a very luminous red blob of a galaxy called MoM-z14 at a redshift of 14.44. But by the time you read this, who knows?

Those records have significant scientific meaning as well. For example, light travels very rapidly but not infinitely so. It takes billions of years for the light from these vastly removed galaxies to reach us, which means that the farther away they are, the earlier in the time line of the cosmos we see them. Any new record means we've added information about our knowledge of the early universe, and sometimes it even means we're seeing the universe in a different stage of its development.

For example, when the cosmos was very young, it was opaque. But then, at some point, stars and supermassive black holes formed, spewing out energy and making it transparent. As we discover galaxies from that period, we can learn about the environment of space at that time, just a few hundred million years after the universe formed.

We also learn about galaxies themselves. Why do they shine so brightly at that age? They have supermassive black holes prodigiously feeding on infalling matter, but how did those black holes grow so huge so rapidly? The more distant a galaxy we find, the more data we have to unravel those mysteries.

Also, that database of distant objects can be used to learn about them in general. We might find that most distant galaxies have some average luminosity, with a few topping out a bit above that and none being brighter. That would tell us about the physics of how galaxies form, how they grow and how they emit light. If there is a single most brilliant distant galaxy, that could put firm limits on how they behave.

And there's another record that will be difficult to break or even verify. When we look back far enough, we won't see any more galaxies at all. Why not? Because they wouldn't have formed yet! It took a few hundred million years for galaxies to collect themselves, with dark matter serving as gravitational scaffolding, allowing normal matter to gather and condense, collecting in colossal quantities that would eventually form nebulas, stars and planets. If we can see far enough into the distant cosmos, far enough into the past, we'll be peering back in time to before those structures even existed.

To be fair, we already have done this; microwave telescopes have detected the fireball of the big bang, the leftover light from the original expansion of the universe that fills the sky as a gently glowing long-wavelength background (as distance records go, it's at a redshift of about 1,000!). But there's a several-hundred-million-year gap between that moment and the time at which galaxies first started popping up, and we know very little about it. Every record breaker we find squeezes that boundary a little tighter.

The universe is lovely, dark and deep, but with our powerful telescopes and clever brains, we keep pushing farther into it. For that, I welcome every new record that falls. At this point in our search, each one that's broken is a footstep into new astronomical territory.

Researchers from the Institut Pasteur and Inserm have found that when mother mice consume dietary emulsifiers, it can negatively affect the gut microbiota of their offspring. These early changes in gut bacteria are linked to a higher risk of chronic inflammatory bowel conditions and obesity later in life. The findings point to possible health effects that extend across generations and underscore the need for human studies, particularly to understand how early-life exposure to emulsifiers may influence long-term health. The study was published in Nature Communications.

Emulsifiers are additives widely used in processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life. They are common in products such as dairy items, baked goods, ice cream, and some powdered baby formulas. Despite their widespread use, scientists still know relatively little about how these substances affect human health, especially their impact on the gut microbiota.

How the Study Was Conducted

The research was led by Benoit Chassaing, Inserm Research Director and Head of the Microbiome-Host Interactions laboratory (an Inserm unit at the Institut Pasteur). In the study, female mice were given two commonly used emulsifiers, carboxymethyl cellulose (E466) and polysorbate 80 (E433), starting ten weeks before pregnancy and continuing through pregnancy and breastfeeding. The researchers then examined the gut microbiota of the offspring, which had never directly consumed these emulsifiers themselves.

The results showed that the young mice experienced noticeable changes in their gut bacteria within the first weeks of life. This period is especially important because mothers naturally pass part of their microbiota to their offspring through close contact.

Disrupted Gut-Immune Communication

The altered microbiota included higher levels of flagellated bacteria, which are known to activate the immune system and promote inflammation. The researchers also observed that more bacteria were coming into close contact with the gut lining. This process, described as bacterial ""encroachment,"" caused certain gut pathways to close earlier than normal. These pathways usually allow small bacterial fragments to cross the gut lining so the immune system can recognize them and learn to tolerate the body's own microbiota.

When these pathways closed too soon in the offspring of emulsifier-exposed mothers, communication between the gut microbiota and the immune system was disrupted. As the animals reached adulthood, this disruption led to an overactive immune response and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of inflammatory gut diseases and obesity. The study links early-life microbiota changes in mice, even without direct emulsifier consumption, to a higher likelihood of developing these chronic conditions later on.

Implications for Human Health

""It is crucial for us to develop a better understanding of how what we eat can influence future generations' health. These findings highlight how important it is to regulate the use of food additives, especially in powdered baby formulas, which often contain such additives and are consumed at a critical moment for microbiota establishment. We want to continue this research with clinical trials to study mother-to-infant microbiota transmission, both in cases of maternal nutrition with or without food additives and in cases of infants directly exposed to these substances in baby formula,"" comments Benoit Chassaing, last author of the study.

This work was funded by a Starting Grant and a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council (ERC).

Scientists at the University of Otago, Faculty of Medicine -- Christchurch Ōtautahi, have identified a direct connection between how much vitamin C people eat and how well their skin produces collagen and renews itself. The findings show that skin health responds measurably to dietary vitamin C, not just topical treatments.

Published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, the research found that vitamin C levels in the skin closely mirror levels in the blood (plasma). Increasing intake through vitamin C rich foods was shown to raise both blood and skin concentrations.

Eating Vitamin C Raises Skin Levels and Thickness

The study followed 24 healthy adults in Aotearoa New Zealand and Germany. Participants who raised their plasma vitamin C levels by eating two vitamin C rich SunGoldTM kiwifruit each day showed a clear increase in vitamin C within their skin. This increase was associated with thicker skin (collagen production) and greater renewal of the outer skin layer.

Lead author Professor Margreet Vissers from Mātai Hāora -- Centre for Redox Biology and Medicine within the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine described the results as striking.

The strength of the association between skin thickness and vitamin C intake is ""compelling,"" she explained.

Vitamin C Moves From Blood to Skin

According to Professor Vissers, the relationship between blood vitamin C and skin vitamin C stood out compared to other organs.

""We were surprised by the tight correlation between plasma vitamin C levels and those in the skin -- this was much more marked than in any other organ we have investigated,"" she says.

The research team also found that vitamin C circulating in the bloodstream reaches every layer of the skin and supports healthier skin function.

""We are the first to demonstrate that vitamin C in the blood circulation penetrates all layers of the skin and is associated with improved skin function. I am very proud of my team and excited about what the data is telling us.""

Why Diet Matters More Than Creams

Professor Vissers says the findings reinforce the idea that skin health begins internally, with nutrients delivered naturally through the bloodstream.

Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which is why it is commonly added to skincare products. However, vitamin C dissolves easily in water and does not absorb well through the outer skin barrier. The study showed that skin cells are highly efficient at absorbing vitamin C from the blood, with uptake into the outer epidermal layer appearing to be a priority.

How the Study Was Conducted

The research was funded by New Zealand company Zespri International along with a University of Otago Research Grant and included two phases. The first phase examined the relationship between plasma and skin vitamin C levels using healthy skin tissue from patients undergoing elective surgical procedures at Te Whatu Ora Canterbury (with support from the Otago campus's He Taonga Tapu -- Canterbury Cancer Society Tissue Bank).

The second phase involved a controlled dietary intervention carried out in Christchurch and Germany. Each location included 12 healthy participants.

Eight Weeks of Dietary Change

Participants were asked to eat two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily for eight weeks. This provided the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C.

""All were instructed to consume two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily -- the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C -- for eight weeks. We then collected skin samples before and after the intervention, with separate analyses allowing us to look at the skin basal layers in Christchurch and the outer dermal skin layer and skin function tests in Germany,"" Professor Vissers explains.

German participants were recruited and tested by the SGS Institute Fresenius in Hamburg, which has the technical capability to collect samples from the outer dermal skin layer (the blister ""roof""). The institute evaluated skin regeneration using ultrasound measurements of skin thickness, elasticity UV protection and epidermal cell renewal to assess overall skin function.

Clear Gains in Collagen and Skin Renewal

One of the most significant findings was a measurable rise in skin thickness among participants, indicating increased collagen production along with faster regeneration of epidermal cells.

""The other really substantial finding showed a significant increase in the participants' skin thickness levels, reflecting collagen production and an upsurge in the regeneration of their epidermal cells, in other words skin renewal,"" Professor Vissers says.

Other Vitamin C Foods Likely Offer Similar Benefits

SunGold kiwifruit was selected for the study because of its consistently high vitamin C content. However, the researchers expect similar benefits from other vitamin C rich foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables such as citrus, berries, capsicums and broccoli.

""We suggest that increasing your dietary vitamin C intake will result in effective vitamin C uptake into all compartments of the skin,"" Professor Vissers says.

Daily Intake Is Key

Maintaining steady vitamin C levels in the blood is essential, since the body does not store the vitamin long term. Professor Vissers notes that healthy individuals can reach optimal plasma levels with about 250mg of vitamin C per day.

""The important thing is to keep your plasma levels optimal, which we know can be easily achieved in a healthy person with a vitamin C intake of around 250mg per day. The body however does not store the vitamin, so we recommend 5+ a day, every day, with one of those five being a high vitamin C food, as a good habit to cultivate.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why some people keep making the same bad decisions","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251225031244.htm","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:02:19 GMT","

People constantly take in information from their surroundings, including visual details and background sounds. Over time, the brain learns to connect these cues with what usually happens next. For example, a familiar sign, sound, or setting can signal whether a choice is likely to lead to a reward or a negative outcome. This process is known as associative learning, which simply means learning through repeated connections between cues and results. In everyday life, this kind of learning helps people make faster and often better decisions.

However, this system does not work the same way for everyone. For people with compulsive disorders, addictions, or anxiety, these learned associations can become overly powerful. Instead of serving as helpful guides, cues may start to dominate decision making. Individuals may feel pulled toward certain sights or sounds or strongly driven to avoid them, even when doing so leads to poor outcomes.

Studying Biased Decision Making

To better understand how this happens, Giuseppe di Pellegrino of the University of Bologna led a study focused on how people learn from cues and how this learning can sometimes go wrong. The research examined maladaptive decision making, which refers to choices that continue to cause harm or disadvantage despite repeated negative consequences.

As described in their JNeurosci paper, the researchers found that people differ widely in how much they rely on environmental cues when making decisions. Some individuals depend heavily on surrounding visuals and sounds to guide their choices, while others rely on them far less.

Why Some People Struggle to Adapt

The study also revealed an important problem for those who are highly cue driven. When familiar cues start to signal riskier or less favorable outcomes, these individuals often struggle to adjust. They may have difficulty updating their beliefs about what those cues mean and unlearning old associations that no longer apply. In practical terms, this means the brain keeps responding as if nothing has changed, even when the situation clearly has.

As a result, disadvantageous decision making can persist over time. Instead of adapting to new information, people may repeat the same risky or harmful choices again and again.

Implications for Addiction and Anxiety

According to the researchers, these findings suggest that some people have stronger cue sensitivity than others, combined with a reduced ability to revise what they have learned about those cues. This combination may help explain why certain decision patterns are so hard to break.

The research team plans to continue studying associative learning in patient populations. Their goal is to better understand whether the harmful decision patterns -- which characterize addictions, compulsive disorders, and anxiety -- are more likely to occur in people who are especially sensitive to the sights and sounds that influence their choices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This tiny chip could change the future of quantum computing","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045341.htm","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:39:50 GMT","

Researchers have achieved a significant step forward in quantum computing by developing a device that is almost 100 times thinner than the width of a human hair. The work, published in the journal Nature Communications, introduces a new type of optical phase modulator designed to precisely control laser light. This capability is essential for running future quantum computers that may rely on thousands or even millions of qubits -- the fundamental units used to store and process quantum information.

Just as important as its size is how the device is made. Instead of relying on custom-built laboratory equipment, the researchers used scalable manufacturing methods similar to those that produce the processors found in computers, smartphones, vehicles, and household appliances -- essentially any technology powered by electricity (even toasters). This approach makes the device far more practical to produce in large numbers.

A Tiny Device Built for Real-World Scale

The research was led by Jake Freedman, an incoming PhD student in the Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, alongside Matt Eichenfield, professor and Karl Gustafson Endowed Chair in Quantum Engineering. The team also collaborated with scientists from Sandia National Laboratories, including co-senior author Nils Otterstrom. Together, they created a device that combines small size, high performance, and low cost, making it suitable for mass production.

At the heart of the technology are microwave-frequency vibrations that oscillate billions of times per second. These vibrations allow the chip to manipulate laser light with remarkable precision.

By directly controlling the phase of a laser beam, the device can generate new laser frequencies that are both stable and efficient. This level of control is a key requirement not only for quantum computing, but also for emerging fields such as quantum sensing and quantum networking.

Why Quantum Computers Need Ultra-Precise Lasers

Some of the most promising quantum computing designs use trapped ions or trapped neutral atoms to store information. In these systems, each atom acts as a qubit. Researchers interact with these atoms by directing carefully tuned laser beams at them, effectively giving instructions that allow calculations to take place. For this to work, each laser must be adjusted with extreme precision, sometimes to within billionths of a percent.

""Creating new copies of a laser with very exact differences in frequency is one of the most important tools for working with atom- and ion-based quantum computers,"" Freedman said. ""But to do that at scale, you need technology that can efficiently generate those new frequencies.""

Currently, these precise frequency shifts are produced using large, table-top devices that require substantial microwave power. While effective for small experiments, these systems are impractical for the massive number of optical channels needed in future quantum computers.

""You're not going to build a quantum computer with 100,000 bulk electro-optic modulators sitting in a warehouse full of optical tables,"" Eichenfield said. ""You need some much more scalable ways to manufacture them that don't have to be hand-assembled and with long optical paths. While you're at it, if you can make them all fit on a few small microchips and produce 100 times less heat, you're much more likely to make it work.""

Lower Power Use, Less Heat, More Qubits

The new device generates laser frequency shifts through efficient phase modulation while using about 80 times less microwave power than many existing commercial modulators. Lower power consumption means less heat, which allows more channels to be packed closely together, even onto a single chip.

Taken together, these advantages transform the chip into a scalable system capable of coordinating the precise interactions atoms need to perform quantum calculations.

Built With the Same Technology as Modern Microchips

One of the project's most important achievements is that the device was manufactured entirely in a fabrication facility, or fab, the same type of environment used to produce advanced microelectronics.

""CMOS fabrication is the most scalable technology humans have ever invented,"" Eichenfield said.

""Every microelectronic chip in every cell phone or computer has billions of essentially identical transistors on it. So, by using CMOS fabrication, in the future, we can produce thousands or even millions of identical versions of our photonic devices, which is exactly what quantum computing will need.""

According to Otterstorm, the team took modulator technologies that were once bulky, expensive, and power intensive and redesigned them to be smaller, more efficient, and easier to integrate.

""We're helping to push optics into its own 'transistor revolution,' moving away from the optical equivalent of vacuum tubes and towards scalable integrated photonic technologies,"" Otterstorm said.

Toward Fully Integrated Quantum Photonic Chips

The researchers are now working on fully integrated photonic circuits that combine frequency generation, filtering, and pulse shaping on a single chip. This effort moves the field closer to a complete, operational quantum photonic platform.

Next, the team plans to partner with quantum computing companies to test these chips inside advanced trapped-ion and trapped-neutral-atom quantum computers.

""This device is one of the final pieces of the puzzle,"" Freedman said. ""We're getting close to a truly scalable photonic platform capable of controlling very large numbers of qubits.""

The project received support from the U.S. Department of Energy through the Quantum Systems Accelerator program, a National Quantum Initiative Science Research Center.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A strange star near a black hole is defying expectations","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251225080730.htm","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 07:34:19 GMT","

Astronomers at the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy (IfA) have pieced together the dramatic history of a distant red giant by studying subtle changes in its light. Tiny fluctuations in brightness reveal that the star may have collided and merged with another star long ago, a violent event that likely left it spinning much faster than normal. Today, this unusual star circles a quiet black hole in a system known as Gaia BH2.

Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the team detected faint vibrations known as ""starquakes"" moving through the red giant, which is the companion to the black hole. Gaia BH2 itself was first identified in 2023 by the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. Much like earthquakes help scientists explore Earth's interior, these stellar tremors allowed astronomers to probe deep inside the star and precisely measure properties of its core. The results of this work were recently published in Astronomical Journal.

""Just like seismologists use earthquakes to study Earth's interior, we can use stellar oscillations to understand what's happening inside distant stars,"" said IfA research scientist Daniel Hey, lead author of the study. ""These vibrations told us something unexpected about this star's history.""

A Star That Appears Older Than It Is

One of the most surprising findings came from the star's chemical composition. The red giant is described as ""alpha-rich,"" meaning it contains large amounts of heavy elements that are typically found in very old stars. Based on its chemistry alone, the star should be ancient.

However, analysis of its internal vibrations told a different story. The star is actually about 5 billion years old, far younger than its chemical makeup would suggest. That mismatch presents a puzzle for astronomers trying to understand how the star formed.

""Young, alpha-rich stars are quite rare and puzzling,"" explained Hey. ""The combination of youth and ancient chemistry suggests this star didn't evolve in isolation. It likely acquired extra mass from a companion, either through a merger or by absorbing material when the black hole formed.""

Spinning Faster Than Expected

Additional clues came from long-term monitoring with ground-based telescopes. These observations show the star completes one full rotation every 398 days, which is unusually fast for a red giant of its age that evolved alone.

""If this rotation is real, it can't be explained by the star's birth spin alone,"" said co-author Joel Ong, a NASA Hubble Fellow at IfA. ""The star must have been spun up through tidal interactions with its companion, which further supports the idea that this system has a complex history.""

Comparing Quiet Black Hole Systems

The researchers also studied Gaia BH3, another black hole system with an even stranger companion star. Existing models predicted that this star should display strong oscillations, yet none were observed. This unexpected result suggests that current theories about stars with extremely low metal content may need to be revised.

Both Gaia BH2 and Gaia BH3 belong to a class of dormant black hole systems. These black holes are not actively pulling in material from their companion stars, which means they do not emit X-rays. Instead, astronomers discovered them by carefully tracking the motion of nearby stars. These findings are changing how scientists search for and study black holes within the Milky Way.

What Comes Next

Future observations from TESS will allow astronomers to study Gaia BH2's stellar vibrations in even greater detail. With more data, the team hopes to confirm whether the red giant truly formed through a past stellar merger and to better understand how these quiet black hole pairs develop over time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new superconductor breaks rules physicists thought were fixed","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045350.htm","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:56:51 GMT","

Something unexpected is happening inside a material called platinum-bismuth-two (PtBi2). According to a new study from researchers at IFW Dresden and the Cluster of Excellence ct.qmat, this shiny gray crystal may look ordinary, but the electrons inside it behave in ways scientists have never observed before.

In earlier work published in 2024, the team showed that only the top and bottom surfaces of PtBi2 become superconducting, meaning electrons can pair up and flow without resistance. Their latest results reveal something even more surprising. The way these electrons pair is unlike any known superconductor. Even more intriguing, the edges surrounding these superconducting surfaces naturally host elusive Majorana particles, which are considered promising building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum bits (qubits) in future quantum computers.

How PtBi2 Becomes a Topological Superconductor

The unusual behavior of PtBi2 can be understood by breaking it into three key steps.

To begin with, certain electrons are confined strictly to the top and bottom surfaces of the crystal. This happens because of a topological property of PtBi2 that arises from how electrons interact with the material's orderly atomic structure. Topological properties are remarkably stable. They do not change unless the symmetry of the entire material is altered, either by reshaping the crystal itself or by applying an electromagnetic field.

What makes PtBi2 especially striking is that the electrons bound to the top surface are always matched by corresponding electrons on the bottom surface, regardless of how thick the crystal is. If the crystal were sliced in half, the newly exposed surfaces would immediately develop the same surface-bound electrons.

A Superconducting Surface With a Normal Interior

The second step occurs at low temperatures. The electrons confined to the surfaces begin to pair up, allowing them to move without resistance. Meanwhile, electrons inside the bulk of the material do not join this pairing and continue to behave like ordinary electrons.

This creates an unusual structure that researchers describe as a natural superconductor sandwich. The outer surfaces conduct electricity perfectly, while the interior remains a normal metal. Because the superconductivity comes from topologically protected surface electrons, PtBi2 qualifies as a topological superconductor.

Only a small number of materials are believed to host intrinsic topological superconductivity. So far, none of those candidates has been backed by consistently strong experimental evidence. PtBi2 now stands out as one of the most convincing examples yet.

A Never-Before-Seen Pattern of Electron Pairing

The final piece of the puzzle comes from exceptionally high-resolution measurements performed in Dr. Sergey Borisenko's lab at the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW Dresden). These experiments showed that not all surface electrons participate equally in superconductivity.

Electrons moving in six specific, evenly spaced directions on the surface refuse to pair up at all. This unusual pattern reflects the three-fold rotational symmetry of how atoms are arranged on the surface of PtBi2.

In conventional superconductors, electrons pair regardless of the direction in which they travel. Some unconventional superconductors, including the well-known cuprates that operate at relatively high temperatures, show directional pairing with four-fold symmetry. PtBi2 is the first known superconductor where pairing is restricted in a six-fold symmetric pattern.

""We have never seen this before. Not only is PtBi2 a topological superconductor, but the electron pairing that drives this superconductivity is different from all other superconductors we know of,"" says Borisenko. ""We don't yet understand how this pairing comes about.""

Crystal Edges That Trap Majorana Particles

The study also confirms that PtBi2 provides a new and practical route to producing Majorana particles, which have long been sought in condensed matter physics.

""Our computations demonstrate that the topological superconductivity in PtBi2 automatically creates Majorana particles that are trapped along the edges of the material. In practice, we could artificially make step edges in the crystal, to create as many Majoranas as we want,"" explains Prof. Jeroen van den Brink, Director of the IFW Institute for Theoretical Solid State Physics and principal investigator of the Würzburg-Dresden Cluster of Excellence ct.qmat.

Majorana particles come in pairs that together behave like a single electron, but individually act in fundamentally different ways. This idea of effectively splitting an electron is central to topological quantum computing, an approach designed to create qubits that are far more resistant to noise and errors.

Controlling Majoranas for Future Quantum Devices

With PtBi2's unusual superconductivity and edge-bound Majorana particles now identified, researchers are turning their attention to controlling these effects. One strategy involves thinning the material, which would alter the non-superconducting interior. This could transform it from a conducting metal into an insulator, preventing ordinary electrons from interfering with the Majoranas used as qubits.

Another approach involves applying a magnetic field. By shifting the energy levels of the electrons, a magnetic field could potentially move Majorana particles from the edges of the crystal to its corners. These capabilities would represent important steps toward using PtBi2 as a platform for future quantum technologies.

When Donald Trump won a second term as US president a year ago, members of violent militias and far-right extremist groups who had spent years boosting the lie that the 2020 election was rigged were ready to assist the president with delivering on one of his main campaign promises: mass deportations.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

“I'm willing to help,” Richard Mack, a former sheriff who founded the far-right Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, told WIRED at the time, claiming he was in touch with Tom Homan, the man Trump installed as his “border czar.” Tim Foley, head of the Arizona Border Recon, which describes itself as a “non-government organization,” also told WIRED he was in contact with administration officials. William Teer, then head of the far-right Texas Three Percenters militia, wrote a letter to Trump offering his help. Homan even met with an affiliate of the Proud Boys after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed. According to reports about the meeting, they discussed deportations.

Despite all of these militia leaders and far-right extremist groups salivating at the prospect of being deployed to the streets of American cities to round up immigrants at gunpoint, the call never came.

Instead, the Trump administration has remade the federal government so completely that it has no need for far-right formations from outside the government to traumatize and terrorize immigrant communities across the country. Instead, it is relying on a vastly increased federal force encompassing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), FBI and DEA agents, state and local law enforcement officers, and others. This newly enlarged force is emboldened not only by a massive influx of cash but also by tacit approval from the White House to do whatever it feels is necessary to meet Trump's wild deportation goals.

“What we're seeing right now is the Trump administration effectively realigning the federal government to support mass deportation,” says Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council. “This has meant diverting law enforcement resources from several agencies that have never before been involved with low-level immigration arrests, so that they are now focused only on profiling and arresting immigrants.”

As devastating as the past 12 months have been for immigrant communities in the US, experts believe the worst is yet to come. Installing CBP, which has a documented history of alleged human rights violations, as the agency at the forefront of the immigration crackdown is a deeply worrying sign, they say.

“I think we're just at the beginning,” says Naureen Shah, director of government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union. “I think we ain't seen nothing yet. They will scale up dramatically in the coming [months].”

Trump campaigned in 2024 on a promise to unleash the “largest deportation operation in the history of our country” during his second term in office, and within days of returning to the Oval Office in January, he signed multiple executive orders designed to fulfill his supporters' demands.

The person tasked with carrying out Trump's deportation agenda was the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, who spent the early months of the administration LARPing as an immigration agent. She was aided by Homan and her “shadow secretary” Corey Lewandowski. But behind the scenes, immigration policy is being dictated by White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who has a long history of promoting white nationalist ideas. In recent months, this administration has green-lit raids at previously protected locations like schools, courthouses, and hospitals; disappeared people to countries they had no connection to without due process; and arrested elected officials. When people fought back, the administration deployed the military to the streets of US cities to combat the all-but-nonexistent threat of violence from protesters.

Then in July, as part of his “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump approved $170 billion to fund immigration and border enforcement over the next four years, $75 billion of which goes directly to ICE. No volunteer militia leaders or anti-immigrant extremists needed.

After the bill passed, the nonprofit American Immigration Council claimed the “new infusion of money [made] ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in history.” It would “bring the administration's effort of repurposing the federal government to focus primarily on immigration enforcement close to reality,” the AIC wrote.

Seeking to capitalize on the terror it was bringing to immigrant communities, official accounts from the White House and DHS documented their actions by posting videos, memes, and AI slop—some incomprehensible outside of extremist spaces—to official social media accounts.

Richard Mack, who claims to have been in touch with Homan as recently as this past fall, hasn't played any official role in the deportation effort. But local sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies were co-opted into doing ICE's work for them, including interrogating anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally, demanding citizenship papers, arresting illegal immigrants, and detaining them in local jails until ICE agents arrive to take them away. Homan did not respond to a request for comment.

“They're not only cannibalizing the federal government, they are building out their tentacles in cities and states across the country through a radical version of the 287g program, which taps state and local law enforcement to support immigration [enforcement],” Shah says.

A year ago, just 125 agencies had signed up to 287g programs. As of November 25 that number had skyrocketed to more than 1,200. ”They're trying to treat it as miniature ICEs all across our communities,” Shah adds.

And yet, despite everything that the Trump administration has done, it was not enough for a cohort of his base.

“The administration is not serious,” Nick Fuentes, a far-right white nationalist influencer who recently sparked a civil war within the GOP, said in October, criticizing the administration's deportation numbers.

A report from the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank published in November came to the same conclusion, pointing out that the Trump administration was “substantially off pace” to meet its stated goal of exceeding President Dwight Eisenhower's 1954 deportation program. To remedy this, the report suggests adopting a broader approach targeting all immigrants by dramatically increasing worksite enforcements—or, to copy the Eisenhower administration's methods, using a “system of blocking off an area and mopping it up.”

DHS has said deportations in Trump's first year back in office would shatter records, but it's difficult to confirm this, as the agency stopped publishing monthly deportation figures. Internal numbers obtained by NBC News show ICE deportations to be well below Trump's predicted figures.

In late October, the administration sought to increase deportations by replacing ICE personnel with CBP agents in leadership positions across the country, an unprecedented use of agents typically tasked with patrolling the Mexican and Canadian borders.

“Border Patrol is an agency with a culture of abuse and impunity,” says Shah. “They have for years harmed people and even killed people and not faced accountability for it. They are bringing their culture of abuse and xenophobia and their sense of impunity to American cities deep into the interior, and it is a recipe for disaster for our civil rights.”

Explaining the decision at the time, a DHS official told NBC, “The mentality is, CBP does what they're told, and the administration thinks ICE isn't getting the job done. So CBP will do it.”

Leading the charge is Border Patrol agent Greg Bovino, who gained notoriety for his role in some of the most infamous anti-immigrant actions since Trump took office, including leading a group of agents on horseback, supported by military personnel, into MacArthur Park in Los Angeles where children were playing. He has also led deportation actions in Chicago where he was captured on video throwing tear gas into a crowd.

In a ruling issued in November to extend an injunction against, in part, the excessive use of force by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Chicago, US District Court judge Sara Ellis wrote that she found Bovino's evidence “not credible,” adding that he “appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute' responses to Plaintiffs' counsel's questions or outright lying.”

Initially, experts worried that having far-right Constitutional Sheriffs working directly with ICE would lead to potential violations of human rights, but those incidents would have been isolated to particular counties where those sheriffs operated. CBP, on the other hand, is a federal agency which now has a mandate to operate across the entire country.

“Bovino has a terrible track record of obvious anti-immigrant rhetoric and action, and Border Patrol has a long-standing history of abuses and impunity and no experience in enforcing immigration law in the interior of the United States,” says Gupta, pointing out that it's “unprecedented to have Border Patrol officers in cities like Charlotte or Chicago or New York making at-large arrests in communities that have long-standing ties to this country.”

And the scope and scale of the agency's activity is increasing, including revelations that CBP has monitored the travel patterns of millions of Americans to identify what it sees as suspicious activity.

Meanwhile, ICE continues to expand its reach, building a shadow deportation network in Texas and contracting with bounty hunting firms to track immigrants. As WIRED exclusively revealed earlier this year, operatives from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency are building a master database at the DHS that could be used to surveil undocumented immigrants.

Experts WIRED spoke to point to mass protests like No Kings marches and state lawmakers, like Illinois governor JB Pritzker, standing up to ICE as signs of hope that Trump's mass deportations could be scaled back or ended. But ultimately, Shah says, as long as Miller remains in place, very little is likely to change.

The White House and Miller did not respond to requests for comment.

A year ago, experts warned about the potential for isolated incidents of overreach by extremist sheriffs in relation to immigration enforcement. Today, those concerns are moot, given how radically the Trump administration, orchestrated by Miller, has reshaped the federal government to execute their deportation demands.

“The thing that could stop this is if Stephen Miller is no longer at the helm,” says Shah. “He's the evil genius, and as long as he has power, he can keep moving the chess pieces. It doesn't matter if it's Tom Homan or Kristi Noem or Corey Lewandowski, all these people are just pieces on the board.”

In 2026, the leaders of America's (former) trading partners are going to have to grapple with the political consequences of tit-for-tat tariffs. A tariff is a tax paid by consumers, and if there's one thing the past four years have taught us, it's that the public will not forgive a politician who presides over a period of rising prices, no matter what the cause.

Luckily for the political fortunes of the world's leaders, there is a better way to respond to tariffs. Tit-for-tat tariffs are a 19th-century tactic, and we live in a 21st-century world—a world where the most profitable lines of business of the most profitable US companies are all vulnerable to a simple legal change that will make things cheaper for billions of people, all over the world, including in the US, at the expense of the companies whose CEOs posed with Trump on the inaugural dais.

This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.

In 2026, countries that want to win the trade war have a unique historical possibility: They could repeal their “anticircumvention” laws, which make it illegal—a felony, in many cases—to modify devices and services without permission from their manufacturers. Over the past two decades, the office of the US Trade Representative–which is responsible for developing and coordinating US international trade, commodity, and direct investment policy—has pressured most of the world into adopting these laws, hamstringing foreign startups that might compete with Apple (by providing a jailbreaking kit that installs a third-party app store), or Google (by blocking tracking on Android devices), or Amazon (by converting Kindle and Audible files to formats that work on rival apps), or John Deere (by disabling the systems that block third-party repairs), or the Big Three automakers (by decoding the encrypted error messages mechanics need to service our cars). The rents that these digital locks help American companies extract run to hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. The world's governments agreed to protect this racket in exchange for tariff-free access to American markets. Now that the US has reneged on its side of the bargain, these laws serve no useful purpose.

US tech giants (and giant US companies that use tech) have used digital locks to amass a vast hoard of ill-gotten wealth. In 2026, the first country bold enough to raid that hoard gets to transform hundreds of billions in US rents into hundreds of millions in domestic profits that launch its domestic tech sector into a stable orbit—and the remaining hundreds of billions will be reaped by all of us, everyone in the world (including Americans who buy gray-market jailbreaking tools from abroad), as a consumer surplus.

In 2026, many countries will respond to tariffs like they were still in the 19th century. But a few countries will have the vision, the boldness, and the political smarts to kick Donald Trump right in the dongle. The country that gets there first will enjoy the same relationship to, say, third-party app stores for games consoles, that Finland enjoyed in relation to mobile phones during the Nokia decade.

There are many countries with the technical nous to pull this off. Obviously, Canada and Mexico have pride of place, since Trump has torn up the USMCA agreement he arm-twisted them into in 2020, and heaped racist rhetoric on Mexico even as he threatened to annex Canada. Speaking of annexation targets with sizable communities of technical experts, the Danes could lead the EU out of the wilderness the bloc bargained its way into when they enacted Article 6 of the Copyright Directive in 2001. Then there's the global south: African tech powerhouses like Nigeria, South American giants like Brazil, and the small, developed Central American states who've seen Trump renege on the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), like Costa Rica.

Retaliatory tariffs make consumer goods in your own country more expensive, and to the extent that they punish Americans, they do so indiscriminately, inflicting far more pain on soybean farmers than they do on the CEOs of the tech companies that back Trump.

Repealing anticircumvention law is a targeted strike on America's most profitable companies, and it will have an especially severe impact on Tesla, whose hyperinflated price-to-earnings ratio reflects investors' pleasure at the Tesla business model, which involves charging drivers every month for subscription features and software upgrades that expire when a car changes hands. Musk owes his power to the digital locks that keep this business model intact. If it were legal for mechanics all over the world to jailbreak Teslas and unlock all those features for one price, Tesla's share price would collapse—taking with it the overvalued shares Musk uses to collateralize the loans he took out to buy Twitter and the US presidency.

In 2026, world leaders have a choice—to make things cheaper and better for all of us, or to fight Donald Trump with weapons that were developed in the Age of Sail.

8/10

The past year had a remarkable number of big new camera releases. Nikon updated the Z5. Sony released a new A7. Leica even released a camera with an electronic viewfinder. Interesting though the year was for big, fancy cameras, perhaps the most anticipated new camera of the year is the little, unassuming Ricoh GR IV.

The GR series has been the pocket point-and-shoot to have for years, going all the way back to when it was a film camera. I'm happy to report that the latest addition to the storied lineup continues the tradition. But then you probably already know that, because you probably preordered one back when they were announced. Let's take a minute to run through the next 1,000 words on why you're smart and that was a great purchase. The two of you who didn't can leave comments below telling the rest of us why we're idiots.

Truly great photographs aren't always beautiful, but they have something extra about them that makes them stick in your mind. Cameras are like that, too. Most of the cameras that I've really loved were far from perfect: the Fujifilm x70, the Ricoh GR III, the Panasonic GF1. All of these cameras have flaws, and yet they are the most compelling cameras I've used in over 10 years of testing cameras for WIRED. I like the GR III so much I did a second review of it, way past the date that a review made any sense. (I appreciate your indulgence, WIRED readers.)

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

All of which is to say, I've been looking forward to the GR IV, so much so in fact that probably nothing could really live up to the expectations. But GR IV comes very close. It is everything the GR III was, but better.

Let's start with what Ricoh didn't change: the body. The GR IV is essentially the same size as the III. Technically it's a couple millimeters narrower and a few grams heavier, but in practice I could tell no difference from the GR III. Most importantly, it still fits in your pocket. And I don't mean you need to do some pocket yoga and then it fits (looking at you, Fujifilm X100). The GR IV actually, legitimately slides right into your pocket.

The control layout has changed slightly, and in a good way. There are two unlabeled adjustment wheels, one in front, one in back, and yes, the one on the back is a proper wheel this time, not the side-to-side rocker switch. By default, the front wheel is set to aperture and the rear to shutter speed, making this one of the easiest cameras on the market to shoot in full manual mode using one hand. You can of course customize these to something else if you like. (You monster.)

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

Ricoh wisely ditched the dial around the outside of the D-pad, opting instead to stick with just a D-pad and then a +/- rocker switch at the top right side of the back of the camera. Again, it's easy to change everything you'd ever want to change regularly using one hand. (All these switches and dials are customizable.)

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

Also unchanged is the rear LCD screen, which does not rotate or fold out in any way. No waist-level shooting for you. The GR series has always been an opinionated camera, and this is one of those places that I think shows that dogmatic stance about what it is trying to be. You either love that or this isn't the camera for you.

Ricoh has also moderately improved the battery life with a new battery that manages 250 shots on a charge (up from 200 in the GR III). It's better, but this is still the weakest point of the GR. You're going to want some extra batteries.

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

The extra battery room appears to be the cause of perhaps the strangest thing about the GR IV, which is that it uses microSD rather than a full-size card. Given the paltry video specs on the GR IV, microSD is fine, and there are plenty of cards fast enough to handle what the GR IV is capable of. If you don't have a good microSD card, have no fear. There is 54 GB of built-in internal memory.

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

The sensor inside the GR IV has a few more megapixels. It's a 25.7 MP APS-C CMOS sensor compared to the previously used 24.2 MP sensor. This sounds like nothing on paper, but in practice the image quality is subtly, but importantly, better. I'm honestly unsure how much to attribute the improved image quality to the sensor and how much to attribute to the redesigned lens. The GR IV retains the same 18.3mm f/2.8 (28mm equivalent in full frame terms), but it has a completely new optical design.

The result, whether sensor or lens or both, is better image quality. The lens is definitely sharper in the corners than the GR III, but more impressive to me is that images have more clarity and depth than what I got from the GR III. The files look cleaner as well. I didn't feel the need to do much, if any, post-processing on most of my shots. The GR IV will shoot video, though it tops out at 1080p, which tells you everything you need to know about what this camera thinks about video.

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

Also unchanged is the weather sealing. There still isn't any, though there is now some protection around the lens when it retracts, which should stop dust from getting on the sensor—a problem for some GR III cameras.

While the body and button layout improvements make the GR IV easier to use, and the lens and sensor make for better image quality, the biggest improvement is the autofocus improvement. I would upgrade for this reason, even if I had the GR III.

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

Autofocus in the GR III was, well. So long as you understood its limitations, it did alright—some, maybe even most, of the time. The GR IV is an entirely different beast. Autofocus is plenty snappy for a camera of this size. Not only is the autofocus system much faster overall, the subject tracking and face detection are also quite good. Not like Sony or Nikon, detect-a-bird's-eye-in-corner-of-the-frame good, but very usable and plenty good enough for street photography and environmental portraits.

The In Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) is also vastly improved, using a new five-axis system that allows you to gain up to six stops of hand-holding ability. This is a big deal given that its f/2.8 lens on a APS-C sensor does not make the GR IV a great low-light performer to being with. Any extra stabilization is welcome, and the new system really does work much better.

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

Ricoh GR IV

Rating: 8/10

When I reviewed the GR III, I wrote about how much I liked snap focus mode, which allows you to set a predetermined focus distance regardless of the aperture. I set up my GR III to use autofocus when I half-pressed the shutter and snap when I quickly pressed, so that snap focus fired off the shot at my predetermined focus distance (usually 1.5 meters).

All that remains, but there is also now a dedicated letter, Sn, on the mode dial that sets the camera in Snap Focus mode, which allows you to dial in not only the distance you want focus at, but also the aperture you want to lock in. You can control the depth of field as well. I rather enjoyed this new mode and found myself shooting with it quite a bit.

The GR IV debuted at $1,497, which is significantly more than the GR III's $999 price at launch. Is it worth the extra money? If you have a GR III and are frustrated by the autofocus, I think you will like the upgrade. It's significant and, if you have the money, well worth it.

If you have any desire to use your pocket camera for video, this is not the one for you. See our guides to pocket cameras and the best travel cameras for some better, hybrid photo- and video-capable cameras. If you want an APS-C sensor that legitimately fits in your pocket, offers amazing one-handed control, and produces excellent images, the the Ricoh GR IV is for you.

Personally, I am holding out for the GR IVx, which will hopefully, like the GR IIIx, be the same camera with a 40mm-equivalent lens. At the time of writing, Ricoh would not comment on whether there will be a GR IVx.

In the original Pirates of the Caribbean, Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner escape Port Royal by strolling out to an anchored ship. They do this by walking on the seafloor, using an upside-down rowboat to hold air so they can breathe. It's an awesome scene, but is it, er, possible? Could you do this yourself?

Of course, the great thing about movies is that they don't need to be realistic (and the Pirates franchise makes the most of that exemption). I'm only asking about this because it's a fun way to do some physics and understand how the world works. So grab your goggles and let's plunge in!

It may not seem like it, but objects in the water still have gravity acting on them, same as on land. Then why do you feel weightless underwater? Well, let's back up for a moment. Imagine you have a block of steel and a block of styrofoam, both measuring 1 cubic foot in volume. Each one has a mass, which equals its volume (V) times its density (ρ). Then the gravitational force (Fg) on each is simply mass times the gravitational field (g):

But you already know about this, because Fg is what normies call an object's “weight,” and for a given volume, weight depends only on the density. Now, if you dropped these blocks in a lake, obviously the styrofoam would float and the steel would sink. So clearly it has something to do with density.

What if you had a block of water with the same volume? If you could somehow hold this cube of water, it would feel pretty heavy, about 62.4 pounds. Now, if you place it carefully in a lake, will it sink or bob on the surface like styrofoam? Neither, right? It's just going to sit there.

Since it doesn't move up or down, the total force on the block of water must be zero. That means there has to be a force counteracting gravity by pushing up with equal strength. We call this buoyancy, and for any object, the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the water it displaces.

So let's think about this. The steel block displaces the same amount of water, so it has the same upward-pushing buoyancy force as the block of water. But because it's denser and has more mass, down it goes.

In general, an object will sink if the gravitational force exceeds the buoyancy force, and it will float if the buoyancy force exceeds the gravitational force. Another way of saying that is, an object will sink if it's denser than water and it will float if it's less dense.

And right in the middle an object will neither sink nor rise to the surface—we call that neutral buoyancy. Humans are pretty close to neutral because our bodies are 60 percent water. That's why you feel weightless underwater—the buoyancy force pretty much offsets the gravitational force.

Avast! Hold on there, matey. Aircraft carriers are made of steel and weigh 100,000 tons, so why do they float? Can you guess? It's because of their shape. Unlike a block of steel, a ship's hull is hollow and filled with air, so it has a large volume relative to its weight.

But what if you start filling it with cargo? The ship gets heavier, which means it must displace more water to reach that equilibrium point. In general, when you launch a boat or ship into the water, it'll sink down until the weight of the water it pushes aside equals the boat's total weight.

Cool, right? This was all figured out by Archimedes more than 2,000 years ago, as legend has it, when he stepped into a bathtub and saw the water level rise.

So, what would you need to walk an upside-down boat on the bottom of the ocean? Let's start off with a force diagram:

There are four forces on this boat: There's the upward-pushing buoyancy force (FB) and the downward-pushing gravitational force (mass times the gravitational field, mg). Finally, Will and Jack have to push up on the boat so the boat pushes down on them. I mean, it's pretty hard to walk on the bottom when you're effectively weightless. (Trust me, I tried.)

So let's do the math. The forces from the humans are puny; we can ignore those. For buoyancy, we find the weight of the water displaced, using the same formula we used for gravity above, F = ρVg. The density (ρ) of water is 1,000 kg/m3, and let's say the air-filled boat has a volume of 3 m3. Multiplying this by the gravitational field g, which is 9.8 newtons per kilogram, we get a buoyancy force of 29,400 newtons. In imperial units, which is probably what Jack and Will use, that's 6,600 pounds.

What does this mean? It means the boat must weigh at least 6,600 pounds—which it clearly doesn't—or the buoyancy will rocket them right up to the surface. I see only two solutions: They could let the air out to reduce the volume—obviously not a first choice—or they could add more than 3 tons of ballast. Maybe gold doubloons? Pirates like gold, and it's extremely dense. But it's hard to be stealthy when you're running wheelbarrows of gold down to the beach.

I see a hand in back. Isn't it true that the air inside would get compressed the deeper you go, which would reduce the volume and thus reduce the buoyancy? Smart question. Yes, that would indeed happen since the water pressure increases with depth. But would it be enough?

To figure this out, we can use the ideal gas law. This gives us a relationship between the pressure (P) of a gas and its volume (V):

In this model, n is the amount of gas (in moles), and T is the temperature. (R is just a constant.) As the boat moves down into deeper water, the amount of air trapped inside doesn't change, and for simplicity let's assume the temperature is constant too.

That means the whole right side of the equation is constant. Which means, in turn, that pressure and volume are inversely proportional: If P rises, V shrinks—and vice versa. That's Boyle's law.

Now, if you're submerged, the pressure is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and the water pressure. That might seem weird, but it's because you have the weight of the atmosphere above the surface (1 atm) weighing down on you as well as the weight of the water column above you. As a rule of thumb, this total pressure increases by about 1 atm for every 10 meters you descend.

Call the pressure and volume at the surface P1 and V1, and for simplicity let's say the starting volume of air in the boat is 1 m3. We'll call underwater pressure and volume P2 and V2. Now, with our assumptions, Boyle's law says P1V1 = P2V2. So we can easily solve for the volume of air at a depth of, say, 5 meters: P1V1/P2 = 1/1.5, so V2 is 0.67 m3.

In other words, the volume declines by one-third. But that still gives us a buoyancy force of 4,400 pounds. If Jack and will pulled the boat down to a depth of 30 meters (about 100 feet), the volume and buoyancy would decrease by 75 percent. But that's still a buoyancy force of 1,650 pounds, and it's way too deep. Even if you could get down there, breathing compressed air at 4 atm's would require a very slow, controlled ascent to avoid the bends.

Bottom line: This trick for walking underwater is pure fantasy—as phony as fool's gold—but, hey, it's 24-karat entertainment.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Todd Bishop on Dec 26, 2025 at 8:47 amDecember 26, 2025 at 8:48 am

Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott has some advice for AI startups waiting for the next breakthrough model: the technology can already do far more than most people are getting out of it, so stop waiting and start building. 

Also: real customer traction still matters more than online buzz.

Speaking at a recent South Park Commons event with the organization's general partner, former Dropbox CTO and Facebook engineer Aditya Agarwal, Scott said founders are sitting on a “gigantic capability overhang” —  meaning that current AI systems can do far more than most apps built on top of them. 

He cited ChatGPT itself as a past example: the underlying model was “pretty old” when it launched, as he put it, and nobody (including Scott and his peers) predicted at the time it would become a potential trillion-dollar product.

“The cost of doing the experiments has never been cheaper,” Scott said. “So do the damned experiments. Try things.”

The barrier isn't model capability, he said, but the unglamorous integration work needed to put it to practical use.

“Some of the things that you need to do to squeeze the capability out of these systems is just ugly-looking plumbing stuff, or grungy product building,” he said. “But you're in a startup, that's kind of your life. It's more about the grind.”

Scott also cautioned founders against mistaking online attention for real traction. The current environment, he said, is flooded with “false signal” — from media coverage to investor interest — that doesn't really correlate with whether you've built something useful.

“You've got a bunch of people whose business model is getting clicks on articles online or getting people to subscribe to their Substack,” he said. “If you believe the things that particular part of the ecosystem is sending to you in terms of feedback, it could be that you're steering yourself in exactly the wrong direction.”

The real signal, he said, comes from building something customers actually love.

Naware founder Mark Boysen first tried killing weeds with drones and a 200-watt laser.  

He'd been noodling on ideas for a startup with some friends, and thinking about how his family in North Dakota had lost three members to cancer, something they suspected may be related to chemicals in the groundwater. Finding a chemical-free way to kill weeds seemed like a solid option.

But the laser was a dead end. There's too much risk of starting a fire, he told TechCrunch in an interview. After a lot of trial-and-error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics. The solution he settled on — which he showed off earlier this year at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — is steam.

Boysen's company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he's trying to kill.

In a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more. 

“They're not real industrial,” Boysen said he quickly realized. “And so there's a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘how do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?'”

Developing the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It's well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real-time while the rig is prowling over a lawn. (And yes, it's using Nvidia GPUs.) 

He thinks they've gotten there, though. He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”

On top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen's pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.

“We're going after the strategic partnerships. We're in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we're a couple conversations into that — I can't say their name, but you'll figure it out,” he laughed.

Success, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now, but said he'll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.

“I've got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it” he said. “I've got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it's effective. And we'll make it work. I'm not concerned about that.”

What history have you been reading? Sure we can find examples of each of these by I can also give you counter examples - big ones - off the top of my head. 1. Did his absolute best (but failed) to cut the Apple II product line, even though it was the only money maker for the company, to support several losing prduct lines. 2. I agree - though he made as many bad big bets as good ones: no expandability of the original Mac, the iMac, PowerPC, are a few examples 3. was deeply technical? compared to his peer tech leaders this was just not true. He was a great product manager, but not particularly technical. I'd suggest you look at his entire corpus before you lionize a spectacular PM & designer, and incredibly flawed human being.>> I wish my CEO had the guts to make these calls.

You basically take those millions of saved hours and multiply them by a government-standard 'value of time' (roughly £15/hr in the UK).

A bus can easily carry 50 passengers. 30 seconds times that many is 25 minutes. That's a lot of aggregate time wasted indeed.Also assuming this 30 seconds delay is not compensated later, it can influence significantly more people than the bus capacity. And if someone misses a connection because of it that's even more time wasted.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

There are a few people that Apple would love to delete from the face of the planet.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who's consistently divulging Apple's plans, is one. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is always sharing information based on his supply chain checks, is high up on the list, too. But YouTuber Jon Prosser is public enemy number one that Apple is trying to truly silence. And for good reason: the man who Apple sued in July for leaking iOS 26 and Liquid Glass keeps spoiling Apple's unreleased products with high-quality 3D renders in his videos—like the foldable iPhone that's not expected to be announced until next year.

On Christmas Eve, Prosser gave the world an early gift: a video revealing what he claims is Apple's foldable iPhone in all of its book-style glory. Watch for yourself:

In his video, Prosser confidently states the foldable iPhone, which is rumored to launch next fall alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and 18 Pro Max, will have a 5.5-inch external display with a hole-punch camera. The inside foldable screen will measure 7.8 inches with a hole-punch camera in the upper left corner. His renders show dual cameras sitting on an oblong camera plateau much like the one on the iPhone Air; an LED flash sits on the opposite side.

Prosser says the foldable iPhone will be 9mm thick when closed, which means each half will likely be 4.5mm. That'd over a whole millimeter thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air, which is already barely thicker than a USB-C port and feels impossibly thin in the hand.

The dimensions do align with the rumored footprint from multiple previous reports. However, it conflicts with a recent leak that claimed the foldable iPhone would have an external screen that's about 5.25 inches, which would be smaller than the 5.4-inch iPhone 13 mini.

Prosser's 3D renders do appear to depict a foldable iPhone that's wider than it is tall when folded and open. Side-by-side with a first-gen Pixel Fold, minus the thicker bezels on Google's foldable, the foldable iPhone might look similar, down to the location of the hole-punch cameras. Other reports have suggested the foldable iPhone would have an “invisible” under-panel camera (UDC) in the folding display.

The big question will be whether or not Apple can make the crease less visible. Several previous reports said that Apple had figured it out, but the latest leak suggests that might not be the case after all.

Ultimately, a foldable iPhone will undoubtedly get lots of buzz if Apple does launch it next year. But the real indicator of its success will be whether consumers buy it. The iPhone Air is a state-of-the-art phone with impressive miniaturization that could be a glimpse of what's to come in a future pair of Apple smart glasses, and yet it's reportedly been a commercial failure. It's been such a sales flop that there may not be an iPhone Air 2 next year. More consumers have purchased the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros than the super-skinny iPhone Air that has fewer cameras and less battery life.

Will consumers see the value of a foldable iPhone, especially if it comes with an exorbitant price tag that could start at over $2,000? I'd say never bet against the iPhone, but then again, the iPhone mini, iPhone Plus, and now the iPhone Air reportedly didn't sell enough.

Tesla's valuation has been spectacular lately, closing at an all-time record of $489.88 earlier this month and still hovering pretty close to that astronomical figure as of this writing. Tesla bulls, notably Dan Ives of Wedbush capital, say this is because Tesla is on the verge of successfully deploying robotaxis, and that Tesla's stock price could spike to $800 next year.

A New York Times report from Thursday reads like a valiant attempt to talk sanity into anyone who believes the Wedbush Tesla narrative. It's not going to work, because Tesla is selling a pretty wild fantasy that isn't mentioned in the Times' piece.

Central to the Times' report is the observation that in Austin, Tesla's proof-of-concept city as a Robocar manufactuer-operator, an estimated 30 self-driving taxis have supposedly rolled onto the roads since June, an absolutely dismal number compared to Waymo's 200 in the same city since March. The source the Times links to for the Tesla stat is a site called teslarobotaxitracker.com, which is run by an Austin-based robotaxi enthusiast named Ethan McKanna.

And the Times points out that each and every Tesla self-driving taxi with passengers in it still has a human safety monitor—while Waymo's fleet is unsupervised—at least inside the car. 

The Times is far from the first to claim that Waymo is way ahead of Tesla. Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind—who shares a parent company, Alphabet, with Waymo, wrote on Twitter earlier this month, “I don't think Tesla has anywhere near the volume of rider-only autonomous miles that Waymo has (96M for Waymo, as of today). The safety data is quite compelling for Waymo, as well.” 

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, replied to Dean by making one of his famous outlandish predictions: “Waymo never really had a chance against Tesla. This will be obvious in hindsight.”

One issue with any Waymo-Tesla comparison right now, however, is that Waymo's business is running into some major potholes, and they might be relevant. This past weekend, Waymo had to shut down its service in San Francisco when its vehicles faltered at dark stoplights. It turned out that Waymo's lack of safety drivers might have contributed to the problem, since the motivation for the shutdown was a logjam caused by the Waymo software's high volume of requests for human feedback.

But importantly, the bullish case for Tesla's Robotaxi service doesn't seem to be based on the existing ride-hailing service that relies on Model Y cars as autonomous taxis. It's most likely based on the large scale rollout of a two-seater car without a steering wheel or pedals called the Cybercab that Elon Musk unveiled in 2024, and claimed will be available for purchase by the end of 2026.

The supposed silver bullet for Cybercabs is that people will ostensibly buy them, and use them for their own transportation needs, but at other times release them into the wild as robotic servants that make them passive, or passive-ish, income. This would benefit Tesla in theory because it would rely on the Tesla app ecosystem, and Tesla would get a cut, while the car owners have to deal with charging, maintenance, insurance, cleaning, and everything else that's annoying about owning a car.

And we know Elon Musk has it in his head that he's going to get something like a million Cybercabs onto the road—or at least some mix of hundreds of thousands of Model Y taxis alongside Cybercabs. We know this because if Tesla doesn't deploy at least one million self-driving taxis, Elon Musk doesn't get all of his notorious $1 trillion pay package. 

The Times's piece isn't wrong to quote experts saying Tesla is “way behind Waymo.” But it includes passages like this that make near-religious faith in Tesla's future revenue sound more mysterious than it is:

Some analysts also doubt whether driverless taxis will generate trillions of dollars of revenue, as Mr. Musk has predicted, or be very profitable. For revenue to even reach hundreds of billions of dollars, many people would have to give up their personal vehicles in favor of riding in taxis, which is unlikely anytime soon, said Michael Tyndall, an analyst at HSBC.

It's not that the Times is comparing apples and oranges. It's more like they're comparing otherwise decent apples with worms in them to magical apples from a wizard who claims his apples can grant wishes, but no one can have one yet. It's more dubious and fantastical than the extremely sane adults in the room are even letting on with their pleas for sanity. But hey, let's all just wait and see what the wizard has in store for us.

Google is finally introducing a way for users to change their Gmail addresses ending with @gmail.com, just in time for the new year.

A page on the company's help center was recently updated with new rules for changing email addresses, outlining a way that would let users keep the familiar @gmail.com ending.

The update was first spotted by users in a “Google Pixel Hub” Telegram group, who noticed the changes on the Hindi-language version of the help page.

“The ability to change your Google Account email address is being rolled out gradually to all users, so this option may not be available to you yet,” a translated version of the page reads.

As that message suggests, it's fair to assume the feature will eventually roll out to users around the world.

The updated language appears on nearly all versions of the page in other languages, including Spanish, French, and Japanese. The English-language version, however, has not yet been updated.

“If your account's email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can't change it,” the English version still states.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

In the support pages that have been updated, Google says, “If your Google Account email address ends in gmail.com, you may be able to change it to another address that ends in @gmail.com.”

That would allow people who have outgrown their original Gmail address or just want a fresh start to switch to a new email without worrying about losing any data tied to their account.

Google says that once users change their email address, the old one will be converted into an alternate email address. Users will receive emails sent to both the old and new addresses, and they can still use the previous address whenever they want. Both addresses can be used to sign in to popular Google services like Maps, YouTube, and Drive. The data associated with the account, including photos and messages, will not be affected.

There are some limits, though. Google says that once you make the switch, you won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the same account for 12 months.

If you're in one of the regions with an updated help page, you can check whether you're eligible by visiting myaccount.google.com/google-account-email and clicking on “Personal information” in the upper-left corner. From there, click on “Email,” then “Google Account email address.” If the option is available to you, you should see a button that says “Change Google Account email.” Clicking it will prompt you to enter the new username you want.

It's a Christmas miracle!

A serendipitous Redditor has stumbled upon a treasure worth gold in these trying times: twenty of some of the best SSDs, worth $5,100, for the price of just two. Yes, while the rest of us mere mortals are stuck coping with the drought-ridden production lines of NAND flash and DRAM, this lucky buyer received a blessing that is nothing short of a Christmas miracle — or an Amazon packaging error.

As posted on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, u/1trollzor1 ordered two 2 TB Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs from Amazon but ended up receiving two entire boxes full of twenty drives. According to the OP, Amazon customer support even told them to keep the package, leading to blissful confusion for u/1trollzor1, who wondered whether to flip them for profit or start an insane NAS project.

For context, one of these Samsung 9100 Pro 2 TB drives costs $254.99 on Amazon right now, so twenty of them would cost around $5,100. The person originally ordered only two, which means they paid a little over $500 for SSDs worth ten times as much. How such a mix-up happened in the first place, well, the OP didn't expound upon that.

Funnily enough, this isn't even the first time something like this has happened. Of course, there are plenty of unfortunate deliveries, but some good eggs also make it through. We covered a similar story a few months ago, where another Redditor ordered a single Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD but instead got a box full of them worth almost $1,000. Though these 9100 Pros certainly carry more swag (and more quantity).

 




Not to mention, these are Samsung's top-of-the-line PCIe 5.0 drives with sequential read and write speeds of up to 14,800 MB/s and 13,400 MB/s, respectively. If it weren't for a few other options on our best SSDs roundup, Samsung's 9100 Pro would be the top choice for a flagship build today, and it's still a great SSD regardless of the leaderboards.

As for the deal itself, there's an inkling of suspicion given the OP's ""1trollzor1"" username — referring to the infamous trollface meme — which could hint at the underlying reality of this situation. There were no obvious clues in the comments pointing toward fabrication. And because packaging errors like these are common, we're going to give this one the benefit of the doubt. The people need a win like this.

Intel was the first company to build an explicitly disaggregated chiplet design, comprising 47 chiplets, with its Ponte Vecchio compute GPU for AI and HPC applications. This product still holds the record for the most populous multi-tile design, but Intel Foundry envisions something considerably more extreme: a multi-chiplet package that integrates at least 16 compute elements across eight base dies, 24 HBM5 memory stacks, and scales to 12X the size of the largest AI chips on the market ( 12x reticle size, beating TSMC's 9.5x reticle size). Of course, we can only wonder about the power consumption and cooling requirements for such beastly processors.

 




Intel's conceptual 2.5D/3D multi-chiplet package demonstrates 16 large compute elements (AI engines or CPUs) produced on Intel's 14A or even more sophisticated 14A-E process technology (1.4nm-class, enhanced features, second-gen RibbonFET 2 gate-all-around transistors, improved PowerVia Direct backside power delivery).

These sit on top of eight (presumably reticle-sized) compute base dies made on 18A-PT (1.8nm-class, performance enhanced with through-silicon vias (TSVs), and backside power delivery) that can either do some additional compute work, or pack plenty of SRAM cache for the 'main' compute dies, as Intel shows in its example.

From cutting-edge interconnects to system-level assembly and test, Intel Foundry delivers the scale and integration needed to power next-generation multichip platforms. https://t.co/smSje92QQh #IntelFoundry #Semiconductors pic.twitter.com/4sAVftVRhgDecember 22, 2025

*Expand the tweet above to watch the fly-through video.The base dies are connected to the compute tiles using Foveros Direct 3D, leveraging ultra-high-density sub-10 µm copper-to-copper hybrid bonding to deliver maximum bandwidth and power to the top dies. Intel's Foveros Direct 3D is currently the pinnacle of Intel Foundry's packaging innovations, underscoring the very sophisticated design.

The base dies leverage EMIB-T (an enhanced version of Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge with TSVs), with UCIe-A on top, for lateral (2.5D) interconnections among themselves and with I/O dies made on 18A-P (1.8nm-class, performance-enhanced), and custom base dies, for up to 24 HBM5 memory stacks.

 






It is noteworthy that Intel proposes to use EMIB-T with the UCIe-A on top to connect customized HBM5 modules rather than use JEDEC-standard HBM5 stacks with an industry-standard interface, possibly to get more performance and capacity. Given the concept nature of the demonstration, the use of custom HBM5 stacks is not a design requirement; it is simply a way to show that Intel integrates such devices as well.

The whole package can also carry PCIe 7.0, optical engines, noncoherent fabrics, 224G SerDes, proprietary accelerators for things like security, and even LPDDR5X memory for added DRAM capacity.

Note that the video Intel Foundry posted on X shows two conceptual designs: a 'mid-scale' one featuring four compute tiles and 12 HBM, and an 'extreme' one with 16 tiles and 24 HBM5 stacks, which our story focuses on. Even the mid-scale design is fairly advanced by today's standards, but Intel can produce it today.

As for the extreme concept, this may emerge toward the end of the decade, when Intel has perfected not only Foveros Direct 3D packaging technology but also its 18A and 14A production nodes. Being able to produce such extreme packages towards the end of the decade will put Intel on par with TSMC, which plans something similar and even expects at least some customers to use its wafer-size integration offerings in circa 2027 – 2028.

Making the extreme design a reality in just a few years is a significant challenge for Intel, as it must ensure the components do not warp when attached to motherboards and do not deform even with minimal tolerances due to overheating after prolonged use. Beyond that, Intel (and the whole industry) will need to learn how to feed and cool monstrous processor designs the size of a smartphone (up to 10,296 mm^2) that will have an even larger package, but that's a different story.

Scientists tested these motorized elastomer powered exoskeletons across three robotic applications.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Swiss scientists have used dead lobster parts as robotic appendages. The strong yet flexible and lightweight exoskeletons of these marine animals have been successfully demonstrated as robotic manipulators, grippers, and swimmers or flappers flexing at up to 8 Hz. The use of dead animal parts makes this an advance in ‘necrobotics.' This example of bio-hydrid robotics, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), is particularly sustainable necro-tech, as it uses crustacean shells that are waste from food production.

Often, researchers are inspired by nature to create better man-made things. However, necrobotics unashamedly commandeers bits of (dead) nature to do its bidding. If you need a sustainable robot part, that is the size and shape of a lobster tail, then why reinvent the wheel?

“Exoskeletons combine mineralized shells with joint membranes, providing a balance of rigidity and flexibility that allows their segments to move independently. These features enable crustaceans' rapid, high-torque movements in water, but they can also be very useful for robotics,” explains EPFL's CREATE Lab head Josie Hughes. “And by repurposing food waste, we propose a sustainable cyclic design process in which materials can be recycled and adapted for new tasks.”

In the video above, you can see a set of clips showing the scientists testing the dead crustacean exoskeleton's use in robotics applications. Specifically, Langoustine tails are used as the robotic appendages throughout these tests. Langoustines are a smaller member of the lobster family, also known as Norway lobsters, Dublin Bay prawns, or scampi.

The first segment of the video shows a pair of these tails being used for gripping a variety of (mostly soft) objects. The associated research paper says that “a 3g exoskeleton [is] capable of supporting a 680g payload.” Though drastically outsized and outweighed by some of the objects, these necrobotic grippers are capable in lifting and manipulation, and don't appear to easily damage things like tomatoes.

Later parts of the video show langoustine tails make for extremely capable robotic swimming appendages – no surprise. In air, the scientists found they could flap pretty fast, up to approx 8 Hz.

 




Chitin, a natural biopolymer, is the key structural component in crustaceans (and insects), which makes their exoskeletons so useful here. It is a very easy to source materials, which is strong, flexible, and light weight, as well as being biodegradable and biocompatible.

To improve on the exoskeleton's already attractive qualities as an articulated appendage, the Swiss scientists added a silicon coating to reinforce strength and extend useful lifespan. Inside the exoskeleton an elastomer was fixed, and attached on the synthetic-end to a motorized base.

“To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a proof of concept to integrate food waste into a robotic system that combines sustainable design with reuse and recycling,” said CREATE Lab researcher and first author, Sareum Kim.

Going forward, the researchers propose more advanced synthetic augmentation mechanisms like tunable controllers, which would adjust for the natural variation in biological structures. In any case, nature still outperforms many artificial systems and provides great insight into elegant materials and mechanical design.

Last month we highlighted Necroprinting technology, where dead mosquito proboscis were used for the finest, and most sustainably sourced, 3D printer nozzles. In 2022, we also saw dead spiders being used as ‘necrobots,' specifically for robotic grabbers (see the video clip below).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Sleep vs exercise: How to strike the balance for health","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/between-sleep-and-exercise-choose-sleep-research-suggests","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 06:30:05 GMT","

Recent research suggests that the allocation of time to sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behavior over a 24-hour period influences long-term health, and that attaining adequate levels of both sleep and physical activity is essential for healthy aging.

A recent study published in Communications Medicine found that only 12.9% of individuals simultaneously attain the recommended 8,000 daily steps and 7-9 hours of sleep.

Moreover, the study showed that a lack of adequate sleep had a negative impact on physical activity the following day. These results suggest that obtaining adequate sleep could help improve physical activity levels.

Study's author Josh Fitton, a doctoral researcher at Flinders University, in Australia, told Medical News Today:

“We demonstrate in our large multinational sample that only a small fraction of people are able to attain sufficient sleep and adequate physical activity on a routine basis. In light of this, we stress the importance of considering the real-world compatibility of prominent public health guidelines related to sleep and physical activity.”

Studies have shown that both adequate sleep and physical activity are essential for maintaining optimal mental and physical health.

Lack of adequate physical activity and insufficient sleep have been independently shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, inflammation, and all-cause mortality.

Sleep and physical activity influence each other over a 24-hour period. Studies have shown that increased physical activity is associated with better sleep quality, while insufficient sleep the night before can lead to lower physical activity due to fatigue and hormonal disruptions. 

In addition, the combined pattern of time spent in sleeping, sedentary behavior, and physical activity together over a 24-hour period influences health outcomes.

For instance, the combination of a lack of adequate sleep and low physical activity is associated with increased risk of mortality. Thus, it is vital to simultaneously assess the time allocated to sleep and physical activity over a 24-hour period. 

Studies have shown that the number of daily steps can serve as a measure of physical activity, with higher daily step counts linked to lower risk of chronic conditions and mortality. 

These studies suggest that achieving a minimum of 8,000 steps daily can help reduce cardiovascular risk and lower overall mortality risk.

In individuals aged over 60 years, evidence suggests a minimum of 6,000 steps could be beneficial for maintaining optimal health, with the benefits plateauing with a further increase in stepping activity.

At the same time, the National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep for adults aged 18 to 64, and 7 to 8 hours for individuals aged 65 and older. 

Previous studies examining the interrelationship between sleep and exercise have been limited by small samples restricted to a single geographical region, reliance on self-reported sleep data, and short follow-up durations.

In the present study, the researchers used a large, multinational sample to evaluate the proportion of individuals who simultaneously attained the recommended hours of sleep and physical activity.

They also examined the interrelationship between sleep and daily step count over a 24-hour period.

The present study used health monitoring data collected over 3.5 years from 70,963 individuals residing in 244 geographical regions.

These individuals were users of consumer health tracking devices in the form of an under-mattress sleep sensor and a fitness tracker.

Based on data collected by the sleep sensor, the researchers calculated sleep duration, sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, a measure of time spent sleeping while in bed.

The researchers found that only 12.9% of the participants obtained 7-9 hours of sleep and also achieved at least 8,000 daily steps.

In contrast, 16.5% of participants simultaneously averaged less than 7 hours of sleep and 5,000 steps daily, the upper threshold for sedentary behavior. Furthermore, about 64% of individuals failed to achieve a combination of 7-9 hours of sleep and at least 5,000 daily steps. 

The researchers then examined how sleep metrics influenced daily step counts on the following day, and vice versa. The relationship between sleep duration and daily steps was characterized by an inverted U-shaped curve, with less than 6 hours and more than 9 hours of sleep being associated with a lower number of steps on the subsequent day.

Around 6-7 hours of sleep the night before was associated with the highest number of steps on the subsequent day. 

Latency to sleep had an inverse relationship with the number of daily steps, with the number of steps decreasing as the duration to fall asleep increased.

In contrast, sleep efficiency, the proportion of time in bed spent sleeping, showed a positive correlation with the number of steps on the following day. 

Higher daily step count was associated with a lower latency to sleep and a greater proportion of time spent sleeping while in bed. Interestingly, the impact of daily steps on these sleep metrics was small. 

Although the current study found a minimal impact of daily step count on sleep metrics, other studies suggest that physical activity, especially of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, influences sleep quality.

One of the reasons for the disparity between the aforementioned results and those of the present study could be that the fitness trackers used in the study did not record all forms of physical activity or other related parameters.

Fitton explained that “the step count metric used does not capture other forms of physical activity (e.g., swimming), and we were unable to assess the intensity and timing of the activity, which will be important to consider moving forward.”

“Our sample consisted of users of consumer-available health monitoring devices and, therefore, are likely to be of higher socio-economic status and/or health-conscious individuals. It is not a representative global sample,” he added.

The researchers note that the bidirectional relationship between physical activity and sleep underscores the need for public health interventions that could help individuals achieve both 7-9 hours of sleep and increase physical activity simultaneously, instead of targeting them individually.

Despite early responses to therapy, most patients eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This disease state is complex and evolving, and is generally defined by disease progression regardless of lowered testosterone levels achieved through previous therapy.

The majority of CRPC tumors remain driven by androgen receptor signaling. Targeting this marker significantly influences treatments of advanced forms of prostate cancer. Assessment of androgen receptor expression and genomic alterations is used to evaluate treatment and to identify tumors that have become less androgen-dependent. The androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7 is most common in metastatic CRPC. Along with androgen receptors and AR-V7, prostate-specific membrane antigen is frequently used in this setting.

Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can be evaluated in progressive or variant CRPC with metastasis, it is not as frequently utilized during evaluation for disease and treatment resistance. Recent data indicate that p63 can influence tumors and play a role in treatment resistance, but it is not as commonly utilized in this setting. E-cadherin can change during tumor progression, but it is not the most used immunohistochemical marker in this setting; further, it is usually downregulated during castration-resistant prostate cancer progression, and N-cadherin upregulation is more often associated with castration-resistant disease.

Evaluating serum levels can influence elements such as further treatment and management of disease. According to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, prostate cancer is considered castration-resistant when a patient previously treated with androgen therapy exhibits serum testosterone levels < 50 ng/dL. The guidelines also state, “Progression may present as either a continuous rise in serum [PSA] levels (values identified at a minimum of 1 week intervals with a minimal value of 2.0ng/mL, with estimations of PSA doubling time with at least 3 values measured ≥ 4 weeks apart), the progression of pre-existing or new radiographic disease, and/or clinical progression with symptoms.”

Learn more about prostate cancer diagnosis.

The AUA recommends both germline and somatic genetic testing for patients with metastatic CRPC. Ideally, this serves to aid in information-gathering to make treatment decisions (eg, determining eligible candidates for targeted therapy) and to help identify microsatellite instability status, tumor mutational burden, DNA repair deficiency, prognosis factors, and familial risk, which can also influence management.

Learn more about advanced prostate cancer presentation.

For patients with nonmetastatic CRPC, the AUA recommends obtaining prostate-specific antigen measurements at 3-to-6-month intervals. AUA also notes calculating PSA doubling time when castration resistance develops. Patients should also be assessed for metastatic disease using conventional or prostate-specific membrane antigen PET at intervals of 6-12 months.

Among individuals with metastatic CRPC, the site of visceral involvement carries significant prognostic value. Data indicate that liver metastases generally reflect more aggressive disease and shorter survival. Although liver and lung are both classified as visceral sites, patients with lung metastases tend to have a more favorable prognosis compared with patients who have liver metastases.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has become a critical focus in the evolving landscape of prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy. Once considered just a biomarker, PSMA currently serves as a significant diagnostic and therapeutic target, transforming how clinicians can detect, stage, and manage advanced disease.

Data indicate that PSMA expression rate is significantly increased in prostate cancer cells; specifically, its expression has been demonstrated to be up to 1000-fold higher. This overexpression has been linked to more aggressive disease, poorer outcomes, and resistance to hormone therapy. Further, the overexpression of PSMA has been shown to intensify tumor cell survival in folate-depleted conditions.

Though PSMA PET has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than standard bone scans, CT, and MRI; combining PSMA PET with multiparametric MRI can improve sensitivity when identifying seminal vesicle invasion and extraprostatic extension (compared with use of these modalities alone).

Learn more about prostate cancer.

PSMA PET-CT should be considered for staging in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. This modality is generally not indicated for initial screening or evaluation, including cases where elevated PSA is the only abnormal finding because its primary prostate cancer is ""not yet fully established."" However, current evidence supports its use as an initial staging tool in those with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.

Learn more about the workup of prostate cancer.

When determining whether a patient with prostate cancer is an appropriate candidate for PSMA-RLT, the number of lesions identified and their uptake levels on PSMA PET should be considered. Especially, experts state PSMA PET is ""utilized as a gatekeeper for PSMA-RLT."" The number of lesions detected and uptake levels can be linked to disease burden and PSMA expression, and higher PSMA expression on this imaging modality is associated with better PSMA-RLT response. Other than PSMA expression and related disease burden and location, treatment history can be utilized when determining candidacy and treatment outcomes.

Typically, age alone and patient occupation are not significant factors when determining candidacy and treatment outcomes for PSMA-RLT. Presumed disease burden based on conventional imaging is generally not utilized when determining if a patent is a candidate for PSMA-RLT, given these methods are not as sensitive and specific as combination MRI and PSMA PET.

Learn more about the treatments for prostate cancer.

Choline- and fluciclovine-based PET improved the detection of small lesions in patients with low serum PSA values compared with conventional imaging modalities; following this advancement, PSMA PET imaging has demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting recurrent prostate cancer following primary treatment (with surgery or radiation), in patients with or without BCR.

Data indicate that, compared with choline- and fluciclovine-based PET, PSMA PET can visualize smaller lesions and detect BCR at much lower PSA levels. Specifically, it has been shown to ""detect more [prostate cancer] in patients with BCR compared to choline- or fluciclovine-based PET after primary radiation or surgery.""

Learn more about the workup of prostate cancer.

PSMA-targeted RLT is recommended after patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor but before starting chemotherapy. However, data indicate that PSMA-targeted RLT used prior to androgen receptor pathway inhibitor treatment and chemotherapy might be beneficial in select cases. Patients without PSMA disease are usually not candidates for PSMA-target therapy.

Patients with PSMA-positive metastatic disease are initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy, potentially combined with other therapies such as androgen receptor pathway inhibitor or chemotherapy. PSMA-targeted RLT is typically not recommended as an initial treatment in this setting.

Greater exposure to extreme heat days (temperature > 100 °F) was associated with a higher prevalence of mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, across all US states than lower exposure, a new study showed.

“Our study underscores the growing public health threats posed by climate change,” the investigators wrote, adding that the findings align with previous research showing that “younger populations and communities with lower socioeconomic status, as measured by educational attainment, are disproportionately vulnerable to mental health issues.”

The study was led by Aneta Kwak, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Illinois. It was published online on December 6 in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

The 2022 mental health prevalence data may have been influenced by lingering effects of the COVID pandemic. Additionally, the study was unable to control for all potential confounding variables, including healthcare access, population density, regional climate adaptation policies, and availability of mental health resources. The study sample of 50 states may have limited the generalizability of the findings. 

The researchers reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

There is a great deal of excitement around microbiome research as it confirms, and debunks, long-held beliefs. Investigators have shown, for example, that proton-pump inhibitors can alter the microbiome's composition and that interventions such as fecal microbiota transplants may support engraftment of beneficial organisms. Yet these findings pose a challenge to gastroenterologists seeking to determine how best to translate into concrete clinical advice.

Despite this uncertainty, numerous at-home microbiome testing companies have already entered the market, offering kits to the public, typically priced between $100 and $500. Many are eligible for health savings accounts or flexible spending accounts, which may give an unwarranted sense of clinical legitimacy.

Because many companies also sell probiotics or prebiotics based on test findings, their utility can be misleading. At best, these tests reveal microbiome imbalances that prompt helpful dietary changes; at worst, they open the door to unnecessary purchases.

Gastroenterologists are increasingly fielding questions from patients about these at-home tests. This makes it more critical than ever to weigh their clinical value when deciding whether they have a role in medical decision-making.

Najwa El-Nachef, MD, a gastroenterologist at Henry Ford Health Hospital in Detroit told Medscape Medical News that diagnosing conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome requires far more than an at-home stool test.

For inflammatory bowel disease, clinicians still must obtain a detailed family history, evaluate symptoms, and perform a colonoscopy for direct visualization of inflammation. “Lab markers are supportive, but you need the endoscopic diagnosis,” she said. Irritable bowel syndrome is even more nuanced, she added, because it often does not appear endoscopically and is “almost always” a diagnosis of exclusion.

While diagnostic tools continue to evolve, at-home microbiome tests currently on the market are “not clinically validated” for these conditions, El-Nachef noted.

Max Brondfield, MD, a gastroenterologist at the University of California San Francisco, who specializes in celiac disease, agrees that these tests lack clinical value for diagnosing or treating this condition. They may, however, offer limited utility as part of a broader evaluation for suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

At-home microbiome tests analyze stool, which extrapolates information from across the entire intestinal tract. But the small intestine and colon have different biomes, Brondfield noted, limiting the precision of these tests. Even so a test can identify dysbiosis in the microbiome, leading gastroenterologists to order a SIBO breath test or adjust treatment in a patient already diagnosed with SIBO who is not improving.

In many cases though, a standard stool test ordered by a gastroenterologist provides equivalent or better clinical information.

“It's fair to say for most of the conditions I'm treating, a standard stool test will do,” Brondfield said.

At-home microbiome tests use varying sequencing methods, such as shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA sequencing. Crucially, they do not analyze metabolomics, a key component in understanding how the microbiome actually affects the gastrointestinal tract, El-Nachef noted.

Brondfield added that proprietary technologies used with these tests make it difficult to assess quality or transparency. Shotgun metagenomic analysis can be particularly oversensitive, leading to false positives for different infections.

“Shotgun metagenomics are capturing every scrap in [the intestinal track], and that's not necessarily relevant,” Brondfield said. “I generally prefer standardized lab tests because they're more transparent.”

However, Brondfield has ordered one type of at-home microbiome test, Genova Diagnostics, for some patients. Available by physician order only, this test serves as a diagnostic tool, and they only sell diagnostic tests, not supplements.

Both Brondfield and El-Nachef cautioned clinicians and patients to be skeptical of companies that use microbiome testing as a means of selling additional products.

“If someone is selling a probiotic, I would worry about that recommendation,” El-Nachef said.

She also stressed that “healthy” microbiomes vary widely by geography, diet, and genetics. Results with an at-home test can even differ by the day for some individuals depending on what they ate.

El-Nachef is encouraged by emerging research on fecal microbiota transplants for ulcerative colitis and potentially Crohn's disease, although the latter is comparatively less studied.

“Each paper on fecal transplant is a pearl of wisdom,” she said.

The wealth of incoming microbiome research can make it feel like “drinking from a firehose,” she noted, and it's going to take time to incorporate these at-home microbiome tests in a meaningful way. She estimated it will take years to reproduce evidence on the microbiome and disease states in enough patient cohorts for true validation.

El-Nachef believes that this gap in evidence leaves clinicians and patients vulnerable to commercial hype, with private companies selling these products “taking advantage of interest in the field,” especially given the lack of strong clinical guidance.

However, she reassured her colleagues that they are not missing out by exercising caution in how they approach at-home microbiome tests.

“I tell almost the same thing to all of my patients,” she said. “The test provides interesting insider information, and if you're interested in the data, you can do it, but it may not change our action plan.”

El-Nachef disclosed receiving grant funding from Takeda, AbbVie, and Abivax. Brondfield reported consulting for Ferring on behalf of REBYOTA.

 December 26, 2025  

A joint initiative led by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in cooperation with the European Commission released the fifth edition of the Country Health Profiles, offering a concise, policy-relevant assessment of health system performance across the European Union (EU), Iceland, and Norway.

Designed to support evidence-based policymaking and mutual learning, the profiles present a concise overview of health systems across Europe. They draw on comparable data covering population health status; behavioural and environmental risk factors; health system organisation and spending; and system effectiveness, accessibility, and resilience. Each country profile also includes a dedicated section on the pharmaceutical sector and national medicine policy.

Taken together, these profiles allow countries to be compared with EU averages across health outcomes, risk factors, health system performance, accessibility, resilience, and pharmaceutical use through an interactive dashboard.

At the European level, a Synthesis Report 2025 published with the country's health profiles highlights the major policy trends shaping health system reform.

Noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of preventable illnesses and deaths in the EU.

In 2022, an estimated 2.4 million years of productive life were lost, and more than 725,000 deaths could have been avoided. Reducing mortality from noncommunicable diseases could offset 12% of the projected decline in the EU workforce linked to population aging between 2022 and 2040.

Member states are responding with policies targeting the consumption of tobacco, nicotine, alcohol, obesity, and physical inactivity, particularly among younger populations. Ongoing policy adaptation is necessary to address emerging challenges, such as vaping and childhood obesity.

Primary care systems across the EU are in increasing demand because of an aging population, long-standing underinvestment, and workforce shortages.

Only 1 in 5 physicians in the EU are general practitioners. Simultaneously, more than one third of adults reported having a long-term illness in 2024, increasing to 60% among those aged 65 years or older.

In response, member states are implementing reforms to attract and retain primary care professionals and expand integrated care models aimed at improving access, patient-centred care, and system efficiency.

Pharmaceutical expenditure represents another growing pressure. In 2023, medicines accounted for approximately 60% of the total pharmaceutical spending and 13% of the overall health expenditure in the EU.

Against the backdrop of rising prices and demand, countries have introduced major pharmaceutical policy reforms between 2020 and 2025 to improve access and affordability, supported by updated EU pharmaceutical legislation and health technology assessment regulations.

Digital transformation of health systems has accelerated across the EU in the context of the COVID pandemic, the European Health Data Space, and the Artificial Intelligence Act.

Investment in health-related information and communication technologies has increased by approximately 30% since 2021, driven by the rising demand for care, workforce shortages, and policy efforts to promote innovation and highly skilled employment in health technology.

By the end of 2024, all EU member states had implemented electronic health record services. In 85% of countries, at least 80% of the population has the technical capacity to access electronic health records.

Within the European context, the health profile in Spain reports strong health outcomes and persistent structural challenges.

In 2024, Spain recorded its third highest life expectancy in the EU at 84 years. Life expectancy declined sharply between 2019 and 2020 because of COVID-related deaths before recovery. The gender gap in life expectancy, favouring women, was 5.3 years. In 2023, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for more than one quarter of all deaths.

Daily smoking among adults remained higher than that in most EU countries in 2020, although the rates have declined steadily since 2000.

Alcohol consumption increased after 2010, reaching 11.1 litres per adult in 2023, about 10% above the EU average. Adult obesity rates rose only slightly after 2017 and were in line with the EU average in 2022.

Health expenditure per capita in Spain reached €3137 in 2023, approximately one fifth below the EU average. Public spending remained the main source of financing, while out-of-pocket payments accounted for 21% of the total health expenditure compared with an EU average of 16%.

In 2022, Spain reported one of the lowest rates of preventable and treatable mortality in the EU, reflecting policies targeting behavioural risk factors and the impact of screening programs. The low hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure and diabetes suggest effective primary and integrated care delivery, although regional disparities remain.

Access to healthcare is generally good in Spain; however, workforce shortages may affect its availability in some regions. Spain has implemented strategic digital health initiatives and has increased funding in this area. A large proportion of the population schedules appointments and accesses their medical records online. Health remains a priority in the country's political agenda, and public spending on healthcare has increased over time.

Despite these strengths, one of the key challenges remains per capita spending on retail pharmaceuticals in Spain. This was below the EU average in 2023, accounting for 15% of total health expenditure. Although spending on retail medicines has declined over time, expenditures on medicines dispensed in hospitals have increased rapidly, partly because of the introduction of new and expensive medicines that are administered exclusively in hospitals.

The report also highlights workforce imbalances, with a relatively high number of physicians and a comparatively low number of nurses. In 2023, Spain had 4.4 physicians per 1000 population, slightly above the EU average of 4.3. Family physicians accounted for 22% of doctors, exceeding the EU average of 19%.

However, Spain faces significant challenges in its health workforce, including an aging workforce, uneven geographic distribution of health professionals, and a projected shortage of family physicians and other specialties, notably geriatrics, psychiatry, and radiology. Of concern is that, although the number of nurses has increased gradually in recent years, reaching 5.9 per 1000 population in 2023, this figure remains well below the EU average of 8.5 per 1000.

High induction doses of risankizumab — at double and quadruple the approved 150 mg dose — produced rapid and durable skin clearance in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis while significantly reducing tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) in the just-published phase 2 KNOCKOUT study led by Andrew Blauvelt, MD, MBA.

The small study randomized 20 patients to either 300 mg or 600 mg doses of the interleukin (IL)-23 blocker at weeks 0, 4, and 16. At weeks 28 and 52, 83% and 44% of all patients, respectively, achieved a Psoriasis Areas and Severity Index (PASI) 100 response with no new safety signals, Blauvelt and his co-investigators reported in Nature Communications.

Moreover, while only a minority of patients completed the entire follow-up period of 100 weeks' duration, it is “intriguing to note,” they reported, that four patients maintained PASI 90 and two patients remained completely clear at 100 weeks — 84 weeks after their last dose of risankizumab (Skyrizi), which is approved for treating plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

“This treatment strategy leads to higher short-term efficacy than what has been documented with any other psoriasis treatment, with no worrisome safety issues,” Blauvelt, of Blauvelt Consulting in Annapolis, Maryland, told Medscape Medical News in an e-mail interview. “And complete clearance lasts for a very long time due to knockout of resident memory T cells within the skin.”

Changes in the number and function of TRM cells, which have been shown in prior research to be dependent on IL-23 for their survival, was the primary outcome of the KNOCKOUT study. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of full-thickness skin biopsies performed at weeks 0 and 52 showed a marked reduction of TRM cells in lesional skin at week 52, with numbers that were similar to the number of nonlesional TRM cells at week 0, the authors reported in the study.

Asked to comment on the results, Christopher Griffiths, MD, a psoriasis expert who has written about curing psoriasis, said in an email that the study “confirms the ability of high-dose risankizumab to clear psoriasis” for the longer term in some patients with moderate-to-severe disease, “accompanied by normalization of numbers of CD8+ tissue resident memory T cells and pathogenic cytokines in the previously involved skin.”

“Both the clinical and immunological data point to a break or reversal of the immunological drive that determines persistence of psoriasis,” Griffiths, emeritus professor of dermatology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, and adjunct professor, King's College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

Also asked to comment on the results, Joel Gelfand, MD, MSCE, director of the psoriasis and phototherapy treatment center, at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, said the study “challenges clinical practice paradigms regarding dosing of risankizumab” for psoriasis.

“A remarkable aspect of IL-23 inhibition,” he said, “is that there does not appear to be safety issues with increasing doses.” Patients with ulcerative colitis “receive seven times the dose of risankizumab in the first year compared to the dose psoriasis patients receive,” he noted.

“The KNOCKOUT study provides initial evidence that higher doses of [the biologic] may achieve better outcomes for psoriasis patients, possibly mediated by a reduction in pathogenic memory T cells in the skin,” Gelfand said.

The phase 2 study findings come a decade after a phase 1 study of a single high dose of risankizumab revealed long-term clearance. In six of eight patients who entered an optional follow-up extension study, PASI 100 responses were sustained for up to 66 weeks, Blauvelt said during a grand rounds lecture titled “Curing Psoriasis” held at the Department of Dermatology, George Washington University (GWU) School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, D.C, in August 2025.

The new findings also build upon a study published in 2020 by Blauvelt and colleagues — the IMMhance study — which randomized patients to continuous risankizumab therapy vs treatment withdrawal at week 28. Doses were 150 mg — not higher. Still, approximately 10% of patients who were completely clear after three doses (weeks 0, 4 and 16) maintained their PASI 100 status at week 76 — over a year after the last dose.

In the new KNOCKOUT study (in which two patients remained completely clear at 100 weeks), it's unclear what factors led to the “super-response” in a couple of patients, Blauvelt said in the interview.

Other research published in recent years has shown that patients with a short disease duration (< 1-2 years) respond better to risankizumab and other IL-23 inhibitors than patients with a long duration of disease. But in the KNOCKOUT study, where the mean length of disease course upon entry was over 20 years, “we had only two short-disease duration patients and neither of them were super responders,” he said.

“I do believe, however, that treating short-disease duration patients with knockout therapy will lead to long-term remissions and potential cures in a subset of patients,” said Blauvelt, formerly the president of the Oregon Medical Research Center, who coined the term “KNOCKOUT.”

Blauvelt has long talked about a “hit hard, hit early” treatment approach. The KNOCKOUT study gets part-way there. “To me, ‘hit-hard, hit early' means treating patients with < 1 year disease duration and hitting with a higher-than-approved dose,” he said in the GWU presentation.

Future answers may lie in research being conducted by the biotechnology company Oruka Therapeutics on a new YTE-modified monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19, ORKA-001, Blauvelt said in the presentation.

YTE-modified antibodies have specific mutations that “allow increased binding affinity to FcRN (the neonatal Fc receptor) and allow for antibodies to be taken up by macrophages and spit back out and recycled back into the bloodstream, extending half-life,” he explained. Several YTE-modified antibodies have been approved, including one for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis (nirsevimab-alip).

In a phase 1 interim analysis presented at 2025 European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology (EADV) Congress, the mean half-life of ORKA-001 was found to be 100 days, more than triple that of risankizumab.

One phase 2 trial (EVERLAST-A) is underway, and another (EVERLAST-B) is scheduled to begin soon, with “knockout” dosing of 600 mg, with hopes of achieving once-yearly dosing. Patients with short disease duration are not being specifically recruited into either of these studies, Blauvelt said in the interview, and plans for phase 3 enrollment are under discussion now.

In the GWU lecture in August, Blauvelt expressed hope that a subset of short-disease-duration patients would be enrolled in the phase 3 research “so we'll be able to finally test this hypothesis of hit-hard, hit early.”

According to Griffiths, the KNOCKOUT study data “in part confirm our hypothesis that psoriasis may be curable using a combinatorial approach, one strand of which is high-dose biologics used early in the disease course.”

Griffiths described this combination, personalized approach, which includes early intervention with biologics, cell-based or advanced therapeutics, and lifestyle modification, in a 2024 perspective piece in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, titled “Curing Psoriasis” — a paper that Blauvelt has called “fascinating.” Cure is defined in the paper as clearance of psoriasis for at least 5 years following withdrawal of treatment.

Studies of cell-based or advanced therapeutics “probably [offer] the best chance of achieving cure,” Griffiths told Medscape Medical News. Studies of their “efficacy and ability to effect immune reset are now underway for severe psoriasis.”

Blauvelt sees early intervention with high-dose biologics as the most “accessible” strategy for now. “We can use what we have now in better ways with better outcomes,” he said in the GWU lecture.

The KNOCKOUT study's tissue findings bring increased understanding of the role of TRM cells in psoriasis recurrences and “explain in part the biological mechanisms underlying long-term psoriasis remissions after anti-IL-23 treatment,” Blauvelt and his co-authors wrote.

TRM cells are cells that develop in tissues in response to pathogen exposure and are responsible for protecting tissues from reinfection. “In the case of psoriasis, it's not memory to a pathogen but memory to autoimmune inflammation specific to the disease,” Blauvelt explained in the GWU lecture. “This is why psoriasis always comes back in that elbow or that knee.”

Among the reported tissue findings from the KNOCKOUT study in Nature Communications are downregulation of CD8+TRM17 cell numbers and function and normalization of inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes after high doses of risankizumab. All tissue data — including “what happens to cell types other than tissue resident memory T cells, such as keratinocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts” — have been submitted for publication in another journal, Blauvelt told Medscape Medical News.

The patient numbers in the KNOCKOUT study were too small, and baseline disease characteristics too unbalanced, to draw any definitive conclusions comparing remission with the two dosage groups, he and coauthors wrote in the paper.

The KNOCKOUT study was funded by AbbVie, which participated in the trial design, research, analysis, collection, and interpretation of data, and review and approval of the publication. Blauvelt disclosed that he is a scientific adviser/received honoraria from AbbVie and Oruka, among other companies, and he is a stockholder for Oruka. Gelfand disclosed he has served as a consultant for AbbVie, Oruka, and other companies. Griffiths disclosed receiving honoraria and/or research support from AbbVie, Amgen, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol Meyers Squibb, and other companies.

Maria Cristina Valsecchi

 December 26, 2025  

For years, a couple's reproductive failures were routinely blamed on the woman: If the longed-for child did not arrive, it was her “fault.” Today, evidence shows infertility factors are attributable to both partners in nearly equal measure, and specialty societies have outlined diagnostic pathways for each to identify obstacles and remove them when possible. In practice, however, the female partner often undergoes more extensive testing than the male partner before the couple is referred for assisted reproduction.

According to the latest report from Italy's Ministry of Health on the implementation of the country's assisted reproduction law, with 2022 data, the main infertility factor among couples who turn to assisted reproduction is female in 43.8% of cases, male in 19.9%, both male and female in 19.2%, and idiopathic (unexplained) in 16.2%.

In Italy, the umbrella term is medically assisted procreation (MAP), which covers all fertility interventions; assisted reproductive technology refers specifically to lab-based procedures like in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

“Infertility is defined as idiopathic when the couple has undergone the recommended diagnostic tests and no abnormality emerges that would explain the inability to conceive spontaneously,” said Luca Boeri, urologist and andrologist at Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. “Whereas any abnormalities found in tests performed on the male partner lead to a diagnosis of male infertility. However, in that 39.1% of cases in which a male infertility factor emerges — alone or combined with female infertility — the underlying causes are not always known.”

The ministry report details the proportions of female infertility due to endometriosis, tubal factor, diminished ovarian reserve, and other causes but provides no breakdown of male infertility causes. This imbalance partly reflects couples delaying their first pregnancy and, when conception takes longer, delaying medical help. As a result, today the workup often centers on the female partner's ovarian reserve, and when time is tight because of age, the pathway to MAP is accelerated to preserve the chances of success.

“The fact is that, in many infertile couples who access MAP, the male partner has undergone only a semen analysis,” Boeri said, “and is not always referred to an andrologist for a thorough assessment and to suggest therapies that could improve the chances of conception, both naturally and with MAP.”

The Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine outlined the recommended pathway for diagnosing male infertility in a 2022 consensus document. “It must be personalized case by case,” said Alberto Ferlin, MD, PhD, professor of endocrinology at the University of Padua, Padua, Italy, director of the Unit of Andrology and Reproductive Medicine at the University Hospital of Padua, and lead author of the document. “First-line testing recommended for everyone includes a medical history, physical exam, semen analysis, semen culture to diagnose possible infections, testicular ultrasound, and hormone assays. Based on the results of these initial tests, further evaluations can follow. In most cases, in-depth diagnostics make it possible to identify the origin of infertility and often to resolve it, allowing natural conception.” According to Ferlin, this should be the primary goal of reproductive medicine, as also provided by Italy's Law 40 (2004), which regulates assisted reproduction.

An in-depth diagnosis matters beyond reproduction. “Sometimes infertility is a warning sign of a general health problem,” said andrologist and endocrinologist Francesco Lombardo, MD, PhD, professor at Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. “We have seen infertile men sent to MAP without determining the causes of the problem, and later it emerged they had a tumor. Unlike women, who are used to periodic gynecologic checkups, few men see an andrologist during their lives. It would be advisable for all young men, around legal adulthood, to have a semen analysis, a testicular ultrasound, and an exam to diagnose any abnormalities early and preserve health and fertility.”

“The man with infertility who turns to an andrology specialist undergoes all the necessary tests to determine the origin of his problem,” Ferlin said. “Today, however, most couples who struggle to conceive go directly to an assisted reproduction center, and specialists at these facilities often do not pursue deeper investigations because they are focused on bypassing the cause with MAP.”

Law 40 requires an andrological evaluation of the male partner before entering a MAP pathway. It does not, however, specify in detail which tests must be performed.

“Often, even in large public hospitals, the andrologist works in another department and consults for the assisted reproduction center. He or she does not evaluate all patients who access the center, but only selected cases,” Boeri said. “What is needed instead is parallel care of both partners by the gynecologist and the andrologist for all infertile couples, even before they are referred to MAP.”

Recognition of the need for an equal approach to both partners led Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy — a major public academic medical center — to establish, in 2022, the Center for Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Infertility, with unique characteristics in Italy's public system.

“At our center, active for a couple of years, we manage the female and male partners in parallel to determine the causes of the couple's infertility,” said Linda Vignozzi, professor of endocrinology at the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, and head of the Andrology, Women's Endocrinology, and Gender Incongruence Unit at the center. “Once the causes are identified, we try to resolve them, and we resort to MAP only when it is not possible to remove the obstacles to natural conception, or when the woman's age makes rapid intervention necessary. Before the center was implemented, 90% of male partners reached MAP without an adequate andrological evaluation. Its launch now allows us to identify, in most cases, the underlying pathology of male infertility — often diabetes, hypertension, endocrine diseases, or hormonal alterations that can be effectively corrected.”

Lipoic acid (LA), an oral antioxidant supplement, was not associated with greater improvements in timed walking speed or other clinical outcomes in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to placebo in a new phase 2b trial. Although LA was linked to reduced whole-brain atrophy and stabilized deep gray matter volume, it was also associated with a potential risk for proteinuria.

Overall, LA “didn't work clinically in progressive multiple sclerosis the way we hoped,” lead investigator Rebecca Spain, MD, Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon, said in a press release. 

“However, the slowing of brain atrophy that we saw in MRI images suggests that we may yet be on the right track, especially if we can find a better way to deliver the beneficial effects of an antioxidant like lipoic acid,” Spain added.

The study was published online on December 15 in Neurology.

The study was potentially underpowered to detect clinically meaningful effects because of a modest sample size and missing data because of COVID-related interruptions. Enrollment of older, more disabled participants limited generalizability. In addition, a high rate of dropout and study discontinuation could have biased outcomes.

The study was funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, MS Canada, and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. Several investigators reported having consulting or other roles with and/or receiving grant support from various pharmaceutical companies and research organizations.

Cryopreserved platelets with a 2-year shelf life did not demonstrate noninferiority to conventional liquid-stored platelets in controlling bleeding after cardiac surgery, with the upper bound of the 95% CI indicating a potential increase in blood loss of up to 34%. Patients who received cryopreserved platelets experienced 42% higher intraoperative blood loss, with a greater proportion of these patients requiring transfusions of blood products.

“Cryopreserved platelets did not meet criterion for noninferiority to liquid-stored platelets in treating bleeding during and after cardiac surgery,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study, led by Michael C. Reade, MBBS, DPhil, Medical School, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, was published online in JAMA.

The findings were specific to high-risk cardiac surgery and may not be generalized to trauma, obstetric, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Cryopreserved platelets were reconstituted in fresh frozen plasma, while many liquid units were in platelet additive solution, which could have confounded comparisons. Additionally, a higher proportion of patients in the cryopreserved group received open-label liquid platelets before completing all study units, which may have reflected clinician perception or imperfect blinding.

The study received funding from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, and the Australian Defence Force through its 2011-2022 relationship with the University of Queensland. Two authors disclosed being employed with the Australian Defence Force, and three authors disclosed being employed with Australian Red Cross Lifeblood.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Pediatric surgeons weigh AI benefits against ethical challenges and practical barriers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251226/Pediatric-surgeons-weigh-AI-benefits-against-ethical-challenges-and-practical-barriers.aspx","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:33:00 GMT","

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing across modern healthcare, yet its role in pediatric surgery remains limited and ethically complex. This study reveals that although surgeons recognize AI's potential to enhance diagnostic precision, streamline planning, and support clinical decision-making, its practical use is still rare and mostly academic. Pediatric surgeons expressed strong concerns about accountability in the event of AI-related harm, the difficulty of obtaining informed consent for children, the risk of data privacy breaches, and the possibility of algorithmic bias. By examining pediatric surgeons' experiences and perceptions, this study highlights the critical barriers that must be addressed before AI can be safely and responsibly integrated into pediatric surgical care.

At present, throughout the world, AI is reshaping how medical data are interpreted, how risks are predicted, and how complex decisions are supported. Yet pediatric surgery faces unique ethical challenges due to children's limited autonomy, the need for parental decision-making, and the heightened sensitivity of surgical risks. In low-resource settings, concerns about infrastructure, data representativeness, and regulatory preparedness further complicate adoption. Pediatric surgeons must balance innovation with the obligation to protect vulnerable patients and maintain trust. These pressures intensify debates around transparency, fairness, and responsibility in the use of AI tools. It was with these challenges that a deeper research is needed to guide the ethical and practical integration of AI in pediatric surgical care.A national team of pediatric surgeons from the Federal Medical Centre in Umuahia, Nigeria, has released the first comprehensive survey examining how clinicians perceive the ethical and practical implications of integrating AI into pediatric surgical care. Published (DOI: 10.1136/wjps-2025-001089) on 20 October 2025 in the World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (WJPS), the study gathered responses from surgeons across all six geopolitical zones to assess levels of AI awareness, patterns of use, and key ethical concerns. The findings reveal a profession cautiously weighing AI's potential benefits against unresolved questions regarding accountability, informed consent, data privacy, and regulatory readiness.The study analyzed responses from 88 pediatric surgeons, most of whom were experienced consultants actively practicing across diverse clinical settings. Despite global momentum in AI-enabled surgical innovation, only one-third of respondents had ever used AI, and their use was largely restricted to tasks such as literature searches and documentation rather than clinical applications. Very few reported using AI for diagnostic support, imaging interpretation, or surgical simulation, highlighting a substantial gap between emerging technological capabilities and everyday pediatric surgical practice.Ethical concerns were nearly universal. Surgeons identified accountability for AI-related errors, the complexity of securing informed consent from parents or guardians, and the vulnerability of patient data as major sources of hesitation. Concerns also extended to algorithmic bias, reduced human oversight, and unclear legal responsibilities in the event of harm. Opinions on transparency with families were divided. While many supported informing parents about AI involvement, others felt disclosure was unnecessary when AI did not directly influence clinical decisions.Most respondents expressed low confidence in existing legal frameworks governing AI use in healthcare. Many called for stronger regulatory leadership, clearer guidelines, and standardized training to prepare pediatric surgeons for future AI integration. Collectively, the findings underscore an urgent need for structured governance and capacity building.""The results show that pediatric surgeons are not opposed to AI-they simply want to ensure it is safe, fair, and well regulated,"" the research team explained. ""Ethical challenges such as accountability, informed consent, and data protection must be addressed before clinicians can confidently rely on AI in settings involving vulnerable children. Clear national guidelines, practical training programs, and transparent standards are essential to ensure that AI becomes a supportive tool rather than a source of uncertainty in pediatric surgical care.""The study underscores the need for pediatric-specific ethical frameworks, clearer consent procedures, and well-defined accountability mechanisms for AI-assisted care. Strengthening data governance, improving digital infrastructure, and expanding AI literacy among clinicians and families will be essential for building trust. As AI continues to enter surgical practice, these measures offer a practical roadmap for integrating innovation while safeguarding child safety and public confidence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI model may help make liposuction safer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251226/AI-model-may-help-make-liposuction-safer.aspx","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:15:00 GMT","

A newly developed artificial intelligence (AI) model is highly accurate in predicting blood loss in patients undergoing high-volume liposuction, reports a study in the January issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer.

The development of an AI model to predict blood loss in liposuction is a ""groundbreaking advancement"" with the potential to improve patient safety and surgical outcomes, according to the new research, led by Mauricio E. Perez Pachon, MD, of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., and Jose T. Santaella, MD, of CIMA Clinic-Loja, Ecuador. ""By leveraging the power of AI-driven predictive models, surgeons can tailor their interventions to each patient's unique needs, ensuring optimal outcomes and minimizing the risk of complications such as excessive blood loss, the researchers write.

Liposuction is the most frequent cosmetic surgery procedure worldwide, performed in more than 2.3 million patients per year. Although liposuction is generally safe, excessive blood loss is a potentially serious complication, especially when higher volumes of fat are removed. AI-based tools have been developed to prevent blood loss in various medical specialties and surgical procedures, such as spinal, orthopedic, and trauma surgery.

Drs. Perez Pachon and Santaella and colleagues used machine learning technologies to analyze data from 721 patients undergoing large-volume liposuction, with a total volume of over 4,000 milliliters (four liters) of fat and fluid removed. All procedures were carried out at two clinics, one in Colombia and one in Ecuador, following identical liposuction protocols.

Data from a random sample of 621 patients were used to develop a model for predicting estimated blood loss, incorporating a wide range of demographic, clinical, and surgical data. The researchers then tested their model's performance in predicting the volume of blood loss in the remaining 100 patients.

The results showed ""excellent agreement"" between the predicted and estimated blood loss volumes, with a standard deviation (variation around the average) of 26 milliliters. The maximum difference between predicted and actual blood loss was about 188 mL, while the minimum difference was just 0.22 mL.

Overall, the AI tool was 94% accurate in predicting blood loss. ""Such accuracy reinforces the model's potential as a decision-support tool in body contouring procedures, where anticipating intraoperative blood loss is crucial for patient safety and operative planning,"" the researchers write. ""[S]urgeons can use the predicted blood loss estimates to make informed decisions about perioperative management, such as the need for blood transfusions, fluid management, and other critical care measures.""

""This proactive approach can significantly reduce the incidence of adverse events, improve recovery times, and contribute to better patient education and informed consent processes,"" Drs. Perez Pachon and Santaella conclude.

The researchers plan additional studies to refine their AI model, including further training with data from surgeons worldwide. Dr Perez Pachon comments: ""We believe that future research into AI technology has limitless potential to enhance patient safety, and we look forward to continued development in this area.""

Large language models (LLMs) have become crucial tools in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, as the user base expands and the frequency of usage increases, deploying these models incurs significant computational and memory costs, limiting their potential to serve as foundational infrastructure for human society. Moreover, current LLMs generally lack interpretability: their opaque decision-making and optimization processes make it challenging to ensure reliability and fairness in high-risk domains such as healthcare and finance. In contrast, the human brain performs complex tasks with less than 20 watts of power while exhibiting remarkable transparency in its cognitive processes. This stark contrast underscores the gap between LLMs and human cognition and presents a dual challenge: on one hand, improving the computational efficiency of LLMs is essential to enhance energy efficiency and conserve resources; on the other hand, enhancing their interpretability is crucial to better understand the interactions and functions of components in large-scale systems.
To overcome the interdisciplinary bottleneck, this study proposes a unified framework that transforms conventional LLMs into NSLLMs by performing integer spike counting and binary spike conversion, while incorporating a spike-based linear attention mechanism. This framework bridges neuroscience and large language models, offering a platform for the application of neuroscience tools to LLMs. By introducing integer training with binary inference, the outputs of standard LLMs are converted into spike representations, allowing neuroscience tools to analyze the information processing.

To validate the energy efficiency of the approach, the study implements a custom MatMul-free computing architecture for a billion-parameter-scale model on an FPGA platform. Specifically, a layer-wise quantization strategy and hierarchical sensitivity metrics are used to assess the impact of each layer on quantization loss, enabling the configuration of an optimal mixed-timestep spike model that achieves competitive performance under low-bit quantization. In addition, a quantization-assisted sparsification strategy is introduced to reshape the membrane potential distribution and shift the quantization mapping probability toward lower integer values, significantly reducing the spike firing rate and further improving model efficiency. On the VCK190 FPGA, a MatMul-free hardware core is designed that completely eliminates matrix multiplication operations in the NSLLM, reducing dynamic power consumption to 13.849 W and increasing throughput to 161.8 tokens/s. Compared with an A800 GPU, this approach achieves 19.8× higher energy efficiency, 21.3× memory savings, and 2.2× higher inference throughput.

By transforming the behavior of LLMs into neural dynamical representations-such as spike trains-through the NSLLM framework, we can analyze both the dynamic properties of their neurons (e.g., randomness quantified by Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy) and their information-processing characteristics (e.g., Shannon entropy and mutual information). This enables a clearer interpretation of the computational roles played by NSLLMs. Experimental results show that the model encodes information more effectively when processing unambiguous text, allowing it to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous inputs (for example, the middle layers exhibit higher normalized mutual information for ambiguous sentences; the AS layer shows distinct dynamical signatures that reflect its role in sparse information processing; and the FS layer has higher Shannon entropy, indicating stronger information transmission capacity. Moreover, the positive correlation between mutual information and Shannon entropy suggests that layers with higher information capacity are better at preserving key input features) . By integrating neural dynamics with information-theoretic measures, this framework provides biologically inspired interpretability for LLM mechanisms while significantly reducing data requirements.

Neuroscience research has shown that the human brain achieves energy-efficient information processing through sparse and event-driven computation, enhancing both communication efficiency and system interpretability. Building on this principle, the team developed an interdisciplinary unified framework that introduces a neuromorphic alternative to traditional LLMs, while delivering performance on par with mainstream models of similar scale across common-sense reasoning and a range of more complex large-model tasks-including reading comprehension, world knowledge question answering, and mathematics. This framework not only advances the frontier of energy-efficient AI, but also offers new perspectives on the interpretability of large language models and provides valuable insights for the design of future neuromorphic chips.

Encouraging people to get vaccinated is often seen as a public health success story. However, understanding how persuading people to roll up their sleeves to receive vaccines creates social division is crucial. Particularly in a post COVID-19 world, where attitudes about infection control have may influence conflict.

Recent research, published in Vaccine: X highlights the recent efforts of a team from The University of Osaka, as their study aimed to better understand the relationship between vaccine messaging and social harmony. The findings suggest that common justifications used to promote COVID-19 vaccination can unintentionally worsen hostility between people who are for and against vaccination.The team conducted four repeated online surveys between July 2023 and April 2024, after the COVID-19 emergency phase had officially ended. More than 13,000 adults from eight countries: Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, South Korea, Germany, Italy, and South Africa took part. The participants were asked about their reasons for supporting vaccination, their intention to be vaccinated in the future, and their feelings toward people who held opposing views.The results show a striking trade-off: higher vaccination intent and support for vaccine promotion was linked to ideas of self-protection, preventing harm to others, protecting society as a whole, and following social norms. However, these same ideas were also associated with stronger negative attitudes toward people who disagreed with vaccination, particularly among those who already supported it.""Public health communication often assumes that stronger moral or social arguments are always better,"" says lead author, Tomoyuki Kobayashi. ""Our findings show that these messages can be double-edged swords. They motivate action, but they can also deepen social divisions.""Senior author Asako Miura explains further, ""When people see vaccination as a moral duty or a collective responsibility, those who opt out can come to be viewed as irresponsible or threatening. That perception can fuel social conflict, even after the immediate health crisis has passed.""Interestingly, there was one exception. The possibility of penalties for not being vaccinated did not influence vaccination intent, but having consequences did appear to reduce hostility towards those with opposing views on vaccinations.""This was a surprising finding,"" says Miura. ""While penalties are controversial, they may reduce interpersonal resentment by addressing fairness concerns, rather than placing moral blame on individuals.""The study arrives at a critical moment, as COVID-19 increasingly becomes a matter of personal choice rather than emergency response. The researchers observed that while general approval of vaccination remained relatively stable, willingness to get vaccinated in the future declined steadily over time.The results suggest that public health messaging needs to do more than just encourage vaccination compliance. Long-term consequences, such as social fragmentation, must also be considered to prepare the public to respond appropriately for future infectious disease outbreaks.

Craig Burley slams FIFA over World Cup ticket prices and 'The Best' awards. (2:10)

For the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF), there are myriad presumed benefits for hosting a FIFA World Cup. There is the attention that the event will bring to the sport of soccer, driving interest not only in the U.S. men's national team, but trickling beyond that to the nation's clubs all the way down to the youth team level, where the hope is that children will be inspired to participate at increasing levels.

Yet for the USSF, there is also a more practical benefit, namely the $100 million that it expects to receive from FIFA.

Multiple sources have told ESPN that as part of the agreement that the host countries struck with FIFA for hosting the 2026 World Cup, the federations of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. expect to receive 1% of the tournament's gross revenues. This amount will be split across the three countries. With tournament revenues forecasted to reach $13 billion, along with the fact that the U.S. is hosting 75% of the matches, the expectation of the USSF is that it will receive $100 million.

But more money leads to more questions. For one, how does the financial haul in 2026 compare to the last time the USSF hosted the World Cup back in 1994? And, more importantly, what does the USSF plan to do with that additional windfall?

Suffice to say, 1994 wasn't just a different world, but a different World Cup. There was huge skepticism that the USSF could pull off a successful tournament, and not just from people outside the country. The USSF itself was so concerned about the financial risks involved that it organized the World Cup via local committees, which insulated it from any monetary downside. Ticketing revenue was the primary income stream, with any surplus going to a foundation set up after the tournament.

""I guess I was a cockeyed optimist,"" then-USSF president Alan Rothenberg said. ""The federation thought [the World Cup] was going to be a loser, which is why they set up the separate entity and why they agreed to let any surplus go to the foundation because they didn't expect a surplus.

""I guess I should have been a little bit more analytical on the likelihood of success, but I knew how great the World Cup is. I knew that the United States loves a big event, and so if we could make sure that this was perceived as a big event, it would get the attention of people over and above just the core soccer fans.""

The 1994 World Cup exceeded all expectations, setting attendance records (both total and per-game average) for the FIFA tournament that stands to this day, but is expected to be broken during the 2026 edition given the expansion to 48 teams. Keep in mind, this 1994 record was set in a 24-team tournament and not even expansion to 32 teams, which started in 1998, was enough to break it.

According to former USSF president Sunil Gulati, who also served as the executive vice president of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee, the tournament brought in a surplus of around $51 million, $5 million of which was loaned to MLS as seed money to get it up and running. Including interest, the amount eventually turned over to the U.S. Soccer Foundation was closer to $60 million.

At first glance, it might appear that the USSF will make more money from the 2026 edition, but when adjusted for inflation, $60 million in 1994 is worth $131 million today. It's worth noting that the organization of the World Cup is very different this time around.

For 2026, FIFA has implemented what Gulati calls ""the UEFA model,"" one championed by FIFA president -- and former UEFA general secretary -- Gianni Infantino. As was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, the organization is centralized within FIFA, eschewing a local organizing committee in favor of dealing with the venue cities directly. That allows FIFA to keep more of tournament's revenues for itself, though it has created some financial issues for the venue cities, and the structure directs money to FIFA that would be reinvested in the U.S. instead. This is similar to what happened when the U.S. hosted multiple editions of the Copa America. In 2016 there was a local organizing committee, but it was more centralized by CONMEBOL in 2024.

The $100 million the USSF is expecting to gain is still a significant chunk of change, but as Gulati put it, ""It's not make-or-break money anymore [for the USSF]. What is make-or-break is the ability to take the sport to a higher level.""

USSF CEO JT Batson isn't content to just take the sport to a higher level. His ambition is to make soccer the ""most played sport in the country.""

According to the National Sporting Goods Association, soccer has 15.8 million participants, trailing both basketball (23.9 million) and golf (21.6 million). To achieve its goal, the USSF has created a foundation, called Soccer Forward, which, with the help of the funds obtained via the 2026 World Cup, is hoping to make the game more accessible. Pay-to-play has long been a scourge of the U.S. soccer development system, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds often priced out of the sport.

Batson aims to address that.

""What is exciting about the $100 million is that we'll be able to use it for very targeted investments in participation and growing-the-game types of initiatives,"" Batson said. ""And these are things that don't have natural business models. And so being able to use philanthropic funds, which of course we've grown a lot of those as well as legacy funds from the World Cup, that allows us to really accelerate our investment in that.

""Ultimately our goal is to have a very large endowment that is focused specifically on participation, access, growth of the game. And this $100 million will be an awesome jumpstart to that.""

What Batson is proposing is a massive undertaking. The U.S. has more than 340 million people, spread across four time zones. Getting various stakeholders to buy in to the extent necessary is difficult in the best of times, and the competition from other sports remains intense. For that reason, the USSF's plan invites some skepticism, both in terms of determining the bar for success, as well as what a national federation can achieve.

""[Growing soccer] is very much pushing at an open door,"" said Stefan Szymanski, author of the book ""Soccernomics"" and a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan. ""The sport is growing in popularity. A lot of parents don't want their kids to play [American] football anymore. They'd much rather play soccer. It's kind of shrewd for the federation to say 'oh, we're promoting soccer' because soccer is going to grow.""

Szymanski added, ""I think we ought to be realistic here though about the limits of this. To create a level playing field, if I may use that expression, one really would need thousands and thousands of fields across the country, and the amount of money that U.S. Soccer is going to put in is going to be a drop in the ocean in relation to that.""

Batson is aware that the USSF's impact will be limited, both in terms of programming and finances. Reaching his goal will take far more investment than the $100 million from the World Cup, more than the $50 million in fundraising it achieved for the fiscal period ending on March 31, 2025. That is why he is attempting to build a coalition of stakeholders -- one that includes pro leagues, youth clubs, school districts, as well as state and local governments -- that can work together to not only draw kids and families into the sport, but keep them there. Much of this falls under the umbrella of the USSF's ""Soccer Everywhere For Everyone"" initiative, as well as the federation's Pathway Strategy from recreational to competitive to pre-professional to professional.

""A lot of people play soccer in this country. That also means if you want to make it easier, more affordable and more accessible, that ultimately is hundreds of millions of dollars a year that you need to be able to flow back to the ecosystem,"" Batson said. ""And so U.S. Soccer will be able to play a role in that, but also, we need local governments. We need school districts. We need local businesses and community organizations leaning in.

""The heart of the Soccer Forward strategy is focused on how are we bringing all these people together to be able to make it to where soccer is much cheaper, much more accessible, and ultimately more fun so that millions and millions more people can go play it.""

Batson said the USSF has studied anti-smoking and anti-drunk driving initiatives to get a sense of how the USSF's programs can be impactful at every level of the soccer ecosystem. He looked at what the national organizations were, as well as local activations. What were the coalitions at the local and national level that led to change in behavior -- or in soccer's case, interest -- on a massive scale?

""We did a whole lot of research on that before we designed the approach to Soccer Forward, because we believed that to deliver soccer at scale, at the sort of price point to where everyone can do it, it's going to take everybody working together on that,"" Batson said. ""And so far, people are really excited. Everyone's leaning in, good early progress, but this is a huge-scale effort, and that's also what makes it fun.""

The connection with anti-drunk driving initiatives seems specious at first glance, but Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), sees some similarities. In her experience, having repeated, consistent messaging is critical to growing support and awareness. Finding a shared purpose is critical, and patience will be needed as well. MADD has been in existence for 45 years, and is still going strong.

For Stewart, the biggest key of all is storytelling. MADD got its start in 1980 when Candace Lightner's daughter Cari was killed by a drunken driver as she walked to a church carnival. That story of loss resonated across the country. Obviously, Batson and the rest of the USSF are telling a different type of story, but one where soccer can be ""a force for good,"" as Batson said.

""I think the storytelling is huge because storytelling is so compelling across social media,"" Stewart said. She added, ""It's the power of stories, individual stories, that creates that spark where people begin to see themselves in other people's stories, and that connection starts to happen.""

One current story the USSF can tell relates to its Soccer at Schools initiative. It is made up of a toolkit that aims to provide soccer advocates the ability to start soccer programs at schools, and address issues like funding, connecting with schools, assessing facilities, as well as activities for participants.

The Rosati Leadership Academy in Lewiston, Maine, started an after-school indoor soccer program at Connors Elementary School that operates five days a week, a lifeline to an economically disadvantaged community. Beyond soccer, the program emphasized social and emotional learning for the 200 students per year that took part, with student behavior and performance both showing improvement.

It might feel like a drop in the bucket, but it speaks to the kinds of programs the USSF is looking to replicate as they cast a wider net to get children involved in the sport. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson said that the USSF would announce additional school programs in the spring, with a rollout in the fall.

Harry Kane speaks about England's hopes of winning the World Cup and the pressure of being one of the favourites.

Facilities are part of the puzzle as well. Colder climates will require indoor fields, while urban environments require hard-top mini-pitches given that green space is often at a premium. Then there is the insatiable appetite for full-sized fields. Batson indicated that the USSF has armed soccer advocates with information and data to convince local politicians that sports fields are a good investment.

But such projects require plenty of heavy lifting.

Beverly Smith is the vice president for sports and youth development with Local Initiatives and Support Corporation, a nonprofit that helps facilitate housing and economic development in underserved communities. Smith's focus is on building sports fields in those locales, and is currently working with the Arthur M. Blank Foundation to build 100 mini-pitches across the state of Georgia. (Note: Smith has also teamed with ESPN to build a mini-pitch at East Point Station in Atlanta.)

Smith notes that a successful project isn't just about building the facility; there has to be a maintenance plan to ensure its long-term viability. Then there is the coalition building at the local level to ensure success. The USSF said it has agreements with local entities to handle the maintenance aspect, but Smith indicated that the Federation needs to stay connected to these projects.

""For the U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build a coalition around this, it really requires that you have your finger on the pulse of what's happening on the ground and where you want to put this and hear the voices of everybody,"" Smith said.

Just how deeply involved the USSF will be in such projects remains to be seen. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson told ESPN that there is dedicated staff within Soccer Forward that is focused on these endeavors. The same is true of its success in coalition building. The level of intentionality required seems vast, although the infrastructure provided by youth clubs and state associations is already in place, and will help in the process.

Will the USSF be an active or passive partner? The scope of Batson's vision demands the latter approach. Whether the level of execution follows is to be determined. Either way, the hope is that the USSF can make the $100 million windfall from next summer's World Cup count.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

That is why he is attempting to build a coalition of stakeholders -- one that includes pro leagues, youth clubs, school districts, as well as state and local governments -- that can work together to not only draw kids and families into the sport, but keep them there. Much of this falls under the umbrella of the USSF's ""Soccer Everywhere For Everyone"" initiative, as well as the federation's Pathway Strategy from recreational to competitive to pre-professional to professional.

""A lot of people play soccer in this country. That also means if you want to make it easier, more affordable and more accessible, that ultimately is hundreds of millions of dollars a year that you need to be able to flow back to the ecosystem,"" Batson said. ""And so U.S. Soccer will be able to play a role in that, but also, we need local governments. We need school districts. We need local businesses and community organizations leaning in.

""The heart of the Soccer Forward strategy is focused on how are we bringing all these people together to be able to make it to where soccer is much cheaper, much more accessible, and ultimately more fun so that millions and millions more people can go play it.""

Batson said the USSF has studied anti-smoking and anti-drunk driving initiatives to get a sense of how the USSF's programs can be impactful at every level of the soccer ecosystem. He looked at what the national organizations were, as well as local activations. What were the coalitions at the local and national level that led to change in behavior -- or in soccer's case, interest -- on a massive scale?

""We did a whole lot of research on that before we designed the approach to Soccer Forward, because we believed that to deliver soccer at scale, at the sort of price point to where everyone can do it, it's going to take everybody working together on that,"" Batson said. ""And so far, people are really excited. Everyone's leaning in, good early progress, but this is a huge-scale effort, and that's also what makes it fun.""

The connection with anti-drunk driving initiatives seems specious at first glance, but Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), sees some similarities. In her experience, having repeated, consistent messaging is critical to growing support and awareness. Finding a shared purpose is critical, and patience will be needed as well. MADD has been in existence for 45 years, and is still going strong.

For Stewart, the biggest key of all is storytelling. MADD got its start in 1980 when Candace Lightner's daughter Cari was killed by a drunken driver as she walked to a church carnival. That story of loss resonated across the country. Obviously, Batson and the rest of the USSF are telling a different type of story, but one where soccer can be ""a force for good,"" as Batson said.

""I think the storytelling is huge because storytelling is so compelling across social media,"" Stewart said. She added, ""It's the power of stories, individual stories, that creates that spark where people begin to see themselves in other people's stories, and that connection starts to happen.""

One current story the USSF can tell relates to its Soccer at Schools initiative. It is made up of a toolkit that aims to provide soccer advocates the ability to start soccer programs at schools, and address issues like funding, connecting with schools, assessing facilities, as well as activities for participants.

The Rosati Leadership Academy in Lewiston, Maine, started an after-school indoor soccer program at Connors Elementary School that operates five days a week, a lifeline to an economically disadvantaged community. Beyond soccer, the program emphasized social and emotional learning for the 200 students per year that took part, with student behavior and performance both showing improvement.

It might feel like a drop in the bucket, but it speaks to the kinds of programs the USSF is looking to replicate as they cast a wider net to get children involved in the sport. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson said that the USSF would announce additional school programs in the spring, with a rollout in the fall.

Harry Kane speaks about England's hopes of winning the World Cup and the pressure of being one of the favourites.

Facilities are part of the puzzle as well. Colder climates will require indoor fields, while urban environments require hard-top mini-pitches given that green space is often at a premium. Then there is the insatiable appetite for full-sized fields. Batson indicated that the USSF has armed soccer advocates with information and data to convince local politicians that sports fields are a good investment.

But such projects require plenty of heavy lifting.

Beverly Smith is the vice president for sports and youth development with Local Initiatives and Support Corporation, a nonprofit that helps facilitate housing and economic development in underserved communities. Smith's focus is on building sports fields in those locales, and is currently working with the Arthur M. Blank Foundation to build 100 mini-pitches across the state of Georgia. (Note: Smith has also teamed with ESPN to build a mini-pitch at East Point Station in Atlanta.)

Smith notes that a successful project isn't just about building the facility; there has to be a maintenance plan to ensure its long-term viability. Then there is the coalition building at the local level to ensure success. The USSF said it has agreements with local entities to handle the maintenance aspect, but Smith indicated that the Federation needs to stay connected to these projects.

""For the U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build a coalition around this, it really requires that you have your finger on the pulse of what's happening on the ground and where you want to put this and hear the voices of everybody,"" Smith said.

Just how deeply involved the USSF will be in such projects remains to be seen. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson told ESPN that there is dedicated staff within Soccer Forward that is focused on these endeavors. The same is true of its success in coalition building. The level of intentionality required seems vast, although the infrastructure provided by youth clubs and state associations is already in place, and will help in the process.

Will the USSF be an active or passive partner? The scope of Batson's vision demands the latter approach. Whether the level of execution follows is to be determined. Either way, the hope is that the USSF can make the $100 million windfall from next summer's World Cup count.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

MADRID, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- In a year without a major men's international tournament, club football dominated the headlines, with Paris Saint-Germain emerging as one of the standout winners.

PSG capped the season by winning the UEFA Champions League in late May with a 5-0 rout of Inter Milan, as coach Luis Enrique underlined the value of cohesion over a collection of star names. The former Spain coach has built a side that blends technical quality with pace and aggression, and after years of domestic dominance, PSG fully justified its first European crown.

Ousmane Dembele set the tone and was later named Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA Best Men's Player. Despite a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea in the FIFA Club World Cup final, PSG looks well-placed to maintain its grip on French football and mount another Champions League challenge.

In England, Liverpool stormed to the Premier League title in Arne Slot's first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp. However, after heavy summer spending, expectations of further dominance have given way to a difficult campaign, with new signings struggling to gel and Slot facing growing pressure.

Barcelona enjoyed a successful first season under Hansi Flick, winning La Liga despite strict financial limits and playing home matches at the former Olympic Stadium while Camp Nou undergoes renovation. Lamine Yamal drew the biggest headlines, but Flick also earned credit for elevating players such as Raphinha, Pedri, Fermin Lopez and Ferran Torres. Barcelona ends 2025 top of La Liga again and hoping to contend in Europe, with a return to Camp Nou expected to ease financial strain.

Real Madrid endured a more turbulent year. Carlo Ancelotti's side missed out on the league title and exited the Champions League in the quarterfinals last season, before Xabi Alonso took over ahead of the Club World Cup. Madrid was then outclassed by PSG in the semifinals, and the year ends amid reports of dressing-room unrest and renewed questions over Alonso after poor results.

Elsewhere, Bayern Munich reclaimed the Bundesliga title, while Napoli sealed Serie A with a 2-0 win over Cagliari in the final round.

The expanded Club World Cup reinforced European strength in the global game - and the prize money distribution that sustains it. Five European clubs reached the quarterfinals along with Brazil's Fluminense and Palmeiras and Saudi side Al-Hilal. Fluminense beat Al-Hilal before losing to Chelsea in the semifinals, while Chelsea produced a strong final to defeat a fatigued PSG.

The tournament also raised concerns about player workload, with many heading into a long season without a proper summer break ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Extreme heat and storms that forced temporary stoppages also offered a warning for next summer.

Looking ahead, Spain goes into 2026 World Cup preparations as one of the leading contenders after an impressive qualifying campaign, while Thomas Tuchel appears to be gradually stamping his authority on England. Argentina is also expected to challenge, although there are doubts over whether Lionel Messi will be involved.

Messi continued to make headlines in the United States as Inter Miami won the MLS title, with Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets also playing key roles. In South America, Flamengo lifted the Copa Libertadores, with Filipe Luis enhancing his reputation as one of the continent's most promising young coaches.

Al-Hilal's Club World Cup run and Al-Ahli's AFC Champions League title underlined the impact of big spending in the Saudi Pro League, although questions remain over whether the league's rise reflects imported stars or genuine local development.

England rose to the top of the women's game after defeating world champions Spain in the European Championship final, before Spain gained some consolation under new coach Sonia Bermudez by beating Germany to win the UEFA Nations League in December.  ■","{'href': 'https://english.news.cn', 'title': 'Xinhua'}","soccer"

                  A study published in the International Journal of Biometeorology in January warned of “serious concern” for the health of players and match officials at the 2026 World Cup due to extreme heat.

With less than six months to go before the 2026 World Cup kicks off, organisers are bracing for what could be their most challenging opponent yet: extreme heat.

Soaring temperatures across the United States, Mexico and Canada pose safety issues for players and fans and a host of logistical issues that remain far from settled.

In the depths of the $5.5 billion SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, which will host eight World cup matches, around 15 industrial misting fans more than two meters sit in storage, waiting to be deployed. If temperatures climb above 80F (26.7C), the fans will be rolled out around the stadium.

A roof suspended some 45 meters above the SoFi Stadium pitch offers some shade for spectators, while large openings along the sides of the stadium allow for breezes from the nearby Pacific Ocean to provide a form of natural air conditioning.

“Knowing that you can put 70,000 people into a building, the energy, the excitement, the activity that comes with that, and the higher temperature, that's where we want to make sure we respond,” Otto Benedict, vice president of operations for the company that manages the stadium, told AFP.

Not all of the World Cup's 16 stadiums are as modern. And Southern California is not considered to be among the highest-risk areas for a competition scheduled from June 11 to July 19, three and a half years after a winter World Cup in Qatar.

A study published in the International Journal of Biometeorology in January warned of “serious concern” for the health of players and match officials at the 2026 World Cup due to extreme heat.

The study identified six “high-risk” host cities: Monterrey, Miami, Kansas City, Boston, New York and Philadelphia.

The “Pitches in Peril” report by the Football for Future non-profit noted that in 2025 those cities each recorded at least one day above 35C on the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) scale, which factors in humidity and is considered the upper limit of human heat tolerance.

The issue of heat featured prominently at this year's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, which drew complaints from players and coaches.

Extreme heat also marked the 1994 World Cup, the last men's edition held in the United States.

FIFA has responded by mandating cooling breaks in the 22nd and 67th minutes of all matches at the World Cup, regardless of conditions.

The World Cup match schedule released after December's draw in Washington shows daytime games largely assigned to air-conditioned stadiums in Dallas, Houston and Atlanta, while higher-risk venues are set to host evening kickoffs.

“You can clearly see an effort to align the competition schedule planning and venue selection with the concerns around player health, but also player performance,” a spokesperson for the FIFPro players union told AFP. “This is a clear outcome, which we welcome, and a lesson learned from the Club World Cup.”

FIFPRO says the biggest takeaway is that heat will play an increasingly central role in organizing competitions on a warming planet.

The union believes though that several World Cup fixtures remain “high-risk” and recommends postponements when WBGT readings exceed 28C.

Among those fixtures causing FIFPro concern: group-stage matches scheduled for mid-afternoon in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, as well as the final, set for a 3:00 p.m. kickoff in New York.

While teams and players work to mitigate effects of the conditions, some officials say the risks to spectators both inside stadiums and in fan zones have been underestimated.

“There is a risk and importantly, we feel like it's an underappreciated risk,” said Chris Fuhrmann, deputy director of the Southeast Regional Center of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“When you're cheering, you're actually generating a lot of metabolic heat and your heart rate's going up. Spectators obviously compared to professional athletes are generally not in as good physical health.

“They have a lot of comorbidities that increase the likelihood that they would have a negative health outcome or succumb to heat stress.”

Stadium temperatures are also amplified by the “urban heat island” effect of concrete, asphalt and metal.

Adequate air circulation, plenty of shaded areas and access to hydration are crucial, Fuhrmann said -- though hydration is often undermined by alcohol consumption.

FIFA has yet to clarify whether fans will be allowed to bring refillable water bottles into venues or whether water will be sold inside. FIFA did not respond to requests for comment.

For National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott, who has advised FIFA and its World Cup task force, the priority is prevention, particularly for foreign visitors unfamiliar with local climates.

Another lesson from the Club World Cup, he said, is the need for multilingual messaging to ensure heat-safety warnings are clearly understood.

“The lesson learned is just trying to maybe better educate fans as they come to the United States to have a better understanding of what the weather could be like during those two months,” Schott said.

'We welcome you' - Wahl on World Cup pride match

A member of the advisory committee for the controversial 2026 World Cup Pride Match has said he hopes Fifa ""does the right thing"" by allowing planned celebrations to continue, after they called on visitors to ""respect the culture"" in Qatar four years ago.

Local organisers in Seattle have designated the World Cup match between Egypt and Iran at Lumen Field on 26 June as the centre of celebrations of the LGBTQ+ community.

The plans were made before the teams for the fixture were decided.

The Egyptian FA has publicly called for the celebrations to be cancelled and for Fifa - which has no official involvement in the plans - to intervene.

But Eric Wahl, who is a member of the Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee, says there has been no contact from Fifa - and that the celebrations are part of the culture of Seattle, so should be respected by visiting teams.

""I know Egypt are petitioning Fifa, but it raises ethical issues,"" Wahl said.

""In Qatar they said we had to respect the culture.""

Wahl was pointing to the rhetoric around the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - a country which also has laws against same-sex relationships - where Fifa said players who wore the OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ people would receive yellow cards.

The game will take place on the weekend of Seattle Pride, and two days before the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which are generally regarded as the birth of the LGBTQ+ rights movement.

In Iran, the maximum punishment for homosexual relations is the death penalty, while in Egypt morality laws are frequently used to suppress LGBTQ+ rights and relationships.

""I can't anticipate what Fifa will do, I hope they do the right thing,"" said Wahl. ""We haven't heard from them, and I am a little surprised they have not reached out, but in general Fifa's approach is respectful silence - that's good.

""With regards to issues like human rights, they will stay out.""

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa and the Football Associations of Egypt and Iran for comment.

The Egyptian FA said it had sent a formal letter to Fifa secretary-general Mattias Grafstrom, rejecting ""in absolute terms"" any activities linked to LGBTQ+ support during the match.

The lengthy Egyptian FA statement claimed the initiative would clash with ""the cultural, religious and social values"" of Egypt and Iran, and urged Fifa to ensure the match would remain focused on football.

It cited Fifa's statutes on political and social neutrality, arguing matches should not be used to promote causes that are ""sensitive or of a contentious nature"".

The Pride Match plans have also reportedly drawn criticism from Iranian media.

But Wahl said their plans - which focus more on events around the city rather than during the match itself - are staying on course for now. 

However he said it was likely there would be celebrations of LGBTQ+ people in stands during the Egypt v Iran game.

""We don't have involvement with things going on inside the stadium, but it is a very Seattle thing to have Pride flags inside the ground,"" he said.

""Everyone affiliated with Egypt and Iran soccer teams are welcome at our parades and events, we are sure they will see it.

""This is something that began to get put together well over a year ago. Pride Month in June is always important, and Seattle does stuff throughout the month.

""So, knowing we have this once-in-a-generation chance, we knew we wanted one of these matches to be pride-themed, with all the resources we have, to highlight to all of our visitors and do it in a joyful kind of way.

""There was never any strategic intent of 'sticking it to anyone', to make Fifa feel a certain way.""

He said art from a poster competition would be displayed around the city, and there would be a LGBTQ+ history trail for people to follow.

How was the fixture selected?

For Wahl, Pride celebrations which coincide with the World Cup carries personal importance.

Wahl, who is gay, is the brother of the late American football writer, Grant. 

At Qatar 2022, Grant was briefly detained by Qatari authorities for trying to enter a stadium wearing a rainbow shirt in support of LGBT rights.

Aged 49, he collapsed and died while covering the quarter-final match between Argentina and Netherlands.

""I told Grant not to poke the bear, but Grant was Grant. There are queer people in Qatar, in the Middle East, and he wanted to highlight the hypocrisy. He loved soccer, but not with blinkers on,"" he said.

""It is very much a bittersweet experience, and that will be same at every World Cup for the rest of mine and my family's life.

He described the fixture schedule as ""anything but a negative, as it shows LGBT people in Egypt and Iran that we welcome you, welcome anyone who loves soccer"".

""It would mean a great deal to me to know that a football fan in Iran, which has a beautiful artistic history, and Egypt, which has such an incredible history, sees this,"" he said.

""It is easy to reduce a country to the sum of their worst parts, and there is meaning in seeing not everywhere in the world is like that. That welcome can be revolutionary.""

Craig Burley slams FIFA over World Cup ticket prices and 'The Best' awards. (2:10)

For the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF), there are myriad presumed benefits for hosting a FIFA World Cup. There is the attention that the event will bring to the sport of soccer, driving interest not only in the U.S. men's national team, but trickling beyond that to the nation's clubs all the way down to the youth team level, where the hope is that children will be inspired to participate at increasing levels.

Yet for the USSF, there is also a more practical benefit, namely the $100 million that it expects to receive from FIFA.

Multiple sources have told ESPN that as part of the agreement that the host countries struck with FIFA for hosting the 2026 World Cup, the federations of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. expect to receive 1% of the tournament's gross revenues. This amount will be split across the three countries. With tournament revenues forecasted to reach $13 billion, along with the fact that the U.S. is hosting 75% of the matches, the expectation of the USSF is that it will receive $100 million.

But more money leads to more questions. For one, how does the financial haul in 2026 compare to the last time the USSF hosted the World Cup back in 1994? And, more importantly, what does the USSF plan to do with that additional windfall?

Suffice to say, 1994 wasn't just a different world, but a different World Cup. There was huge skepticism that the USSF could pull off a successful tournament, and not just from people outside the country. The USSF itself was so concerned about the financial risks involved that it organized the World Cup via local committees, which insulated it from any monetary downside. Ticketing revenue was the primary income stream, with any surplus going to a foundation set up after the tournament.

""I guess I was a cockeyed optimist,"" then-USSF president Alan Rothenberg said. ""The federation thought [the World Cup] was going to be a loser, which is why they set up the separate entity and why they agreed to let any surplus go to the foundation because they didn't expect a surplus.

""I guess I should have been a little bit more analytical on the likelihood of success, but I knew how great the World Cup is. I knew that the United States loves a big event, and so if we could make sure that this was perceived as a big event, it would get the attention of people over and above just the core soccer fans.""

The 1994 World Cup exceeded all expectations, setting attendance records (both total and per-game average) for the FIFA tournament that stands to this day, but is expected to be broken during the 2026 edition given the expansion to 48 teams. Keep in mind, this 1994 record was set in a 24-team tournament and not even expansion to 32 teams, which started in 1998, was enough to break it.

According to former USSF president Sunil Gulati, who also served as the executive vice president of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee, the tournament brought in a surplus of around $51 million, $5 million of which was loaned to MLS as seed money to get it up and running. Including interest, the amount eventually turned over to the U.S. Soccer Foundation was closer to $60 million.

At first glance, it might appear that the USSF will make more money from the 2026 edition, but when adjusted for inflation, $60 million in 1994 is worth $131 million today. It's worth noting that the organization of the World Cup is very different this time around.

For 2026, FIFA has implemented what Gulati calls ""the UEFA model,"" one championed by FIFA president -- and former UEFA general secretary -- Gianni Infantino. As was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, the organization is centralized within FIFA, eschewing a local organizing committee in favor of dealing with the venue cities directly. That allows FIFA to keep more of tournament's revenues for itself, though it has created some financial issues for the venue cities, and the structure directs money to FIFA that would be reinvested in the U.S. instead. This is similar to what happened when the U.S. hosted multiple editions of the Copa America. In 2016 there was a local organizing committee, but it was more centralized by CONMEBOL in 2024.

The $100 million the USSF is expecting to gain is still a significant chunk of change, but as Gulati put it, ""It's not make-or-break money anymore [for the USSF]. What is make-or-break is the ability to take the sport to a higher level.""

USSF CEO JT Batson isn't content to just take the sport to a higher level. His ambition is to make soccer the ""most played sport in the country.""

According to the National Sporting Goods Association, soccer has 15.8 million participants, trailing both basketball (23.9 million) and golf (21.6 million). To achieve its goal, the USSF has created a foundation, called Soccer Forward, which, with the help of the funds obtained via the 2026 World Cup, is hoping to make the game more accessible. Pay-to-play has long been a scourge of the U.S. soccer development system, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds often priced out of the sport.

Batson aims to address that.

""What is exciting about the $100 million is that we'll be able to use it for very targeted investments in participation and growing-the-game types of initiatives,"" Batson said. ""And these are things that don't have natural business models. And so being able to use philanthropic funds, which of course we've grown a lot of those as well as legacy funds from the World Cup, that allows us to really accelerate our investment in that.

""Ultimately our goal is to have a very large endowment that is focused specifically on participation, access, growth of the game. And this $100 million will be an awesome jumpstart to that.""

What Batson is proposing is a massive undertaking. The U.S. has more than 340 million people, spread across four time zones. Getting various stakeholders to buy in to the extent necessary is difficult in the best of times, and the competition from other sports remains intense. For that reason, the USSF's plan invites some skepticism, both in terms of determining the bar for success, as well as what a national federation can achieve.

""[Growing soccer] is very much pushing at an open door,"" said Stefan Szymanski, author of the book ""Soccernomics"" and a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan. ""The sport is growing in popularity. A lot of parents don't want their kids to play [American] football anymore. They'd much rather play soccer. It's kind of shrewd for the federation to say 'oh, we're promoting soccer' because soccer is going to grow.""

Szymanski added, ""I think we ought to be realistic here though about the limits of this. To create a level playing field, if I may use that expression, one really would need thousands and thousands of fields across the country, and the amount of money that U.S. Soccer is going to put in is going to be a drop in the ocean in relation to that.""

Batson is aware that the USSF's impact will be limited, both in terms of programming and finances. Reaching his goal will take far more investment than the $100 million from the World Cup, more than the $50 million in fundraising it achieved for the fiscal period ending on March 31, 2025. That is why he is attempting to build a coalition of stakeholders -- one that includes pro leagues, youth clubs, school districts, as well as state and local governments -- that can work together to not only draw kids and families into the sport, but keep them there. Much of this falls under the umbrella of the USSF's ""Soccer Everywhere For Everyone"" initiative, as well as the federation's Pathway Strategy from recreational to competitive to pre-professional to professional.

""A lot of people play soccer in this country. That also means if you want to make it easier, more affordable and more accessible, that ultimately is hundreds of millions of dollars a year that you need to be able to flow back to the ecosystem,"" Batson said. ""And so U.S. Soccer will be able to play a role in that, but also, we need local governments. We need school districts. We need local businesses and community organizations leaning in.

""The heart of the Soccer Forward strategy is focused on how are we bringing all these people together to be able to make it to where soccer is much cheaper, much more accessible, and ultimately more fun so that millions and millions more people can go play it.""

Batson said the USSF has studied anti-smoking and anti-drunk driving initiatives to get a sense of how the USSF's programs can be impactful at every level of the soccer ecosystem. He looked at what the national organizations were, as well as local activations. What were the coalitions at the local and national level that led to change in behavior -- or in soccer's case, interest -- on a massive scale?

""We did a whole lot of research on that before we designed the approach to Soccer Forward, because we believed that to deliver soccer at scale, at the sort of price point to where everyone can do it, it's going to take everybody working together on that,"" Batson said. ""And so far, people are really excited. Everyone's leaning in, good early progress, but this is a huge-scale effort, and that's also what makes it fun.""

The connection with anti-drunk driving initiatives seems specious at first glance, but Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), sees some similarities. In her experience, having repeated, consistent messaging is critical to growing support and awareness. Finding a shared purpose is critical, and patience will be needed as well. MADD has been in existence for 45 years, and is still going strong.

For Stewart, the biggest key of all is storytelling. MADD got its start in 1980 when Candace Lightner's daughter Cari was killed by a drunken driver as she walked to a church carnival. That story of loss resonated across the country. Obviously, Batson and the rest of the USSF are telling a different type of story, but one where soccer can be ""a force for good,"" as Batson said.

""I think the storytelling is huge because storytelling is so compelling across social media,"" Stewart said. She added, ""It's the power of stories, individual stories, that creates that spark where people begin to see themselves in other people's stories, and that connection starts to happen.""

One current story the USSF can tell relates to its Soccer at Schools initiative. It is made up of a toolkit that aims to provide soccer advocates the ability to start soccer programs at schools, and address issues like funding, connecting with schools, assessing facilities, as well as activities for participants.

The Rosati Leadership Academy in Lewiston, Maine, started an after-school indoor soccer program at Connors Elementary School that operates five days a week, a lifeline to an economically disadvantaged community. Beyond soccer, the program emphasized social and emotional learning for the 200 students per year that took part, with student behavior and performance both showing improvement.

It might feel like a drop in the bucket, but it speaks to the kinds of programs the USSF is looking to replicate as they cast a wider net to get children involved in the sport. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson said that the USSF would announce additional school programs in the spring, with a rollout in the fall.

Harry Kane speaks about England's hopes of winning the World Cup and the pressure of being one of the favourites.

Facilities are part of the puzzle as well. Colder climates will require indoor fields, while urban environments require hard-top mini-pitches given that green space is often at a premium. Then there is the insatiable appetite for full-sized fields. Batson indicated that the USSF has armed soccer advocates with information and data to convince local politicians that sports fields are a good investment.

But such projects require plenty of heavy lifting.

Beverly Smith is the vice president for sports and youth development with Local Initiatives and Support Corporation, a nonprofit that helps facilitate housing and economic development in underserved communities. Smith's focus is on building sports fields in those locales, and is currently working with the Arthur M. Blank Foundation to build 100 mini-pitches across the state of Georgia. (Note: Smith has also teamed with ESPN to build a mini-pitch at East Point Station in Atlanta.)

Smith notes that a successful project isn't just about building the facility; there has to be a maintenance plan to ensure its long-term viability. Then there is the coalition building at the local level to ensure success. The USSF said it has agreements with local entities to handle the maintenance aspect, but Smith indicated that the Federation needs to stay connected to these projects.

""For the U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build a coalition around this, it really requires that you have your finger on the pulse of what's happening on the ground and where you want to put this and hear the voices of everybody,"" Smith said.

Just how deeply involved the USSF will be in such projects remains to be seen. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson told ESPN that there is dedicated staff within Soccer Forward that is focused on these endeavors. The same is true of its success in coalition building. The level of intentionality required seems vast, although the infrastructure provided by youth clubs and state associations is already in place, and will help in the process.

Will the USSF be an active or passive partner? The scope of Batson's vision demands the latter approach. Whether the level of execution follows is to be determined. Either way, the hope is that the USSF can make the $100 million windfall from next summer's World Cup count.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Zlatko Dalić

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup slowly approaching, Croatian head coach Zlatko Dalić has openly expressed concern about his squad, particularly in attack. 

Croatia will be aiming to secure an extraordinary third consecutive World Cup medal, but the task ahead will be anything but easy. 

Drawn into a challenging group featuring England, Panama and Ghana, Dalić, speaking to RTL, believes Croatia face one of the toughest groups at the tournament.

“This is definitely the hardest group,” Dalić said. “England vs Croatia will be the strongest match of the entire first round. We also drew Ghana from the fourth pot, the strongest and most dangerous possible opponent.”

Dalić highlighted Ghana's quality and unpredictability, noting that many of their players compete in the English Premier League.

“They are an African team full of talent. You never know what to expect from them, and playing them in the final group match makes it even more difficult.”

While the group itself presents a major challenge, Dalić's biggest concern lies within his own squad, specifically the lack of solutions in attack.

“The situation is not good. We are in trouble,” Dalić admitted. “Younger players are still searching for themselves. They have not imposed themselves, they have not shown enough quality, and they have not shown that they deserve a place in the national team.”

Croatia's most reliable forward option remains Ante Budimir, who is also the oldest striker in the squad. According to Dalić, this highlights a deeper issue.

“We need a real striker, strong, powerful, fast, someone who can run in behind defenders. Unfortunately, we don't have that player right now.”

With qualification and preparation ongoing, Dalić stressed that the next six months will be crucial. Several players will need to raise their level significantly if Croatia are to remain competitive and realistic contenders at the World Cup.

As history has shown, Croatia often thrives when doubts are highest, but with a difficult group and unresolved attacking problems, the road to another World Cup medal will demand improvement, solutions and decisive breakthroughs in the months ahead.

December 26, 2025

By Martina Alcheva

As the soccer world looks ahead to 2026, questions continue to swirl around Lionel Messi and whether the sport's most decorated modern icon will once again step onto the game's biggest stage. For Argentina, the debate is not only about age or minutes played, but about leadership, influence, and timing. Few voices carry more authority on that subject than Javier Zanetti, a former captain who understands both the weight of the shirt and the demands of a World Cup campaign.

Speaking with the calm certainty of someone who has lived through multiple tournament cycles, Zanetti offered a perspective that cuts through the noise. While doubts persist externally, his stance is clear: Messi remains capable of helping Argentina in a meaningful way at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. And at the heart of his argument lies a carefully chosen nine-word message that reframes the entire conversation.

La Albiceleste enters the next World Cup cycle as the defending champion, having conquered the world in Qatar in 2022. That triumph, led by Messi, ended years of pressure and debate about his international legacy. Since then, the national team has continued to collect silverware, reinforcing its status as one of the strongest sides in global soccer.

Yet time moves quickly. Messi will be approaching 39 during the tournament in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He now plays his club soccer away from Europe, prompting inevitable questions about rhythm, intensity, and physical sustainability. Some have even suggested that Argentina should begin planning without him at the center of the project. Zanetti strongly disagrees.

Lionel Messi of Argentina kisses the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Winners' Trophy.

In an interview with FourFourTwo, Zanetti dismissed the idea that Messi's age diminishes his value to the national team. “I don't agree with that,” he said when asked whether Messi should step aside as a leader. “Messi is fully capable of continuing as a leader. He's intelligent, knows better than anyone how to interpret what the team needs, and is surrounded by great players in the national team.”

For Zanetti, leadership is not about running more kilometers than anyone else. It is about understanding moments, managing teammates, and raising standards in decisive situations. Those are qualities Messi still possesses in abundance, regardless of the league he plays in.

Zanetti went even further, making it clear that Messi's presence alone elevates Argentina's status. “I'm convinced that with him, Argentina will be a major contender again at the next World Cup,” he added. Midway through the discussion, He delivered the line that best encapsulates his philosophy on Messi's future. Reflecting on where the forward stands in his career, he said: “The time has come for Messi to enjoy football.”

Lionel Messi of Argentina celebrates after scoring

Those nine words shift the narrative entirely. Rather than framing 2026 as a burden or a final obligation, Zanetti sees it as an opportunity—a space where Messi can contribute without the suffocating pressure that defined earlier chapters of his international career. According to the former defender, enjoyment does not mean detachment. It means clarity. It means freedom. And paradoxically, it may be the very thing that allows Messi to remain decisive on the biggest stage.

Zanetti was careful to stress that the final call belongs to Messi alone. “That has to be his decision,” he said. “But I think yes. There are only a few months to go, and I believe he also wants to represent his country again. I have no doubt it will happen.”

The former captain highlighted an important distinction: Messi no longer needs to prove anything. Every major trophy is already in his cabinet. What remains is the desire to compete—and Zanetti believes that desire is still there.

The World Cup itself, he suggested, will serve as a personal checkpoint. “The World Cup will surely be an important testing ground to see how he feels, and then he'll decide, calmly, whether to continue.”

December 26, 2025

For weeks, Barcelona have been at the center of transfer rumors. The Spanish club is looking for a top-level defender and has reportedly targeted a teammate of Lionel Messi with the Argentina national team who won the FIFA World Cup in Qatar 2022.

“FC Barcelona are scanning the market in search of an affordable center back with leadership qualities who can strengthen the squad in January… one of the names that fits that profile is Argentine defender Nicolas Otamendi,” Mundo Deportivo reported on Friday.

Otamendi, who is approaching his 38th birthday, remains one of the most reliable defenders in Europe and has continued to shine with Benfica in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. He has made 28 appearances this season across domestic league play, the Portuguese Cup, the Portuguese Super Cup, and the UEFA Champions League.

The main obstacle surrounding a potential move for Otamendi is his contract situation. The defender is under contract with the Portuguese club until June 30, 2026, and “Benfica will not make things easy for him to leave during this winter window,” according to Mundo Deportivo.

Nicolas Otamendi of Benfica.

“Jose Mourinho, the team's head coach, has urgently requested the renewal of his captain to avoid a possible move to Barcelona in the winter transfer market,” the report added. “A scenario that would also have the approval of Rui Costa, president of Benfica.”

As is the case with many elite soccer stars, in the coming months Nicolas Otamendi will be focused on playing as much as possible and, above all, staying healthy in order to be in peak condition for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America. There, Argentina will attempt to defend the title they won in Qatar in 2022, when Lionel Messi led them to the third trophy in the nation's history.

For Otamendi, it would also represent his final major tournament with Argentina and his fourth World Cup overall, after appearing at South Africa 2010, Russia 2018, and Qatar 2022. He has already announced that he will not begin another World Cup cycle after 2026 and, like Messi, is expected to retire from international duty following the FIFA tournament.

Nicolas Otamendi is the latest name added to a long list of players who are rumored to be closely monitored by Barcelona ahead of the January transfer window. Another Argentine defender reportedly on the Catalan club's radar is Marcos Senesi, who currently plays for Bournemouth and is also attracting interest from Atletico Madrid.

In addition, several Premier League defenders such as Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace, Nathan Ake of Manchester City, and Murillo of Nottingham Forest have also been mentioned as possible targets for Barcelona.

While familiar icons like Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe continue to dominate headlines, the assist charts have delivered a quiet shock: a new name has risen above them both, redefining what elite playmaking looks like this year.


Marcus Rashford has impressed with his performance in Barcelona, consistently demonstrating solid form. Despite this, his future with the team has been widely debated. However, coach Hansi Flick has already made a clear decision regarding the Englishman for the 2026-27 season.


As the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins to narrow, Marc-Andre ter Stegen now finds himself at the center of a tense and defining crossroads—caught between recovery, competition, and a message from the very top of German soccer that leaves little room for ambiguity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'We are short'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/man-utd-boss-ruben-amorim-january-transfer-admission-kobbie-mainoo-joshua-zirkzee/blt25e2cc06c0653ee3","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:05:03 GMT","

Manchester United will only allow players to leave in the January transfer window if replacements can be found, says head coach Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese has delivered the update ahead of the winter market opening on New Year's Day, with Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee believed to be keen on departing Old Trafford in search of more playing time.

In a new report from the BBC, both Mainoo and Zirkzee are hoping to earn more first-team minutes by leaving United when the transfer window opens on 1 January. 

England international Mainoo is yet to start a single game for the Red Devils in 2025-26, making 11 appearances from the substitutes bench.

The 20-year-old was reportedly close to completing a season-long loan move to Antonio Conte's Napoli in the summer, only for United to block the switch on deadline day in September.

Meanwhile, Zirkzee is also believed to be attracting interest from Italy. The 24-year-old has made just 10 appearances for United this season, with only three of them coming from the start.

Netherlands international Zirkzee spent two seasons with Serie A side Bologna between 2022 and 2024 before moving to England in a £36.5 million (€42m/$49m) deal.

However, both Mainoo and Zirkzee have now been told they will not be allowed to leave United unless the club is able to secure replacements.

The 20-time champions are currently without Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, who are competing at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) for Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon respectively, with the tournament lasting until Sunday, 18 January.

United are also expected to be without captain Bruno Fernandes for a month after the midfielder sustained a hamstring injury in last Sunday's 2-1 Premier League defeat at Aston Villa.

And therefore Amorim believes United are “short” of numbers heading into the January transfer window.

“It's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution,"" Amorim said. ""We are short. Even with the full squad we are short for something that can happen.

""We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in [the media's] heads, in my head, in everybody's head, we need to win every game. It doesn't matter. There are no excuses.”

Amorim revealed earlier in this month that United are prepared to strengthen in January, provided the “perfect” players for the long term become available. However, the former Sporting CP manager has stressed the importance of not panic buying over the winter period - a “mistake” he believes the club have made in the past.

""We can improve, we have space to have more players but we have a plan and we need to bring in players that we know, obviously it is hard to know for sure that everything is going to work,” Amorim told Sky Sports.

""But we need to be certain with the players that we bring in, if we are not sure, if everyone is not aligned, it is better not to bring anyone and work with the players that we have. 

""That is clear for me. Maybe I should be different, like so many other managers, but that is my thinking for the club and I think the board thinks that, too. 

""We cannot make the same mistakes we did in the past and we need to survive these moments because we have players coming back from internationals and injury.”

Amorim is on the verge of competing his first full year in charge of United as they wrap up 2025 with league fixtures against Newcastle United on Boxing Day and winless Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday 30 December.

The 40-year-old was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor on 1 November 2024 and steered United to a 15th-place finish last season - the club's lowest league position since 1989-90.

However, United have been in much better form this term, with Amorim's men currently seventh in the table and just three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Robert Lewandowski set for Saudi Pro League talks with Poland legend expected to leave Barcelona once his contract expires","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/robert-lewandowski-set-saudi-pro-league-talks-leave-barcelona/blt04e08a952163f1f3","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:45:31 GMT","

Robert Lewandowski has reportedly moved a step closer to leaving Barcelona as his representatives prepare to hold a fresh round of talks with the Saudi Pro League over a lucrative move to the Middle East. The Poland international is also being courted by Major League Soccer side Chicago Fire ahead of his contract expiring at the end of the season.

In a new report from Spanish publication AS, Lewandowski's Israeli agent, Pini Zahavi, is due to hold a new meeting with Saudi Pro League officials ahead of the January transfer window opening on New Year's Day.

The report claims Lewandowski has already received an offer from the Saudi Pro League, though it does not state which clubs are keen to sign the striker, who has scored eight goals in 18 appearances in all competitions for Barcelona this season.

The 37-year-old is believed to be attracted by the possibility of playing in the Middle East, with the Saudi Pro League home to a number of football's biggest names including Al-Nassr and Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Ittihad duo Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante.

In a separate report from the BBC earlier this month, Lewandowski's representatives reportedly held discussions with MLS outfit Chicago Fire over the possibility of a move to the United States.

Fire, who have previously tried to sign Neymar and Kevin De Bruyne in 2025, are believed to have made Lewandowski a priority signing for at least six months - with Chicago holding the USA's largest Polish community.

Lewandowski is widely regarded as Poland's greatest ever footballer, having scored 88 goals in 163 caps for his country. The Eagles remain in contention to qualify for next summer's World Cup in North America, with Jan Urban's side due to face Albania in a play-off semi-final on Thursday, 26 March 2026.

The BBC claim Lewandowski is also open to joining Fire, with wages not expected to be an issue, though AS claim the Saudi Pro League have presented a larger financial package to the attacker's camp.

After scoring a remarkable 344 goals in 375 games during an eight-season spell with Germany heavyweights Bayern Munich, Lewandowski joined Barcelona in July 2022.

The ex-Borussia Dortmund and Lech Poznan hitman has won five trophies at Camp Nou, including league titles in the 2022-23 and 2024-25 campaigns. He has scored 109 goals in 165 games for the Blaugrana.

However, Lewandowski's future at Barcelona remains in doubt after seeing fellow striker Ferran Torres step up for Hansi Flick's champions this season.

Former Manchester City man Torres has found the back of the net 13 times in 22 appearances in all competitions for Barcelona this term, with 11 of his goals coming in La Liga. Only Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe has been more proficient in front of goal (18) in Spain's top flight.

When asked about his long-term future in November, Lewandowski said: “I still don't know the answer. That's why I'm not in a hurry, I'm at peace with myself.

“And that is the most important thing. Even if, for example, the club contacted me now, I still wouldn't answer that question. Because I also have to feel what's best for me. Now I'm calm, I'm not in a hurry and, at the moment, I don't expect anything else.”

Barcelona will make their return from Spanish football's winter break when they travel to Espanyol in the Catalan derby on Saturday, 3 January. Flick's men will then take on Athletic Club - led by former Blaugrana boss Ernesto Valverde - in the semi-finals of the Spanish Super Cup four days later.

Lewandowski made his return to the Barcelona fold in the 2-0 win at Villarreal last Sunday, having not featured in the previous two games against Osasuna in the league and minnows CD Guadalajara in the last 32 of the Copa del Rey.

Following the victory over Villarreal, in what was their final fixture of 2025, Barcelona boss Flick said: “I think we've overcome a lot of things this year.

Roman Abramovich has assembled a formidable legal team as a protracted court battle in Jersey continues to block the release of billions of pounds from the sale of Chelsea, funds that were pledged for victims of the war in Ukraine. While the £5.3bn dispute over frozen assets on the island remains unresolved, Abramovich is refusing to bow to mounting political pressure to immediately release the money.

According to The Telegraph, among the senior figures now acting on Abramovich's behalf are Eric Herschmann, a former White House adviser to Donald Trump, and Lord Wolfson KC, the shadow attorney general in the House of Lords. They are joined by a former solicitor general of Jersey and a UK-based human rights specialist, with imminent legal claims for £2.5m in costs also being prepared. 

The stand-off intensified last week when UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly urged Abramovich to ""pay up now"", insisting that the proceeds of Chelsea's sale should finally be deployed for humanitarian relief in Ukraine. That demand, however, has not altered Abramovich's stance. His legal advisers argue that while the Jersey litigation is ongoing, the release of funds cannot be discussed. As a result, the £2.35bn earmarked for Ukraine remains locked in limbo more than three years after the invasion that triggered the sanctions regime.

The legal saga centres on Abramovich's claim that Jersey authorities unlawfully handled data linked to investigations against him. He pursued court action after discovering that government records, including messages and emails referring to him, were missing or deleted. That effort led to a significant ruling in his favour. Advocate David Michael Cadin, master of the Royal Court, declared that the Government of Jersey had breached its obligations, finding that Abramovich's data protection rights had been violated. Despite this, the broader asset freeze remains in place, and the impasse over the Chelsea funds continues.

Advocate David Michael Cadin, master of the Royal Court, wrote: ""I have issued a declaration that the GOJ [Government of Jersey] defendants are in breach of their obligations.""

The UK Government maintains that the Jersey proceedings should not prevent the Ukraine funds from being released. A licence has already been issued permitting the money to be spent on humanitarian causes and ministers insist Abramovich has no legal justification for delaying. 

Complicating matters, however, are financial records published by Fordstam, Abramovich's UK-registered vehicle that received the Chelsea sale proceeds. Those accounts show an outstanding £1.5bn debt to Camberley International Investments, the Jersey-based parent company whose assets were frozen. Abramovich's camp argues that until the Jersey freeze is resolved, the structure of the funds cannot be untangled. Sources close to the discussions insist that the debt will not ultimately reduce the amount destined for Ukraine. Yet Abramovich's lawyers have repeatedly refused to engage on the mechanics of release while their Jersey challenge remains unresolved.

Correspondence revealed during the case has highlighted a striking shift in Jersey's stance towards Abramovich. In September 2017, he was warmly welcomed by the island's authorities when applying for residency. A letter from Jersey's director of high-value residency even suggested meeting for lunch to discuss a ""soft landing"" on the island. That tone changed dramatically after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In April of that year, just a month after Abramovich pledged that Chelsea sale funds would go to ""all"" Ukraine war victims, the Royal Court of Jersey imposed a freezing order on $7bn (£5.3bn) worth of assets linked to him. The island's attorney general said Abramovich was a suspect in a criminal investigation, though officers later admitted that raids on his properties had been unlawful. The breakdown in dialogue between Abramovich and UK authorities has left the Ukraine fund frozen for three and a half years. Sources close to the UK Government acknowledge that the Jersey litigation has repeatedly been cited by Abramovich's side whenever talks have attempted to move the situation forward.

A spokesperson for Abramovich had previously said: ""The attorney general's decision to investigate Mr Abramovich was illegitimate and politically motivated and linked to improving Jersey's reputation as a financial centre in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, at a time when the Jersey government's previous policy of encouraging Russian wealth to move to the island was now seen as politically inconvenient.""

The Government of Jersey has firmly denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, it said: ""The government of Jersey is aware of recent media reports concerning ongoing legal proceedings involving Mr Roman Abramovich. We respect the independence of the courts and the integrity of the legal process, and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We categorically reject allegations of conspiracy, misfeasance in public office, or bad faith. These claims are entirely without foundation and will be addressed through the appropriate legal channels.""

Abramovich's legal bench is extensive. Alongside Herschmann and Lord Wolfson are Howard Sharp, a former Jersey solicitor general, Maya Lester, a senior barrister specialising in sanctions and human rights law, Richard Lissack, known for complex financial litigation, and Andrew Stafford, an expert in international finance cases. Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty has insisted that the UK Government remains confident in its legal position, including with regard to the Jersey action. Insiders familiar with the case suggest Abramovich's decision to assemble such a heavyweight team reflects the scale of Jersey's own legal resources.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

For the first time in English football history, Saturday 3PM kick-offs could reportedly be broadcast live on domestic television, with the Premier League and the English Football League set to open formal discussions early next year about lifting the long-standing blackout. England is now the only major footballing nation in Europe to maintain the restriction, which prevents live broadcasts between 2.45PM and 5.15PM on Saturdays.

With both leagues preparing for future domestic media rights negotiations, there is a growing consensus that selling every match may be the only realistic way to protect and increase revenues, as revealed by The Guardian. Although the Premier League and EFL are currently locked into broadcast agreements that run until the end of the 2028–29 season, planning for the next cycle has already begun. The EFL intends to take its rights back to market at the start of 2027, while the Premier League auction is expected later that year. Crucially, both competitions want clarity on whether 3PM matches can be included before those tenders begin. Without an early agreement, broadcasters would be bidding without knowing the full scope of games available, a scenario neither league wants to repeat in a market where rights inflation has slowed.

This season already represents unprecedented domestic exposure. The Premier League is showing a record 270 live matches, while the EFL has 1,059 games broadcast, primarily through Sky Sports. Despite that expansion, league executives have concluded that partial coverage is no longer sufficient. The EFL, in particular, believes it could unlock significant additional income by making all 1,891 of its fixtures available for broadcast, but only if the blackout is removed in agreement with the Premier League and the Football Association.

The Premier League's appetite for change is also driven by wider economic trends. While its current domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a headline-grabbing £6.7bn, that figure masks a quieter reality. To secure the deal, the league extended the contract by an extra year and increased the number of games sold from 215 to 270 per season. In real terms, the value of the agreement has fallen by around 23 per cent compared to the 2022-25 cycle. 

Many Premier League clubs' American owners have long questioned the logic of the blackout, pointing to the US model, where every game across major sports is available to viewers. From their perspective, restricting access in a digital era limits growth, particularly among younger audiences accustomed to on-demand viewing. Those voices have grown louder as revenue growth has flattened. Broadcasting every match, they argue, is no longer a luxury but a necessity.

The restriction is rooted in Article 48 of UEFA's statutes, which allows live football broadcasts to be prohibited for up to two and a half hours on a Saturday or Sunday. In England, it applies when at least half of Premier League and Championship fixtures are scheduled for 3PM on a Saturday. That rule was briefly sidestepped at the start of this season, when the EFL televised all of its opening-weekend fixtures because the Premier League campaign had not yet begun, highlighting the flexibility already built into the system. 

The Football Association, which must formally apply to UEFA for the blackout to be enforced, is not expected to stand in the way if the leagues request its removal. Last season, the FA discussed exempting the Women's Super League from the blackout altogether, though those talks stalled after the Premier League and EFL raised legal concerns. The principle, however, has already been tested, weakening arguments that the blackout is untouchable.

Any decision to lift the blackout would not exist in isolation. Article 48 is also enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and leagues there could seek compensation if English football suddenly gains a commercial advantage.

There are also fears about unintended consequences. If 3PM Premier League matches were broadcast across the UK, attendances, particularly in the lower leagues, could suffer, undermining the very pyramid the blackout was designed to protect. That concern has historically underpinned resistance to change, with supporters' groups warning that easy access to televised football might discourage fans from attending matches in person.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Mitchell got up for some nasty slam dunks during the Cavs' Christmas game at the Knicks, inspired by his partner.

	There are muses, and there is Coco Jones — an R&B artist who gives NBA star Donovan Mitchell a lift when she's in the house.


	Mitchell is an elite scorer for his Cleveland Cavaliers, a walking highlight package who combines deep range with flair for getting to the hoop, and impressive hops.


	When the Cavs stopped by Madison Square Garden on Christmas Day to face off with the New York Knicks, Jones sat courtside as her fiancé got to work, notching 34 points, along with seven rebounds and six assists.

	The six-time NBA All-Star and 2018 Sam Dunk Contest champion Mitchell also got up for some nasty slam dunks, inspired by his partner. The 6'2” shooting guard was mic'd up for the game, which aired on ESPN, and admitted Jones gave him wings. “I ain't dunk in like three months. I only dunk when she here,” remarked Mitchell, per SportsCenter.

	











	Their combined efforts weren't enough as the Knicks ran out winners 126-124. It's a long season. 


	Mitchell and Jones announced their engagement in July 2025, after dating for more than a year. Earlier, in March, Jones confirmed they were dating during an appearance on Club Shay Shay. “I love the Internet because they definitely clocked my tea. Little spies everywhere,” she told Shannon Sharpe. “I'm happy and I will say, my music is my outlet where I tell my stories and my truth. Some things I keep for myself because this is my life, too. I say some things and you can hear it on my album.”




	Jones continued: “Secrecy is not what I prefer. I don't want to feel like I have to be somebody secret. I don't want to make anybody feel like they're mine. For me, I'm trying to protect myself, and I'm trying to protect my family and who I love, so I am more private.”


	While Mitchell is balling out in the NBA, Jones dropped her anticipated Why Not More? debut album in April, following the release last year of several singles, including her Grammy-nominated hit “Here We Go (Uh Oh),” which was up for best R&B song and best R&B performance at this year's awards show. “Here We Go (Uh Oh)” also became her first No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay and received a remix with Leon Thomas.

The singer went method with her fireside recitation of Jim Carrey's harried monologue about his busy schedule.

Celine Dion definitely got the Christmas assignment. The iconic pop superstar went fully method for her holiday video this year, slipping into a lime green Grinch costume on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) for a recitation of the holiday baddie's overstuffed schedule.

	In a clip shared this week, the singer posted up in a chair by a fire pit in the backyard and crooned her indelible cover of Eric Carmen's maudlin ballad “All By Myself,” which Dion first recorded for her fourth English-language album, 1996's Falling Into You. Of course, the sight of famously well-attired Dion goofily crooning the song while wearing a Santa getup over her green, furry costume was enough of a gift.

	But then Dion made it a notch sillier by cutting to a shot of her holding one of her little pups on her lap while reciting a version of the Grinch's lament about his busy schedule from the 2000 Ron Howard-directed, Jim Carrey-starring How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 


	“The nerve of those Whos, inviting me down there on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it!” Dion says as the dog wearing antlers like the Grinch's pooch, Max, wriggles out of her grasp. “4:00 — exercise my voice. 4:30 — wake my children up. 5:00 — solve world hunger. Tell no one. 5:30 — jazzercize. 6:30 — dinner with me. I can't cancel that again! 7:00 — wrestle with my creative ideas.”

	











	The dramatic recitation goes on, as Dion-as-Grinch honks, “I'm booked! Of course, if I bumped my creative ideas to 9:00, I'll still have time to lay in bed and scroll TikTok videos endlessly. Or I can just simply wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year,” she adds mock contentedly before shouting, “boring!” 


	The video winds down with Dion crooning a bit more of the song, casually singing, “When I was young/ I never needed anyone.”


	The appearance was one of the rare public outings this year from Dion, who was diagnosed with the neurological disorder stiff-person syndrome in 2022, which seriously affected her voice and caused uncontrolled tremors, forcing her to cancel a planned 2023-2024 world tour to focus on her health.

	For those of us who were good this year, Santa brought us Christmas Day gifts, good food and some Doggfather delights.


Snoop Dogg headlined the halftime entertainment for Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday Live, a matchup of Detroit Lions and the Minnesota Vikings. And he didn't drop the ball.

	Snoop stepped into centerfield at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, MN, wearing an all-red ensemble, a long red coat with furry trim over a double-breasted suit, as he hit a succession of classics.


	The party started with Dr. Dre covers “The Next Episode” and “Nuthin' but a “G” Thang,” and a rendition of “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” featuring EJAE, AUDREY NUNA and REI AMI, the singers that make up Huntr/x, the heroic girl group Netflix's animated hit Kpop Demon Hunters.


	Next up, Snoop served some homestyle cooking with “Drop It Like It's Hot” and “Who Am I? (What's My Name?),” before country star Lainey Wilson sledded on in for a performance of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.”


	The spectacle wrapped up with a cover of Bing Crosby's “White Christmas,” with Snoop flanked by world-renowned Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and his son Matteo Bocelli.


	Earlier, Kelly Clarkson set the tone with a special gridiron-meets-white-Christmas themed video for “Underneath the Tree,” the American Idol's contemporary holiday classic that dropped in 2013.

	











	Netflix announced the all-star special earlier this month. “NFL, Netflix and your uncle Snoop on Christmas Day? We're servin' up music, love and good vibes for the whole world to enjoy,” Snoop teased in a statement at the time. “That's the kind of holiday magic Santa can't fit in a bag.” To celebrate the big reveal, the streaming giant shared a festive teaser on its official social media pages, narrated by funk pioneer George Clinton.


	Snoop Dogg's halftime takeover comes one year after Beyoncé played Netflix's inaugural Christmas Day extravaganza. Queen Bey, who earned the highest-grossing solo tour of 2025, treated her hometown of Houston to the first live performance of tracks from her three-time Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter LP. 


	The 2025 Christmas Day doubleheader kicked off with the Dallas Cowboys facing off against the Washington Commanders. For the record, the Cowboys beat the Commanders 30-23, and the Vikings went on to beat the Lions by 23-10.

EXCLUSIVE: The Wire‘s Tray Chaney and his son Malachi are producing Reborn By the Storm, an indie documentary about the tornado that destroyed their Georgia family home.


	The Chaneys are executive producing the film, which documents the aftermath of the EF-2 tornado in May that ripped their home apart earlier this year and critically injured the 18-year-old Malachi, throwing him hundreds of feet into nearby woods.


Chaney Vision Entertainment is producing, with Luis A. Garcia from Wise Minds Films editing. The plan is to begin screening the film in May 2026, a year after the incident.

	The film will feature interviews with the Chaney family and document Malachi's remarkable recovery. In less than three weeks, Malachi was walking again and planning a return to college despite having suffered a traumatic brain injury, broken ribs and facial fractures. His father, who was also injured when the tornado hit, called his son a “walking miracle” following his recovery. 


	Here's a trailer for the film.


	Tray Chaney – known for his much-loved role as street dealer Malik ‘Poot' Carr in HBO drama series The Wire – has spoken at length about the traumatic event, being interviewed on the likes of CNN, Fox and Good Morning America.


	Kenan Thomson, Shaquille O'Neal, Night School producer Will Packer and Kevin Hart, along with several cast members from The Wire sent messages of support to the family in the aftermath of the devastating incident. Felicia Pearson, who played Snoop in the show, visited Malachi in the hospital in the immediate aftermath.

	











	In The Wire, Chaney Snr. acted alongside the likes of Michael B. Jordan Idris Elba, Dominic West, Wood Harris, Michael K. Williams and J.D. Williams, who played his best friend and partner on the Baltimore street corners, Preston ‘Bodie' Broadus.


	Prior to the tornado hitting, Chaney had been attempting to interview every living member of The Wire cast, producing a YouTube series called Live From the Pit in which the likes of Williams, Anwan Glover and Hassan Johnson discussed the legendary series, which explored how politics, the police and crime shaped late 1990s and early 2000s Baltimore. The Wire has often been cited among the greatest TV shows of all time.


	Chaney is represented by J Pervis Talent.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.


	Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) takes a big leap of faith in the penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5.


	After escaping Vecna's mind invasion, Will realizes that he'll continue to be vulnerable to the monster unless he comes clean about a secret he's been keeping. So, rather than continue to let Vecna pray on his guilt and shame, he takes control of his own destiny. In a moving scene in Episode 7, “The Bridge,” Will comes out as gay in front of all of his friends and family.


	“It was so freeing. I mean, there's been so much build up for this scene for so long. Since, I would argue, episode one of the first season,” Schnapp tells Deadline. “So getting to finally have that moment and just have that dialogue… Will is always speaking through so much of his facial expressions, but to actually verbalize his emotions and express them to everyone was so freeing to finally get to do.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While this is the first time that Will has said out loud that he doesn't like girls, creators Matt and Ross Duffer seemed to be dropping hints regarding his sexuality in earlier seasons. Throughout Season 5, it became much more obvious when Will found out about Robin's (Maya Hawke) relationship with Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and began peppering his friend with questions about how she came to terms with her own sexuality.


	But, it isn't until he's tortured again by Vecna that he realizes the only way forward is to open up about this part of his identity. In part, Schnapp says, Will refrained from doing so sooner because, even though he'd come to accept his sexuality, he was still grappling with his feelings for his best friend, Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard). 

	











	By the time he comes clean, Schnapp thinks he's made peace with the fact that Mike is likely not going to reciprocate those feelings — a realization he says felt quite relatable. 


	“He accepts his own identity by the first volume, and that's what allows him to unleash these powers,” Schnapp explains. “But then, like he says, it takes him through kind of Volume 2 to really understand that it was never about [Mike], it's about himself. I mean, I think it was just really well done and really authentic to how the story unfolds. I know I could definitely relate to some of those feelings of being in love with a best friend who's not in love with you. It feels [like a] realistic representation of being queer and growing up.”


	Schnapp has been very vocal about his thoughts on Will's sexuality, though it was never explicitly confirmed by series creators Matt and Ross Duffer before now, which has only fueled online discussion as fans began to suspect that it might play a pivotal role in his Season 5 arc. As he pointed out, the series has been alluding to this moment since Season 1, when Will's friends used to tease him about not liking girls. 


	Now, creators Matt and Ross Duffer admit the scene is “something we've been building to for a long time,” as the latter tells Deadline. 


	“I think mostly we were nervous, as we just wanted to do right by Noah. Obviously, we've been working with him for so long, since he was a little kid, and we knew that this scene, obviously, we've talked about it over the years with him,” Ross continued. “We knew it was important, and we all wanted to get it right. There's not a scene, I don't think, in the entire series that we spent as long on as we did that coming out scene, just working it and working it until it felt right to us.” 


	How did they know when they got it right? Getting the seal of approval from the actor who has been playing the character for a decade and arguably knows him better than anyone. 


	“The litmus test was giving it to Noah, but then seeing how he responded to it and reacted to it gave us confidence,” Ross added.


	Schnapp says that, in some ways, Will's coming out felt parallel to his own, allowing him to draw from his own experience to access his character's emotions for that moment and “make it feel so real.” Still, there were some cultural and political differences in the 40-year span between the two boys' revelations that the actor wanted to ensure were taken seriously as well.


	“[It was about] making sure I really understood the environment and the landscape that I'm declaring this in, where the AIDS epidemic was rampant, the Reagan administration wouldn't even acknowledge that gay was a real word. If you even so much as came out, people thought you were sick and were contagious,” he said. 


	Will has a genuine concern that he “could be abandoned and lose everything,” Schnapp says, “so just having the stakes in my head that I really wanted to make sure I got right.”


	“I just, of course, wanted it to feel as authentic as possible. It's such an important scene, because it's going to affect so many real young Wills out there struggling with their own identity, and I wanted it to be perfect for them and do justice to this character, which has been leading up to this for so long. So, yeah, just making it feel as authentic and natural as possible,” he continued.

	











	During the scene, Will breaks down as he confesses that Vecna had tried to convince him that his loved ones wouldn't stand by him if they knew the truth. While he was trapped in Vecna's mindscape, he says the monster showed him a false reality where he lost several of them to this admission. It wasn't that they outright rejected him, but according to Vecna's vision of the future, many began to slowly distance themselves from him once he revealed his full self. He says he hopes that, by telling them the truth, he can prove to himself — and to Vecna — that won't happen.


	While trepidatious at first, once Will begins his monologue, the words just start pouring out of him, almost uncontrollably. 


	“He had [the scene] months in advance, and he just worked it and worked it,” Ross Duffer recalls. “I remember him telling us…he wanted to not even have to think about the words on the day, because it would just allow him to sort of access this part of himself where he's not thinking about the language of it all, he's just letting the emotion come through. That's exactly what we did, and we're so proud of him [and] what he accomplished on that thing.”


	To his relief, Will is met with unwavering support from everyone in the room. And, when it came time to film the scene, so, too, was Schnapp. To capture both Schnapp's performance and the reactions of the rest of the cast took an entire 12-hour production day, after which Matt Duffer says the actor “looked like he was about to collapse.”


	Even when the camera was firmly on Schnapp, the rest of the cast made sure to be there for every single take. Likewise, Schnapp repeated the lengthy speech several times with the same fervor when the cameras were focused on coverage of everyone else. 


	“He poured everything into every single take,” Matt said. “I think that brought out these incredible performances in [the cast], and I think they got lost in what he was saying, and it was moving them in a very real way, because Noah was very, very, very emotional that day, and very moving.”


	As a result, says Shawn Levy, who directed the episode with the Duffers, “the thing that makes that scene even more beautiful and memorable is the reactions of the other characters and actors.”


	Throughout Will's speech, the camera cuts repeatedly to Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Robin, who are both beaming with pride at his extraordinary display of vulnerability, and the rest of the teenager's closest confidantes — all of whom are giving them their undivided attention as he pours his heart out to them.


	Usually, “it's always so loud and chaotic on set, especially when the whole cast is there. There is no silence. Everyone's messing around. Everyone's making jokes,” Schnapp says. But, on that day, “you could hear a pin drop.”


	“They were so respectful and gave me so much space to get into the character, which I really appreciated. I didn't really get to fully take note of all their reactions, just because there's so many people in the room, and I'm so emotional,” he continued. “So it really only hit me after, when I watched it, seeing how genuine it felt. And then, of course, when we cut the cameras, Charlie and I started hugging and crying for real. So it definitely hit home.”


	Will's coming out is a big milestone not only in his personal life but also, presumably, in the fight against Vecna. As for how things will pan out in that department, Schnapp is staying quiet for now.

	











	“I guess you're gonna have to wait and see,” he teased. “I'm excited to to share it with the world.”


	The finale of Stranger Things arrives on December 31.

SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Volume 2.


	After nearly a decade, Stranger Things fans finally have some answers about the Upside Down and the supernatural forces that have been plaguing Hawkins since Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) disappeared on November 6, 1983.


	The second volume of the series' final season unveils most of the secrets that creators Matt and Ross Duffer have been keeping from just about everyone since Season 1, including the fact that the Upside Down has actually been a wormhole to another dimension this entire time.


	“We've known it was a wormhole since Season 1, but it's one thing to say it, and it's another to try to figure out how to visualize such an abstract concept,” Ross told Deadline. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







The Wormhole


	In the first two of three episodes, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), Steve (Joe Keery) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) are searching for clues about what could be behind the massive, flesh-like wall they've discovered surrounding the Upside Down-version of their town. They find answers inside Hawkins Lab, but not the ones they were expecting. 


	At the end of Episode 5, “Shock Jock,” Dustin discovers one of Dr. Brenner's (Matthew Modine) journals at the same time that Nancy and Jonathan make it to the roof of the lab to find a mysterious presence floating above it. Dustin realizes far too late that neither Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) nor Holly (Nell Fisher) — nor anyone for that matter — are behind the wall, because the wall is actually holding the whole place together. Before he can warn Nancy and Jonathan, the older Wheeler aims her shotgun at the mass on the roof and sends a sweeping shockwave through the Upside Down, ripping a gash in the wall of the wormhole. It's at that moment that viewers finally get a glimpse of what it looks like from afar.

	











	“I think, ultimately, we really wanted it to have that hourglass shape, because we thought that was the simplest way to communicate such a big idea to the audience,” Ross explained. “But to do that, we had to zoom out. I can't remember how many miles away visual effects figured out that we were by the end in order to see the full shape, but we had to go way out.”


	“We're very far [away],” Matt laughed.


	Continued Ross: “Generally, we try to stay within the characters' perspectives, but that was an instance where we thought to illustrate this best to the audience, we had to leave the characters' perspectives for a moment, just to show the enormity of this whole thing.”


	It's thanks to Dustin that viewers, and the rest of the crew in Hawkins, won't get lost in the theoretical physics of it all. After they make it out of the Upside Down, Dustin draws a diagram on the DJ booth at WSQK to illustrate what they're up against. He explains that the mass that Nancy shot was exotic matter, and it's the only thing keeping the wormhole intact.


	“[The Duffers] literally drew that diagram at the season pitch out two years ago, because they understood, even then, that we would need visual aids,” Shawn Levy, who directed Episodes 6 and 7 with the brothers, said. “I'm so grateful that they had Dustin draw that exact same diagram in the show that the Duffers had used to explain the show years before we shot Season 5.”


	The creators don't credit themselves with devising that explanation though, nor with the flashlight and slinky that Steve uses to help the group understand how they might use the radio tower to get to the alternate dimension that Dustin has named “The Abyss.”


	“One of our writers, Paul Dictor, his superpower is the harder sci-fi aspects of the show. He's read every hard sci-fi book that there is,” Matt said. “As far as [when] it comes to this stuff, he's smarter than Ross and I are, so he's playing these things, and Ross and I are basically the Steve in the room going, ‘Huh?' Illustrations help a lot. So we take a lot of those conversations that we have in the room and the way we help everybody understand it and map it onto the show.”


The Exotic Matter


	Speaking of the exotic matter, as Nancy and Jonathan make their way toward the roof, they realize the entire building seems to be melting. Funnily enough, the melting lab was born not from any attachment to accuracy of an encounter with the theoretical sciences, but from a desire to put the characters in a life-threatening situation that may force them to have a conversation that they'd long been avoiding.


	“All we knew was that we wanted the lab to be melting, and weirdly, actually, that idea came less because we thought it was cool, and more from it kind of all revolved around, or started with, that scene between Nancy and Jonathan. We knew we wanted to put them in a life-or-death situation,” Matt explained.


	After Nancy shoots the exotic matter, the writhing ball of energy becomes even more ferocious, melting the top of the lab at a more rapid rate. She and Jonathan find themselves trapped inside a room as the roof melts around them, threatening to swallow them whole. It's at that moment that Jonathan decides to come clean about the engagement ring he's been carrying around this whole time.

	











	Except, he doesn't propose. Instead, he admits that he thinks maybe they aren't meant to be after all, and he believes Nancy knows that deep down as well. 


	“One of the references was Almost Famous, just like a way less comedic moment than Almost Famous when they're on the plane and they're about to crash, and they all confess to this, because why not? You're about to die. So we liked that moment. Titanic was a slight reference — they both now are able to fit on the table,” Matt revealed. “So we started from there and reverse engineered what would be a situation that would present that kind of moment for them, and we came up with a melting lab.”


	Then comes the work of actually making the lab look like it's melting, which required intense collaboration between the visual effects department, production designer Chris Trujillo, and art director Sean Brennan. 


	“It stressed everybody out,” Matt laughs. “Nobody liked the melting lab idea, not because [of] the concept, but no one actually wanted to do it.”


	The final scene does include some computer-generated visual effects, although the Duffers lament “it was intended to be no visual effects.”


	The production had developed a special “goo-like substance” to funnel into that room so that the scene was entirely practical. Unfortunately, when it came time to produce it at such a large scale, things did not pan out as intended, requiring some post-production magic.


	“I think they tested it in too small of a batch, because by the time we had — I don't know how many gallons of it that were needed to flood that room — it was much too thin. I mean, it wasn't thick at all,” Matt recalled. “It was basically gray water, which was a big problem. So Nat and Charlie just acted it out [and] moved more slowly through it, and then we had ILM, who did a lot of visual effects on the final season, [adjust it]. I don't know how they did it. They developed some sort of formula to fix it and make everything look thick. Obviously, they did all this incredible liquid simulation, at the end of the day. So it's a real mix between practical and visual effects. It's not, maybe, the showiest of our visual effects this season [but it] was one of the ones that blew us away.”


The Abyss…and Its Connection to Eleven


	The wormhole, Dustin says, connects Hawkins to another dimension that he calls “The Abyss.” This is where be believes all of the monsters — the demogorgons, the Mind Flayer, Vecna — have all been coming from. It's also why they haven't been able to find Vecna in any of their crawls over the last two years. He's not in the Upside Down at all. He's actually thousands of yards above them, recovering in this alternate dimension, and that is where he's keeping all those kids, including Holly. Those who have seen The First Shadow may draw connections to one Dimension X.


	Volume 2 does give a glimpse at this other dimension, when Holly briefly escapes Vecna's clutches and tries to make a run for it. Outside of his lair, the world looks barren and deserted, save for a few glowing red rifts in the ground where the world is connected to the Upside Down.


	It's certainly satisfying to get the answers about the Upside Down that have evaded audiences for so long, but, in some ways, all of these explanations come with a new set of questions. What is this alternate dimension? Why is Vecna so hellbent on merging it with the human world? Is this where Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) sent him all those years ago? 

	











	The show has been alluding to the fact that the U.S. government's been locked in some sort of arms race with Russia to access this alternate dimension, likely to use whatever lurks there as weapons of mass destruction. The Vol. 2 episodes also reveal that the government has once again started experimenting on babies in utero to create more supernatural humans like Eleven and Kali, using the latter's blood. It hasn't been working, though, which is why they've been after Eleven this whole time. They believe that her blood holds the key to creating more kids like her. 


	While the pieces are starting to fall into place, there are a couple of dots left to connect on this front, which the Duffers promise will happen in the two-hour finale.


	“The goal is to tie up the remaining loose ends and answer any questions that remain,” Ross teases. “There are a few specifically big ones…Henry and his backstory, and then Eleven and what all this means for her and Kali.”


	The Stranger Things finale arrives on December 31.

SPOILERS: This post contains details about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale episode ‘The Cottage'


	With the conclusion of Heated Rivalry‘s rookie season, writer/director/creator Jacob Tierney is taking a breath before hitting the ice again with the wildly popular LGBTQ hockey drama series.


	Ahead of the highly anticipated Season 1 finale ‘The Cottage,' which is now available to stream on Crave and HBO Max, Tierney teased that despite the satisfying closure of the episode, Season 2 and beyond “will always be centered around” Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov's (Connor Storrie) love story, with author Rachel Reid's final book in the series, The Long Game, serving as the basis.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“But we have a whole universe here, and so there's loads of other things that we're thinking about and that we're gonna explore and that we're gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there's an audience for it,” explained Tierney, following the show's Season 2 renewal. “And that's pretty exciting, so I'm looking forward to really digging into this world.”


	Taking LGBTQ and female audiences by storm with its bold depictions of gay sex and romance, Tierney revealed that his favorite intimate scenes were in the finale.


	“What I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it's one thing to just make smut—which I'm thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game,” he said. “But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers.”


	Tierney added, “That's why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it's both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That's when I feel like they're a real couple, like when you're giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That's what a boyfriend does.”

	











	Read on about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale's sex scenes, why the show's depiction of LGBTQ fame appealed to him and what's ahead for Season 2.


DEADLINE: Are you surprised that the show has taken off on this level, outside of Canada? 


JACOB TIERNEY: No, this is exactly what I expected—yes, I'm very surprised. We're all a bit overwhelmed by the reaction to the show. Obviously, it's very gratifying and it's very nice, but it's certainly not anything you can expect, and then coupled with, plan for anything like that. It's crazy.


DEADLINE: And it was awesome seeing the fan reaction to the Scott [François Arnaud] and Kip [Robbie GK] kiss in the last episode. It was such a good wrap-up for that episode.


TIERNEY: It was very moving to see all those reactions. It was very, very moving for me. 


DEADLINE: And now, all of the gays and the girls are super excited for ‘The Cottage'. 


TIERNEY: I'm telling you, no Canadian's that excited. 


DEADLINE: Was the pressure on to bring that part of the book to life? Because I've seen a lot of people are really anticipating it. 


TIERNEY: I mean, I made the show. I didn't think anybody was gonna care this much. I'm relieved that I made it the way that I did. I mean, there was pressure for me internally to end the show well. And I think that the thing that I was aware of, though it might not seem that way on the surface, it's a big swing cause it's a two-hander essentially. To go from an episode like 5, which is so big and epic, into ‘The Cottage', which is relatively tiny—I think 38 of the 52 minutes are the two of them alone in a cottage. That's kind of a big structural and narrative swing to pull off, or to attempt, I suppose. But I just wanted to continue to do right by this relationship, these characters, and to give their journey the kind of last push that I thought it needed to successfully finish the book. 


DEADLINE: And I really appreciated the scene with Shane's parents because coming out was obviously such a big fear for him, and just seeing how perfectly they handled it. Tell me about bringing something that gay kids really need to see to the screen like that. 


TIERNEY: Yeah, it's a big part of the book, so I certainly didn't invent it whole cloth. But yeah, that stuff is very important, and it's always been an interesting distinction between Shane and Ilya. And I think it's quite stark when Ilya—it's a small line that he says in episode 5, but he says that about his father, “I wish he could have known me.” And I think that's what he means, and I think that Ilya's very aware. Part of the reason that he's kind of gently probing Shane in that episode and being like, “Do they know about you?” And he's like, “No, about you. Who f*cking cares about me? Do they know you? If they don't, you'll regret it at a certain point. You need to take this leap.” And it's scary as those of us who've come out to parents [know], which is most gay kids at this point, or queer people in general. It's very scary and it's a big deal, but it's something that's pretty important in that journey. And what was important to me throughout the show was to make sure that we had sophisticated and complicated relationships with parents going on here. It was why it was so important for me to keep Skip's dad in the show, to see somebody be supportive like that, to see somebody whose love cup is endless. And I think that to see Yuna [Shane's mom, played by Christina Chang] is such an important part of this show, and she's such an important part moving forward, especially. And I think that in these moments, you see that her and Shane are so similar, and they have very similar limitations, and that it was really important to me for the two of them to have a moment together beyond what was already in the book and what was already in the story. It felt very important to me that these two have—I don't think it's a reckoning, but that they have their own moment of intimacy where they can clear things up for one another. Because I think they're both the kinds of people that build things up in their heads, and when you say things out loud, I think you can kind of take the air out of them, and it suddenly becomes a lot more manageable than whatever you've created in your brain. And it helps to have two very, very good actors there to do the heavy lifting for me.

	











DEADLINE: And one thing that's really tragic, even though it was such a great finale, just the fact that Shane wants to just keep their relationship a secret until they retire. And it kind of struck me how it's almost like art imitating life, or vice-versa, with the pressure and speculation that the actors are facing. Was that exploration of fame in the back of your head when you were making this?


TIERNEY: I mean, I've been an actor my whole life. I know what that's like. I've known loads of actors in the closet. I've known loads of actors who have come out. And I do think that part of the reason that this story appealed to me is because I can relate to it. I can understand that pressure, especially when you come up at a young enough age that you don't know, that you don't know what an answer to a question like that would be, but you certainly live in a world where you got a lot of people telling you not to talk about it, and that if you want the things you want, you'll kind of keep toe-ing a line. And I think that's also part of what makes the story resonate with so many people is that we're not pretending we live in a world without homophobia, and we're not pretending we live in a world where coming out is easy. I think that's part of the beauty of what Scott does is so brave, and it's so big, and it does crack something open for other people, but I think what it cracks open for them is just allowing them to know that they are allowed to be together. The rest of it, they can figure out at a later date—and the fans of the book know how this is gonna go—but I think that part of what is interesting and different and unique about Shane and Ilya's story is that this journey that we're watching them go on in this first book, in this first season of TV now, is a journey to just understanding that they love each other. And that's such a hurdle for them. That's hard enough for them, that to then add in the rest of the world, I think will take a whole other season of television. So, that's kind of part of the journey that will be explored down the road. But I have a lot of empathy and I have a lot of time for Shane's journey with that stuff. It's not easy. It's hard, and I do think that there's actors, a lot of professionals, especially people who begin their professional journey at 12 years old. There's so much baked in, and there's so much built in around you that you can often lose yourself. I think it's quite easy to do that, and again, I've seen it happen with so many actors that I came up with. 


DEADLINE: Speaking of which, I just recently discovered that you were in Are You Afraid of the Dark?, which was such a big part of my childhood. 


TIERNEY: I am a campfire kid forever. 


DEADLINE: I love that. Were there moments on Heated Rivalry where you had to compromise your vision or the story?


TIERNEY: Sure, there were moments along the way … my execs at Crave were so f*cking amazing about that. There were people along the way. But my execs, they didn't want it toned down at all.


DEADLINE: Well, it's great to see such a fearlessly queer show, especially when GLAAD recently released their study that almost half of LGBTQ characters are disappearing. So, it just feels very needed right now, and I love it. 












TIERNEY: We added a bunch, so at least there's that. It's not a great time for stuff like that, and I think, unfortunately, the more there's consolidation among broadcasters and streamers too, it's not gonna get a lot better, I don't think. But it is nice to be a part of a show that is doing something like this, that's reminding people that there's loads of audiences here and that they can be queer and queer adjacent, our allies, our friends, our families. If this was just gay people watching this show, we wouldn't be talking about it right now, let's be real. So, the fact that it's gotten to this level of conversation in the culture is because there are people that want to watch this, and they don't care if it's two men in a love story, or maybe even want that specifically. And then even more so, it's just such a pleasure to be involved in a show that's making people happy and that is providing joy. I still read people being like, “I know that this show is gonna end on a cliffhanger.” And I keep wanting to shout it from the rooftops, “It won't! I don't want to do that to you, that's not what we're doing here.”


DEADLINE: Honestly, I had that thought too, watching it. It's such a good ending, and then they get in the car. I'm like, “Oh, they're about to get into a car accident or something. I just know it.”


TIERNEY: You know what's really funny, is that if I let that footage just run and run and run, because we shot that in the studio, my producing partner Brendan [Brady] will run out in front of that car and get hit by it. So you will see our straight producer dying. Does that help? Is that the secret twist that nobody saw coming? 


DEADLINE: That's the one we want. 


TIERNEY: There you go. That's it. 


DEADLINE: Another thing I thought was funny, I'm reading a lot of the social media reactions, and you've introduced a lot of viewers to frottage.


TIERNEY: Frottage at the cottage, baby! 


DEADLINE: Yeah, exactly. So that's cool, it's really opening a lot of eyes to queer sex. And I've also seen some people talk about how very accurate the sex scenes are to the book, and I'm wondering if you were very committed to maintaining accuracy to those scenes.


TIERNEY: Some of them are super accurate to, or close to the book, and some of them go different ways. But what I would say I was committed to, that Rachel and I are both committed to, was kind of using this sex to tell their story, that this is not separate from their story. The sex isn't like, “And then they fuck! Let's put it in a new room or do it on a kitchen counter.” Their sex is the way that they understand each other, and it's the way that we understand them as a couple. So, what I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it's one thing to just make smut—which I'm thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game. But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. Who cares at a certain point? We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers. You can go watch sex wherever you want to. So, what would have to keep this interesting, is to watch it evolve and to watch their intimacy change. That's why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it's both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. And I like those two juxtapositions. That's when I feel like they're a real couple, like when you're giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. That's what a boyfriend does. That's annoying. That's great. That's what I want to see. 

	











DEADLINE: Another thing I loved, as great as the sex scenes are, I noticed that episode 5, there's not as many sex scenes.


TIERNEY: There's none.


DEADLINE: But there's a lot more emotional intimacy, and it made it feel so earned and real. Like when Ilya tells Shane “I love you” in Russian.


TIERNEY: I think that's part of the evolution too, it's a story. It was really important to me that you have to earn these moments. That's why episode 3 is where it is, and that's why 5 ends the way it does. This stuff, it has to imprint on you, and then, you get that those big feelings like that. And I don't think you get those big feelings that you get in 5 if you haven't sat through how painful 4 was for them, or the ending of 2, where you're like, “Oh God, will these two ever f*cking learn to talk to each other?” And then when they do in 5, it's in two different languages. I think that's also part of what's amazing when romance works, that you're just endlessly watching two people bypass each other. When they hit, you're like, “No, wait! It's not that.” And that aching. Yeah, it's been so fun to see people react to that. 


DEADLINE: Where are you at with Season 2, or are you just kind of letting it ruminate? 


TIERNEY: It's all gonna be underwater. It takes place in the lost city of Atlantis—no, listen, Season 2 will be based around The Long Game. I don't have details. I have not started writing, so I'm not just trying to be evasive. I genuinely don't know yet. I'm so lucky to have a whole world of books here to grab things from, to use, to add color, to add context, to add story. I can tell you I'm really excited to get back to writing. I'm excited to get back into this world with them, and I'm looking forward to it. I guess, here's what I can say too, is that Heated Rivalry will always be centered around Shane and Ilya, this show. But we have a whole universe here, and so there's loads of other things that we're thinking about and that we're gonna explore and that we're gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there's an audience for it. And that's pretty exciting, so I'm looking forward to really digging into this world.

It's a shame that awards show contention is what it is in America. Because this show deserves all the flowers. Absolutely brilliant on all fronts. Episode 5 is the best episode of television I have ever watched, never have I felt such visceral emotion watching a TV show.

Great interview.  I have been incredibly impressed with each episode, and I'll be watching it again and again until season 2.

Regardless of whether or not it can get into the awards show conversation in this country, I've seen the impact that this show has had on so many people.  I'm sure that will continue as it gets seen in more and more countries.

SPOILER ALERT: This post contains major plot details from Volume 2 of Stranger Things Season 5 – Episodes 505-507.


	Three more episodes of Stranger Things Season 5 have arrived, leaving just the two-hour-plus finale to draw the epic sci-fi series to its close. Volume 2 of the final season gets into the real nitty gritty of what the Upside Down actually is and sets the stage for the final battle with Will (Noah Schnapp), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) etc. vs. Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower).


	Even more so than with Volume 1, Stranger Things: The First Shadow heavily connects to Episodes 505, 506 and 507. As Vecna's whereabouts come into focus, Max (Sadie Sink) and Holly (Nell Fisher) happen upon some traumatic memories in his mindscape and he unveils his grand plan with the 12 children he has kidnapped.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Those needing a refresher of what lore has been established in previous seasons need look no further, because like we did with Volume 1, we will explain the connections building up to these three stacked episodes.


	As viewers learned in the epic cliffhanger ending of Episode 504, aptly titled “Sorcerer,” Will has powers, and as Mike explains them through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons, there is a difference between his abilities and those of Eleven or Vecna. Will being a sorcerer means that his powers are innate, drawn from a higher being (in this case, Vecna himself). He doesn't have to study or practice much in order to access his abilities, as evidenced by the relative ease with which he tapped into the hive mind. According to D&D, a wizard has to intensely study to gather intelligence and use their powers. Wizards are reliant on preparation, whereas sorcerers can summon their talent at will.

	











Particles & The Hive Mind


	This connection comes into play when Joyce (Winona Ryder) suggests her son attempt to jack back into the Hive Mind and use Vecna's powers against him. In order to do this, the Sinclair siblings come up with two different plans, and Lucas provides a good explanation for the way the hive mind is all connected. While popping some popcorn, he posits that the dormant particles within all hive mind participants can be energized or galvanized to make the connection more apparent. As has been key since Season 2, or really Season 1 when you think about it, particles seemingly from the Upside Down have connected Will, demogorgons, The Mind Flayer and more for better or worse. In Season 2 at the end of Episode 4, “Will the Wise,” the Mind Flayer infests Will with its shadowy essence, making him “The Spy.”


	Lucas theorizes that these particles were also in Max's step brother Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery), when the Mind Flayer possessed him in Season 3, which is why, when the kids trapped him in the pool sauna and cranked up the heat, it exposed inky black veins all over Billy's body. Similar veins appeared on young Will's neck in Season 2 when Joyce, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy (Natalie Dyer) did something similar to Will, exposing his body to intense heat to expel the Mind Flayer from his body. 


	The veins appear on the dead Demogorgon's body when Robin (Maya Hawke), Will, Mike, Lucas and co. shock the body to provide a way for Will to invade Vecna's mind. As of Volume 1's release, the gross fleshy tube that attaches to Will and the 12 children's mouths apparently particalizes them with Mind Flayer molecules.


Vecna's Plan


	Meanwhile, in his eerily tranquil mindscape, Henry, posing as Mr. Whatsit, tries to persuade the 12 children he has taken that Max is a monster waiting in the woods. According to Henry, she is under control of the Black Thing, like from A Wrinkle in Time (The IT). He wants them to believe she is doing its bidding and would try to enslave the children, too. Sounds like he is really projecting himself and his intentions onto Max. He tells them, though, that his goal is to bring them “back to the light.”


	In Season 4, we learned that Eleven sent Henry back to Dimension X, which is the desert-like expanse in which he found The Mind Flayer and demogorgons. He had initially been transported there by powerful technology he stumbled on when he was younger, returning with unexplained abilities. This is where The First Shadow comes into play, because that story fleshes out Henry's childhood and the moments in Rachel, Nevada, when he stumbled upon the technology — we'll get to this later because the memory itself appears in Episode 6.


Dr. Kay's Motives


	Back with Eleven, Kali (Linnea Berthelssen) and Hopper (David Harbour), viewers learn what Kali knew about Henry — everything except that he was still alive. Those who didn't skip Episode 8, “The Lost Sister,” in Season 2 will remember that Kali's powers manifest differently than Eleven's and Henry's in that she can cast illusions and make the mind see things that aren't there. She does this while she and El and Hopper get away from the military base in the Upside Down, casting a mirage of herself still connected to that horrific machine she was immobilized in.


	Kali reveals that she previously tried to escape her confines, and in doing so, she discovered a series of pregnant woman being infused with her blood. She could tell that it was not having its desired effect, though, because the women were sick and dying and asking Kali for help. She realizes Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) was replicating Dr. Brenner's experiments with blood transfusions in an attempt to create children with super powers. She even cast a vision for Eleven showing Henry hooked up to a pregnant woman, which was “Papa's program” and how he created children like Kali and Eleven (008 and 011), giving them powers through Henry's blood. She hints that since her blood wasn't working, Kay is after Eleven for her blood because she could be more like Henry.

	











Dustin Connects the Dots


	Dustin, Jonathan, Nancy and Steve (Joe Keery) have taken it upon themselves to investigate the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down after Dustin determined that to be the center of the flesh-like wall encompassing the town. In the lab, he finds a map exactly like the one he drew to determine the central point, raising some red flags about the origins of the Upside Down.


	He tries to tell Jonathan and Nancy not to disturb what he thought could be a shield generator, similar to the Death Star in Return of the Jedi (1983), but it wasn't what he thought it was.


	We learn throughout these episodes that the characters have been all wrong about what the Upside Down is and what's been happening to them since Will disappeared on November 6, 1983. But, some of the most important lore to remember here is actually about Dr. Brenner's experiments.


	See our Vol. 1 mythological explainer if you need a refresher on Season 4 Episode 7, “The Massacre at Hawkins Lab,” which continues to heavily come into play in Volume 2.


	The Duffer brothers teased 506 as an emotional episode, and boy does it deliver while also dispensing truth nuggets that change the perspective of the Stranger Things universe. 


Dustin Explains The Upside Down


	After he and Steve physically brawl, putting their relationship on the brink of collapse, the pair reunite to try and get to Jonathan and Nancy's aid after Nancy shoots a suspicious force-field atop the roof of the Hawkins Lab in the Upside Down.


	Turns out, The Upside Down is a wormhole that bridges Hawkins and Dimension X, where Henry's powers originated. After going through Dr. Brenner's mysterious journal that describes the angry red ball as exotic matter holding the wormhole together, Dustin reveals that everything they've thought about the alternate world is wrong and not due to dark magic, but science.


	Dustin further diagrams all of this for the entire team in Episode 7.


Vecna Makes Will Spy One Last Time


	In “Shock Jock,” Will hacks into Vecna and is able to stall him so that Max and Holly can escape after he threatens to kill Max and trap Holly once again. The invasion gives them enough time to escape, but once Vecna regains control, he uses his connection with Will to find Max's body in the real world and send the demodogs after her.


	Remember, Will has been “spying” for Vecna, and for the Mind Flayer, since Season 2. We broke that down in our Volume 1 refresher.


	Max, meanwhile, is now out in the desert beyond the caves where she sheltered with Holly. She doesn't know that it's Will who has overtaken Vecna, assuming it's Eleven, since she's previously witnessed El's ability to “piggyback” into other people's minds. Since she and Holly aren't privy to what's going on back home, they have no idea that Will has these newfound powers.


Max & Holly Stumble Upon Henry's Traumatic Memory


	Out in the desert, where Holly draws the connection that the shape of the caves mimics the aperture in the spyglass, an M of sorts, she and Max literally almost fall down a mineshaft. M marks the spot for the reason Henry won't venture into the caves — they witness his memory of stumbling upon the scientist who had defected from a government experiment. This is where Stranger Things: The First Shadow comes into play.

	











	When Henry finds the scientist, he's clutching a briefcase that contains stolen technology from an experiment that accidentally sent a group of men to a place they've called Dimension X. We know that Dr. Brenner's dad was part of this experiment, and it's basically the entire reason that Brenner has been experimenting on kids — to try to recreate that happy accident and get back to Dimension X. 


	The scientist is very paranoid while Henry, dressed in his boy scout uniform, only wants to help the poor man. After the man shoots Henry in the hand, Henry bashes his skull in out of fear for his life. The young boy opens the briefcase that the scientist attempted to guard with his life. Unfortunately, the camera pans away once he opens the briefcase, and we don't get to see what happens next, but those that know Henry's backstory can make some educated guesses. 


	In Stranger Things: The First Shadow, we learn Dr. Brenner was able to track Henry down because he left his spyglass in those caves. That's how Brenner got Henry in his clutches, realizing that Henry had gone to Dimension X and returned with a unique blood type, a different personality and new powers. Season 4 reveals that Henry was 001, the first child that led to the MKUltra experiments where Brenner created more children with supernatural powers.


	Presumably, all the answers about what happened to Henry in those caves are ahead in the upcoming finale.


An Emotional Escape


	When Max and Holly make it into the red hellscape in Vecna's mind, Max quickly realizes that she and Holly can't escape together because their bodies are in different places. She gives Holly a rousing pep talk where Holly embraces her little figurine — Holly the Heroic — that Mike gave her. This helps her move past the fear that froze her when the Demogorgon attacked her mom and when Vecna almost killed Max to believe in herself and her power. 


	Mind you, this is happening as demodogs close in on Max, Robin, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty) and an unconscious Max's body as they hide in a laundry room below Hawkins Memorial Hospital in a scene quite reminiscent of the velociraptors closing in on Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) in Jurassic Park (1993). Lucas doesn't want to turn off the radio playing Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” because he believes it's the only thing guiding Max back to him, but the sound tips off the demodogs as to where they are hiding. The song saved Max in Season 4, Episode 4, “Dear Billy” and she had previously hinted that she could have escaped Vecna's mindscape earlier if the tape recording hadn't needed to rewind. But, as we learn in the final moments of Episode 6, it was never about the song, specifically, but the way it provided her an enduring connection to everything that she loved, which is what really gave her the ability to escape.


	“The Bridge” sets the team up for a crazy confrontation with Vecna as he aims to merge worlds by drawing The Abyss across the wormhole that is The Upside Down. 


Holly Wakes Up in Dimension X


	After Max wakes up to an emotional welcome from Lucas, Robin and Vickie, we finally learn where Vecna is keeping the 12 children hostage — a skeletal looking fortress in an alternate dimension, where they are attached to fleshy feeding tubes. He hangs in the air connected to similar tubes, seemingly drawing energy from the kids. When Holly comes back into her own body, she rips the tube from her mouth, coughs up those pesky black particles and tries to escape from the fortress. Vecna tracks her down and somehow pulls her back from her free fall towards the Hawkins Lab, where Jonathan and Nancy see her briefly before she's yanked back into the sky.

	











Kay Fully Admits Her Big Plan


	In a cut to Dr. Kay in The Upside Down lab where she blames Lt. Akers for the kidnapping of the 12 children, Kay screeches that if she had already found “the girl” (meaning Eleven), the demogorgons and other monsters from Dimension X would be in Russia fighting the Soviets, instead of threatening the existence of Americans. 


	This line is key, because it ties the whole show back around, particularly shining a light on the Russia plot lines in Season 4, where they were opening a gate in Kamchatka to try and replicate the success the Americans had had in harnessing the mysterious powers and beings lurking in these dark dimensions. This further explains why the Russians first came to Hawkins in Season 3 to try and crack open a closed gate underneath Starcourt Mall.


	The fight for psychic children and access to the Upside Down and Dimension X can be boiled down to an arms race, of sorts. However, there are still a few missing pieces left to be answered on this front in the finale.


Dustin Diagrams The Upside Down


	Back at WSQK, Dustin explains the Upside Down and its connection to a dimension he's dubbed “The Abyss.” D&D players like Erica and Mr. Clarke know The Abyss as a realm of chaos and true evil, and that's what this dimension looks to be.


	Dustin theorizes that Eleven created the wormhole by making psychic contact with the demogorgon back in Season 1, which did open the gate, or rift, that led to a lot of the creatures coming into Hawkins. As Henry has already explained it vaguely to his prisoners, he wants to merge Dimension X into Hawkins and create a new world.


	The team comes up with a plan to counter this action, and Steve Harrington is at the center of it for once instead of being the one who needs an explanation. Using a flashlight and a Slinky, he suggests they wait for Vecna to draw the worlds closer and let him until the top of the radio tower is poking into the dimension, giving them direct access. Dustin adds one note to the plan – to drop a bomb on the Upside Down as they escape one final time and, hopefully, do away with the whole mess.


Will's Coming Out


	In maybe the most heartfelt moment of Season 5 so far, Will braved coming out as gay to not only his close friends but the entire ensemble that has been fighting demons by his side since the day he got taken. This was prompted by a vision Vecna showed Will of a future where his friends worried about him living in a world not friendly to gay men, ultimately pushing his loved ones away as well. Will casted aside the shame so that he was no longer vulnerable to Vecna, who we know preys not just on weakness but specifically on guilt and shame in order to exploit his victims.


	Will's sexuality hadn't been outright confirmed, but seeds were planted in the earlier seasons when Joyce pointed out the slurs that kids called Will, including queer. Will's bullies, and even his friends, also often made jokes abut how he didn't like girls. In Season 3, when Will wanted to play D&D while all his friends would have rather hung out with their respective girlfriends, Mike made a particularly hurtful comment, saying he was sorry Will didn't like girls.


	Will's acceptance of his own sexuality, as well as his ability to make peace with the fact that Mike will likely not reciprocate those feelings, seems to be key to defeating Vecna in the looming finale.

Ever wonder what your favorite celebrities buy when they're browsing their favorite boutique or shopping online late at night? Welcome to Six Picks, where we ask stars to spill their style and beauty must-haves — so you can shop like you're famous, too.

Sara Blakely is taking her love of comfy fashion to new heights. 

Decades after founding Spanx — and growing it to a billion-dollar business — the iconic entrepreneur is working on a different solutions-based style: Sneex, a sneaker-stiletto hybrid.

“Like my first business, Spanx, I created Sneex because I was a frustrated consumer,” Blakely tells Page Six Style, calling her sporty-chic heels a “love letter to all the women who have been told that beauty is pain.”

Since Sneex's 2024 launch, the quirky shoes have gotten off on the right foot with stars; Hoda Kotb, Reese Witherspoon and Gayle King have all raved about them, while Oprah featured the innovation on two back-to-back “Favorite Things” lists.

“When Latto wore Sneex on stage during one of her concerts last year, I was elated,” Blakely adds of her favorite celebrity moments. “[And] Suki Waterhouse wore the white Tepper for a photo shoot (in a bikini no less!) which was so fun.”

As for how she styles the shoes herself? Below, the business mogul dishes on her six top style and beauty staples, from her “signature” red lipstick to a pair of surprisingly comfortable jeans.

“I love a bold red lip. It's my signature. This lipstick from Gucci Westman's brand, Westman Atelier, is a go-to.”

“Playfulness is a core theme in my wardrobe. I am drawn to jewelry that doesn't feel too serious. These earrings from Roxanne Assoulin are classic with a wink.”

“My favorite outfit is jeans and a T-shirt. You can't beat it! I saw Gayle King wear these denim look-alikes on ‘Watch What Happens Live' (with Sneex!) and I thought she looked effortlessly cool.”

“An easy to way to liven up any outfit is to wear a pair of outrageous sunglasses. I have tons. These from Jimmy Fairly are so fun.”

“One of my favorite Sneex styles is the Tepper in Taupe. This style is named after my daughter Tepper. It's made with the most beautiful Italian fabric called Leone mesh. You can wear it with everything from jeans to party outfits.”

“During the winter, hats are always a part of my outfit. This beanie from Missoni is on my wish list.”

This article was written by Hannah Southwick, Commerce Associate Editor for Page Six. Hannah spies deals on actually affordable celebrity-worn styles, puts Hollywood's favorite labels to the test and finds the beauty products that keep stars red carpet-ready. She consults stylists and industry pros — including celebs themselves — for firsthand product recommendations, trend predictions and more. In addition to writing for Page Six since 2020, her work has been featured in USA Today and Parade.

[Editor's note: The A.V. Club will return to recap Stranger Things‘ series finale on December 31.] 

“It gives me a headache trying to understand all this,” Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) says toward the end of Stranger Things‘ latest round. Granted, she's recently woken up from being under Vecna's (Jamie Campbell Bower) spell, so her confusion about the latest plan to kill the enemy is warranted. But there is a considerable amount of exposition packed into these three episodes—each clocking in at least an hour, with the sixth (and, admittedly, the best) coming up to 75 minutes. The bloated runtime is bound to cause fatigue at various intervals, like when poor Holly Wheeler's (Nell Fisher) friends turn against her and kick her(!) or when Steve (Joe Keery) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) beat each other up. The question “What is the point of Brett Gelman's Murray Bauman?” also comes up whenever he's onscreen. 

Stranger Things has a lot to accomplish in these final few outings, so the pacing seems annoying. Then again, the decision to split the season up is frustrating in and of itself. First, we had a monthlong gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and now, the finale releases on the night of December 31. If you have made New Year's Eve plans and hate spoilers, well, stay away from social media until your hangover recedes on January 1. At least the Duffers try to justify this batch of overlong episodes by introducing game-changing Upside Down lore and a dangerous new dimension that sets up a challenging mission for the gang. And that's not to mention the tearjerking conversations and life-or-death adventures some of them experience. (Yes, I'm looking at you, “Jancy.”)

The show still works because it has a lot of heart, and the writers have cultivated stirring dynamics over the seasons. Despite its issues and overtly familiar beats, Stranger Things hits due to the endearing characters and their bonds. We get to see plenty of that in these episodes. “Shock Jock” and “Escape From Camazotz” keep everybody separate before a much-welcome reunion in “The Bridge.” There are lots of moving parts, though, so for my sanity and yours, I'm divvying this recap based on the pairings. As the show's writers have done before, the puzzle pieces connect by the end. Let's start with my favorite new duo. (Steve and Dusty have some stiff competition.)  

Max and Holly: “Sorcerer” offered a glimpse of the two girls teaming up to escape a vengeful villain's mind control. There's a lot to appreciate about this pairing because of what they bring out in each other. A generally cynical Max was at her lowest point after losing her stepbrother in season four. Holly is the opposite in the sense that she's jovial and friendly but feels less assured in and out of the loop. Together, though, Max and Holly make for a dynamic duo. The most engaging parts of this season stem from their adventure across Henry's memories. With dipshit-turned-delightful Derek's help, Holly escapes from Henry Creel's house, but not before meeting the 11 other children Vecna has kidnapped. She knows no one will believe her about Mr. Whatsit's true identity, so Holly and Max leave on their own by revisiting all the times Holly interacted with Mr. Whatsit before being taken. 

As they hop from the playground to a library to her home, Holly witnesses the demogorgon attack on her mother. She's stumped by the fact that she did nothing to help Karen (Cara Buono), nor did she help when Vecna attacked Max in episode six. (They escaped with a timely assist from Will entering Vecna's mind.) I understand Holly's dilemma, but girl, you're 10. The fear is normal. However, it leads to an interesting personality switch between the two in episode six. Holly becomes pessimistic about their chances of escape, claiming she isn't Heroic at all. Max encourages them to keep going until they find the exit, which they eventually do—or at least Max does, when she sees Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) sitting by her hospital bedside, playing Kate Bush on repeat. Holly's gate is nowhere to be found, but Max gives an encouraging, emotional speech about her strengths. Sink and Fisher, much like Keery and Matarazzo, have such easygoing camaraderie that you can't help but fall for their friendship here. 

Speaking of Steve and Dustin, I won't lie: Watching them punch each other in “Shock Jock” was maddening. Their feelings are heightened, but come on, we need them to be pals. And thankfully, it happens sooner rather than later. After initially not wanting to be paired up in the Upside Down, the two explore the basement of Hawkins Lab while Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) do the same on the upper floors and the roof. Their goal is to find an energy shield that's keeping the Upside Down safe, per Dustin's theory. If they blow it up, then maybe they can take the entire UD down. But Dusty finds Brenner's old journals, which reveal that the “shield” is actually the door to a darker, empty dimension that they dub The Abyss. Opening it would cause even more chaos. What they don't know is that upstairs, Nancy has already fired a gun at the shield, leading to some sort of melting gray goo that's destroying the building they're in. When they realize this, Steve—ever the hero—wants to climb right up and rescue his friends. But Dustin stops him. He can't lose Steve after watching Eddie die in his arms. It's an incredibly sweet moment that reminds us that, in the end, Dustin is just a kid, too, even if he's been spending the past 18 months riling everybody up in that torn Hellfire Club T-shirt and looking for a fight. It's a coping mechanism, but the walls finally break, leading to Steve comforting his best friend. Huzzah! 

Jonathan and Nancy: After she fires that gun, they're trapped in a place where the goo is not only melting the walls but also filling up the room they're in. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, the couple finally has a much-needed heart-to-heart about the state of their relationship. They perform an autopsy of it, essentially, talking about how they both want different things and that spending time apart when Jonathan was living in California emphasized this. They trauma bonded after Will's kidnapping and Barb's death. Since then, they've only faced uphill battles. As safe as they feel with each other, they're also suffocated in the other's presence. So they share their confessions and happily break up, despite Jonathan showing her the ring, assuming death is on its way. Of course, Dustin and Steve manage to rescue them. “Escape From Camazotz” brings out some of the best work from Heaton and Dyer. For any Stancy shippers, though, Nancy shuts down the idea of liking Steve, primarily because she remembers how he wants to be a dad of six kids. (Someone tell Steve he's already a dad of sorts to the multiple teens around him!) 

The hospital crew: The action-packed parts of episodes five and six take place in the hospital. Vecna, using Will as a spy one last time, figures out where Max is being kept. He sends a bunch of demogorgons to attack her physical body, hoping that if she dies, Holly will be alone and return to him. But he underestimated the power of a determined mom. Karen saves the day by helping kill the demogorgons in the hospital's laundry room. But before she does, Lucas runs around with Max's body in his arms, getting help from Robin and her girlfriend, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty). They also think they're about to die, but Stranger Things puts no one essential on the chopping block. Still, there's plenty of tension in these chase scenes, which end on the happy note of Max waking up and reuniting with Lucas. Sink, a natural scene-stealer, and McLaughlin turn in season five's strongest performances in this scene. I'm so glad she's awake and that Lucas won't have to listen to “Running Up That Hill” ever again. 

The “Let's wake up Will Byers” crew: As it turns out, Joyce (Winona Ryder) has learned her lesson about keeping Will away from danger after seeing him gain powers. She comes up with the plan that Will should channel into the hive mind and attack Vecna through it. While it works at first, Vecna's power overtakes Will. It isn't until El (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour) return from the Upside Down with Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) in tow that a new plan to wake him up emerges. El jumps into a water tank to try and find Will in the void and gets him out of Vecna's control. Meanwhile, Erica taps Mr. Clarke into the team, using his skills to make another telemetry tracker and figure out where Dustin, Steve, Jonathan, and Nancy are in the Upside Down. Once they do, everybody comes together—thank heavens!—in “The Bridge.” Now, episode seven is where the finale's shape starts getting outlined. 

For starters, Kali tells Eleven that their blood will be in constant demand. Killing Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) isn't enough because someone else will take her place so that the military can keep making new weapons. Kali suggests the only option is to, um, kill themselves. I do not support this insane plan, even though Kali feels burdened after witnessing how Kay was infusing her blood into pregnant moms. Please, Eleven, you gotta come up with a better plan. Plus, season five has oddly sidelined its main protagonist so that Will gets a lot of the focus as the new Sorcerer. Eleven has been stuck in Hopper's charge, but she's the OG powerful superhero, and I am hoping the finale doesn't forget that. 

Then there's Steve, who comes up with the ultimate plan of destroying The Abyss, which has already begun its descent into Hawkins. Once it's close enough, he suggests climbing up into it using the radio tower and destroying it from within before it takes them all out and Vecna's plan to merge worlds occurs. Hey, at least it now makes sense why the premiere had a scene of him racing Jonathan to climb up to the top of that damn tower. It's a deceptively simple goal because we just know things aren't going to entirely go their way. Still, most of the gang head into the UD to make it happen—El, Hopper, Nancy, Jonathan, Murray, Steve, Mike, Lucas, Robin, Dustin, Will, and Kali. Meanwhile, Joyce, Max, Erica, Mr. Clarke, and Vickie are still above ground. 

Before they head down, though, comes a Stranger Things scene that's been a long time coming. Will, extra traumatized after being under Vecna's control again, makes a hearty confession to everyone. After a lengthy speech in which he tearfully talks about how he's similar to his friends and they all share the same interests, he admits that he “doesn't like girls.” He was afraid to say this out loud because of the fear he'll be abandoned, but talking to Robin about her journey emboldened him. It's a very moving (although, admittedly, a little cheesy) speech that ends in a big group hug. Aww. I do think watching it will be beneficial to younger ST fans, but it's a bit wild to shoehorn this huge moment right at the end of the penultimate hour. Let's meet back in 2026 to figure out how this all wraps up, huh?

In the documentary special “Rob Reiner — Scenes From a Life,” Kiefer Sutherland revealed the director's life-changing impact on him. As the actor explained, the first time he met Reiner was during the casting process for “Stand By Me,” and being cast in the film changed everything. 

“I'd been living in my car,” he admitted. “This was the best news I had ever gotten.” Taking on the role of Ace proved to be a huge career move for Sutherland, and it's one he has always been grateful to Reiner for facilitating.

“I had no idea, the course change in my life that it would make,” Sutherland said of playing Ace. “But he did.” Reiner created a resonant, classic story that became a massive hit once it hit the big screen. According to Sutherland, part of what made the director so special was the way he saw the world. “Rob Reiner had an incredible point of view,” the actor said. “A point of view that was inspired by real humanity, kindness, intellect… And all of those elements combined and allowed him to become a real American storyteller.”

“Stand By Me,” as it turned out, was just the beginning for Sutherland, who starred in “The Lost Boys” and three other films in 1987, the year after Reiner's film hit theaters. He has since built an impressive resume in Hollywood, as have many stars who worked with Reiner early in their careers.

In addition to Kiefer Sutherland's kind words, the documentary features many of Reiner's other friends and colleagues sharing their fondest memories and feelings about the director and his wife.  Sutherland also posted a heartfelt tribute to Reiner after his tragic passing in December, but he is far from the only one who did so. Show business professionals from across Hollywood honored the family in the media. 

Outside of social media posts from individual stars, the Associated Press also released a joint statement on December 16. Billy Crystal, Martin Short, and multiple other close friends of the Reiners signed the statement. “They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish, and inspiring,” the message reads in part, describing the Reiners. “We were their friends, and we will miss them forever.”

Over the course of a calendar year, we here at IndieWire watch hundreds of new films. Some of those titles make it to our best of the year list. A few more pop up on our staff picks list. A handful of real gems are still looking for homes (and we're still stumping for them). And some? Well, we've spent months chatting them up, only to be forced to reveal to our (likely captive) audiences that, oh, actually, that film is not coming out this year.

But soon it will be 2026. And those films, 19 of which we're highlighting below, will be coming out this year. Per tradition, we'll be rolling out our larger, most-anticipated films list in the coming days, but even that curated offering is the subject of some guesswork. This list, however, is not, and is filled with proven winners we can heartily recommend, with reviews to back up our claim that these are already some of the best films of a year that hasn't even begun yet.

Of note: This list only includes films we have seen that have a confirmed 2026 release date or have been picked up for distribution with 2026 release dates to be set. This list does not include films that received 2025 qualifying runs.

David Ehrlich, Ryan Lattanzio, Christian Zilko, Sam Bodrojan, Ben Croll, Leila Latif, Katie Rife, Josh Slater-Williams, and Esther Zuckerman's previously published reviews contributed to this list.

Sophy Romvari's “Blue Heron” follows a protagonist as she navigates her pre-millennial childhood memories through a sea of camcorder clips and hazy recollections. But it would be reductive to belabor the comparisons any further than that, as the Canadian-Hungarian filmmaker's extraordinary debut feature defies any clear precedent or easy categorization as it ventures down structurally exciting and unexpected paths.

While “Blue Heron” is a drama that works without any knowledge of the filmmaker's history, Romvari's feature is also the culmination of a decade-long journey. An international festival favorite since the mid-2010s, her acclaimed shorts regularly fall somewhere between fiction and autobiography, the latter to varying levels of overtness. In the likes of “Still Processing,” Romvari herself is the primary onscreen presence. That particular short from 2020, which grappled with the loss of her brothers by sifting through a box of family photos that had been unseen for decades, shares the most DNA with “Blue Heron,” though Romvari is strictly behind the camera this time.

For her fiction feature, she deploys an onscreen avatar. Or two. Possibly three, depending on how you interpret one specific dramatic set piece. It's a thrilling formal expansion for a filmmaker who's already so sharp in examining fragmented identities, and how they might be restored with a greater understanding of how the cracks came to be — even if restoration can be an incomplete process, and “greater” often means that a considerable amount of explanation and potential catharsis remain out of reach.

If nothing else, it's always wonderful to see a new Steven Soderbergh movie with some actual life in its bones. After the airless spy games of “Black Bag,” the postmortem gimmickry of “Presence,” and the limp gyrations of “Magic Mike's Last Dance,” the prolific filmmaker's run of small and increasingly sterile genre exercises was starting to feel like a waste of his un-retirement. I never would have guessed that the answer to Soderbergh's listlessness might be an 86-year-old man, but Ian McKellen — delivering what's easily his most essential screen performance since “The Lord of the Rings” — is so full of vim and vigor in “The Christophers” that he threatens to revitalize his director by osmosis. 

McKellen stars as the fading artist formerly known as Julian Sklar, a once-revered painter who peaked in the '90s with a series of portraits of his ex-lover — the titular Christopher — before losing his luster, becoming the Simon Cowell of a ludicrous reality competition show, and finding himself on the wrong side of “cancel culture” for unspecified reasons. Now supposedly dying from some terminal illness, Julian has gone total hermit mode inside of his cluttered London apartment, where the walls are festooned with the relics of his success and the backrooms are a junk pile of painful memories. 

Painful memories like his relationship with Christopher, which left Julian rich but scarred; his work began to suffer along with their romance, to the point that the last eight pieces of his signature series have remained unfinished in a dusty corner of his home for the last 30 years. His grubby adult kids (James Corden and Jessica Gunning) — still stinging from the casual cruelty he inflicted upon them as children, and well-aware that Julian's withholding nature will extend to their inheritance — would sure love it if they found a previously unknown trove of three million dollar paintings among their father's stuff when he died, and so they hire the best art forger in Britain to apply for an assistant job in the hopes that she can nick the unfinished “Christophers” and complete them with Julian's original materials (thus making it impossible to identify them as fakes). 

Would that it were so simple.

“Dead Man's Wire” was already in production when Luigi Mangione fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. But you'd be forgiven for interpreting it as a reaction to those events. The film — director Gus Van Sant's first since “Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot” in 2018 — takes place in the 1970s, another decade when dissent fueled by economic stagnation exploded into politically charged violence. But its sympathy for its aggrieved antihero feels very current. 

“Exploded” can be taken literally here, as Tony Kiritsis (Bill Skarsgård) rigged his Indianapolis apartment with homemade munitions when he took his mortgage broker, Richard Hall (Dacre Montgomery), hostage there for 63 frozen hours in February 1977. This was in addition to the device that gives Van Sant's movie its name, a wire that was attached to the trigger of a shotgun on one end, and looped around Hall's head on the other. If Hall jerked too violently, let alone tried to run, the wire would pull the trigger, firing the shotgun Kiritsis had pointed at the back of Hall's head.

Michel Franco is back in a pissed-off register about the world we live in with his crisply directed class critique “Dreams,” where the Mexican writer/director rails into the limousine liberal American one-percent identity with all the subtlety of a power drill. But the film's quietly disturbing power lies in how Franco packages his U.S.-Mexico border metaphor — with rich philanthropist Jennifer (Jessica Chastain) and her young dancer lover Fernando (Isaac Hernández, in a striking newcomer performance) standing in for each — into an addictive and destructive love story as sharply wrought as the movie's grander political concerns.

Chastain gives her riskiest performance in some time as a rich arts patron who encourages Fernando to cross the border illegally in order for her foundation to give an American showcase of his art. Many of Chastain's recent movies, including her Oscar-winning “Eyes of Tammy Faye” and even Franco's own bittersweet dementia romance “Memory,” have a feminist or at least redemptive streak. Not so with her turn in “Dreams” as a woman who invites little sympathy (until she does in the film's harrowing conclusion) even while she's being played like a marionette by her father (Marshall Bell) and brother (Rupert Friend).

A 71-minute wisp of a film that moves and sounds like a cartoon wind curlicue, Pete Ohs' “Erupcja” — the Polish word for “eruption” — was (clearly) shot with half an outline and scripted on the fly, to the point that all four of its main actors are credited as co-writers as well. Here, that approach proves a bit more pointed than it did in the director's previous “Jethica” and “The True Beauty of Being Bitten by a Tick,” as its elevated mumblecore energy suits the unformed and searching nature of a wherever you go, there you are story about the ways that people try to make sense of the world around them in real-time. 

People like Bethany (Charli xcx, a sly and natural screen presence), a British girl who's convinced that a volcano explodes whenever she blows up her life for a biannual fling with flower shop owner Nel (Lena Góra) in Warsaw. Her puppy dog-like boyfriend Rob (Will Madden) wanted to propose to her in Paris, but when Bethany suggested they go to Poland instead — and not even Kraków, with all of its historic charm — some part of her was expecting the planet to crack open when they got there, as if the Earth itself were responding to her fears of heteronormative complacency.

Shot on an iPhone with the same crew that Radu Jude had already collected for his forthcoming epic about the Dracula myth, “Kontinental '25” naturally feels like the scrappy and scabrous B-side to a larger project about Transylvanian self-identity. Its moral dimensions are more straightforward than those in Jude's previous work (and its form much simpler in kind), but only because their practical applications are that much knottier in return. Where “Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn” and “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” scaled their characters' personal depravities against sprawling backdrops of systemic abuse, the far more intimate — and less uproarious — “Kontinental '25” filters the perversity of neoliberalism through the eyes of a well-meaning woman's attempt to do the right thing. Alas, a bold act of kindness can be a terrible cross to bear in a culture that's sustained by ambient cruelties.

The woman's name is Orsolya (Eszter Tompa), and she's a middle-aged, upper-middle-class bailiff who was born in Hungary before she moved to the rapidly gentrifying Romanian city of Cluj — or at least to a hilly suburb on the outskirts of town, where she lives with her husband and their two kids in the kind of house that likely priced out the local population and paved over generations of personal history. Consciously or not, Orsolya has played an active role in such urban growth; her job is to evict people from the lots that have been gobbled up by the government and/or greedy real estate developers who want to turn them into condos, chain stores, and luxury hotels. It's a job that she tries to perform humanely, though a cynic might say that she only does so in order to live with the fact that the job itself is inhumane.

“Maddie's Secret” is probably not what you are expecting. Comedian John Early's directorial debut, ostensibly a pastiche of basic-cable TV movies, is not a parody, or a satire, or even a comedy. Instead, it turns out a devastatingly sincere high melodrama with a studied queer sensibility. 

Early plays the eponymous Maddie Ralph, a dishwasher at Gourmaybe, a food content production company. She's sweet, hard-working, and a brilliant chef in her own right. Everyone in the film sees it; Her lesbian best friend (played by Kate Berlant) and her boyfriend (Eric Rahill of the magnificent “Rap World”) can't help but dote on her, and who could blame them? One day, she finds herself the new face of Gourmaybe after one of her signature vegetarian recipes goes viral. But between the stress of her new job, a big opportunity to impress the executive producers of “The Boar” (not a typo) and the words of her mother banging around in her head, she regresses into bulimia. In attempting to hide her eating disorder, Maddie begins to unravel.

There is no world, really, in which “Maddie's Secret” would not have turned out very funny. If you were to make a list of the most exciting people in comedy from the past decade, everybody in the movie would be on it. The cast includes Kate Berlant, Vanessa Bayer, and Connor O'Malley. There is an all-time runner about Better Help, Maddie's house is littered with incredible sight gags, and every time Berlant did so much as move her jaw it sent the whole theater to an uproar. Even when it is not strictly funny, the dialogue is written and perfomed with the kind of hyper-expressive broadness that defines the after-school specials which inspired it. But what is most immediately striking about the film is its straight-forward sincerity.

It's a classic setup: The filmmaker follows a creative genius before the reveal of a major new work, chronicling preparations and fears, pains and pleasures, with an elegant and obvious endpoint. Creator creates, we watch, triumph delivered. That framing works for all kinds of stories, but at its best it moves beyond the prescriptive tendencies.

It's satisfying to see the painting finished, the house built, or the book complete, but it's the process that makes these stories truly compelling. This appears to compel Sofia Coppola's first documentary, “Marc by Sofia.” The film ostensibly follows fashion designer and icon Marc Jacobs as he readies his his spring 2024 show (both the collection and its eye-popping runway event), but it's far more concerned with the act of creating itself.

Fans of Jacobs (this includes Coppola, long a friend and collaborator) will find a few autobiographical tidbits, but “Marc by Sofia” wants to know Jacobs as creator first, person second. (Sections in which we learn more about his biography, including his childhood and first forays into fashion, are delightful; the film could have benefitted from more of that context.)

Christian Petzold‘s gossamer latest film, “Mirrors No. 3,” is as compact as a novella, as ephemeral in its emotion, as delicate in register as one of the Chopin or Ravel pieces that float through it. A mystery woman, standing on a bridge, lost in thought. An amnesiac looking for respite. A car flipped upside down, its driver's brains spilled onto the road while its passenger stares on, unharmed. Later, she eats apples in a bed that belongs to another woman, in clothes that belong to that woman's daughter, trying on another life almost as a lark.

German filmmaker Petzold came to Cannes for the first time with a minor-key drama, which burrows into the psyche despite its slim running time and almost perverse refusal to explain itself or the shapes its narrative takes. The title comes from a piece written by Ravel — yes, that one you probably know from the trailer for “Call Me by Your Name,” but the affiliations with the idylls of summer love and coming-of-age end right there. 

Writing and directing a script that evolved during the making of his last feature, “Afire,” Petzold has never been less forthcoming, the images from cinematographer Hans Fromm never overstating themselves. Nor does Petzold's regular collaborator Paula Beer, who shifts with silvery, slippery ease between states of bemusement and shock. “Mirrors” is another gorgeous showcase for what makes her alchemy with Petzold succeed so well.

“Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie” was the only movie playing SXSW 2025 that requires 17 years of context to fully appreciate. But man, it's worth it.

For the uninitiated, Nirvanna the Band couldn't have less to do with Kurt Cobain. Launched as a webseries in 2008, the ongoing comedy project stars Matt Johnson and Jay McCarrol as fictional versions of themselves who are dying to break into the Toronto music scene. Specifically, they're dying to play a show at a legendary club known as the Rivoli. The duo is so focused on landing a gig that they don't have time to practice music. Instead, they spend every day engaging in complex publicity stunts that demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of the music industry and often end up mirroring tropes from classic films.

The scale of the project has gradually expanded as it morphed from a DIY webseries to a Viceland show to the feature film that premiered this week, but the format remains the same. The two friends start their day sitting around a piano and brainstorming an idea for a scheme to play the Rivoli. A documentary crew then follows them as they try and execute their plan on the streets of Toronto, utilizing unknowing actors in a format that might be described as “Nathan for You” meets “This Is Spinal Tap.”

The joke only gets funnier the longer they remain unsuccessful. When we catch up with these aspiring rock gods, Matt has hatched a scheme that he believes is truly foolproof: the two men are going to buy tickets to the EdgeWalk experience that allows them to stand outside atop the CN Tower, sneak a pair of clippers into their pocket to cut the bungee cords on their harnesses, parachute into the SkyDome during the 7th inning of a Blue Jays game, and announce that they're playing a show at the Rivoli that night. The excitement from fans will be so overwhelming that the venue will have no choice but to comply to avoid embarrassment.

A kite shaped like a horse, a cicada-filled Baltimore world, and a black-and-white aesthetic almost perversely hooked on its own disaffected weirdness — writer/director Albert Birney's “OBEX” is a surreal, early-'90s'-esque odyssey into its main character's (also played by Birney) addiction to his vintage Mac and inability to form actual human connections. With the lo-fi scrappiness of a dot matrix printer and the hallucinatory male-specific anxiety of David Lynch‘s “Eraserhead,” “OBEX” tells the story of an awkward-under-his-skin computer programmer named Conor who escapes dreary black-and-white Baltimore into a fantasy world to defeat a demon named Ixaroth.

Birney, who previously co-directed the sci-fi adventure rom-com “Strawberry Mansion” with Kentucker Audley, writes, directs and stars in the movie as Conor Marsh. Living alone with his dog Sandy, he makes custom dot matrix printer photo reproductions for money over the post, while a neighbor Mary (Callie Hernandez) brings food delivery and some conversation through the door. Other than that, his flimsy grasp at human connection pretty much stops right there.

We're rapidly approaching the point where the most reliable route to becoming a horror director is to launch a short-form comedy career. Jordan Peele shocked the world with “Get Out,” Zach Cregger made it a pattern with “Barbarian” and “Weapons,” Danny and Michael Philippou jumped on the train with “Talk to Me” and “Bring Her Back.” Now, YouTube prankster Curry Barker has released one of the best horror films of 2025.

“Obsession” begins with the simplest of horror premises: Bear (Michael Johnston) is a shy and sensitive music store employee who can't find the courage to ask his co-worker and childhood friend Nikki (Inde Navarrette) on a date. Rather than be honest with her and tell her how he actually feels, he wanders into a woo-woo crystal store and buys a One Wish Willow, a kitschy antique toy from the 1960s that promises to grant its owner one wish when they snap a branch in half. The cashier warns him that most of the customers who buy them have complained about the results, but it wouldn't be much of a horror movie if he listened.

Dick-sucking, boot-licking, and ball-gagging are de rigueur for a movie like writer/director Harry Lighton's wildly graphic and strangely moving BDSM romance, “Pillion.” But for a British queer film that puts the particulars of a gay dominant-submissive affair (or arrangement, better yet) up front and up close, actors Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling find the sweet center of a story marked by clamps, cages, and assless unitards. No doubt comparisons will arise to another A24 movie, “Babygirl,” which last year put Nicole Kidman on all fours, crying out to Harris Dickinson that “I'm gonna pee!” when actually she was just having an orgasm with another person for the first time.

Lighton, adapting Adam Mars-Jones' book “Box Hill,” really does take us there in the delightful “Pillion,” with Skarsgård getting more emotionally naked than ever and almost physically more than he ever got as Eric Northman on TV's “True Blood.” But not without, at first, this leather-clad biker, who seeks a submissive with seemingly disinterested vibes, radiating aloof energy when he first meets barbershop quartet singer Colin (Melling, in a truly special and wonderful breakout performance). A parking garage attendant by day and dandied-up singer by night who's just a bit too old to still be living with his parents — though his mum (Lesley Sharp) is dying of cancer, which in part keeps him home — Colin isn't so much looking for love or companionship or sex as much as he finally happens to fall into it when on Christmas Eve he's asked for a date, of sorts, by Ray (Skarsgård, who looks and sounds more and more like his father with each day).

What makes “Pillion” so thrustingly good is how much the movie teases and tantalizes us, getting off on withholding, until finally unleashing in all its graphicness once Colin is face down, plunging his mouth on Ray's quite large, pierced cock, plunging ever deeper into Ray's expansive kinky social world. Scissor Sisters lead Jake Shears makes his acting entrance as one of the submissives orbiting Ray — and he ends up one of the stars of a very hot group sex scene splayed out over a picnic table, in which Ray fucks Colin face to face, eyes locked on eyes, for the first time.

Oscar Restrepo (Ubeimar Rios) is a bum. Call him a lush, a louse, a putz, a schmuck, a sad-sack, and a dumb-SOB and all would apply. He can take them, and then some. He is, after all, a man of words — poor Oscar's a poet, and woe unto all those who know him. 

But good news for all those that take in “A Poet” (“Un Poeta”), director Simón Mesa Soto's immensely appealing and often caustic character study-turned-social-satire premiering out of Cannes' Un Certain Regard sidebar. Put together with impressive efficiency — the film only started shooting in January 2025— this art-world send-up explores the many fears and frustrations the acclaimed director felt in the decade since making the 2014 short film Palme d'Or winner “Leidi,” channeling them into a darkly-funny burlesque that speaks of verse while playing like a Dan Clowes comic brought to manic life.

Not everyone turns out to be a Sofia Coppola, but it's a relief to report that the directorial debut of Maude Apatow — the “Euphoria” star who got her start as a precocious kid in her father Judd's movies — is utterly delightful. “Poetic License,” which premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, has all the makings of a sleeper hit as well as a new coming-of-age classic. 

Keeping it in the family is an Apatow tradition, and Maude has followed in her father's footsteps giving her mother, Leslie Mann, a prime role that allows the “Knocked Up” star to show off her familiar comedic quirks and reach new emotional depths. But beyond that, Apatow has surrounded her mom with two of the brightest rising stars in the business, Andrew Barth Feldman and Cooper Hoffman, who are both balls of bundled charisma that bounce off each other perfectly here. 

Apatow's first smart move was to attach herself to a really good script from Raffi Donatich. Mann plays Liz, a former therapist who just moved to a quaint college town with her economics professor husband James (Method Man) and her teen daughter Dora (Nico Parker). With Dora off starting a new high school, and James busy with work, Liz finds herself adrift. One way she tries to keep herself busy is auditing a poetry class where she meets best friends Ari (Hoffman) and Sam (Feldman). They quickly become captivated with this charming older woman who is just as confused about what to do with her life as they are.

Nobody else is doing what Mark Jenkin is doing. Over three features the Cornist director has established himself as a singular auteur, and his newest, “Rose of Nevada,” is, in many ways, just more of the same. His particular brand of avant-garde, genre work is, at least from the outside, basically irresistible to anybody who loves cult cinema. His latest, shot on 16mm with all the audio recorded in post-production, is a drone-y folk tale with a lot on its mind and sound mix so loud my ears were still ringing four hours later.

There are walkouts at every film of his I have attended, usually exactly 10 minutes in when they realize the whole thing is gonna just be “like that.” This is amusing but understandable; in an era where commodity fetishism has turned analog, low-budget cinema into something aspirational, Jenkin has made no compromises for accessibility. None of this is a marketable aesthetic to him; It is the essence of his work, like a callous atop the celluloid print. There is a sense that he makes films in Cornwall with a consistent stable of artists not to build a personal brand, but because there is nowhere else he could find better rust, better moss, or stronger wind. He is not using the frenzied intensity of Jerzy Skolimowszki or Takashi Ito as a moodboard; these are the fundamentals of his cinematic language.

“Rose of Nevada” is the most heavily plotted of his films, though that's grading on a pretty steep curve. It's a story that could fit comfortably in a classic “Twilight Zone” episode. 30 years ago, the eponymous fishing boat disappeared after going out to sea shorthanded. With it went an entire coastal town's economy, and the sole surviving deckhands, the one who stayed ashore, threw himself off a cliff. Now, the vessel has magically reappeared at the rundown harbor. Two men — a drunk named Liam, played by Callum Turner, and a family man named Nick, played by George Mackay — unaware of the vessel's past, are hired by the families of the deceased crew to go out once more. Upon their return, they find themselves sent into the past, having assumed the roles of the two men who were lost before.

In Brittany Shyne's gorgeous documentary “Seeds” the camera often captures parts of her subjects others might ignore. Shyne, who also serves as cinematographer, focuses on hands, weathered with creases. She looks at hair, washed in a sink. She lovingly lingers on ash dangling off a cigarette and the worn toes of boots. Shyne's powerful eye is one of the reasons “Seeds,” a lyrical portrait of Black farmers in the American South, was one of the must-see documentaries at this year's Sundance, and will continue to be vital once released for a broader audience. 

Captured in exquisite black and white, Shyne creates a moving testament to a dwindling population. The world of these landowners is threatened by discrimination and government ignorance. But “Seeds” is not all that concerned with statistics, though they are shared in passing. Shyne makes a forceful argument through just letting the audience be absorbed with a way of life. 

The details do eventually come into play. A key one, for instance, is the astonishing fact that in the early 20th century Black farmers owned 16 million acres of land, and now they possess a mere 1 million. But this information is not revealed through title cards or authoritative talking heads. When the people of Shyne's film do speak directly to camera they do so less as if they are being interviewed and more as if they are talking to an old friend.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said that “if a lion could speak, we could not understand him.” That our references and experiences of the world are so different that even a shared language could not allow humans to commune with an animal.

In Ildikó Enyedi's “Silent Friend,” communication between plants and people lies far beyond words, but it is perhaps possible to connect with them more profoundly than we previously assumed. Her cinema has never been content with surfaces, instead preferring to peer beneath the everyday.

Never a filmmaker content with surfaces, here Enyedi has always been about peering underneath the everyday and finding something curious. Her 2017 Golden Bear winner “On Body and Soul” married tenderness with surrealism in a love story set around, of all places, a slaughterhouse, while “The Story of My Wife” wrestled with love blossoming out of initial callous indifference. Her latest, “Silent Friend,” premiering in competition at Venice 2025 before moving on to Toronto, extends this fascination with the invisible — this time, through the unlikely vantage point of a ginkgo tree.

Spasming with anger where Nadav Lapid's previous features (“Policeman” and “The Kindergarten Teacher”) searched for hope, both of these movies were fringed with a sense of resignation that they fought tooth-and-nail to shake off. As a result, I naturally assumed that his follow-up feature — written in Europe before the events of October 7, 2023, and then furiously reworked around them as Lapid conceded to the futility of escaping his background — would either be the wildest film that Lapid has ever made, or the most defeated.

The vituperative genius of his cinema is epitomized by the fact that “Yes” is both of those things at once. Extremely.

As sincere in its satire as it is satirical in its sincerity, the deliriously provocative “Yes” is a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis. In a movie that unfolds like an Ecstasy-addled cross between Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom” and the Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” Lapid doubles down on the frenzied violence of his filmmaking at the same time as he fully embraces his growing appetite for submission.

Here, in a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his dancer wife who afford a life for their newborn by acquiescing to every demand made of their talent and bodies by Tel Aviv's militaristic ruling class, Lapid doesn't rage against the worst monstrousness of the modern age by speaking truth to power, but rather by volunteering his characters to get crushed under the heel of its boot. And then — with a literalness no one else would dare — by forcing them to lick that boot so clean the whole world can see the dehumanizing nature of Israel's crimes reflected in its leather.

“I've spent a lot of my life trying to move trauma out of my body,” says choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall, whose singular vision of bodies in motion brings the core tenements of the Shaker movement to startling life in director Mona Fastvold's stirring historical musical drama “The Testament of Ann Lee.”

Over the last fifteen years, Rowlson-Hall has left her mark on the stage and screen, working with everyone from Gaspar Noé to Lena Dunham, and on films as different in tone and plot and genre as “After Yang” and “Smile 2.” 

 










Nearly a decade ago, Rowlson-Hall first collaborated with Fastvold and her creative partner Brady Corbet on their musical drama “Vox Lux.” Unlike her previous film work, where she worked on a scene or two, “The Testament of Ann Lee” required an entire film's worth of choreography. t“I wanted to bring into the film some of the passages that Mona had researched,” Rowlson-Hall said. “They danced all through the night and continued until six in the morning. That was really helpful information. It had me thinking, how would the body be after dancing for 10 hours?”

Co-written by Fastvold and Corbet, the film centers on the life and work of Ann Lee, a visionary spiritual leader from 18th-century England who believed herself to be the female reincarnation of Christ. Played with gusto by Amanda Seyfried, Lee was a founding member of the Shaker movement, who later settled in New England after seeking spiritual freedom across the Atlantic Ocean. 

“The film is about movement in a way,” Rowlson-Hall told IndieWire. “The main form of this religion is movement and singing.” While there was some written documentation with descriptions of their dancing, the Shaker movement existed nearly a hundred years before the advent of the motion picture camera. “That allowed me to have the creative freedom to imagine what it would have looked like,” Rowlson-Hall said. She added that there are some “beautiful artworks of the Shakers in worship once they're in America,” showing them “making these very tight, circular spirals, which I recreated at the end of the film. But that's really all I had to go off of. So this was so much more of a creative deep dive for me.”

Rowlson-Hall began work on the choreography for the film two years ago, working at first on short tests in January of 2024 before the film began shooting in Budapest in May that same year. “I had one week to put all the dances together,” she said. Although the timeframe was intense, she was able to create structures for all of the dances. After she arrived in Budapest, she finally began working with the principal cast and dancers. “Everything changed,” she recalls, adding, “When we went to the actual filming location, everything changed, again.”

 










When creating with an actor or dancer in mind, Rowlson-Hall starts with one question: “What is their character going through and how can the dance get them to that next place?” More questions follow, Rowlson-Hall adds, like “Are they moving through grief? Are they moving through joy? What do they want? What do they need at this moment?” She finds that these questions are helpful for the actor because they know that they are not just doing dance movements, “They're moving with such specific intention that,” Rowlson-Hall said, “it's almost like it's not dancing.” 

A great example of this ethos comes during the group's journey from England to the United States. “I very much knew that sequence was going to be the most exacting dance,” Rowlson-Hall said. Filmed aboard an operational replica of an actual 18th-century ship, the Götheborg of Sweden, the sequence sees Lee and her congregation worshipping through movement daily on the ship's deck, rain or shine. As the Shakers are disparaged by the ship's crew and pummeled by violent squalls throughout their arduous seafaring journey, Fastvold keeps her camera as centered and steady as the worshipers themselves, with their bodies moving in and out of the frame as they pray. 

Rowlson-Hall knew the choreography here needed to be sharp and clean because, as she recalled, “we were going to be going from sunshine, snow, wind, and rain. I knew that those were the hard cuts that [Fastvold] wanted to do, and so the movement couldn't have that sort of flow thing going on, or you won't get a clean edit.” Rowlson-Hall also felt that the movement here needed to feel like a military exercise, or some other repeated action like going for a walk or riding a bike, that becomes so routine, “you don't have to think about how to do it anymore,” she said, adding that editor Sofía Subercaseaux “found such a beautiful edit in that dance.”

 










Rowlson-Hall also kept in mind that in the story, the actors and dancers are not playing actors and dancers; they are ordinary people who use movement in their worship. “Whether they're a blacksmith or work in a mill,” Rowlson-Hall said, “they are people who use their hands. I thought a lot about keeping the lower half of the body grounded here, in the earth, and the upper half of the body is having the conversation with God.” She instructed the dancers to imagine that their hands are akin to “antennas to God” and that they should “not do the movement until they had a specific thing in their mind of what they're asking to receive, or are asking to let go of,” she said.

This guidance can be seen in Seyfried's most physically and emotionally demanding scene, a montage in which Lee gives birth four different times, each ending in the death of her child while still in infancy. In an earlier sequence, Lee believes she's found freedom and love with a fellow Shaker named Abraham (Christopher Abbott). Seyfried channels the ecstasy of their union with joyful movements, a smile on her face. This is then contrasted with the weight of this trauma, which pulls her to the ground, writhing in pain, in search of a new form of release. 

When conceiving the choreography for this sequence, Rowlson-Hall thought a lot about the way the body stores everything that you go through. “We're just these sponges,” she said. Although she eventually found freedom through her faith, Lee is a woman who was, according to Rowlson-Hall, “born into this world that gives her nothing.” Her trauma is then intensified by the loss of her children and her lingering grief. 

 










As she worked on Seyfried's show-stopping number “Hunger and Thirst,” performed in an asylum where Lee has been locked up after having a breakdown after her fourth child's death, Rowlson-Hall said that she could do the dance only once before she felt like she was either “going to throw up or start crying,” she recalled, “because if I really sat with what she was going through… It's just so much, and what do you do with it?” 

The irony that the Lee and her fellow Shakers used movement in order to ascend beyond their trauma wrought on their bodies is not lost on Rowlson-Hall, who shared, “I have always used dance to try to transcend, to get out of the body,” but she said, “you have to use the body to get out of the body, but to get out of the body, you have to go even more into the body.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “Stranger Things” Season 5, Volume 2 — Episodes 5-7.]

I'll be honest: I never expected anyone in the main cast of “Stranger Things” to die. After Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) disappeared at the end of the first season, only to reappear at the start of the second (which wasn't exactly a surprise), it felt like the Duffer brothers were indicating their homage to '80s science-fiction would be more “Goonies” than “Aliens.” Their characters would face danger, sure, and some lives would be lost, but the core group wouldn't be picked off one by one, season after season. They're kids! In a kids' show! This is their story!

Granted, quite a bit has changed since then — the glow-up between Seasons 1 and 2 suggests Hawkins traveled to another dimension where Reaganomics actually worked — but the Duffers remained devoted to Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and Will (Noah Schnapp), as well as their adopted friends and parental figures. Hopper (David Harbour) improbably, ridiculously, yet obviously surviving the Season 3 explosion only furthered the impression that certain people were bulletproof, which also helped separate “Stranger Things” from its ruthless prestige TV peers. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






But that understanding wasn't (and isn't) universal. Every season, fans work themselves into a frenzy over who should and shouldn't be killed off. Culture writers convert those fears into lists ranking the likeliest deaths. Even the cast members complain about the size of the cast while predicting an inevitable demise or two lurking in the next set of episodes. 

So in Season 5, Volume 2, when Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) find themselves trapped in a sealed room slowly filling with white goo, it's reasonable to assume, “OK, here we go. The Duffers are finally doing it. These two are toast.” The couple starts confessing secrets. They recognize the fundamental flaws in their relationship. Jonathan even “un-proposes,” giving Nancy the ring he once hoped would fix their problems and that he now knows can't save them. Nothing can. This is it. Time to kick the bucket.

Except they don't. Of course they don't. The seven-minute scene just keeps going, and going, and going, until it's clear the death Jonathan assured Nancy was about to happen couldn't possibly still go down. For one, their dialogue doesn't close a loop; it opens one. At first, they say everything they have to say while they still can, but then… they don't die. They have more time, and they keep talking. Something shifts. They realize the lives they could've lived if only they'd been honest with each other, if only they knew their partner was feeling the same things they felt, if only… they had more time. Like, a lot more time. A lifetime, even.

 










Killing them off after such a meaningful emotional discovery wouldn't just be insanely melodramatic (seven minutes!), it would also be cruel. “Stranger Things” may be sappy sometimes, but it isn't cruel. So tragedy becomes triumph: The ring doesn't sink into the white slime; it slides across a suddenly solidified surface.

Once again, the main characters dodge Death's scythe, and once again, I'm sure there are “Stranger Things” fans screaming in frustration. They likely screeched again when Hopper didn't blow himself up, as planned, at the end of Episode 4, and I'm sure they sank to the floor when Robin (Maya Hawke), Vickie (Amybeth McNulty), Lucas, and Max (Sadie Sink) all survived the Demogorgans' best velociraptor impression in Episode 6 — especially when it takes the unlikely intervention of the implausibly alive Karen Wheeler (Cara Buono) to save them. 

Viewed with the belief that someone has to die in “Stranger Things” Season 5, I can see why these moments might be frustrating. Focusing on which of these teenagers makes it out alive would make any head-fake toward who it might be feel like torture. (Though if that's what you find yourself dwelling on during the 10-and-a-half-hour final season, I'd argue the show has bigger problems.) 

 










But here's the thing: No one has to die. If you can believe that, then these moments become less about teasing and evading the inevitable and more about appreciating and acknowledging the characters we've watched grow up over five seasons in 10 years. (And lest we forget: The Duffers love these characters. That's why so many of them are still around to begin with!)

It's not enough to find out that Jonathan and Nancy won't get married; we need to know why they broke up and that they'll be better off for it. The same goes for the comparably low-stakes relationship between Robin and Vickie. No offense to the Robie ‘shippers out there, but we don't need to see a proposal; we just need to know they'll get to go on their long-awaited date to Enzo's (presumably with Hopper and Joyce at a nearby table). Lucas and Max need to see where their coma-delayed relationship can go, and the same goes for everyone else.

One reason it's so easy to focus on “who will die” is because so many recently popular TV shows have done exactly that. “Game of Thrones” was a literal game of death. “Breaking Bad” built toward Walt's demise the whole time, and “Succession” did the same with Logan Roy. But all of those shows focus on adults (save for a few Stark children) and were aimed at adult audiences. “Stranger Things” isn't, and the Duffer brothers know it. They're telling a coming-of-age story; an allegory for how the events and decisions of adolescence can shape what comes next. It doesn't have to pivot around the kids denied their shot at finding out. 

 










Season 5, after all, is framed by Mike and Eleven's daydream of a conversation in the first episode. Eleven wants to know what happens when their fight with Vecna is over, and Mike tells her — using Dungeons & Dragons logic — that the group “usually doesn't return to their local village” (aka Hawkins). Instead, “they travel to a faraway land, a peaceful land, somewhere beautiful. […] Then they start again. Together.” 

So where will they go? Who will they go with? What friendships will continue into adulthood, and what families will come out stronger in the end? The suspense in Season 5 doesn't pivot solely on whether the Hawkins crew can defeat Vecna and who among them will survive the final battle. It also stems from finding out what their lives will be like after they come out the other side, all grown up.

And that's how it should be. With the two-hour finale still days away, I won't pretend to know what happens in the end. Anyone could still die, including Eleven, just like Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) argues she should. But even that dire prognosis seems to indicate we should be focused on reasons she ought to live rather than coming to terms with her impending martyrdom. As full-circle as it may seem for Eleven to disappear into another dimension, just like she did at the end of the first season, she deserves better than that. She deserves better than to lose out on the life she's spent all this time fighting for. She deserves better than a tragic ending for the sake of one.

 










So do the rest of them. And so do we.

“Stranger Things” Season 5 Volume 2 premiered Thursday, December 25 at 8 p.m. ET on Netflix. The series finale, “Volume 3,” will be released Wednesday, December 31, at 8 p.m. ET on Netflix and in select theaters.

After years of niche acclaim—marred by her frustrating failure to ascend to the pop A-list—Peppa Pig is setting her sights on a breakout 2026. The little pink pop phenom has announced a major North American tour, titled My First Concert: A Classical Music Journey, kicking off next February. With the news comes an unprecedented crossover: Embark on an aquatic odyssey in the video for “Baby Shark x Peppa Pig (Dance Remix),” her collaboration with none other than Baby Shark, below.

The spate of activity comes nearly a half-decade on from Peppa Pig's storied second album, Peppa's Adventures: The Album, released when she was just 4 years old. (A companion, Peppa's Club: The Album, followed a year later.) The famous pig, still 4, will present the concerts alongside a full orchestra playing songs from the TV show. She and her family will also showcase their acting chops in sketches about the history of classical music.

In a press release, Esra Cafer, whose job title at Hasbro is “senior vice president for global brand strategy and management, fashion, and preschool,” praised Peppa Pig as “a cultural touchstone for families across generations.” Bin Jeong, the CEO of Baby Shark parent firm Pinkfong USA, complimented the pig's contribution to the “special new version of our iconic ‘doo-doo-doo'” as Baby Shark celebrates its 10th anniversary. Since the dissolution of Peppa Pig's record label eOne into MNRK Music Group, it remains to be seen whether the stymied starlet is seeking to oink a new deal.

	Americans have Black Friday, but in most other parts of the world, Boxing Day (a.k.a. Dec. 26) is the biggest shopping day of the year. And hundreds of retailers are marking the occasion with new sales and discounts, along with end-of-year closeouts.


	Here's what to know about Boxing Day and how to shop the best deals this year.


	Once reserved as a day for packing Christmas boxes to deliver to people in need, Boxing Day soon became a day where people would open boxes (I.e. their holiday presents) as well. That eventually led to Boxing Day becoming a big shopping day, and it's still common to see lineups for Boxing Day doorbuster deals or limited-time offers.

	In many countries around the world, Boxing Day is a national holiday, with many referring to it as the second day of Christmas.


	Despite the growing popularity of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Boxing Day continues to be big business for retailers in Canada, along with Australia, New Zealand, the UK and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean. New data shows more and more U.S. stores getting in on the Boxing Day buzz this year as well, with retailers using the day to clear excess inventory and off-load goods before new products and pricing come in for 2026.




	What that means: Boxing Day 2026 offers a chance to save big, with some analysts noting that “discounts during Boxing Day are often deeper than regular seasonal sales,” thanks to “extreme markdowns, especially online.”




Last year's statistics revealed the biggest Boxing Day deals on electronics, clothing, housewares and beauty products, with discounts up to 70% off. Sites like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Nordstrom were among the retailers offering the largest selection of products on sale for Boxing Day.




Other sources say to expect the best deals on women's clothing and “practical categories,” like everyday household items and essentials. Where to find the biggest discounts: look for “overstocked items, discontinued models, or seasonal products that cannot carry over into the next retail cycle.”


	From Amazon to Zappos, here's a look at some of the best Boxing Day deals to shop online this year.

	Back in 2013, we took it upon ourselves to remind music fans that it's our duty to remain at least somewhat civilized when we attend concerts. We weren't asking people to stop drinking, dancing, and having fun. We just wanted them to stop acting in super obnoxious ways that annoyed everyone around them.


	Sadly, the world didn't listen. In fact, 2013 seems like a quaint and respectable age now that we're all living in the twisted dystopian hellscape of 2025. Cellphones were hardly a novelty back then, but most people could at least remember a time back then when they weren't surgically attached to our hands 24/7. Instagram was fairly new, TikTok was barely a glimmer of an idea in the collective mind of the Chinese Communist Party, and the pandemic hadn't robbed us of basic social norms that we used to obey when we left our homes.


	That's why we've put together this new list of proper concert behaviors. Some of these are updated versions of the old rules, while others reflect the changes we've undergone over the past dozen years. And yes, some of you won't agree with all of these. You'll think we're pathetic squares that need to learn how to have fun. You're part of the problem. And when we revisit this again in 2037, everything will surely be worse.

	When you look around the crowd at any given show, you're likely to see a somewhat wide assortment of folks. The only thing we all have in common is we bought a ticket to this particular concert. That means we want to hear the music. We don't want to hear you talking. If you don't like the opener or you're bored at any particular moment, head to the lobby or concourse, order a drink, and chat away. You and your buddy can do a live read of the My Dinner With Andre script for all we care. Just please don't stay in your seats and yell to each other over the music. We can all hear you. It's incredibly annoying. (And if you've enjoyed a few cocktails, you have no clue how loud you are. But you're very, very loud.)

	This isn't an issue if you're seeing, say, James Taylor at the Tanglewood Music Center or Engelbert Humperdinck at the Westgate Las Vegas Casino & Resort. But if you're at a club packed with youths and some of them begin moshing, be a mensch and help out. Put your hands up, move towards them, and guide them towards safety. It's not always easy, and it's possible you'll receive an inadvertent kick to the head, but the alternative is some poor kid smashing their head on the concrete. Nobody wants that. If you don't want to deal with crowd surfers, move to the back of the room once things get rowdy.


	Moments after the lights dim at any general admission event, there's always one or two dickheads who push their way to the front of the crowd. They couldn't give two shits that many of the people in front of them waited several hours to secure their spots. If you see this happen, and you're feeling brave, position yourself so they have a hard time getting by. If you're feeling extra brave, you can even tell them they're breaking the sacred covenant of the pit. (You might want to phrase it somewhat differently.) And most importantly, don't ever be the pushy asshole yourself. If you want a good spot, get there earlier. It's as simple as that.


	For every act like Phish that switches around the songs from night to night, there are about 50 like Lady Gaga who basically stick to one set throughout the entire course of the tour. If you want to know what they're going to play ahead of time, setlist.fm is here and ready for you. But once the show starts and you're surrounded by people who may not have peeked, please stop looking at that damn website. I can't tell you how much of an issue this has become in recent years where I can usually look around and see multiple people staring at setlist.fm. And it's not even a quick glance. They study it like the Talmud with their screens at maximum brightness. I speak for many people when I say that I don't want to know what's coming next. And even if I looked weeks ago, I didn't memorize it. Please give me a chance to be surprised.

	We really need to say this? Don't throw a beer bottle at the performers. Don't throw coins. Don't even throw your demo tape or a handwritten letter. Have you people lost your minds? (Back in 2004, someone threw a lollipop at David Bowie and hit him square in his good eye. He howled in agony and shock. Wherever that lollipop guy is now, I hope you're proud of yourself.)

	











	We went over this last time, but it bears repeating. If you are at a concert with reserved seating, especially at a theater with sub-optimal sight-lines, it's your obligation to make sure the folks behind you can see. You can't be angry at the entire crowd. But if people are mostly seated, and you feel the need to be one person to get up and block people, don't do it. We know your favorite song just started and you have the itch to dance, but it's not worth it. A good rule is to stay down if you have a totally clear view of the stage. Your good time isn't worth angering a ton of other people in worse seats. (Good people disagree on this one and feel they should get up whenever they like. They should think of older people who can't stand long or just don't want to bother the folks behind them.)


	In an ideal world, people wouldn't feel the need to use their phones at shows. But if you're going to surrender to the urge, please turn your brightness all the way down. In the pitch black, a phone is extremely bright and incredibly distracting. I don't need to see your Instagram feed while I'm trying to watch a show. And if you're filming, at the very least don't have the flash on. That not only blinds everyone around you, but it often bothers the performer too.


	It wasn't funny in 1978. It wasn't funny in 1996. It wasn't funny the first 9,000 times we heard it. And it's not funny now. We have nothing against a little humor at concerts. But for the love of God, try a new bit. Screaming out “Freebird!” is more played out than a Shecky Greene nightclub routine.

	If you ignore everything else on this list, please read this one. We spend all damn day staring at screens. A concert is a chance to put them down and experience something that's actually happening IRL. But for reasons that remain absolutely baffling, a giant percent of any given crowd would rather use their tiny cellphone screen to watch it when they could look up and see it with their own eyes in super HD 500K reality. People even do this in the very front row when the performer they paid to see is inches away from them. It's craziness.


	Yes, they're taking photos and videos. But these are terrible photos and videos that they'll likely never even look at more than once. Put your friggin' phone in your pocket. Watch the show. For a precious hour or two, live in the moment. We used to do this all the time. We can do it again. (I know I'm an old man yelling at a cloud here. I don't care. These stupid phones are melting our brains and somebody has to say it.)

	The Double P dynasty is thriving — and proudly rooted in corridos. On Christmas Day, Peso Pluma and his cousin and longtime collaborator Tito Double P released their long-awaited joint album, Dinastía.


	“It's something we've always wanted, and it's only now that it could finally happen,” Tito tells Rolling Stone. “[Peso] was doing his thing and I was doing mine. It was always something we wanted to do, but now we've finally made it happen. We're here.”


	The 15-track project finds the cousins fully leaning into their corridos foundation, trading verses and melodies in their signature raspy delivery — but also tapping into elevated production and angelic choir arrangements between songs. The decision to stick to corridos — after both stars forayed outside of the genre in recent months — was fully intentional.


	“It was important to send a message to the Mexican people that the more united we are, the stronger we are,” Peso says, with Tito adding, “[Corridos] is where we come from. It's what we like to do, and it's what's going to last.”

	











	Peso says the duo spent months trying to land on a title, only to realize the fans had already chosen it for them. “We ended up realizing that the people had already named it without us even knowing,” he says, referring to the way listeners had long dubbed the pair a “dinastía.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Beyond family ties, Tito has also been one of Peso's closest collaborators, with Peso calling him “the musical support I was missing” in his Rolling Stone cover story several years ago. “There's a special chemistry, a different kind of chemistry when the two of us are together and when we work together,” Peso says now.

	











	“People were always waiting for it — it's what people want to see, and it's what we like to do,” Tito adds.

Dinastía arrives on the heels of Tito's breakout album Incómodo and Peso's 2024 release Éxodo. The pair had been teasing a joint project for months, first offering a taste with the album's opening track, “Intro.”


	Over the years, the two have teamed up on fan favorites including Génesis standouts “La People” and “Gavilan II,” Éxodo tracks “Belanova” and “La People II,” Incómodo's “Dos Días,” and the standalone single “Los Cuadros.”

T
he first week of September, Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, a self-proclaimed independent journalist and the founder of Veterans on Patrol, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a right-wing militia, appeared at a meeting of the Sweetwater County Board of County Commissioners in Wyoming. 


	Meyer, who is in his late forties with an unkempt reddish bread, wore a safari-style shirt and brimmed hat with sunglasses perched on top. He claimed to be in town to assist with disaster preparedness. But he was not talking about climate change. He argued that the people of Wyoming faced an existential crisis due to “weather weapons” — a shadowy conspiracy of untested technologies that supposedly alter the Earth's atmosphere — which, according to Meyer, also caused Hurricane Helene, which had recently devastated western North Carolina. 


	The “weather weapons,” he warned, came from the U.S. military, which was “playing God with the weather,” spreading dangerous chemicals and other unknown biological materials throughout the atmosphere. These “stratospheric aerosol injections,” commonly called “chemtrails,” came from, he claimed, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, a division of the Department of Defense that conducts research. “Our goal here is to set up evacuation routes,” Meyer concluded. “I would ask you guys to take this very seriously because [in Asheville] we have seen the bodies that were put in trailers.… Rescue workers have pulled limbs out of debris piles.”

	Wyoming State Representative Marlene Brady was in the back of the room and agreed with Meyer. “I just want to let you know that is 100 percent correct,” she said, referring to the existence of chemtrails and weather weapons. “Our plants are dying, our animals are being affected, we're being affected.” 

	











	When people talk about chemtrails, they're referring to the white streaks you'll sometimes see in the sky, which believers think are a dangerous stream of chemicals. To be clear, chemtrails are not real, and banning them, according to Dr. Andrew Dressler, a professor at Texas A&M and the director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather, is “like banning unicorns or banning Bigfoot.” The trail of clouds behind airplanes in the sky are known as contrails — mere water condensation created by hot exhaust meeting cold air.

	Meyer's group broadcasts conspiracy-laden messages on his Telegram channel, called Sojourner News Network, alongside vague threats to military bases that harbor “weather weapons.” One of his recent projects was nicknamed “Operation Morning D.E.W.,” with the acronym standing for “Direct Energy Weapons.” At one point, a website, which is now offline, described a “brigade” of “over 3,000 military veterans and civilians” planning an unspecified “counteroffensive against the U.S. military in order to stop chemical agents, biological agents, and directed energy weapons.” The targets include “5G cellular towers,” “NEXRADS,” which are Doppler weather radars operated by federal agencies, and “noncommercial aircraft.” The website included a photo of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth with the word “traitor” superimposed. Meyer has accused Hegseth repeatedly of “treason” for the Department of Defense's involvement in DARPA. 


	While Meyer's posts often cite a wide panoply of supposed threats — “chemical agents, biological agents, directed energy weapons, bioweapons, nano-tech, and weather weapons” — most of his recent theories have centered around the existence of “chemtrails,” which Meyer believes are poisoning us. When I spoke to Meyer this fall, he described the threat to me very seriously, even angrily. “Are you OK being sprayed like a bug? Are you OK with the military saying we're going to control the weather? Because that's not theirs to control. That's God's to control.”

	Meyer has for years spread QAnon-style conspiracies about secret sex-trafficking rings. In 2018, he claimed that he found a secret pedophile hideout near a cement plant in Tucson, Arizona. While Meyer's story wasn't true, it generated a flurry of media speculation, and Arizona law enforcement even sent investigators to the site. Meyer was arrested for trespassing. Around the same time, he was also reportedly vandalizing water stations maintained by Humane Borders for immigrants crossing the southern border. He was charged for that, too.

	











	But these ideas about chemtrails no longer live on the fringes of social media. The idea that the skies are poisoning us has gained more traction in recent years, and the mysterious chemicals have been blamed for everything from mind control to weather disasters. In April of this year, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared onstage with TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw for a town-hall-style meeting in which Kennedy addressed chemtrails by, like Meyer, blaming DARPA. At least 30 states — including places as diverse as Kentucky, Minnesota, South Dakota, Arizona, and Texas — have recently proposed legislation that purports to regulate chemtrails in some way. 


	In most cases, the bills refer to weather-modification tactics, some of which are in use and some of which are still theoretical. One is solar geoengineering, also called “solar radiation modification,” a theoretical method to alter the atmosphere by reducing solar radiation through spraying particles in the air that is being explored by scientists as a way to mitigate the dangers of climate change. (There are also startup companies exploring the use of sulfur dioxide, the chemical spewed by volcanoes, to dim the sun, but the method is not currently in use, largely because it is controversial among climate scientists.) “Cloud seeding,” which involves spraying existing clouds with silver iodide, making them heavier and more likely to produce rain, has also been blamed for chemtrails. 


	Scientists have experimented with cloud seeding since the 1960s, when some states began using it in an attempt to increase snowfall, and its benefits have been relatively modest. But, according to Dessler, cloud seeding does not create weather disasters. “There's just no way humans can do anything on that scale,” he tells me. “That's nature.” 


	Still, the conspiracy has taken hold. After a July 2025 Texas flood killed more than 130 people, most of them children, Naomi Wolf, a prominent conspiracist, posted videos and photos of “chemtrails.” Shortly afterward, a variety of government officials posted on social media about chemtrails, suggesting they were a contributing factor. Lee Zeldin, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, posted on July 10, “I tasked my team @EPA to compile everything we know about contrails and geoengineering to release to you now publicly.” The post links to an EPA website that quotes Zeldin: “Americans have legitimate questions about contrails and geoengineering, and they deserve straight answers.” The site might disappoint true conspiracy theorists, however, because it states plainly, “The federal government is not aware of there ever being a contrail intentionally formed over the United States for the purpose of geoengineering or weather modification.”

	











	While most of the proposed laws haven't passed, Wyoming is one of the latest states to consider legislation to address chemtrails. In late October, the Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Committee of the state Legislature held an eight-hour-long working session to consider a bill “prohibiting the release of atmospheric contaminants into the airspace above Wyoming.” A state representative called it the “hottest topic … blocking the geoengineering.” One anti-geoengineering expert testified that the ongoing cloud-seeding operations are on the level of the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. 


	In late October, Meyers advertised the hearing to his Telegram followers and testified via Zoom about evidence he allegedly had connecting chemtrails to Hurricane Helene. 


	“This is a global operation,” he said. “These are weapons programs.” 


	MOST OF THE MAIN PURVEYORS of chemtrail and geoengineering theories reside on the internet, and the people most likely to share photos of benign-looking clouds with a sense of dread are the same ones, according to research, who likely imbibe other conspiracy theories, ranging from fears over genetically modified foods to a belief that the Obama administration intentionally attacked a U.S. outpost in Benghazi. 


	Conspiracy theories about chemtrails are becoming more and more common on X, too. A 2016 survey of adults by Dustin Tingley and Gernot Wagner at the Harvard Kennedy School showed 10 percent of respondents thought the chemtrails conspiracy was “completely true” and “a further 20 to 30 percent describe it as ‘somewhat true.'” (The survey did not find links between chemtrail believers and political ideology.) A 2025 study in Communications Earth & Environment, published by science journal Nature, found that around 20 percent of respondents said it was “somewhat or completely true” that weather modification exists. “Beliefs in chemtrails or in ongoing government intervention in the atmosphere are not fringe ideas at this point in time,” the authors wrote, adding that belief in chemtrails was associated with being “younger, female, conservative, religious, and having less education.”


	RFK Jr., the conspiracy-driven head of the Health Department, often chimes in on the topic, as well. In August, he posted on X, “We are going to stop this crime,” in response to a post purporting to be a pilot whistleblower speaking out about chemtrails. (The X account that posted the video, ConcernedCitizen a.k.a. @BGatesIsaPyscho, describes himself in his bio as “TOP GeoEngineering. Covid was a SCAM. Reject Woke Ideology. No Wars. Conspiracy Realist/Coincidence Analyser” and has 1 million followers. ConcernedCitizen is also the number-one website for “community notes” — or corrections for misinformation — on X.) 

	











	The theories have spread from social media to legislation. Despite the dearth of scientific evidence, the dozen-plus chemtrail-related bills have received remarkably little pushback, largely riding on the wave of Covid denialism, anti-vaccine sentiment, and so-called health freedom promoted by the Make America Healthy Again movement. Scientists who work in climate science have been somewhat perplexed. 


	Professor Jeffrey French, who leads the Department of Atmospheric Science at the University of Wyoming, tells me that the conspiracy about weather weapons “has gained a critical mass of people such that it's being raised in political forums” without much input from people like himself who have been doing work in the field of atmospheric science for years.


	In April 2024, Tennessee became the first state to outlaw “the intentional injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical compounds, substances, or apparatus within the borders of this state into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.” Physician Dr. Denise Sibley, who is linked to anti-mask and anti-vax movements, testified, “There is no doubt that weather modification is taking place within our state,” and describing it as an “experiment” and a “God-like desire to control the heavens.” In June 2025, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a similar bill with criminal penalties — second-degree misdemeanor with fines up to $10,000. (Louisiana's yet-unpassed bill would set the fine at a whopping $200,000; Pennsylvania, $500,000.) The day he signed the bill, DeSantis posted on X, “The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces.” 


	Beyond state legislatures, many U.S. Congress members also tout the conspiracy. After Hurricane Helene in the fall of 2024, Marjorie Taylor Greene posted, “Yes they control the weather,” on X, followed by a map that suggested the hurricane had been intentionally deployed to ravage Republican-leaning counties. This summer, Greene proposed the Clear Skies Act, a federal ban on weather modification; the legislation would make it a felony to release chemicals into the atmosphere with intent to modify the weather. 


	THOUGH FEARS ABOUT CHEMTRAILS are surging today, the idea that the U.S. government controls (or tries to control) the weather appears to trace back to at least the 1940s, when the U.S. government collaborated with General Electric to seed clouds with dry ice in a program called “Project Cirrus.” After a test run, a hurricane swerved west and hit Georgia, with at least one scientist saying he was “99 percent sure” the change in direction was caused by Project Cirrus. (Scientists determined later that it probably wasn't caused by the dry ice, but it did cool the enthusiasm for weather experimentation.) A military plan to increase rainfall as part of the Vietnam war, called “Operation Popeye,” also spurred additional conspiracy theories about nefarious weather control. Chemtrails, specifically, appear to have originated on a blog that referenced a 1996 Air Force paper proposing weather modification, which fueled theories about links to the military. 

	











	Chemtrails began as a more politically neutral theory, much like UFOs. However, over time, the far-right seized on chemtrails as further evidence that the U.S. government was not to be trusted. 


	One of the main purveyors of the chemtrails theory has been the website Geoengineering Watch, run by Dane Wigington, a conspiracy theorist who lives off the grid in California. In the early 2010s, Wigington was one of the northern California residents who began to connect the ongoing and historically dire drought with white streaks in the sky. While the number of people who supported the theory was never large, they did make waves in local government. 


	In July 2014, a local doctor named Dr. Stephen Perlman held a three-hour-long meeting in Redding that involved hundreds of residents as well as testimony from scientists, biologists, pilots, physicians, and residents arguing that the streaks were potentially harmful. Perlman's wife, Melinda, wrote later, “In the fall of 2013, Stephen and I noticed strange white lines in the sky above our apple farm in Scott Valley. They became a daily occurrence, crisscrossing the sky in grid-like patterns.” (Melinda claims chemtrails caused her husband's cancer; he died in 2015.)


	Wigington was the unquestioned star of the 2014 meeting. All five supervisors found “credible and compelling evidence” to substantiate further inquiry; they specifically rejected evidence from federal agencies that had disproven the existence of chemtrails, arguing it was “skewed.” In January of this year, the chair of the County Board of Supervisors for Shasta County, Kevin Crye, invited Wigington to reprise his role as scientific educator after three young children in Shasta County were diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. 


	Wigington's audience has only continued to grow. In 2023, RFK Jr. hosted Wigington on his podcast in an episode titled “Are Chemtrails Real?” During the conversation, Wigington asserted that chemtrails contain metals like aluminum: “What we're seeing in our skies are not condensation trails. In almost all cases, they are sprayed particulate trails.” Kennedy expressed alarm. Wigington even appeared on the “Tucker Carlson Show” in November 2025, which got more than a million views. Tucker linked the “total lie” of the Covid vaccine to the chemtrails conspiracy. “So, I know for a fact what you're describing is possible,” he said to Wigington, whom he treated as an engineering expert. (Wigington also testified last month in front of the Wyoming Legislature about chemtrails.) Anonymous online “whistleblowers” have used Wigington's popularity to catapult their own content, like an interview from an airplane mechanic that purports to prove the existence of chemtrails. 

	











	University of California, Berkeley, professor Timothy Tangherlini, who studies folklore and conspiracy theories, thinks of the spread of the chemtrails conspiracy as part of a story that gives people both someone to blame and a strategy to cope with the impacts of disastrous weather patterns. Many people, he says, operate in a low-trust environment and are aware of other ways in which the government has covered up harms, such as the use of Agent Orange. “In these low-trust situations, it's really a fertile ground for this type of story,” he says. “Here, a threat from above that's probably linked to the government or nefarious deep-state actors in cahoots with chemical companies for unknown reasons … becomes a more palatable narrative than the climate is changing.”


	SHORTLY AFTER HURRICANE HELENE DEVASTATED western North Carolina, Meyer arrived to purportedly provide assistance to the many people who were displaced. He initially tried to interfere in a variety of aid operations around Lake Lure and Chimney Rock, two small towns devastated by flooding. In October 2024, Meyer and his Veterans on Patrol group, which mostly consists of acolytes, started hanging around the parking lot of an Ingles grocery chain, which had become a staging place for FEMA. After confrontations with local residents, Ingles managers, with the help of local Lake Lure police, cleared the parking lot. FEMA moved to the nearby public library, and Meyers shifted his operation into the woods nearby.


	Meyer then reprised his role by going to Swannanoa, a small working-class town about 40 minutes east of Asheville, where he posted videos of flood-devastated homes and debris floating in the Swannanoa River.


	I went to see Meyer in February 2025, eight months after Helene. He was still hanging out in a part of Swannanoa called Good Loop Road, which is a gravel circle that used to be lined with prefab homes and double-wide trailers next to the Swannanoa River. When I went, it hosted more of a squatters' camp with trailers and a few tents. I found Meyer inside a small trailer; he emerged vaping and talking on the phone. 


	He immediately began to tell me about the “NEXRAD towers” and how they are poisoning the skies. “I don't care about the immigration. I don't care about the border. I don't care about the government corruption. What I care about is we're rebuilding people. And if the military can keep doing this, and they can send another weather weapon up here, then what good is rebuilding if we don't deal with the immediate problem?” he asked.

	











	Meyer was proud to show me around the area, where, he said, he had helped to set up a supply station, clear out some houses, and even build some tiny homes, which were really just a room with a bed. Most of this work had actually been completed by Samaritan's Purse, a nonprofit run by Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, the evangelical preacher. It was not clear to me what, if anything, Meyer had done. 


	Meyer pointed to the clouds, which were not clouds in his telling, but chemtrails. “They sprayed us all morning,” he tells me. 


	He spouted a mixture of commentary, some of it moderately accurate about the failure of FEMA to provide sufficient assistance to working-class people in western North Carolina, combined with wild conspiracies about “smart cities” and “weather weapons.”


	The place where I met Meyer was the same spot where Donald Trump gave a post-inauguration speech just a few weeks earlier, in January 2025. Next to the river, which was wider than it had been before the storm, consuming whole feet of property, yellow tape drooped, marking the spot where Trump had given a press conference at which he said that he would consider eliminating FEMA, saying, “And we'll begin the work of fundamentally changing, terminating, or overhauling FEMA. FEMA has been a disaster, no matter where they are.”


ProPublica has reported that the poorest residents of Hurricane Helene-impacted regions have gotten the least amount of FEMA funding. (DHS recently said it would release $155 million for North Carolina's recovery.)

	The people still living around Good Loop Road seemed to accept Meyer as a fixture of the neighborhood, but they were more focused on rebuilding and repairing their own lives. “I don't pay attention to any politics,” one man told me, waiting for his kid to come home from school. The ground was littered with abandoned car carcasses, sinks from bathrooms, piles of ripped-out insulation.  


	In the absence of real political action and concern for the residents of western North Carolina, Meyer was there to fill the gap, providing not just imaginary support but also the convenience of a government conspiracy. According to Meyer, once the chemtrails were eliminated, everything would go back to normal. Once the military stops spraying chemtrails, he told me, “watch what happens to nature and how quickly we recover, and how good our rain is, and how people start thinking clearly, and our trees and things will start growing normally.” If only it were that easy.

Thousands of UFO sightings are reported every year but one of the most famous and unexplained UFO sightings took place in Suffolk 45 years to this day.

Just after midnight on Boxing Day, American troops at RAF Woodbridge in the Rendlesham Forest, 80 miles northeast of London, spotted an unusual craft on their radar equipment.

It may have been 45 years ago on December 26, 1980 but it remains amongst the most debated UFO incidents on record. Science and history author Andrew Collins explains: ""Airmen were sent out in a vehicle to investigate, and came across this clearing in which was this otherworldly object surrounded with light.

""It rose up slightly, then moved backwards and disappeared. Over the next few nights, more and more sightings occurred. The whole episode was written up and recorded by the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Halt which was very unusual.""

Britain is regarded as one of the planet's most prolific UFO hotspots, despite government ministers having consistently maintained they harbour no concerns regarding reports of peculiar aerial activity. UFO researchers would beg to differ. They argue that the British government's own documentation reveals a vastly different narrative - one that eventually emerged in 2008 - when the Ministry of Defence at last disclosed its UFO archives.

British writer, investigator and television host Lynn Picknett, who explores paranormal subjects, explains: ""The MOD released 60,000 files on the subject. Which basically backs up the assertion over the years that they've been researching all sorts of anomalous phenomena.""

IMeanwhile, the British Ministry of Defence maintains records of military staff encountering UFOs spanning more than 80 years, according to a Sky History programme about UFOs.On 13th August 1956, Royal Air Force personnel stationed at RAF Bentwaters alleged they witnessed fifteen unidentified aerial phenomena on their radar displays streaking along the coast.

Nick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence (MoD) official who examined UFOs for the government between 1991 and 1994 and is currently a prominent authority on the topic, states: ""Military jets were scrambled to try and intercept these things. At one point, one of the objects was recorded at speeds of around 4,000 miles an hour.

""That was way faster than anything anyone had at the time. And reliable witnesses, the pilots saw them. They're simultaneously tracked on radar. At one point, these things are going in formation, and then they appear to converge and form a single object.""

If the British military has witnessed so many inexplicable incidents, why has the government consistently claimed to have no interest in UFOs? UFO researchers suggest the answer lies in examining the earliest documented British military encounters, which were recorded during World War II.

UFO investigator and podcaster Dan Zetterstrom explains: ""Files released show that Prime Minister Churchill was being briefed on these encounters during World War II. He was worried that any release of information would lead to mass hysteria, public panic.

""So, he covered up every UFO sighting that happened. He put a blanket secrecy ban on reporting on UFOs for 50 years. But while Winston Churchill wanted to hide UFO sightings from the public, he also felt it was important to study them, and initiated government funded projects to do just that.""

While many UFO enthusiasts suspect the British government continues to keep their most explosive UFO files under wraps, civilian research groups have investigated thousands of unexplained incidents. Some of the most fascinating occurred in a single town over the span of a decade: Warminster, England.

On Christmas Eve, 1964, local resident Mildred Head was jolted awake by a disturbing noise emanating from above her bedroom. Lynn Picknett describes: ""It sounded like thousands upon thousands of tiles being ripped off and then thrown back on, which was utterly terrifying and also there was a vibration going through the house.""

The sole explanation Mildred could conjure was that the disturbance might have stemmed from military exercises at a neighbouring Royal Air Force Base. That remained her theory until her neighbour, Marjorie Bay, encountered something equally peculiar. Nick continues: ""The very next day, Marjorie Bay was going to church when she was assaulted by a series of strange vibrations that she felt reverberating through her body, and shortly afterwards, dozens of other witnesses in and around Warminster reported the same thing. It was as if some unseen force was just taking a hold of people and shaking them.""

Following reports from locals about buzzing or droning sounds and peculiar lights appearing overhead, over 300 residents gathered at their community town hall seeking explanations. National newspapers became intrigued and visitors began flocking to Warminster for evening sky vigils where others also observed these enigmatic aerial phenomena.

David Clarke remembers: ""There was a classic photograph of a disc shaped object that was taken by Gordon Faulkner. And the Daily Mirror immediately put it on the front page, big splash. From that point onwards Warminster became the place to go and see flying saucers. It was the first sort of UFO hotspot in the British Isles.""

One region of Great Britain that has witnessed UFO encounters on an almost daily basis from ancient times through to today is Yorkshire. Private detective Paul Sinclair and his colleagues commenced their investigation and monitoring of the area in 2009, positioning cameras along the clifftops beside the North Sea.

During one evening in 2020, their footage proved especially fascinating.

""We saw an object rise out of the water. I started filming. The entire sequence of events lasted about 90 seconds. We estimated the speed to cover six miles in 90 seconds was about 240 miles per hour before it seems to turn in and drop into the sea. So we've got an object that's gone below the surface, risen from the sea, traveled six miles and then gone below the surface.

""We have footage of objects beneath the surface of the water. Or luminous light beneath the surface. And we've no explanation for that. We've filmed that on three occasions.""

Do you believe in Jesus and UFOs? If you do, I want to know how you reconcile the two. 
                                                                                          
          
My earliest memories in life are singing church hymns praising God, the Holy Spirit, and the Messiah. My family attended a small Southern Baptist church in Louisiana, and at Christmas, we celebrated angels, prophets, disciples, miracles, and the virgin birth of our Savior. The mysteries of the stories were fascinating, charming, and puzzling. I flatly accepted the teachings, just as I believed in Santa Claus, flying reindeer, and elves. 
                                                                                          
          
Still, I always had questions. I vividly remember badgering my mom about life's origins, inconsistencies in the Bible, and statements I heard from an energetic pastor behind the pulpit. Even then, I detected Mom agonizing between giving me pat answers or sincere responses of her own doubt. Somehow, she always found the right comforting words to ease my inquisitive and irritating self. 
                                                                                            
              
                                
          
So, I plodded along in childhood, mostly accepting the “truths” from my mentors, until I saw the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The year was 1977, with me eleven years old when the movie released two weeks before Christmas. While celebrating Advent, I walked into the Twin Cinemas in McComb to see the much talked about fictional alien movie. I walked out stunned, never having thought of aliens as compassionate, inquisitive, and peaceful. But a Hollywood movie opened my eyes to the real possibility that we were not alone in the universe and that perhaps extraterrestrials were watching us, even interacting with people on our planet. Hooked, I became interested in Ufology. I did not abandon my Christian faith. To the contrary, I am a committed believer and regularly worship with like-minded people. My church, however, allows me room to question even the most fundamental concepts of what it means to be human, including our belief systems. In that context, I often ponder whether we are alone in the innumerable galaxies, and I have concluded that we are not. 
                                    
Which leads me to the recent release of a documentary called The Age of Disclosure. Dozens of credible witnesses verify sightings of UAPs, known as unidentified aerial phenomena. These persons are reputable scientists, government officials, and academics. They all confirm that our government harbors non-human technology and biological specimens from UAP crashes. The United States government now admits that secret programs exist which study UAPs, including one called The Legacy Program. Long-classified documents reveal decades of clandestine work by researchers and engineers engaged in reverse engineering of the technology discovered. Profit and power motivate these initiatives, often disguised behind disingenuous assertions that humanity is not ready to know the truth. Do I sound like an X-Files groupie? Sure. But the evidence leads me to this hypothesis. 
          



Our Judeo-Christian culture is the bedrock of Western civilization. In the Bible Belt, Christians annually reflect on the Christ child and his second coming. Jews await the human Mashiach to gather Jews in Israel and rebuild the Temple. Religions of all kinds worship and believe in deities who will save humanity. Meanwhile, observations, discoveries, and theories of alien activity suggest harmless, benevolent, and altruistic behaviors. Theoretically, an advanced species could have destroyed the planet, yet there have been accounts of UAPs mitigating the environmental impact of human-caused disasters. One might espouse that the religions of the world and discoveries of alien life are not mutually exclusive. Until we gain more knowledge in this life or an afterlife, I plan to joyously sing Christmas carols in worship and simultaneously marvel at the mysteries of faith and the universe. The truth is out there.

It happened to me again, just before Christmas.

Out walking in the gloom, I saw a streetlight that wasn't on.

I ran through my usual checklist.

‘Are the other lights nearby on, showing it is dark enough that this one should also be on?'

‘Have I reported this one before?'

‘Who does this fault need to be reported to?'

‘Which app or email is the best for them?'

‘Which pocket is my phone in?'

And then, just as I point my phone at the dark light, ping! On it comes as if it has been shamed into working by the imminence of my fault report.

Once is a coincidence, easily dimissed.

Twice is a curio.

But a regular pattern, once or twice a year?

Sure, I know that's still coincidence.

And yet…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Here's where NASA is looking for alien life in our solar system","https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/venus-mars-biosignatures-nasa-extraterrestrial-life","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:02:32 GMT","

From Viking to Perseverance, scientists have spent decades chasing chemical hints that could point to life beyond Earth.

In September, NASA announced the discovery of a possible sign of life, known as a potential biosignature, on Mars. The Perseverance rover, which has been exploring a dried-up lakebed for years, found traces of ancient redox reactions, which can be produced by either life or geological processes. 

Though the origin of the reactions remains unclear, the tantalizing discovery represents the latest chapter in the search for biosignatures on alien worlds. For a half-century, scientists have been fascinated and flummoxed by ambiguous compounds and structures on our neighboring planets—and increasingly, exoplanets beyond our solar system. Here's a primer of the most perplexing finds, and what they mean for our quest to discover life elsewhere in the universe.

It's worth noting that the definition of a potential biosignature is slippery. Geological processes can produce complicated structures, such as crystals and polymers, that make it difficult to separate signs of life from non-living processes.

“If you ask the question—how complicated can non-biological chemistry get?—the answer is biological chemistry, because biological chemistry comes from non-biological chemistry,” says Sean McMahon, an astrobiologist who leads the Planetary Paleobiology Group at the University of Edinburgh. 

Indeed, there are structures on Earth that don't clearly fall into biotic or abiotic categories. Frances Westall, emeritus director of research and former director of the Exobiology Group at the Center for Molecular Biophysics in France, says it took her nearly 20 years to confirm the biological origin of Australian fossilized microbes that date back 3.45 billion years. In a study published in September, her team said these microbes, known as chemolithotrophs, could be a common form of alien life that “are notoriously difficult to detect and identify.” 

(The is the best evidence yet for ancient life on Mars)

“I had to wait until there was a suitable instrument that could measure these small things and detect the very small amounts of carbon,” Westall says. “It just took ages and ages, but finally, we managed to get the smoking gun results that we really wanted.” 

The possibility of abstract or unexpected forms of life, as well as the presence of novel geological processes, could make it hard to even pin down a standard for biosignatures. 

“We're looking for a signal above a baseline, and most of the time, we don't know what's in the baseline,” McMahon says. That's why the search for potential biosignatures has such a nebulous history, on Planet Earth and beyond.

NASA's Viking landers touched down on Mars in the summer of 1976, becoming the first operational robots on its surface. The landers were equipped with a test called the Labeled Release experiment, which mixed Martian samples with water and nutrients to detect biological activity. 

The experimental setup involved searching for gasses emitted from the nutrient-enriched sample that would expose metabolic processes from microbes in the Martian soil. Astonishingly, the test detected the very gasses that it had expected to see if life were present in the soil, a result that lined up with earlier tests of Earth soil containing microbes. 

But while the outcome was tantalizing, the experiment did not consistently reproduce the same results in subsequent tests. Moreover, as scientists learned more about Martian soil chemistry, it became clear that common abiotic compounds on Mars could have potentially released the mysterious gasses detected by Viking. 

The results are now widely considered inconclusive at best, and many possible abiotic explanations have been proposed. Regardless, the whole episode sparked a decades-long controversy over whether the mission really did find aliens. 

(Could there really be alien life on this exoplanet? We asked 10 experts.)

“We still don't fully understand what happened, which is a bit shocking when you think about it,” McMahon says. “It was a flawed experiment that was liable to both false positives and false negatives.” 

Westall thinks there is likely a non-biological explanation for the Viking mystery, such as the presence of reactive compounds in the Martian soil capable of producing the detected gasses. But she adds that “we could be surprised.” 

“It's very difficult to say 100 percent positive or 100 percent negative,” she says. “My feeling is that the analysis was interesting, but we simply do not have sufficient data to say that it was an indication of a trace of extant life.”

Fast-forward two decades: In 1996, President Bill Clinton announced the “possible discovery of life on Mars” after scientists identified strange structures in a Martian meteorite that landed in Antarctica, known as called Allan Hills 84001. Though researchers initially speculated that the structures might be “fossil remains of a past Martian biota,” there is now widespread consensus that they can be explained by abiotic geochemistry.

The story of the Allan Hills meteorite has often been viewed as a cautionary tale of jumping the gun, but it also helped to stimulate public interest and academic investment in the search for life in other words.

“Despite the fact that their interpretations were wrong, the study really pushed the field of astrobiology,” Westall says. “We know a lot more now, 30 years after they published that paper.”

(How many alien civilizations might be out there?)

Beyond searching for signs of life on the surfaces of other worlds, scientists are increasingly gazing into the skies of distant planets to look for atmospheric chemistry that might hint at biological activity. 

In 2021, a team reported a detection of phosphine, a compound that has both biotic and abiotic origins, in the atmosphere of Venus. Earlier this year, another team reported a potential atmospheric biosignature on the exoplanet K2-18b, located some 124 light years from Earth. Both results generated spirited pushback and inspired research into non-biological explanations, which will likely be a common theme in the coming years as we peer deeper into extraterrestrial skies.

“We've barely started to scratch the surface of the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres,” McMahon says. “The way that we're going to find life begins with making an observation that we can't explain, and then the real work is figuring out all the possible explanations and doing the scientific detective work.”

To that end, Perseverance's new discovery of redox reactions is thrilling, but it is only the start of a new story, not the conclusion. The plan is ultimately to send another spacecraft to Mars to pick up Perseverance's' samples and bring them back to Earth where they can be thoroughly examined. This effort could potentially reveal whether Perseverance has already discovered alien life, though the sample-return effort is imperiled by the current administration's proposed cuts to NASA.

Perhaps one day, we will be able to clearly identify a true alien biosignature, finally solving the great riddle of whether we are alone in the universe. But we will likely need a whole lot of patience and dedication to reach that milestone.  

“It would be terribly, terribly exciting,” says Westall of the possible discovery of alien life. “But I think it will probably be like looking for a needle in a haystack.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","If You Loved 'Supernatural's Angel Wars, This Forgotten Fantasy Epic Goes Even Harder","https://collider.com/supernatural-dominion-legion-spinoff-syfy-series/","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:12:00 GMT","

Anyone who's a fan of Supernatural remembers the moment where the long-running horror series kicked into a new gear: its Season 4 premiere ""Lazarus Rising"", which introduced the angel Castiel (Misha Collins). Castiel's presence added a new dynamic to Supernatural, particularly when he shared the screen with Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), and new enemies as Dean and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) found themselves fighting the forces of Heaven and Hell. Before Castiel stole the show in Supernatural, the Syfy Channel depicted its own version of a heavenly war with the short-lived series, Dominion. 

Dominion takes place after God mysteriously disappears from Heaven. In His absence, archangel Gabriel (Carl Beukes) launches a war against humanity, intending to wipe them off the Earth. Humanity isn't going down without a fight though, setting up small armies in heavily fortified cities — including ""Vega"", which is built out of the remains of Las Vegas. It's here that Alex Lannon (Christopher Egan) learns that he has been chosen to be the savior of the human race; he must juggle his newfound duties with continuing the battle against Heaven's forces.

Dominion's biggest claim to fame is that it's a sequel to the horror film Legion, even bringing back director Scott Stewart to helm the pilot episode. Legion boasts the kind of plot that would come to define Supernatural, as the archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) travels to Earth to protect a young couple, Charlie (Adrienne Palicki) and Jeep (Lucas Black), as their child will be the only hope for humanity to survive the angels' wrath. The pilot of Dominion picks up where Legion left off, as Alex is Charlie and Jeep's son. Jeep, now played by Langley Kirkwood, even appears in the pilot episode before dying and passing on his duties to Charlie.

Though Legion was packed full of horrifying Biblical imagery and managed to turn a profit, it was critically savaged, being called ""dull"" and that it ""took itself way too seriously"". Dominion fared slightly better, as its first season stands at a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes while its first season is a measly 48%. This jump in quality is credited to a deeper storyline that finds Alex dealing with the toll that the war against Heaven is taking on him, while also showcasing just how devestating said war truly is. Sadly, it wasn't enough to save Dominion as the series was canceled shortly after its second season.

The Winchester brothers did it all.

Dominion might share the common theme of fighting angels with Supernatural, but like its predecessor, its cast featured a wide range of actors who went on to bigger and better roles. Season 2 features Christina Chong as Zoe Holloway, a soldier who grew disillusioned with the war and deserted; sci-fi fans might better know her as La'an Noonien Singh from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Kim Engelbrecht, who plays Alex's fellow soldier and lover Noma (and also turns out to secretly be an angel), had a stint on The Flash as the wife of the superintelligent villian, the Thinker. Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans will be delighted to see that Anthony Stewart Head appears in the series, playing a villainous role for once.

Ironically, Dominion wouldn't be the first time that Christopher Egan starred in a short-lived series that put its own twist on Biblical lore. Prior to Dominion's conception, he starred in NBC's Kings, a series that put a modern spin on the rise of King David. Kings was handicapped from the start, as it dealt with low ratings and NBC refusing to promote it due to its ties to religious material. Dominion, on the other hand, had no such hangups as the Syfy Channel was fairly open about the kind of programming it carried. If you're looking for a series to fill the Supernatural-sized hole in your heart, Dominion is worth a watch.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Can dogs really sense danger?","https://www.dw.com/en/can-dogs-really-sense-danger/a-75147970","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 05:35:51 GMT","

Research shows what canines really can sense — and how social media and human projection fuel belief in their supernatural abilities.

Countless clips of heroic dogs rescuing humans are circulating on social media. But do dogs really have a magical sixth sense, or are their ""superpowers"" simply biology that's being given outsized significance by their human owners?

Spectacularly staged rescue videos get millions of clicks on social media, whether they are real scenes, cleverly edited clips or AI illusions. 

Psychologically, this is confirmation bias at work. People remember conspicuous dog behavior before an accident but forget all the times the dog reacted similarly without incident.

The desire to believe in a special bond with one's own pet and its unique abilities makes belief in canine clairvoyance even more convincing.

Dogs have senses that are far superior to those of humans. They hear much higher frequencies, are sensitive to vibrations, changes in air pressure and weather, and have a sense of smell that is around 10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than that of humans.

Studies on epilepsy, diabetes and cancer show that they can detect the slightest biochemical changes in the body — in sweat or breath, for example. They also register the smallest changes in the behavior and emotions of their caregivers, such as muscle tension, breathing rhythm and the smell of stress.

In a study by Neil Powell of Queen's University Belfast, 19 family dogs reacted significantly differently to sweat samples from epilepsy patients in the phase shortly before a seizure versus control samples.

Assistance dogs for diabetes or cancer are not guided by supernatural forces. Instead, they detect physiological signals such as heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress hormones, and what are known as VOC patterns (volatile organic compounds), combinations of organic molecules that reflect a person's state of health.

Canadian psychologist Stanley Coren from the University of British Columbia is a pioneer in dog research. Coren developed his namesake ""Stanley Coren Index"" to assess the intelligence of different dog breeds. His studies show that average dogs understand up to 165 words, while intelligent dogs understand as many as 250, comparable to the cognitive performance of a two-and-a-half-year-old child.

Coren explains the behavior of some dogs before disasters in terms of their biology. ""Many of these stories about dogs predicting disasters or accidents seem supernatural, but can usually be explained by their extraordinary sensory organs,"" he told DW in an emailed interview.

According to Coren, dogs could, for example, hear the first sounds of breaking rock layers when an earthquake is imminent, sounds that are far beyond the human hearing threshold.

They also sense heat sources ""like an infrared sensor"" and perceive even minimal instabilities or vibrations via fine touch sensors between their paw pads. This is why a dog may become restless shortly before a bridge begins to sway or a vehicle skids on a wet road, Coren wrote.

What appears to be a ""sixth sense"" is therefore primarily a physiological advantage. Dogs react earlier to stimuli that are already present but not perceptible to humans.

Other animals also have much more powerful senses than humans. A team led by Martin Wikelski from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior equipped cows, sheep and dogs in Italy with sensors and observed significantly increased activity before several earthquakes, especially among animals in stables.

Apparently, they react to microvibrations or electrical effects in rock layers. ""This is not a premonition but a reaction to physical stimuli,"" Wikelski explained in an email to DW.

However this does not allow for reliable predictions. ""Dogs can certainly do a lot, but warning of car accidents seems practically impossible to me, except perhaps when it comes to the nervousness of owners that could lead to accidents,"" Wikelski said.

He emphasized that data is needed to separate myths from real abilities.""Such anecdotes would have to be verified with transmitters attached to the animals—as we did in our studies on earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.""

Most incidents of doggy sixth sense can usually be explained by coincidence, retrospective interpretation or a dog's ultra-sensitive reactions to real stimuli.

Dogs can notice unusual noises, screeching tires, traces of smoke or their owner's anxiety seconds before these factors become perceptible to humans. If the dog then displays stress behavior — panting, whining, urging — it is easy to see this as an early warning in retrospect.

The wildest celebrity-fueled conspiracy theories of 2025 have made headlines throughout the year. Kim Kardashian reignited moon-landing doubts, prompting NASA to restate it landed on the Moon six times.

Donald Trump alleged US funds under the Biden administration bought condoms for Hamas to make bombs; records show only $45,681 in contraception sent to Jordan in 2024, with no condoms. 

Wiz Khalifa repeated flat-earth theories, despite overwhelming evidence debunking this longstanding false claim. 

Sopranos actor Drea de Matteo used OnlyFans to call airplane contrails “chemtrails,” another long-debunked claim.

When Trump began deploying troops to US cities, Janessa Goldbeck's Vet Voice Foundation was ready – now they're preparing for what may be next

Whatever the worst-case scenario, Janessa Goldbeck has probably imagined it. In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup. Last year she advised local leaders on the hypothetical of troops being deployed to their streets for immigration enforcement.

Then Donald Trump won and Goldbeck's nightmare came true.

“It's a little surreal to see something that we've been talking about and thinking about and stressing out about,” the chief executive of Vet Voice Foundation, a non-profit advocacy organisation, says via Zoom from her home in San Diego, California. “When we first did War Game, the film, some folks would ask during our press tour, ‘Do you think you're scaring people? This feels a little hyperbolic?' It doesn't feel good to say I told you so in this moment.”

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has sought to politicise the military like no other commander-in-chief before him and use it as a cudgel against Democratic-led states and cities. He has deployed thousands of national guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans and Washington DC, triggering protests from local officials and residents.

Having read the Project 2025 policy document, Goldbeck saw this coming. Last year Vet Voice Foundation, which mobilises veterans and military families to defend US democracy, ran exercises with local elected officials, activists and journalists to prepare for a second Trump administration conducting aggressive immigration enforcement. It has now become a vital resource for governors, state attorneys general and mayors trying to weather the storm.

Goldbeck, 40, explains: “This year the vast majority of our work has been supporting litigation to halt or slow down national guard deployments, providing subject expert witnesses, retired generals, to talk through with staff what the footprint of these deployments might look like and how to prepare, and training for activist groups on who the guard is, who they're not – the difference in the uniforms that the guys at ICE are wearing versus the national guard.

“Then serving as advisers for governors and mayors who are living day to day through this, helping them shape their communications and ensure that things don't become more violent. That's been a huge line of effort for us.”

It would be a mistake to assume that all national guard members are Make America Great Again (Maga) diehards eager to do Trump's bidding. In every city except the capital, their role has eventually been restricted by courts to guarding federal property. Some have told Goldbeck that it is tedious and unfulfilling work.

“There's a wide range of feelings for the folks I've spoken to, ranging from boredom – this is a waste of time – to anger because they've been taken away from their families and their jobs. Most guardsmen make more in their civilian jobs than they do when they're deployed but they signed up to serve their communities, to either serve overseas to protect the homeland or to respond in cases of a natural disaster.

“They did not sign up to be ICE – immigration enforcement – and they did not sign up to police their friends and neighbours or to be deployed into ‘hostile territory' where the governors, local police have said actually, we do not want you here.”

Last month, two West Virginia national guard members were shot in a targeted ambush near the White House by an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who had previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and arrived in the US in 2021. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe survived and has been released from hospital.

Goldbeck comments: “After the horrific killing of the guardswoman in DC, there's the question of: is the president putting these folks in danger unnecessarily? The answer to that, I believe, is absolutely yes, especially when they're not necessarily trained for the mission they're being asked to execute. But also they're targets of opportunity for any madman who wants to create chaos or has a vendetta or a mental health crisis or whatever it is.”

Then there is embarrassment. In Washington the national guard have been seen picking up litter, helping commuters with luggage and feeding squirrels. Goldbeck continues: “I spoke to one mother of a guardsman in DC who said she'd had a phone call with him and he said, ‘Mom, they're calling us the national gardeners on the internet,' because they're out there picking up trash. This is a combat vet who was a law enforcement official in his real life.

“That's humiliating to our service members. It just goes to show how deep this president's disdain is for people who serve in uniform and how little he understands about the actual ethos of the military and what it's there to do.”

The deployments come in broader context that has seen Trump expand presidential power. He has sought to sideline Congress, gut the civil service, flout the law, weaponise the justice department against his perceived enemies and coerce law firms, media and universities. Goldbeck warns that he could use the military to cling to power.

“I hope that people have learned that this administration, this president, mean what they say, even it if sounds absurd or anti-American or anti-democratic. They mean it. I absolutely think that this president wants to remain in power much longer, for as long as he can.”

She adds: “My fear is that this is all a lead-up to potential use of the guard or the US military around the next election cycle. I'm not just dreaming about that. It's because it's been spoken about by very senior members of this administration and the president himself. That is incredibly alarming. It is not American to conduct elections with troops in the streets and to intimidate voters. It's very authoritarian.”

Goldbeck's own story is testimony to the diverse, non-monolithic nature of the military. She was raised in San Diego by parents she describes as “children of the 60s and 70s” who were “vegetarian pacifist Hindus”. Her mother was an elementary school teacher and her father drove a tow truck.

She attended Northwestern University, studying journalism and African studies. A study abroad programme in Uganda and Rwanda educated her on the unfolding genocide in Darfur, Sudan, sparking her passion for activism. Returning to the US, she became the national student leader of a movement to compel the government to protect civilians in Darfur.

Goldbeck's activism in Washington brought her into contact with military and security personnel. She observed a disconnect between humanitarian workers and the security forces that enable their operations. To bridge this gap and gain a “master's degree, so to speak, in military”, she decided to join the Marine Corps at age 25.

This decision was a shock to her family. When she told her parents she was joining the Marine Corps, they were “horrified” and said: “These are not the values we raised you with.” This was the opposite of their reaction when she came out as gay, to which they responded, “We love you no matter what.” But over time, her parents came to take pride in her service.

Goldbeck commissioned as a Marine Corps officer in 2012 and served for seven years as a combat engineer officer – a role she defines as someone who “builds things and blows things up” – while advocating for fellow female and LGBTQ+ service members. She spent years in Europe training US-allied countries but her final duty station brought her back home to oversee the integration of the west coast boot camp to include both male and female candidates.

Goldbeck left the Marine Corps in 2019 for two primary reasons: her mother becoming seriously ill and the election of Trump. She felt she could not remain silent in uniform and “wanted to be involved in pushing back” against what she saw happening to the country.

A few weeks after leaving the service, her local member of Congress retired, and Goldbeck was recruited to run for the seat. Although she did not win, the experience led to an offer to lead the Vet Voice Foundation, which represents about 2 million veterans, military family members and supporters.

The foundation has been heavily involved in protecting public lands, citing a deep connection between veterans and the outdoors for healing and reconnecting with family. Following the supreme court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the foundation has advocated to ensure that female service members stationed in states with restrictive abortion laws could travel to get necessary medical care.

Earlier this year Goldbeck testified to a Senate forum that the justice department was laying the groundwork for voter roll purges that disproportionately target groups including servicemen and women who move frequently or vote absentee. She noted that more than 30% of veterans have a service-connected disability and for many in-person voting is not feasible.

Joining all the dots, she is concerned that the military's status as an apolitical institution is under threat from Trump. She says: “This administration is doing harm to the world and to the nation in a lot of different ways but one of my chief concerns is about this generational harm that it's doing to the professionalism and the apolitical nature of the military.”

In this, she argues, Trump is being aided and abetted by Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence. In a recent speech to senior officers at a military base in Quantico, Virginia, Hegseth railed against “woke” culture, railed against “fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon” and insisted: “No more beardos.”

Goldbeck responds: “Pete Hegseth is unequivocally the least qualified person who ever led the department of defense.”

Hegseth has also gone on the record with the opinion: “I'm straight up saying we should not have women in combat roles”. This is anathema to Goldbeck, who put herself forward for infantry officer training, a position then closed to female marines, and later worked with advocacy groups to successfully repeal the policy. She states that in the decade since women have served successfully and standards have not been lowered.

“To see this fight that has already been litigated, has already put to bed, that nobody in the service is actually still grumbling about except for a few guys that have holes in their soul that will never be filled, is so incredibly infuriating,” she reflects.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US has launched a “powerful and deadly” strike on Islamic State (IS) “scum” in Nigeria, Donald Trump said.

The president took action, in coordination with Nigeria's military, on Thursday after having spent weeks accusing the West African country's government of failing to stop the persecution of Christians.

“Tonight, at my direction as commander in chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against Isis terrorist scum in north-west Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing – primarily innocent Christians – at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform.

The strike killed multiple IS militants and was conducted after an appeal from Nigerian authorities, the US military's Africa Command said on X.

Last month, Mr Trump warned that Christianity faced an “existential threat” in Nigeria and vowed to intervene over what he described as the country's failure to stop violence targeting their communities.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, wrote on X: “The president was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.”

Mr Hegseth said the US military was “always ready, so Isis found out tonight – on Christmas”, adding: “More to come... grateful for Nigerian government support and cooperation”. He then signed off the message: “Merry Christmas!”

On Monday, Reuters reported that the US had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.

The country's government said armed groups had targeted both Muslims and Christians. US claims that Christians faced persecution dido not represent the complex security situation and ignored efforts to safeguard religious freedom, it added.

Recommended

However, Nigeria agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims, living primarily in the north, and Christians in the south.

The strikes on Friday came the day after a suspected suicide bomber detonated an explosive in a mosque in Maiduguri, a city in the north-east, killing at least five worshippers and injuring 35.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred in a region where Islamist insurgents Boko Haram and its IS-affiliated offshoot Iswap have waged a 15-year campaign of violence, targeting civilians, mosques and markets.

The US has intensified its campaign against IS over the past month, launching multiple air strikes against targets in Syria.

It killed at least five militants on Dec 20 in what Mr Trump labelled “a very serious retaliation” for a deadly attack on American soldiers carried out by a lone IS gunman.

Two US soldiers and an interpreter who held US citizenship were killed in the ambush on Dec 13, triggering the US to strike more than 70 targets across central Syria, including in Homs, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa provinces.

Announcing the strikes, Mr Trump said: “Because of IS's vicious killing of brave American patriots in Syria, whose beautiful souls I welcomed home to American soil earlier this week in a very dignified ceremony, I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation – just as I promised – on the murderous terrorists responsible.

“We are striking very strongly against Isis strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if IS can be eradicated.”

$10bn Trump-approved sale to Taipei triggers Beijing sanctions against firms such as Boeing and Northrop Grumman

China's foreign ministry has hit US defence companies including Boeing with sanctions after Donald Trump approved a large package of arms sales to Taiwan.

The ministry said on Friday that the measures – against 10 individuals and 20 US firms including Boeing's production hub at St Louis in Missouri – would freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in China and bar domestic organisations and individuals from doing business with them.

It comes after the Trump administration last week announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10bn, including medium-range missiles and drones. It was the largest weapons sale in the history of the bilateral relationship.

China's stance on Taiwan, which is that it must merge with the People's Republic of China – something that the democratically governed Taipei rejects – has been a pinch point in its relations with the US, already worn thin over trade and tariff issues.

Individuals on the Chinese sanctions list, including the founder of the defence firm Anduril Industries and nine senior executives from the sanctioned firms, are banned from entering China, the ministry added.

Boeing produces fighter jets in St Louis, where more than 3,000 union workers went on strike over pay this year. Other companies targeted by the sanctions include Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation and L3Harris Maritime Services.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Friday: “The Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. Any provocative actions that cross the line on the Taiwan issue will be met with a strong response from China.” They urged the US to cease “dangerous” efforts to arm the island.

The US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, although such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

The eight arms agreements that comprised the total sale included 420 army tactical missile systems, or Atacms. The systems are similar to those sent to Ukraine under the Biden administration for its defence against Russia.

The state department said at the time of the Taiwan arms sale that it served “US national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability”.

“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” various similar statements issued on each of the agreements said.

Looking into age restrictions on social media is ""more than justified,"" Germany's Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger told the dpa news agency, commenting on Australia banning the platforms for children under 16.

With Australia's social media ban for teenagers coming into effect this month, German Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger signaled he was opened to a similar move in the EU country.

""I can see a lot of merit in that,"" he told the German dpa news agency in remarks published on Friday.

""I consider the question of an age restriction to be more than justified,” he added.

Since December 10., the Australian government has required social media platforms to remove profiles of users under 16 and prevent teens from creating new ones.

While the move was controversial, Australian officials say it was motivated by concerns such as cyberbullying, grooming and content that might be harmful to mental health.

The ban applies to multiple digital platforms and global corporate giants such as TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook, Kick, Twitch, Threads and X.

Social media companies and civil liberties activists have criticized the law. At the same time, the decision prompted praise in other countries, where governments are closely monitoring Canberra's efforts to implement and enforce its new policy; including its age verification systems.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was ""inspired"" by the Australian ban.

Australia remains the first and only country in the world to impose such a restriction.

Wildberger pointed to an expert commission appointed by the German government to address child and youth protection in the digital age.

""So now the question is: How do we enable them to have a healthy development, like earlier generations had without social media?"" he said.

The panel, which includes academics, medical professionals and youth protection advocates, is expected to publish policy recommendations by summer 2025.

Those proposals are likely to cover social media use and may include comments on banning cellphones in schools, similar to measures already partly implemented in France.

Each collection speaks to a different seasonal mood, but all are worth slowing down with before the new year.

For those of us north of the equator, winter officially arrived last week. The early darkness and the chill in the air demand a change in our habits. For many, the season provokes an unmistakable turn inward—toward our warm homes, or the loved ones we see on holidays, or meditative thoughts that, in other times of year, might be crowded out by the light and noise of the world.

Perhaps saying so is sentimental, but these feel like the perfect days and nights for poetry. The form can capture, perhaps better than any other, the muffled quality of cold afternoons and days spent indoors. Its winding paths of language can describe both the season's comforts and its harsher qualities. As 2025 winds down, we've selected some poetry to accompany you through the last days of December. Each collection speaks to a different wintry mood, but all are worth slowing down with before 2026 brings the return of longer, busier days.

Selected Poems of Rubén Darío, translated by Lysander Kemp

Once, after an epiphany in a high-school class, my best friend declared that she had made up her mind to study literature in college. This was years ago, but I remember that day well: She said that analyzing a Darío poem had made her realize how beautiful an arrangement of words can be. Many of his works double as fairy tales, and have been adapted into children's books. This is why my first exposure to Darío, one of the best poets to ever write in Spanish, came when I was 3 or 4—in the form of a princess story that I love just as much now. My father, too, can recite from memory a Darío verse he read as a young man: “and the neck of the great white swan that questions me.” This volume of Kemp's translations includes my favorite Darío poems; their rhymes are lost, but their dreamlike, hypnotic quality is preserved. And the sensual images these verses bring to mind—nightingales and angels and silks—make this collection ideal for evenings beside the hearth.  — Gisela Salim-Peyer

Rangikura, by Tayi Tibble

On a snowy day, you could curl up by the fire with something wholesome and cozy; you could perch by the window with something chilly and somber. Or you could crack open the New Zealand poet Tayi Tibble's Rangikura, which is none of these things. Playful, forceful, and sexy, it radiates so much heat that choosing it for a holiday read is like fleeing south for the winter. (And in Tibble's home country, December is summer.) That's not to say it's unserious: Tibble reflects on the relentless shame she used to feel about her gender and her Indigenous Māori heritage; she charts how she emerged from timidity like flowers peeking out from a melting blanket of ice. Rangikura is the result of her transformation, and it is a persuasive case for freedom, pleasure, and fun that honors the generations of women in her family who also celebrated, shouted, and danced. “I'm hotter than the sun,” she declares. “And my ancestors ride wit me / like dawgs. When I whistle / they run and run and run.”  — Faith Hill

Midwinter Day, by Bernadette Mayer

In her diary-like, book-length poem, Midwinter Day, Mayer sets out “to tell the story of exactly what is happening.” The book duly follows a course from her waking hours to the “long black night” of the winter solstice. In the middle of the book, she stops to note the time: “It's 1:15 pm,” she writes, as she leaves the market. “We're going home with what we can have to carry. / Having had to pay for it / And the sun comes out.” Mayer isn't the first author to turn a single day into her plot, but her loving transcription of life in 1978 Lennox, Massachusetts—her children drawing at the kitchen table, their visit to the library, the pattern of snow Mayer sees on a roof, the red brake lights that shine on the wet street—makes a string of ordinary events feel like quiet epiphanies.  — Walt Hunter

Was It for This, by Hannah Sullivan

Sullivan's poems are so long that only six appear in her books. Half of these are in her 2018 debut, Three Poems, and the other half appear in her follow-up, Was It for This, which juxtaposes an elegy for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire with two gratitude-laced meditations on aging. Throughout, the depth and quality of Sullivan's attention to prosaic detail—even plain and unappealing objects—never wavers. She lingers on microwavable “corn cobettes”; on a crumbling library book that turns into an “osteoporotic spine / all particles, frayed ribbon, / skin stubs, moving in the / light.” Such appreciative concentration is rare in this era of rush and scrolling, but in “Was It for This,” the collection's most meditative poem, Sullivan writes, “The things that I instinctively saw as ugly I wanted to see also, under another aspect, as beautiful.” When I read her, I want that too.  — Lily Meyer

The Wilderness, by Sandra Lim

Lim's searching book is best read in complete silence. It rewards the focused, careful turning over of words and phrases. And it is studded with winter imagery: “No clouds toppled across the snow wilderness. / No gloom-dark tree-glitter winding and twining its silks. / Blankness, egg-quiet,” she writes in “Wintering.” This book is dead serious about the human condition, determined to ask existential questions about life and willing to linger in its mysteries. Yet this ambivalence doesn't show up in Lim's syntax, which is sure-footed, precise, and vibrant. She begins one poem, “Certainty,” by referencing the Puritan poet Edward Taylor. His verse, she notes, is “full of deep piety, / learned and quiet, but sometimes an errant wildness runs under / the seams of his words.” The same could be said of the poems in Wilderness—they read like a long, slow breath after the crush of a hard year.  — Maya Chung

The Bridge, by Hart Crane

How successful is Crane's modernist epic, a poem meant to stride as confidently across American geography and history as the mighty Brooklyn Bridge spans the East River? Nearly 100 years after its publication, the jury is still out. But even those who consider The Bridge a spectacular failure tend to be impressed by Crane's ambitions. As T. S. Eliot does in The Waste Land, Crane wants to connect rapid, destabilizing change with mythic currents of emotion. He clasps Walt Whitman's hand and briskly rouses Rip Van Winkle; all the while, he conjures trains and telegraph wires tearing across the country, buffeted by a hurricane of contemporary references. Making sense of all of this requires measured, deliberate reading, my ideal kind of project for the dead week between Christmas and New Year's. Helping with this task is a fantastic annotated edition edited by Lawrence Kramer (which is being reissued this spring). Crane was a motivated, but frustrated, visionary. This makes him fascinating—and makes The Bridge worth the trek from promenade to promenade.  — Emma Sarappo

The House on Marshland, by Louise Glück

Glück, a Nobel laureate, was a poet of few and careful words. Her work is often described as “spare” or “austere”; a solitary aspect to her poems makes them the perfect companion after an early sunset. Glück often directs her focus toward self-reflection, but her second collection, The House on Marshland, also scrutinizes a stark, chilly natural realm marked by “the barrenness / of harvest or pestilence.” The opening poem, “All Hallows,” is sublimely, high-mindedly eerie, and it is one of my favorites. In later poems, Glück includes plenty of flowering trees and signs of new life, but those are freighted with warning: As she writes of spring, “with the first leaves / all that is deadly enters the world.” Perhaps there's comfort to be found in the stillness and blankness of winter.  — Quinta Jurecic

The Complete Poems of John Keats, by John Keats

Some of Keats's best poems brim with references to the seasons and their attributes, whether a spring musk rose, “mid-May's eldest child,” or the “mists and mellow fruitfulness” of autumn. But picking up the 19th-century Romantic at the end of the year feels especially apt. That's because Keats, who died at just 25, was obsessed with the finality of things, with an unavoidable fear of life ceasing to be. Reading him this season can be a humbling reminder of our finitude. And yet, his descriptions of winter's “pale misfeature” or of “drear nighted December”—its ability to make him wonder, “were there ever any / Writh'd not of passed joy?”—are wildly alive; they suggest that there is much to be gained by reflecting on loss. With this poet, even musings on mortality point toward beauty, no matter the month.  — Luis Parrales

The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs.

Hot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a ""Great Freeze.""

As KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, ""Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled.""

It's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a ""jobless boom."" Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you.

Instead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and ""do more with less"" has been the mantra of the year.

""Firms are doing more with fewer workers,"" Swonk wrote. ""Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels more in line with demand. Others are offsetting the squeeze on profit margins due to tariffs with layoffs and hiring freezes.""

Economists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts.

Business Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt ""impossible,"" and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life.

In addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread.

This suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty. 

The tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow.

Dozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job.

In his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for ""ROI for AI.""

""I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects,"" he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year.

If that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market.

Although it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the ""Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.""

Still, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains.

Amplify ETFs is expanding its digital asset offerings with the launch of two new ETFs that aim to capture the infrastructure driving blockchain's next phase, without requiring investors to hold cryptocurrencies directly.

The Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (NYSE:STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (NYSE:TKNQ) started trading on Wednesday. These funds provide exposure to companies generating revenue from stablecoins, tokenized assets, and the systems that support them. Both funds follow diversified indexes that focus on blockchain-related business models rather than speculative tokens.

Amplify stated that the dual launch reflects increasing institutional interest in the foundational aspects of digital finance, as stablecoins and tokenization move from niche uses to mainstream acceptance.

The stablecoin-focused ETF targets companies earning significant revenue from payment technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms. Key holdings include Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Circle, along with crypto-linked ETFs from Grayscale, iShares, and Bitwise.

Amplify pointed to regulatory progress as a major advantage. In the U.S., the passing of the GENIUS Act and Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework has provided much-needed clarity around stablecoins. The firm noted that clearer rules are giving financial institutions the confidence to develop compliant stablecoin products and explore related revenue opportunities.

Stablecoins, once mainly viewed as tools for crypto trading, are increasingly being seen as payment and settlement systems for traditional finance.

The Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF concentrates on companies creating systems to digitize real-world assets and financial processes. Its holdings include BlackRock, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Nasdaq, and Figure Technology Solutions, which have all made strategic investments in tokenization in recent years.

Tokenization has gained momentum as regulators engage more with the concept, including discussions about tokenized stocks and other traditional assets. Financial institutions view this technology as a way to improve settlement efficiency, cut costs, and create new market structures.

Crypto and blockchain ETFs surged onto the market in 2025 after the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Paul Atkins, eased approval standards. This regulatory change opened the door to products that target specific segments of the crypto ecosystem instead of just offering broad, price-linked exposure.

Amplify's latest launch highlights a wider trend: investors are increasingly seeking options beyond volatile cryptocurrencies, focusing instead on the companies building compliant, revenue-generating infrastructure for blockchain-based finance.

For those cautious about crypto's ups and downs, Amplify's new ETFs provide a way to engage with the industry's growth without the intense volatility.

Trust Wallet users lost more than $7 million shortly after it released an updated version of its extension for the Chrome web browser. The stolen funds will be reimbursed, said Changpeng Zhao, a co-founder of crypto exchange Binance, which owns the utility.

The breach, flagged Dec. 25 by onchain detective ZachXBT, was confirmed by the wallet team. 

""Community alert: A number of Trust Wallet users have reported that funds were drained from wallet addresses within the past couple hours,"" ZachXBT posted on Telegram. ""While the exact root cause has not been determined coincidentally the Trust Wallet Chrome extension pushed a new update yesterday.""

Crypto wallets store the keys to users' cryptocurrency holdings, and malicious actors who gain access can authorize transfers of funds to destinations they control. Crypto theft rose to $6.75 billion this year, according to a Chainalysis report. The number of personal wallet compromises surged to 158,000 from 64,000 last year, though the amount stolen accounted for 20% of the total, down from 44%, it said.

The breach affects version 2.68 of Trust Wallet's browser extension, the wallet team posted on X, urging users not to open that version and to upgrade to version 2.69. ""Mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions are not impacted.""

Although smart glasses have been around for a while, the technology is getting more advanced each year, so much so that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims the wearables will replace smartphones in the next decade (though many people disagree, of course).

Smart glasses are no longer just a futuristic gadget — they've become practical tools that people use to communicate, navigate, track fitness, watch movies, enjoy immersive gaming, and more.

Whether you're looking to get a pair for yourself, buy one as a gift, or simply explore what's available on the market today, we've compiled a list of the most compelling options. This list features smart glasses with and without displays, designed for everyday wear, sports, work, and gaming.

We've also highlighted upcoming launches to watch as the smart glasses market heats up.

The nice thing about the Ray-Ban Meta glasses is that they look like regular glasses, which is great for people who don't want to compromise on aesthetics. The smart glasses come in many styles, so you can pick a pair based on your personal style.

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses have a 12-megapixel camera, open-ear speakers, and five microphones. They offer twice the battery life of their predecessor, lasting up to eight hours with typical use. They can charge to 50% in just 20 minutes, and you can purchase a case that provides an additional 48 hours of battery life.

The glasses feature 3K Ultra HD video capture, which is two times more pixels than the previous generation. They come with 32GB of storage and an IPX4 water resistance rating, which means they're protected in light rain.

They also have a slew of AI features, including the ability to say “Hey Meta” to do things like get information and set reminders, along with real-time translation, hands-free photo and video capture, the option to ask about what you're seeing, and more.

The glasses cost $379.

The Viture Luma Pro glasses offer one of the best displays on smart glasses available right now. They feature Sony's micro-OLED panels to deliver a crisp 1200p image on a 152-inch virtual screen, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a wide 52-degree field of view, and up to 1,000 nits of perceived brightness. (Nits measure screen brightness — higher numbers mean you can see the display more clearly in bright environments.)

You can plug the Luma Pro XR glasses into many phones, tablets, handhelds, and laptops with USB-C to mirror their display. This makes them a great option for people who want to game on a large, immersive screen, whether they're on the go or the TV is in use. They're also useful for frequent travelers and people who want a virtual multi-screen setup for work. 

They come with built-in support for mild myopia, allowing users with up to -4.0 diopters of nearsightedness to experience a clear virtual display without needing prescription lenses. 

In terms of aesthetics, they're a bit chunky, but not overly bulky. 

They retail for $499 (currently on sale for $449).

The Xreal One Pro smart glasses are one of the most premium models available on the market right now, with a $649 price tag. They're a good choice for people who are already familiar with smart glasses and want an upgrade.

The glasses' flat-prism design allows for a sleek and comfortable fit. They feature a virtual display of up to 171 inches, with 1080p resolution, a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and a 57-degree field of view.

The Xreal One Pro smart glasses come with built-in Bose speakers and 700 nits of brightness, allowing for use in brighter environments.

They are built on Xreal's custom X1 chip, which enables 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom). This means the glasses track your head's rotational movements, keeping virtual content pinned in space relative to your head. In short, if you turn your head, the virtual screen stays in place rather than moving with you.

They feature a built-in button array that lets you quickly change your screen size, distance, color temperature and more.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses are the best option for outdoorsy people and athletes, as they were specifically designed with them in mind. The glasses can capture video in up to 3K resolution and feature a 12-megapixel camera with a 122-degree wide-angle lens.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses feature a programmable button that can trigger a custom AI prompt, which you can set up using the Meta AI app. All the buttons on the glasses are located underneath to allow athletes to wear helmets comfortably while using them.

They offer up to nine hours of battery life, or up to six hours of continuous music playback. 

The glasses come with a charging case that can provide an additional 36 hours of charge on the go. Plus, you can charge the glasses to 50% in 20 minutes via the charging case.

They also feature a five-microphone array optimized to reduce wind noise while on calls, messaging, or using Meta AI with your voice. The glasses have an IP67 dust and water-resistance rating for use during intense workouts (this rating means they can withstand being submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes).

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses cost $499.

The RayNeo Air 3s are a great budget-friendly choice for anyone just getting started with smart glasses. They offer impressive visuals and features for the price and are great for light gaming or watching content on long journeys. 

They feature micro‑OLED displays that create a virtual 201‑inch screen at 1080p resolution, with a 120 Hz refresh rate, a 46-degree field of view, and about 650 nits of perceived brightness. 

While the field of view is narrower than some premium models and they don't have head tracking, they're a good option for people who simply want an external display on the go without breaking the bank. 

The glasses use a micro‑OLED “HueView” display with eye protection features like 3840 Hz hybrid dimming and low blue‑light certification to reduce eye strain during extended use. 

The RayNeo Air 3s cost $269 (currently on sale for $219). 

Project Aura: Google and Xreal are collaborating on a pair of Android XR-powered glasses that are equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. The glasses can function as an extended workspace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google's suite of products or stream video as they would on a more advanced headset. The glasses are launching next year. 

Snap Specs: Snap is set to release a lightweight consumer version of its AR glasses in 2026, bringing many of the same augmented reality and AI features found in the developer-focused Spectacles 5. The new glasses are expected to be smaller and lighter, making them more discreet and comfortable to wear in public compared to their bulky predecessors. 

Apple AI smart glasses: Apple is reportedly sidelining plans to overhaul its Vision Pro headset to focus on developing AI smart glasses that can compete with products from Meta, featuring many of the same features available on the social media giant's current smart glasses. The glasses are expected to debut in 2026.

It's beginning to look like a lot like a flu Christmas. Surges of influenza are hitting parts of the U.S. hard, and the worst is yet to come.

Various regions of the country have reported a dramatic climb in cases lately, including New York City. Overall activity is on the rise nationwide, as are flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. This season is being fueled by an unexpected strain of “super flu.”

A typical flu season is nothing to brush off. Annually, influenza sickens millions of Americans, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands, and kills tens of thousands. But this winter has brought along an especially nasty variant of the H3N2 flu known as subclade K.

The variant is noticeably different on a genetic level from the flu strains scientists predicted would be circulating this season, meaning our vaccines aren't as effective against it as usual. Subclade K emerged towards the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and since then, it's quickly supplanted other strains of H3N2 and other flu viruses in general worldwide.

K already caused the flu season to arrive weeks ahead of schedule in European and Asian countries. In the UK, it's helped cause a spike of hospitalizations and an “unprecedented wave of super flu.” And now it's clearly making its mark in the U.S.

Several school districts have had to temporarily shut down due to flu outbreaks, while some hospitals are reporting an alarming rise of cases. Data collected from the NYC Health Department shows that nearly 10,000 emergency room visits of flu-like illness were reported last week—the largest weekly peak seen in at least a decade.

According to the CDC's latest flu surveillance data (covering up to Dec. 13), the majority of new infections are being caused by H3N2. Flu activity is “very high” or “high” in 17 regions of the U.S., including NYC, and “moderate” in another 8 jurisdictions. Two more pediatric deaths were reported that week, rising the total to 3 deaths so far this season. And we almost certainly haven't reached the peak yet.

There are some silver linings to this bad flu season.

For starters, subclade K doesn't seem to have any mutations that make it more likely to cause severe illness compared to other H3N2 strains. And though the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to the variant, it's not worthless. UK data has found that the vaccine is still providing significant protection from serious complications, especially in children.

This means that vaccination remains a crucial tool against flu this winter. So it's still worthwhile to get your flu shot even now, though you should keep in mind that it takes around two weeks for the vaccine's protection to kick in.

You should also practice good hygiene like regularly washing your hands, trying to stay home if you're sick, and potentially wearing a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection. Well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 are the most effective.

PC builders are buying older chips which are still relatively good to save money.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The AMD Ryzen 5 5800X — launched on November 5, 2020 — recently hit the top spot in Amazon UK's list of best-selling CPUs. The refreshed 5800XT, which arrived in July last year, is likewise in the top ten most popular processors in Amazon US, with the chip sitting in fourth place.

This is unusual, given that these use the five-year-old Zen 3 architecture and the nearly decade-old AM4 platform. The age of these chips means that they're often picked by PC builders sticking to a budget and are commonly eschewed by mainstream and high-end enthusiasts for more modern Zen 4 and Zen 5 options.

However, the ongoing memory crisis has enthusiasts flocking to older DDR4 modules as prices have surged to record highs. It has gotten to the point that 64GB DDR5 memory kits now cost more than an entire PlayStation 5 console, even with discounts. Analysts and industry experts are saying that there is no relief in sight in 2026, with prices expected to climb through the first quarter of next year.

That's why demand for decent gaming processors that use older DDR4 RAM has skyrocketed, with AMD's first X3D chip, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, now costing more than new 9800X3D processors in the secondhand market.

Unfortunately, the 5800X3D is no longer in production, so gamers who want a new processor without paying for the DDR5 premium must settle for the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or 5800XT. In our review of the 5800X, the chip delivered excellent gaming performance while balancing single-threaded and multi-threaded capabilities. However, it had a high launch price of $450 while offering almost the same numbers as the more affordable Ryzen 5 5600X.

Thankfully, the price of the 5800X has fallen since then, with the Amazon UK listing it for £184.19 or around US$250. On the other hand, the newer AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT is much more affordable in the U.S., as you can get it for just US $199 as per this Amazon US listing. By comparison, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is also listed for $198.49 in Amazon US at the time of writing. While the 9600X will certainly beat the 5800X and XT in almost all metrics, the fact that the former uses more expensive DDR5 RAM is likely the main reason why many budget and mainstream PC builders are opting for the older processor that uses more affordable memory kits.

Advanced therapies improved bowel urgency in 50.9% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a reduction in the severity of urgency. These improvements correlated with clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound remission.

""[Our] data support the integration of routine BU [bowel urgency] monitoring alongside ultrasound and fecal biomarkers in clinical practice, with the goal of achieving a more personalized, timely, and effective disease management strategy,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Ferdinando D'Amico, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and Vita–Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy. It was published online on December 17, 2025, in United European Gastroenterology Journal.

The study was retrospective in nature, and potential selection bias may have occurred. The uneven distribution of patients across treatment groups limited direct comparisons between drugs. No long‑term follow‑up data were available; bowel urgency was assessed using patient‑reported measures rather than objective tools.

This study did not receive any specific funding. Several authors reported receiving consulting fees or honoraria for lectures and serving as speakers, consultants, or advisory board members for various companies including AbbVie, Pfizer, and Roche.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Technical disruptions in video calls can negatively affect rapport with the person on the other end. Since the COVID pandemic, videoconferencing has spread across many parts of life. More physicians now use it for video visits with patients and for discussions with colleagues. Technical issues such as picture or audio interruptions are almost unavoidable.

A study in Nature now shows that people affected by technical disruptions in a videoconference may be perceived unfavorably by the person they're speaking with. One reason, according to Melanie Brucks of Columbia University in New York City and colleagues, could be interruptions in video or audio transmission — so-called glitches — that induce discomfort in the other person.

Brucks and colleagues examined the effects of glitches in several experiments and data analyses. When glitches occurred in first-time meetings, participants said they liked the other person less and felt less understood. In short online presentations on health topics, technical disruptions also reduced trust in the presenter.

People who later watched these presentations said they would be less likely to work with the presenter. In another investigation, video problems elicited a feeling of discomfort. The effect could be mitigated, however, when participants did not look directly at each other during a videoconference.

Audio disruptions, by contrast, had a stronger negative impact on hiring interest in job interviews than video glitches.

This held true even though no information was lost due to the disruption. Brucks and colleagues also analyzed transcripts of US court probation hearings conducted by videoconference. They found that people who experienced glitches were granted probation less often.

“The findings are plausible and clearly align with existing research on digital communication,” said Johannes Basch, business psychologist at Neu-Ulm University of Applied Sciences, Neu-Ulm, Germany, in comments to the Science Media Center Germany. Lisa Handke, business psychologist at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg in Erlangen, Germany, also called the study “meaningful.” The concept of “uncanniness” has been known in research for some time and has its origins in robotics.

Here, “uncanny” can be understood as “eerie.”

Basch said studies on digital job interviews have for years shown that limits to social presence can lead to different evaluations of candidates. The studies also show these limits affect both candidate performance and interviewer ratings.

Other factors may also play a role: Glitches in videoconferences can increase the working memory's cognitive load. “This is because content is harder to process and requires additional attention to technical aspects. This, in turn, could lead to less considered decisions,” Basch said.

The new results, in Basch's view, underscore the need to standardize the medium used for interviews within an applicant pool so individuals are not disadvantaged.

“Conducting interviews with individuals via video conference, supposedly as a courtesy because they would have too long a journey for a face-to-face interview, is therefore not advisable.”

 December 26, 2025  

Specific components of air pollution were linked to increased depression risk in older adults,new research suggested. 

A cohort study of nearly 24 million adults showed that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) overall and to four of its six major components individually was associated with increased likelihood of late-life depression development. Sulfate, elemental carbon, and soil dust were the main contributors to the association, with a fourth component, ammonium, also showing relevance. 

The likelihood for depression was increased with exposure to more than one of these components and for individuals with neurologic or cardiometabolic comorbidities. 

“These findings suggest that regulation of specific PM2.5 components may help reduce depression risk, particularly among vulnerable older populations,” Yanling Deng, PhD, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, and colleagues wrote. 

The results were published online on December 22 in JAMA Network Open. 

Although previous research has shown a link between fine particulate matter and depression, the current study sought to assess which components may be causing this association. 

The nationwide, population-based cohort analysis included data for nearly 24 million older Medicare beneficiaries (mean age at baseline, 76 years; 55% women; 89% White, 7% Black) from 2000-2018.

A spatiotemporal model was used to assess annual concentrations over a 5-year window of PM2.5 mass as well as its six major components: elemental carbon, ammonium, nitrate, sulfate, soil dust (largely silicon), and organic carbon.

The 5-year mean level of PM2.5 was 10.2 µg/m3. The component with the highest annual level was sulfate, followed by organic carbon.

Late-life depression was identified by Medicare claims. More than 5.5 million participants developed depression during follow-up, 97% of whom had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension the most common.

Results from single-pollutant models showed that exposure to 5-year average concentrations of PM2.5 was associated with increased odds of depression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02), as were concentrations of sulfate (HR, 1.05), elemental carbon and soil dust (HR, 1.03 for both), and ammonium (HR, 1.01).

A combination of all six of the major components had an even greater association, with each one-quartile increase linked to increased risk for depression (HR, 1.07), with soil dust, sulfate, and elemental carbon the primary contributors.

“Although the individual-level effect sizes were modest, such small relative increases in risk may have meaningful population-level implications given the widespread exposure to air pollution and the high burden of depression among older adults,” the investigators wrote.

The associations between depression and the pollutant components (especially soil dust, sulfate, and elemental carbon) were even greater in participants with cardiometabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension and congestive heart failure, and those with neurologic comorbidities, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.

There was no association between total PM2.5 and increased depression risk in participants without comorbidities.

“Our findings underscore the necessity for stricter regulation of ambient PM2.5 emissions, particularly from fossil fuel combustion and traffic sources,” the researchers wrote.

The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring his penalty Franck Fife

A controversial penalty from Mohamed Salah secured top spot for Egypt in Group B of the Africa Cup of Nations against South Africa.

Salah's nerveless 45th-minute effort from the spot came after South Africa's Khuliso Mudau was punished for raising an arm to the Liverpool forward's face — following a lengthy VAR review.

Egypt had to contend with going a man down at the end of that chaotic first half when right-back Mohamed Hany was shown a second yellow card for stamping on Teboho Mokoena in stoppage time before the break.

Hossam Hassan's team survived a late VAR check after Yasser Ibrahim blocked a Mokoena shot with his hand after the 90th minute. Replays did not appear to show a conclusive angle of whether that occurred inside or outside the penalty box, although the rules of the game state that a handball offence cannot be given if the ball hits a player's supporting arm.

It meant Egypt continued their successful start to this tournament in Morocco — and kept Salah's hopes of a first AFCON triumph very much alive.

Nick Miller and Ahmed Walid analyse the key talking points from an intriguing match in Agadir that went past 101 minutes.

Until the 39th minute, you could file this game under ‘not a classic'. Then, all hell broke loose.

First, the penalty. There seemed to be only two people watching who thought Mudau had actually committed an offence worthy of being penalised when his flailing hand touched Salah's forehead. Unfortunately for South Africa, those two were the VAR and the on-pitch referee Pacifique Ndabihawenimana.

It was precisely 38 minutes and 38 seconds when Madau's hand made contact with Salah. The Egypt captain went down, as if Madau had “poked his eye out”, according to former South Africa forward Benni McCarthy in the Channel 4 studio. But aside from slightly hamming things up by occasionally checking said eye, Salah did not appeal for the penalty with any gusto.

There followed some lengthy arguments on the field, and it was not until the clock ticked into the 42nd minute that Ndabihawenimana was sent over to the VAR monitor. There he stood for 14 seconds while the screen was frozen, standing there like a man with questionable WiFi waiting for Netflix to load: not a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things, but long enough to add to the general sense of farce.

The consensus seemed to be confusion as to why the incident was being scrutinised, never mind actually awarding the penalty. Former Arsenal and Cameroon defender Lauren, also in the Channel 4 studio, pointed out that Madau did not once look around and that he was simply using his arm to aid his running motion.

“If you see a defender look first, then hit the opponent, then you would say it's a penalty,” said Lauren. “In this case, he was looking at the ball.”

But after nearly a minute of deliberation, Ndabihawenimana pointed to the spot. There followed more arguments, jostling and prevarication, before Salah eventually stroked home the penalty insouciantly. From the moment Madau's hand struck Salah to the moment the ball went into the net, six minutes and 14 seconds had elapsed. From the time taken to the decision itself, it was a farce.

Still, advantage Egypt. And yet, a couple of minutes later, with the safety of half-time looming, an act of self-sabotage threw that away, when Hany — already on a yellow card — launched his studs into Mokoena's foot. He was given a second booking and was sent off.

It was a brainless act, but along with the equally illogical penalty award, it spiced up a hitherto pedestrian game.

Nick Miller

Despite scoring the winner in Egypt's first game against Zimbabwe, Salah's performance in that match was mixed — excelling in the first 45 minutes, before his level dropped in the second half.

Against South Africa, Egypt's switch to a back three meant Salah had fewer runners to find in the final third. But it was the Liverpool forward who won his country the penalty through which they secured the three points, chipping it elegantly down the middle as South Africa's Ronwen Williams dived to his left.

Hany's dismissal forced Egypt to drop deeper in the second half, only threatening on the transitions, with Salah central to the few counter-attacks they had.

It is hard to judge Salah's performance in this game, considering Egypt's lack of attacking solutions in the first half and Hany's red card, but his presence as an outlet in the second half gave his team-mates a breather and limited the time spent under pressure. He was eventually withdrawn for Osama Faisal in the 89th minute.

Ultimately, it is Salah's goals that have put Egypt into the knockouts. Since making his tournament debut at AFCON 2017, no player has scored more than Salah's nine goals — and he is now four efforts off his coach Hassan's 69-goal scoring record for Egypt.

It is hard to argue with those kinds of numbers, even if we have still not seen the best of him at this edition.

Ahmed Walid

It is not just that South Africa had 45 minutes against 10 men to make an impact and find an equaliser that was so discouraging for them. Arguably, it was that they also had the 15 minutes before that to plan how they were going to approach so much of the game with a man advantage.

That should have been ample time to come up with something, but in the early stages of the second half, it was Egypt who looked more likely to extend their lead, rather than lose it. It took until the 70th minute for South Africa coach Hugo Broos to change their shape, bringing on winger Relebohile Mofokeng, and another five before introducing another forward.

Egypt defended brilliantly, and they were perhaps unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty for handball: the referee had given a free kick on the edge of the penalty area when the ball struck Yasser Ibrahim's arm as he dived to block a shot. However, replays seemed to suggest that the defender was inside the penalty area, and Ndabihawenimana was sent to the VAR monitor to review the decision.





From that point, it felt like a penalty would be given, even though there was no conclusive angle, but not only did he choose not to point to the spot, he reversed the decision entirely. Which suggests that he ultimately decided it was not a handball and that Ibrahim had touched the ball with his hand in a natural action, rather than deliberately. Broos was livid, but it was not the referee's fault his team could not find an equaliser.

Nick Miller

Angola's 1-1 draw with Zimbabwe earlier in the day meant that the winner from this game would top the group due to the sides' head-to-head record.

Despite that, these teams played out a cautious first half, with Hassan's switch to a 5-3-2 limiting any adventure from either Egypt or South Africa. Only Salah's penalty separated the sides by the end, and Egypt put their bodies on the line to maintain their 1-0 lead.

Egypt's victory guarantees them top spot in the group. Meanwhile, South Africa need a win or a draw to secure second place after beating Angola 2-1 in the first round.

As for Angola and Zimbabwe, they took a big hit by drawing with each other. Since the competition's format changed in 2019 so that the best third-placed teams in the group can qualify, nobody has progressed to the knockout stages with two points. That means they both need to win their final group game on Monday, with Angola facing Egypt and Zimbabwe playing South Africa.

Usually, home advantage gives the nations hosting a World Cup a big boost on the pitch, but that's not always the case.

While those playing host have ended the tournament as World Champions on six occasions, others haven't done nearly as well on home turf.

Here are the five worst performing host nations in World Cup history. 

Relative to expectations, Japan didn't do too badly in 2002, and they only make our top five because host nations usually perform so well.Having played three World Cup matches and lost all three prior to the edition they co-hosted with South Korea, few expected them to earn a point—let alone reach the last 16. Yet they did just that, thanks to a draw with Belgium and wins over Russia and Tunisia.That gave fans hope they could beat Turkey, but it wasn't to be—a 1-0 loss ended their run.

South Africa became the first ever host nation to exit at the group stage in 2010 and, frankly, weren't very good—but they still exceeded expectations.Bafana Bafana drew with Mexico and beat France, although that victory is slightly less impressive given that the French staff and players were literally at each other's throats at the time.Siphiwe Tshabalala scoring the tournament's opening goal, however, was undoubtedly the high point—immediately cementing itself as one of the all-time great World Cup moments.

FIFA hoped that hosting the World Cup in the United States would finally break America—making “actual” football popular across the pond—but the quality of the USMNT at the time made that a difficult task.They scraped through the group stage as one of the best third-placed sides, thanks to a win over a Colombia team many claimed was bribed—which says it all.Brazil then arrived and made light work of the U.S., bringing their disappointing tournament to an end. Oh, and Diana Ross missed a penalty in the opening ceremony.

Heading into the 1982 World Cup, Spain hadn't made it past the first round since 1950, and hosting didn't exactly improve their fortunes.They stumbled through the opening stage, losing to Northern Ireland, drawing with Honduras and narrowly beating Yugoslavia, before crashing out in the second group stage after a loss to West Germany and a somewhat fortunate 0-0 draw with England.

Most expected Qatar to be the worst World Cup host nation ever—and they didn't disappoint.Dreadful in their opening group match against Ecuador, with a 2-0 defeat that flattered them, they were then beaten 3-1 by Senegal and 2-0 by the Netherlands—crashing out with no points, seven goals conceded and just one scored.They became the only host nation ever to record “nul points,” as the French say. Shambolic.

If the tight end retires after this season, the game will also mark his last time playing at Arrowhead.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	This year, Taylor Swift spent her Christmas at Arrowhead Stadium, where fiancé Travis Kelce played his final Kansas City Chiefs home game of the NFL season.


	Showing up in her signature red lip and a matching bomber jacket alongside her parents, the pop star was all smiles as she entered the venue, as captured in clips posted online by the NFL. She hunkered down in her usual suite at Arrowhead Stadium to watch the tight end and his team play against the Denver Broncos, who ended up winning 20-13.

	











	Kelce was visibly emotional during the national anthem, rocking back and forth with his hand over his chest. He was also clearly fired up as he first entered the field, striking his signature archer pose at the center of flashing lights, smoke and thunderous applause.


	The Christmas Day matchup marked the Chiefs' penultimate game of the 2025-26 season, with the team this year missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 after quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered an ACL injury earlier in December. Their last game will be against the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium in Sin City on a soon-to-be-scheduled date.


	But the Chiefs' final home game might have had even more significance for Kelce. Throughout this year, the Grotesquerie star has faced much speculation about whether he will retire after this season, something he has not yet confirmed or denied.

	











	He did, however, address the possibility after the Broncos face-off, according to ESPN. “I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,” he reportedly said, adding that he was feeling “a whole lot of emotions.”

TV Reporter


SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from Stranger Things 5 Vol. 2.


	The penultimate episode of Stranger Things 5 offers fans a moment that they've been hoping for all season: a reunion between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink).


	At the very end of Episode 6, “Escape from Camazotz,” Max finally manages to make it out of Henry's mindscape and wakes up from the coma she's been in for nearly two years in the basement of the hospital, where Lucas had brought her to save her from the Demo dogs that Vecna had sent to kill her. The two share an emotional and vulnerable moment together as Max finds her way back to reality.

	“That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn't around her for so long,” McLaughlin told Deadline. Besides a few scenes of Lucas at Max's bedside, this was the first moment they'd shared on-screen all season.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The scene is one of several tear-jerkers in the second volume of episodes, released on Christmas Day. In addition to a whirlwind of emotional sequences, the back half of the season is finally beginning to provide some answers about the Upside Down and the evils that Hawkins has been facing this whole time.


	In the interview below, McLaughlin discusses working on these three episodes, including filming that scene with Sink and another equally moving one with Noah Schnapp, and what's to come as the beloved series comes to an end. 


DEADLINE: I hear you're about to go watch the finale with your castmates. How are you feeling about that?


CALEB MCLAUGHLIN: I have a lot of anxiety and mixed emotions going into it. I think I've been, not uneasy, but I'm happy…but then now it's the last content I will see of the show. So it's a weird feeling. Not gonna lie, honestly, I'm like, I want to see it, but I wish it was two weeks ago to where I had more time for the anticipation of it all. But now it's almost two hours into that moment, and it's crazy.

	











DEADLINE: Do you think you've made peace with the show ending?


MCLAUGHLIN: I think I've definitely made peace with the show ending. I believe all great things come to an end, and to cherish the moment is for it to end. I think the story has done so well throughout the years, and it's gonna go down in history as a classic, a show that people loved. I'm just happy. I'm happy to be a part of the legacy. So I'm happy to put this in a nice safe as one of the great things that I've done and move on to the next.


DEADLINE: There is much to discuss from these episodes, but first I wanted to ask you about working with Sadie again on that emotional scene at the beginning of Episode 7 when Max and Lucas are finally reunited. 


MCLAUGHLIN: I mean, even her being in the coma in Episode 2, I guess she was still there, but last year, we rarely saw her. That moment, it almost felt real, because I wasn't around her for so long. You miss your friend when you're on set. You miss the camaraderie you both have. So I think with that, seeing that emotion that I had [access], to the state of mind that I had to be in, was a different emotion from Season 4, when he was losing her. In this moment, it was more of an emotion of relief and joy…it wasn't sadness, it was happiness. But then also, at the same time, that feeling of loss, because now everything that he was feeling, he can now have this release. 


DEADLINE: Yeah, almost like he could finally let some of his emotions go after feeling like he had to be strong for her and for his friends for so long.


MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, he was able to be there for her when that happened. Like, ‘I never gave up. I never doubted a moment.' And also, like, even I felt that he was still trying to hold it in [when she woke up], because he didn't want to be the one crying. He had to be strong for her.


DEADLINE: After Max wakes up and they rescue the rest of the crew from the Upside Down, the back half of Episode 7 features some of the first scenes with the entire cast together like this in quite some time. How did those moments feel to film?


MCLAUGHLIN: Oh, man, it was hectic. I think every season, we always have that — the beginning, everyone's around each other, and then we separate to go on our own journeys, and then we come back at the end. Last season, I was kind of not looking forward to those moments, because usually when we go to those moments, we know the show is ending. When you see everyone's face and you're having a good time, you start realizing time is going by. You see that the time that you had is no longer going to be there. So it was one of those. It was a lot of fun, because I had a lot of fun last season. It was my favorite time filming, because I got closer to everyone… just because of how big the show's gotten, just these moments towards the end, is so much bigger than any moment we've ever had on the show. So I think that was spectacular.


DEADLINE: Can you tell me a little about filming Noah's coming out scene? It's a really emotional scene and one that fans have been anticipating for some time. You all give very emotional and generous performances in that moment.


MCLAUGHLIN: Being on the show for so long, and knowing everyone's had other ups and downs and, just me being a friend, just wanting to be there and knowing I'll always be there for a friend, I think that scene was a moment that felt genuine. We would be there for Noah. We would be there for anyone in their hard times and their biggest secret moments where they want to be vulnerable. I think it's important for stories like that to be told, to have those vulnerable moments. I mean, of course, we were acting, but it was important — even when we weren't shown, we were there off screen, we [were] there behind the camera…So I think that scene was very special. Noah killed it. His performance was amazing. We had to do it a couple of times, and then we did it on another day as well, and he was able to bring it each time. Being able to be there as his friend, on and off screen, supporting him, especially not even just what the scene is, but just a big moment for an actor to tap into that emotion, I think being there for another actor, being there for a friend is always something that — I would want someone to be there for me. So I was just happy to be there in that moment and see him flourish.

	











DEADLINE: What was your reaction to learning some of the details about the Upside Down and the mythology you all have been building for five seasons?


MCLAUGHLIN: I think it was a whirlwind. It was a lot of shocking moments. I remember reading it and listening to the Duffers read the script. I was like, ‘Oh, this is good. Oh, yeah. This is how you bring this to a close.' Sometimes TV shows or movies will create something, they'll create this world that's already good, and then make it more [complicated], and then it becomes less meaningful. I think these moments made it more meaningful, and it made it more grounded. 


DEADLINE: How was it to watch it and see what it really looked like? Because there's a lot going on that Lucas doesn't witness, or that none of the characters do, like the wormhole.


MCLAUGHLIN: I didn't realize that was a thing until I watched it. There's so much detail in this next volume, and there's a lot of things you can miss even while reading, because they don't explain how it is. It'll be like a simple sentence, like, ‘we zoom out and there's this wormhole,' right? But then when you see it, you understand what they're explaining. It's a different perspective. I think that's what was sick.


DEADLINE: What can you tease about the finale?


MCLAUGHLIN: It'll be our biggest yet. There will be a lot of range of emotions, but you'll be satisfied with the story.


DEADLINE: What are you looking forward to post-Stranger Things?


MCLAUGHLIN: I'm excited for the new journey. I think being in the industry, being on the show for so long, there's things that you're like, ‘oh, I need to do this. I need to do that.' It's been full circle to where I realized I'm already doing it, and I just need to keep doing it and following my heart and knowing who I am, and I'm excited, because I feel like this is only the beginning in life, in my career…future projects next. Literally right after this press tour, I'm going into another press run for this movie I'm doing called Goat, an animated movie called Goat. So that's the first movie I'm doing at the top of the year, so that's a new beginning, and it's also a wonderful story about a little goat wanting to be the, no pun intended, greatest of all time. Actually, the pun was intended. But yeah, so I'm excited for the future.

Bono revisited a classic holiday song he knows intimately, “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” with Imelda May during Dublin's annual Christmas Eve charity event, the Busk.


	Imelda May sang the first verse with some extra Christmas spirit, delivering the “Christmas” refrain at the end before harmonizing again with Bono for the final notes. About midway through the song, “Mr. Bono,” as he was introduced, added some words of his own to the song, acknowledging the unity of the event and asking everyone there to lift their hands up in jubilation.


	Darlene Love first recorded “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” in 1963, while U2 covered the track for the 1987 benefit compilation A Very Special Christmas. While performing on the Busk, Bono summoned the same panache he did in '87, when he was singing to help raise money for the Special Olympics. Maybe it was the Irish flute that fueled him this time.


	Along with Bono and May, the Busk this year featured event organizer, Glen Hansard, as well as the Script's Danny O'Donoghue, the Riptide Movement, the Coronas' Danny O'Reilly, and Shosby, according to NME. The evening ended with an all-star jam on the Pogues' “Fairytale of New York,” which found May wishing a happy birthday to the song's late songwriter, Shane MacGowan, who was born on Christmas Day.

	The event, which Bono has previously supported, has been a Dublin tradition for 15 years. This year, it raised money for the Dublin Simon Community, a charity that seeks to help Ireland's homeless population.

	











	Darlene Love recorded “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” on a hot August day in 1963 for Phil Spector's A Christmas Gift for You compilation, which came out in 1963. It became an enduring hit after she sang it on David Letterman's late-night shows for decades. U2 revisited their cover of the song for the first time in nearly four decades in 2023 during their residency at Las Vegas' Sphere venue.

	The movies tend to do better in depicting agony over ecstasy, but The Testament of Ann Lee drops a potent depiction of the latter early on. We are in Manchester, in the early 1760s. Young Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried) works as a cleaner in a hospital, and lives with her brother William (Lewis Pullman), and her late sister's daughter. She is a pious woman, having felt the presence of God in her life from an early age. And having been forced, due to close living quarters, to bear witness to her parents rutting like farm animals in heat, she's also developed conflicted ideas about the pleasures of the flesh. Ann and her kin are drawn to a religious community that has separated themselves from both the Church of England and the burgeoning countermovement known as the Methodists. These “shaking quakers” are a sect to themselves. 


	They commune via prayer and unburden by the confessing of sins. Yet their worship does not stop there. The Shakers, as they'll eventually be named, channel the holy spirit via song and dance. Ann Lee embraces this practice with the fervor of a true believer. So naturally, in recounting this woman's story — a tale in which we follow Lee as she spreads the good word, gathers converts, and leads her followers to a feral, often unfriendly place soon to be dubbed “America” — filmmaker Mona Fastvold drops us right into the middle of the Shaker equivalent of mass. The congregation writhes, sometimes in unison, and whirls and stomps; at one point, a line of folks snake through a doorway and into the foreground, as the camera rotates in the opposite direction. They beat their hands against their chests and raise their arms heavenward, twitching like marionettes on strings. Their hymn keeps time via a full-body rhythm. A close-up of Ann's face as her head whips back testifies to the sheer joy she feels in testifying to the Lord. Fastvold is crafting a biopic, but she's borrowing the trappings of a genre far better equipped to portray spiritual transcendence: the movie musical.

	For those of us who've had something close to a religious experience while watching, say, Singin' in the Rain or Gold Diggers of 1933, the choice to use musical numbers to portray a person in thrall to complete abandon is a no-brainer. And while it'd be foolhardy to expect that this will inspire a resurgence of interest in Shaker songs and dances à la O Brother Where Art Thou‘s mainstream revival of bluegrass music a quarter of a century ago, both choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall and composer Daniel Blumberg definitely make you see the transportive power of these ancient customs. Not all of the film's numbers deliver the primal joy of bodies moving chaotically through the frame, yet the few full-blown examples of 18th century everyday people losing themselves to the holy-roller beat carries this film even more than the meticulous historical recreations. It's a period film with 6/8 pulse.

	After Ann finds what she's looking for amongst the Shakers, she begin to see visions: angels, serpents, a land across the Atlantic that will allow their cause take root. She also ceases the practice of fornicating with her blacksmith husband Abraham (Christopher Abbott), much to his dismay. Their union led to the conception of four children, all of whom died shortly after birth. Ann believes her sins led to their untimely demise. She wants to honor her marital duties, but there is a higher calling to answer to. The Shakers must save all of their love for God. Not even arrests, violence or the nagging sensation known as lust can sway them.


	Once Ann, her brother and niece, and a small congregation that includes our humble narrator, Sister Mary Partington (Last Night in Soho‘s Thomasin Mackenzie), land in the New World right before it becomes a sovereign nation, The Testament of Ann Lee becomes a true American story. Which means that it becomes, among other things, a parable of persecution, as the freedoms promised by these former colonies butt up against the prejudices and populist notions of might over right. Will's missionary work turns the Shakers into a movement and the source of some truly excellent furniture. Ann's declaration that no Shaker shall “take up a sword against the Devil,” by which she means British troops trying to squash a revolution, gets them brand as treasonous. Cue the agony. It will end badly for the group, even if the movie itself ends with a Busby Berkeley overhead shot that feels positively beatific.

	Fastvold previously cowrote The Brutalist with her professional/personal partner, director Brady Corbet (he helped pen this script, while she took over directorial duties), and like that woozy epic conjuring up the spirit of the New Hollywood saints, the attention to detail here — combined with a high degree of difficulty in blending the biographical and the tunefully divine — is a tribute to its creators. The similarities to Fastvold and Corbet's Oscar-winning chronicle of an immigrant's rise and fall, however, don't stop there. The Testament of Ann Lee is really about having an extraordinary sense of commitment to chasing your vision, be it for spiritual awakening or artistic endeavors that fly in the face of the Entertainment Inc. market, to illogical and extreme ends. That goes double for its star, who throws herself into the role with a unihibitedness and a dedication that Lee would find admirable. 

	











	To watch Amanda Seyfried sing so devotionally for a world beyond this one is to see a portrait of someone desperately searching for a semblance of heaven on earth. (This is not to be confused with what she's doing in her other movie out right now, The Housemaid, which focuses on women stuck in a perpetual life of hell. ‘Tis the Seyfried season!) It's easy to just bask in the magic-hour imagery, the artisanal spectacle of dancers throwing themselves about, and the overall effort it took to recreate a 18th century America experiencing early growing pains. All of that alone is an accomplishment. Seyfried reminds you this is human story of hunger and thirst — literally, in the case of Blumberg's number “Hunger and Thirst.” The movie isn't just a paean to a pioneer spirit. It's equally a testament to the actor playing her.

Swedish legend Björn Borg has recently opened a new chapter in his life off the court in his memoir Heartbeats. While Borg's 11 Grand Slam titles and famed rivalry with John McEnroe are well-documented, the book offers some surprising revelations about the methods he employed to gain an edge.

Among the most striking is his admission that, following a heartbreaking U.S. Open loss in 1979, he consulted a psychic medium. “She told me the stars were never aligned for me at the U.S. Open, and that I'd never win there, and I never did,” Borg writes. In an extract quoted by the NY Times, he continues, “It was eerie how accurate she was. But I was hooked, and I kept working with her for the next three years.” It's a glimpse into the unconventional lengths one of the sport's most disciplined athletes would explore to enhance his performance.

While Borg's choice to consult a medium may seem extraordinary, he is by no means alone in seeking guidance beyond conventional training. Football legends such as Glenn Hoddle, who worked with a faith healer during his time as England manager, Paolo Maldini, who reportedly turned to a spiritual advisor while at AC Milan, and Diego Maradona, known for consulting shamans and spiritualists throughout his career, demonstrate that elite athletes in various sports have occasionally embraced unconventional methods to sharpen their focus or recover from setbacks.

In tennis, too, players have explored related approaches. Novak Djokovic has spoken extensively about the role of meditation, visualization, and energy-focused routines in his preparation, while Andre Agassi has credited holistic mentors for helping him manage pressure and refine his game.

Borg's story, while rare, sheds light on athletes turning to non-traditional strategies to gain a competitive edge. Indeed, his admission, more than four decades later, comes at a time when the practice of mediumship and spiritualism is far more mainstream. Tyler Henry rose to prominence with his readings for A-List celebrities on E! Entertainment and then got his own series on Netflix in 2022. Likewise, Theresa Caputo became a psychic celebrity with her long-running show, Long Island Medium. Mystic Meg even got her own casino bingo game in the form of Mystic Meg Bingo, the former National Lottery clairvoyant taking her small-screen personality to the world of iGaming.



Heartbeats, which was released in September in the U.S., also explores Borg's relationships, friendships, and the lifestyle surrounding his career. He recalls spending time in New York with close friend and fellow player Vitas Gerulaitis, who introduced him to the glamour of Studio 54, and mingling with icons such as Elton John, Mick Jagger, and Paul Simon.

Yet Borg emphasizes these experiences were more about finding balance amid the structure of professional tennis than indulgence. He reflects on his early adoption of meditation, yoga, a strict diet, and the pioneering use of a full-time traveling coach and regular sports massages. These practices, many unconventional at the time, are now commonplace in elite tennis preparation.

The memoir presents Borg as both an athlete and an individual navigating fame, sport, and personal curiosity. The revelation about consulting a medium, while surprising, fits this broader quest for understanding and competitive edge, showing that even the seemingly unflappable “Ice Borg” explored unusual avenues to sharpen his legendary edge.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","The world's leading blockchain-based taxi app is setting its sights on New York City","https://fortune.com/2025/12/25/the-worlds-leading-blockchain-based-taxi-app-is-setting-its-sights-on-new-york-city/","Fri, 26 Dec 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

In June 2026, the world's leading Web3 taxi app will be launched in the Big Apple.

This ride-hailing app—called TADA—uses blockchain technology to connect drivers and riders via smart contracts. Its use of decentralized tech enables greater transparency, fairer earnings for drivers, and cost savings for riders, co-founder Kay Woo told Fortune in a Dec. 24 interview.

“We don't work as an intermediary. We are becoming the software for both [drivers and riders] and while they're using our network, they just need to simply pay a small fee,” Woo says. 

TADA was founded in Singapore in 2018 by two South Korean tech entrepreneurs: Kay Woo and Jay Han. The ride-hailing app is best known for its “zero commission model”, which charges drivers a flat software fee (of around 78 to 92 cents) rather than a cut of their earnings.

The platform has a significant and growing share in Singapore's crowded ride-hailing market, constituting 11.1% of market share in 2022, according to data platform Measurable AI. As of October 2024, TADA brought in a record $19.8 million in revenue, up from $15.7 million in 2023.

Since its launch, TADA has expanded to various markets in Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam in 2019, and Thailand and Hong Kong in 2024. Within the U.S., the company is currently trialing its tech in Denver, and plans to launch officially in NYC in June.

The origin story

TADA's entry to NYC marks a full-circle moment for Woo, who had first begun his entrepreneurship journey in the city. 

In 2012, alongside a friend, Woo created a social gathering application with the goal of bringing people together—but the app flopped.

“I couldn't sell the product. I come from an engineering and finance background, and my co-founder was an engineer. We were just a bunch of nerds,” Woo says. 

After a few failures, they decided to create a product that would generate revenue from the get-go, and a ride-hailing app came to mind. 

In 2014, Woo and Han moved back to Asia, and set out to digitalise the cross-border mobility services between the bustling cities of Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

According to Woo, although Uber and DiDi were popular in the region, ride-hailing apps didn't yet offer cross-border transport services. Instead, car rental companies and drivers managed reservations with pen and paper—and Woo saw a gap in the market.

After a successful test run in Hong Kong and mainland China, TADA's founders officially launched their ride-hailing business in Singapore, choosing the city-state as it is densely populated and has “superb infrastructure support.” 

“Among Southeast Asian countries, Singapore is super important to showcase all other neighboring countries in Southeast Asia,” Woo says. “We got lucky in picking the right place, but also the right time.”

Aside from revenue from its platform fees, TADA has several other revenue streams. 

Besides generating a profit from the broader Web3 platform by its parent company, MVL, TADA sells anonymized vehicle and driving data—with consent—to ecosystem partners, and offers MVL tokens to be traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges.

Journey to the west

After growing the business in Asia, Woo now has his sights set on the U.S., where he is ready to take on industry giants like Uber and Lyft.

“Whenever I go to New York, I interview the old drivers, and everybody says the same thing: current ride-hailing services take too much commission, but they don't have any choice,” quips Woo. “We need to give them a choice—TADA is going to be a painkiller for them.”

Woo is a big proponent of disruption, believing it to be an essential tenet of progress.

He alludes to ‘legacy' ride-hailing apps like Uber and Grab as part of the “first wave”, which disrupted the traditional taxi market. But these platforms were built with capitalistic goals, he says, leading to skyrocketing platform fees and prices. 

“And now it's their time to be disrupted with a new type of model,” Woo adds.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

This story first appeared in the Washington State Standard.

Joe Nguyen is stepping down as director of Washington state's Department of Commerce and is expected to be named the next leader of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber.

Nguyen told Commerce employees on Tuesday that he is leaving but didn't disclose his new job. He said he didn't anticipate taking off “until sometime in January.”

“Although I can't tell you where I'm going just yet, I will be working in Seattle, closer to home,” he wrote in an agencywide email. “Sometimes opportunity knocks, even when you haven't invited anyone to your door. Recently I was offered an opportunity outside of Commerce that I have accepted because it was the right thing to do for my family.”

The chamber, an independent business organization with 2,600 members, plans an announcement Monday concerning its chief executive officer position. A spokesperson declined further comment.



Rumors of Nguyen's selection had begun circulating online and among business lobbyists in recent days. Nguyen did not return multiple phone calls for comment.

The job has been open since Rachel Smith left as the organization's president and CEO to become president of the Washington Roundtable.

Nguyen, a White Center Democrat, was in his second term in the state Senate representing the 34th Legislative District when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to the high-ranking post. He is the first member of Ferguson's executive cabinet to quit, though others have retired. 

Nguyen led an agency with a $7.9 billion budget and that administers more than 100 programs in the areas of housing, energy, community and economic development, local government and business services. One of its largest portfolios is promoting development of affordable housing, a top priority of Ferguson's.

In his email to employees, Nguyen wrote he was “honored” that Ferguson “put his faith in me nearly a year ago and I thank him for that trust.” He said he did not know if Ferguson would install an interim leader or hire a new director right away.

In a statement, Ferguson praised the outgoing director and didn't say how he plans to replace him.

“I spoke with Joe, and it's clear he received an offer he couldn't refuse,” Ferguson said. “I deeply appreciate Joe's work this past year. Joe always has an open invitation to join my administration in the future.”
