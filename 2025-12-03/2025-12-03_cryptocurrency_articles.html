                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With this raise, the firm's total assets under management have reached $1.5 billion, reinforcing its commitment to backing founders building category-defining technologies in fast-moving global markets. The firm emphasized that these sectors are experiencing structural shifts driven by breakthroughs in AI, computing, defense technology, autonomy, and cryptographic infrastructure. Leadership noted that the industries historically underserved by software—still reliant on paper, phone calls, or decades-old systems—now present some of the most dramatic reset opportunities as AI unlocks full P&L transformation. Entrée Capital's long-standing focus on deep-tech and AI, along with its founder-driven investment approach, positions the new funds to accelerate global company-building from day zero. The firm has backed AI companies for more than seven years and plans to increase its exposure as the next wave of AI-native platforms and infrastructure takes shape. “We are entering a new era where physics, compute, software, and national-security innovation converge. We are focused on AI-native founders building vertical agents, infrastructure, and category-defining software. We've been investing in AI for over seven years, and these funds will double down on the theme.” I am excited to support world-class founders building enduring companies from Israel and globally.” “Three themes are top of mind: AI agents, decentralized physical infrastructure, and policy automation. Web3 is evolving from speculation to institutional adoption, where real utility and infrastructure take center stage. Policy automation and compliance as code are enabling institutions to interact with these systems safely, embedding trust and regulation directly into programmable finance.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain is shifting from speculation to execution, with adoption driven by practical infrastructure. The debate over which blockchain will dominate is finished. Bitcoin long ago established itself as the number one global store of value, and we've seen Ethereum cement its place as the primary settlement layer for digital finance. Each new network tried to outperform the others on speed, cost or decentralisation. It was a period that helped drive innovation but also distracted many in crypto from the real question: ‘How can these systems now serve people and businesses?' Attention and hype brought in invaluable capital, but, unfortunately, also narrowed how people saw the technology. Mainstream investors and traditional finance watched the 2017 boom in ICOs, and it turned blockchain into a byword for wild speculation. The industry has matured and is finding real-world uses for its products. The adoption of stablecoins alone is expected to generate an additional $1.4 trillion in demand for US dollars by 2027. They make transactions fast, reliable and affordable, bridging Ethereum's security with the ease people expect from modern payment systems. Bitcoin is the secure digital reserve, a hedge against inflation and policy risk, while Ethereum is the programmable base for settlement and trustless transactions. When payments clear instantly, and fees cost less than a cent, people stop thinking about the technology and just use it. Stablecoins now move money across borders instantly and at almost no cost, but only when the networks beneath them can handle constant activity without slowing or breaking. Stripe's launch of stablecoin payments on Polygon shows that blockchain is becoming part of everyday finance and not a side experiment. The infrastructure is used to move tokenised assets, settle trades and connect new digital markets with traditional finance. This results in a single, more fluid system where value can travel anywhere. Franklin Templeton's OnChain US Government Money Fund, built on Polygon, is proof that traditional assets can operate directly on public blockchain infrastructure. Related: Why Everyday Transactions, Not Wall Street, Will Drive Crypto Adoption For Web3 to grow, these systems must work together as one network. At Polygon, this is the problem we are addressing with Agglayer, a framework that links multiple blockchains so they can share value and security while keeping their independence. It lets developers expand to new users without rebuilding everything from the ground up. When that connection happens, Web3 starts to look like a functioning economy rather than isolated silos. Across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, stablecoins are part of everyday life. Families in Argentina use them to protect savings from inflation amid an ongoing economic crisis. Around the globe, there are real economies powered by blockchain systems that focus on speed and low cost. Once people can send money instantly without thinking about what enables it, adoption will become permanent. Competition in Web3 has shifted from ideology to execution. The debates over consensus models or technical purity matter less than how well a network performs. The leaders will be those who offer a smooth, reliable experience and can handle millions of users without strain. When blockchain becomes simple and invisible, users stop discussing crypto. The era of competing base layers has run its course. What matters now is how well execution networks turn that foundation into practical tools for people, businesses and governments. The next wave of adoption will be led by those who make blockchain useful, not just possible. The builders who focus on making it invisible will define its most visible impact. The debate over which blockchain will dominate is finished. Bitcoin long ago established itself as the number one global store of value, and we've seen Ethereum cement its place as the primary settlement layer for digital finance.

US Stocks:

Shares of crypto miner American Bitcoin collapsed yesterday, losing a third of their value in the first minute of trading, and it only got worse from there.

The company quickly became the symbol not just of the crypto market wipeout of late 2025, but also the collapse of the myriad ventures that the Trump family has been promoting in the digital-currency world over the past year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto Asset Management firm Bitwise said Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade, expected to go live later Wednesday, is the kind of unflashy infrastructure change markets tend to overlook in real time, and then credit later for making the network feel sturdier and more investable. The upgrade is constructive for Ethereum over time because it expands capacity, improves validator efficiency as rollups grow and, most importantly, strengthens the blockchain's ability to capture value from layer-2 activity, wrote analyst Max Shannon. Fusaka also raises the layer-1 gas limit to 60 million per block, a move that should lift throughput and take some pressure off fees, roughly doubling capacity over a year, by Shannon's estimate. Fusaka introduces a minimum blob base fee (EIP-7918), addressing a post-Dencun quirk where fees can sink to near zero in quiet periods, dampening ETH burn and weakening the link between real usage and value accrual. Under Fusaka, the blob fee gets a floor tied to execution fees, roughly the execution base fee divided by 16, creating a more consistent revenue and burn stream as stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization migrate to rollups, the analyst said. Bitwise cautioned that upgrades don't reliably spark lasting ether price pops, there's often a mild sell-the-news pattern, but argued that Fusaka further cements Ethereum's role as the settlement layer for on-chain, increasingly institutional, finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICO reprimands company over accidental publishing of data about people caught up in Horizon IT scandal The Post Office has avoided a fine over a data breach that resulted in the mistaken online publication of the names and addresses of more than 500 post office operators it had been pursuing during the Horizon IT scandal. This data breach was entirely preventable and stemmed from a mistake that could have been avoided had the correct procedures been in place.” The ICO said its investigation had found that the Post Office had failed to implement appropriate “technical and organisational measures” to protect people's information. The data watchdog highlighted a lack of documented policies or quality assurance for publishing documents online, as well as “insufficient” staff training with “no specific guidance on information sensitivity or publishing practices”. The ICO said it had initially considered imposing a fine of up to £1.09m but decided that the data breach did not reach the threshold of “egregious” under its approach to fining public-sector companies. “As reprimands lack the force of law, the Post Office can rest assured that they will not face consequences if they fail to address their shortcomings.” Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning The Post Office settled the civil claim brought by 555 claimants for £57.75m over the wrongful prosecutions on faulty Horizon evidence – amounting to £12m after legal costs – without admitting liability, in December 2019. Last May, hundreds of post office operators convicted on charges including false accounting, theft and fraud were exonerated by an unprecedented act of parliament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tectum (TET) is a blockchain development project and has just launched a new token, Tectum Cash Token (TCT), following an $800,000 community raise on the KingdomStarter launchpad. TCT crypto has officially hit DEXs and is now teasing a CEX listing for later this week. TCT crypto launched on December 1 at a listing price of $0.20, but was quickly sold off by presale investors, taking profits. However, a worrying lack of volume is causing the price to stagnate and leading investors elsewhere, particularly to the PepeNode (PEPENODE) presale. The Tectum PayFi ecosystem is described as “a zero-fee payment system using digital banknotes”, in which TCT is used to transform user participation into ownership. Holders will gain access to revenue-sharing from SoftNote ePOS operations, exclusive ecosystem rewards, and decision-making rights that shape Tectum's financial evolution. Although there was some initial hype surrounding the TCT crypto launch, which saw an $800,000 presale raise filled on the KingdomStarter launchpad, the two days following its public launch have seen dwindling volume, leading to a sell-off from presale investors. After a successful DEX launch yesterday, we now have our very first CEX listing lined up for later this week! Can you guess which one it's going to be?! Per GeckoTerminal, TCT has only processed $47.5K in daily trading volume, which is a pitiful haul for a supposedly hyped new project. To add to the misery, Tectum Cash Token has maintained a holder count of just 164, another indicator of weak demand for the token. Many investors are seemingly bearish on the project and its early poor performance, instead turning to PepeNode (PEPENODE), a ‘Mine-2-Earn' memecoin ICO that has already raised over $2.25M. The PepeNode (PEPENODE) presale has just surpassed $2.25M in ICO funding and is set to hit $3M as its next target, before running toward $5M and beyond. These features create excitement and interest in the PEPENODE token ahead of its launch on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). While TCT crypto is teasing CEX listings that may or may not come, there are strong rumors within the PEPENODE community that Binance is closely monitoring the project. This feature enables presale investors to compound their investments, earning additional revenue through a GameFi mining approach. As broader crypto market conditions improve, PepeNode is solidifying its position as one of the best investment plays right now, with more hype and demand than TCT crypto and other new token launches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined what he sees as the network's next phase of scaling, offering a more nuanced roadmap for growth as on-chain activity accelerates and institutional capital re-engages with ETH. Buterin's comments come as Ethereum is attempting to regain technical footing after a difficult month, supported by a broader macro rebound and strengthened tokenized-asset flows. Vitalik floated one possible path forward: a 5× increase in the gas limit paired with a 5× rise in gas costs for operations that create inefficiency at the execution layer. Among the areas Buterin listed as candidates for higher costs were SSTORE operations (particularly when new storage is created), certain complex arithmetic opcodes, calls to contracts with large code size, precompiles (excluding elliptic-curve functions), and slight increases to calldata costs. Buterin's remarks follow the community's push for higher gas limits, with Ethereum now running at a 60-million-block gas limit, double what it was just a year ago. According to recent market analysis, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum, including stablecoins, has repeatedly set the floor for ETH's market cap. Meanwhile, market performance this week offers a hint of renewed confidence. ETH rose 7.46% in the last 24 hours, reversing part of a steep 30-day decline. Gains tracked a wider market rebound, supported by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and increased dollar liquidity. Whales also accumulated approximately $22 million in ETH during recent dips, easing sell pressure and helping the asset reclaim key moving averages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Whale Buying Steps Up as Market Rebounds From Heavy Liquidations Ethereum's largest holders have re-emerged as crypto prices mount a recovery following more than $600 million in long liquidations on Monday. On-chain data show that one large holder purchased 18,345 ETH, worth roughly $55 million, from BitGo on Tuesday, according to analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. Another purchased 4,597 ETH worth roughly $13 million from Binance early on Wednesday, while yet another large holder purchased 30,278 ETH worth $91.16 million from Kraken, roughly three hours ago. Those moves have coincided with a rebound from early December losses, which have lifted Bitcoin, Solana, and other digital assets higher. Bitcoin is 7% and Solana has jumped more than 10%. Adding to hopes of continued higher prices, taker buy volume—representing the volume of buy orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps—spiked to $148.7 million across all exchanges on Tuesday. “If we see more DATs trade below mNAV, there will be some acquisitions with institutional investors swooping in for discounted Ethereum,” Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, told Decrypt. “I think the correction has run its course, and the macro tailwinds will push Ethereum back up,” he added.

Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has charted its best day since May as it adds 10% to top $93,000, up from lows of under $84,000 earlier this week and putting it back within touching distance of a $2 trillion market capitalization, with traders betting on a 2026 game-changer. “If history is any guide, tokenisation today is roughly where the internet was in 1996—when Amazon had sold just $16 million-worth of books, and three of the rest of today's “Magnificent Seven” tech giants hadn't even been founded.” “Assets of all kinds could one day be bought, sold and held through a single digital wallet.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Fink threw BlackRock's weight behind a decade-long push to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to Wall Street in 2023, calling it the first step towards a blockchain-based tokenized revolution that he believes will help democratize finance. "Tokens that represent ‘real-world' traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds and so on) remain a tiny share of global equity and fixed-income markets but are growing fast—up roughly 300% in the past 20 months," Fink wrote, adding: “It started in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous developer, launched bitcoin as a shared digital ledger that could record transactions without intermediaries.” BlackRock's bitcoin ETF has led the market since a dozen such funds were launched in early 2023, far outpacing the growth of gold ETFs and opening the floodgates for many other cryptocurrencies to get ETFs of their own.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an alleged statement to developers Santa Ragione, the Fortnite makers explain that they've found the game to be in contravention of policies against "Inappropriate Content" and "Hateful or Abusive Content". Given that, according to Santa Ragione, Epic have had access to a build for two months and had already approved the game for publication on their store 18 days before launch, the whole thing feels like a frantic response to Valve's claims about the unfinished build, which Epic presumably haven't seen. In the statement attributed to them, Epic's content reviewers also say that when they piped their findings about Horses through a questionnaire supplied by an international age rating NGO, it told them the game should be rated Adult Only. AO games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store unless - as the attributed statement reminds us - they've only been rated Adult Only because they have blockchain, NFT or cryptocurrency technology. This is totally fine, because none of those things are reprehensible or controversial, and besides, they probably make more money for Epic than bizarre and disturbing artworks about people dressed as horses. According to Santa Ragione, Epic informed the developers that they won't distribute Horses about 24 hours before release, and denied a subsequent appeal 12 hours later. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology)." The developers say they don't know for sure what pushed Epic to act, but offer a bit of speculation. "Following the announcement of Steam's ban, HORSES became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition," they write. "It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself." Regarding Epic's attributed comments about policy infringement, they write that "no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines". If you're catching up with all this, Santa Ragione went public about Valve banning Horses from Steam around a week ago. According to the developers - with partial confirmation from Valve - Steam's reviewers rejected the game after submission of an unfinished build they felt featured "content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor". I've reviewed the finished game (at possibly indulgent length - maybe have a toilet break before you dive in) and as regards the final version of that scene, I don't consider this to be any kind of child pornography. I've included screens of it below to give you an idea. To give some broad context, Horses is about violent structural repression and the punishing of sexuality. The game is not an endorsement of anything it depicts. As with their response to Valve's rejection of the game, Santa Ragione argue that all of this is just modern-day puritanism in action. "We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists," they write. "Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. These bans passively shape which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship." As with the payment processor crackdown on "adult" or "NSFW" games from earlier this year, my takeaway is that another large corporate institution is reluctantly pantomiming the role of public guardian. As their on-going support for scam-ridden technologies with a considerable environmental cost suggests, Epic aren't really interested in safeguarding morality - it's just a predicament thrust on them by their control of distribution. In the meantime, Horses can still be found on Humble, Itch, and GOG. Click that link above, and you'll see it's "no longer available for purchase". Humble are owned by IGN Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, who also own Rock Paper Shotgun. I have yet to reply at the time of writing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home | Analysis | Quantum money meets Bitcoin: Building unforgeable digital currency A new battle for the digital throne is emerging as quantum money moves from theory to possibility, raising the question of whether Bitcoin's decentralised strength can withstand a future shaped by quantum technology. Quantum money might sound like science fiction, yet it is rapidly emerging as one of the most compelling frontiers in modern digital finance. Comparisons between blockchain and quantum money are frequent and, on the surface, appear logical, yet can these two visions of new-generation cash genuinely be measured by the same yardstick? Quantum money was first proposed by physicist Stephen Wiesner in the late 1960s. Wiesner envisioned a system in which each banknote would carry quantum particles encoded in specific states, known only to the issuing bank, making the notes inherently secure. Due to the peculiarities of quantum mechanics, these quantum states could not be copied, offering a level of security fundamentally impossible with classical systems. At the time, however, quantum technologies were purely theoretical, and devices capable of creating, storing, and accurately measuring delicate quantum states simply did not exist. Today, the rise of functional quantum computers, advanced photonic systems, and reliable quantum communication networks is breathing new life into the concept, allowing researchers to explore practical applications of quantum money in ways that were once unimaginable. Any attempt to measure a quantum state inevitably alters it, meaning that copying or scanning a quantum banknote destroys the very information that ensures its authenticity. The unique property makes quantum money exceptionally secure: unlike blockchain, which relies on cryptographic algorithms and distributed consensus, quantum money derives its protection directly from the laws of physics. In theory, a quantum banknote cannot be counterfeited, even by an attacker with unlimited computing resources, which is why quantum money is considered one of the most promising approaches to unforgeable digital currency. Quantum money schemes are typically divided into two main types: private and public. In private quantum money systems, a central authority- such as a bank- creates quantum banknotes and remains the only entity capable of verifying them. Despite these challenges, public quantum money remains a major focus of quantum cryptography research, with scientists actively pursuing secure and scalable methods for open verification. Quantum states are inherently fragile and susceptible to decoherence, meaning they can lose their information when interacting with the surrounding environment. Any error or loss could render a quantum banknote completely worthless, and no reliable method currently exists to store these states over long periods. In essence, the concept of quantum money is groundbreaking, yet real-world implementation requires technological advances that are not yet mature enough for mass adoption. Each transaction is verified across thousands of nodes, and SHA-256 hash functions secure the blockchain against double spending without the need for a central authority. Unlike elliptic curve cryptography, which could eventually be vulnerable to large-scale quantum attacks, SHA-256 has proven remarkably resilient; even quantum algorithms such as Grover's offer only a marginal advantage, reducing the search space from 2256 to 2128– still far beyond any realistic brute-force attempt. Many experts therefore consider Bitcoin effectively quantum-proof, with most of the dramatic threats predicted from quantum computers likely to be impossible in practice. Furthermore, the network can evolve to adopt post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, ensuring long-term resilience, making Bitcoin arguably the most battle-hardened digital financial instrument in existence. Bitcoin operates as a global, decentralised monetary network with established economic rules and governance, while quantum money represents a technological approach to issuing physically unforgeable tokens. Bitcoin is not designed to be physically unclonable; its strength lies in verifiability, decentralisation, and network-wide trust. However, SHA-256- the hashing algorithm that underpins Bitcoin mining and block creation- remains highly resistant to quantum threats. Quantum computers achieve only a quadratic speed-up through Grover's algorithm, which is insufficient to break SHA-256 in practical terms. Bitcoin also retains the ability to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards as they mature, whereas quantum money is limited by rigid physical constraints that are far harder to update. Quantum money also remains too fragile, complex, and costly for widespread use. Its realistic applications are limited to state institutions, military networks, or highly secure financial environments rather than everyday payments. Bitcoin, by contrast, already benefits from extensive global infrastructure, strong market adoption, and deep liquidity, making it far more practical for daily transactions and long-term digital value transfer. Although fundamentally different, quantum money and blockchain technologies have the potential to complement one another in meaningful ways. Quantum key distribution could strengthen the security of blockchain networks by protecting communication channels from advanced attacks, while quantum-generated randomness may enhance cryptographic protocols used in decentralised systems. Researchers have also explored the idea of using ‘quantum tokens' to provide an additional privacy layer within specialised blockchain applications. Both technologies ultimately aim to deliver secure and verifiable forms of digital value. Bitcoin, by contrast, stands as the most resilient and widely adopted model of decentralised digital money, supported by a mature global network and robust cryptographic foundations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's ($ETH) latest drawdown flushed out excessive leverage, with cascading liquidations forcing weak hands to sell into thinning bids. As the dust settles, on-chain data now shows large wallets quietly stepping back in, accumulating spot $ETH rather than chasing high-octane derivatives. That includes one whale who bought around $13M worth of $ETH in the past 24 hours. When whales rotate into spot after a washout, they signal conviction in the underlying asset's medium-term trajectory, not just a quick bounce. For you, it's a chance to take advantage: blue chips stabilize, then capital starts hunting for higher beta plays that can outperform if the rebound broadens. At the same time, Ethereum's own fundamentals are strengthening, with the Fusaka upgrade and PeerDAS set to expand blockspace and support more rollup activity. If whales are expressing fresh confidence in Ethereum's programmability, the obvious asymmetric trade is the chain that finally gives Bitcoin similar capabilities. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to launch a super-fast Bitcoin Layer-2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, targeting execution speeds that can rival Solana's performance. When it launches, the platform will feature a modular design: the Bitcoin Layer-1 handles settlement and security, while a real-time SVM-powered Layer-2 executes transactions and smart contracts. This architecture enables high-throughput execution and sub-second finality while anchoring state periodically to Bitcoin for trust minimization. That also means you can move wrapped $BTC with low fees, swap, and stake. To get yours, our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the information you need. That kind of early whale interest often precedes deeper liquidity once listings arrive. Buying early has its advantages, considering the token's potential to hit a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) fits that bill as the world's first mine-to-earn meme coin, blending old-school mining vibes with on-chain gamification instead of ASIC warehouses. At its core, PEPENODE introduces a virtual mining system where you acquire node tiers rather than physical hardware. A gamified dashboard tracks your node performance, rewards, and progression. The PEPENODE presale has raised more than $2.2M, with tokens currently priced at $0.0011778, giving it a meme-cap starting point with clear upside if the mine-to-earn concept catches on. Staking is set at a whopping 576%, which is sure to encourage investors to lock their token in the staking pool and support the network. Our PEPENODE price prediction believes it has the potential to reach $0.0072 by end-2026. Based on its current price, that translates to a 511.309% increase. In a market where attention is everything, PEPENODE offers something beyond another cartoon frog: an interactive mining game loop that can keep users engaged well past the initial hype. If Ethereum's rebound spills over to the best meme coins, mine-to-earn memes like PEPENODE could be among the biggest percentage movers. None of this altcoin rotation happens without a credible base layer leading the charge, and Ethereum ($ETH) still owns that role. It remains the dominant decentralized smart contract platform, powering billions in DeFi TVL, NFT markets, and a rapidly expanding Layer-2 ecosystem that settles back to Ethereum for security and finality. Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade is set to go live today, introducing PeerDAS and higher gas limits to meaningfully increase data availability and throughput. By making it cheaper and more efficient for rollups to post data on-chain, Fusaka lays the groundwork for another wave of Layer-2 innovation and activity. For you as a trader, that means two things. First, Ethereum itself remains the liquidity sink where whales park capital between risk cycles, a trend currently visible as large wallets quietly reload $ETH on spot markets post-liquidation. Second, improved scalability attracts more apps and users, which in turn supports the valuations of the altcoins and Layer-2s built on top.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At 9:31 a.m. on Wall Street, just one minute after trading opened, its shares were down 33%. For as much as broader crypto markets have sunk these past two months — roughly 25% in the case of bellwether Bitcoin — projects that are tied to the Trump family are down far, far more. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, has seen its WLFI token tumble 51% from its peak in early September, more than both Bitcoin and an index of smaller digital tokens. Alt5 Sigma, a company promoted by the Trump sons, has plunged around 75% as it deals with a growing number of legal problems. Then there are the memecoins named after the president and his wife, Melania, which have fallen around 90% and 99% respectively from their record highs back in January. American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump, is now down 75% after the big drop on Tuesday. Now, though, what looked like a Trump premium has suddenly turned into a Trump drag, taking out one of the central pillars holding up cryptoassets and offering an indication of just how quickly confidence in these speculative markets — and even in the president himself — can dissolve. “The Trump presidency has been a double edged sword for legitimacy,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University's Washington College of Law. “Trump started launching his own crypto projects, many of which lost value very quickly. While the president has recently toned down his public promotion of crypto, Eric Trump took to social media on Tuesday to blame American Bitcoin's bad performance on the end of a lockup period for its shares, rather than any broader weakness. “Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched,” he wrote in a post on X. Digital tokens have experienced big drops in the past, before bouncing back. On Tuesday, as American Bitcoin struggled, the original cryptocurrency had one of its best days in the last few weeks, rising around 6%. And for a while, the various cross-promotions seemed to be working. These projects were all helped by policies and regulatory changes that Trump promoted, led by legislation that aimed to bring crypto stablecoins, tied to the value of the dollar, into the mainstream. But the signs of trouble have been mounting over time. He noticed things getting particularly bad after Trump launched a new salvo of tariffs against China in October. “People started to realize, this might not be what they thought,” Li said. Michael Terpin, a long-time crypto investor, said that the tariff moves have served as a cold reminder: “Trump giveth and Trump taketh away.” Meanwhile, Alt5 Sigma, a public company that set out to buy one of the tokens issued by World Liberty Financial, has faced an exodus of executives after announcing that one of its subsidiaries had faced a criminal probe in Rwanda. Alt5 Sigma did not respond to requests for comment on the recent developments. But they are still sitting on significant profits, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It is retail investors who bought into assets when they were flying near their peaks that are nursing the most painful losses. Kevin Hu, a 22-year-old student in Vancouver, had positioned for a continued rally, but instead saw his portfolio of digital tokens drop by as much as 40% by mid-November. “You'd think with the president being so pro-crypto, it would create a floor,” he said. “But the market didn't respond that way.</p>
