                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case on Wednesday, citing what he called a "weaponized" justice system. Trump, who has argued that his own legal troubles were a partisan witch hunt, said on social media without presenting evidence that Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were prosecuted because the congressman had been critical of President Joe Biden's immigration policies. Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that Cuellar "bravely spoke out against Open Borders" and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife "simply for speaking the TRUTH." Federal authorities had charged Cuellar and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House. Cuellar has said he and his wife are innocent. The couple's trial had been set to begin next April. "Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight," Trump wrote in his social media post announcing the pardon. Cuellar, who has served in Congress for more than 20 years, is a moderate Democrat who represents an area on the Texas-Mexico border and has a history of breaking with his party when it comes to immigration and firearms. He also is one of the last Democrats in Congress who opposes abortion rights. Cuellar is not the only Democrat Trump has pardoned this year. In February, he pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, five years after he had commuted his sentence in a political corruption case. Like in Cuellar's case, Trump suggested that New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, faced federal corruption charges because he made comments critical of Biden's immigration policies. A top Justice Department official, who was also Trump's defense lawyer in several of his cases, stepped in to seek dismissal in the case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court. Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties. "We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122," he said during an onstage interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit. Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's "Squawk Box" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, "permanently." Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on a time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures. Bessent added that China has made "a robust effort" at halting the drug's import into the U.S. He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case. On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the front-runner. "The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks," he said. Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft pushed back on a report Wednesday that the company lowered growth targets for artificial intelligence software sales after many of its salespeople missed those goals in the last fiscal year. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company has not lowered sales quotas or targets for its salespeople. The sales lag occurred for Microsoft's Foundry product, an Azure enterprise platform where companies can build and manage AI agents, according to The Information, which cited two salespeople in Azure's cloud unit. AI agents can carry out a series of actions for a user or organization autonomously. Less than a fifth of salespeople in one U.S. Azure unit met the Foundry sales growth target of 50%, according to The Information. In another unit, the quota was set to double Foundry sales, The Information reported. The quota was dropped to 50% after most salespeople didn't meet it. "Aggregate sales quotas for AI products have not been lowered, as we informed them prior to publication," a Microsoft Spokesperson said. The AI boom has presented opportunities for businesses to add efficiencies and streamline tasks, with the companies that build these agents touting the power of the tools to take on work and allow workers to do more. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Salesforce, Amazon and others all have their own tools to create and manage these AI assistants. But the adoption of these tools by traditional businesses hasn't seen the same surge as other parts of the AI ecosystem. The Information noted AI adoption struggles at private equity firm Carlyle last year, in which the tools wouldn't reliably connect data from other places. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo on Wednesday said humans will begin test driving the Alphabet-owned company's robotaxi vehicles in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. The three cities represent the latest additions to Waymo's quickly growing list of cities where the Google sister company is either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles. Waymo will begin manual drives in the trio of new cities this week with hopes to eventually begin serving fully-autonomous rides there, spokesperson Ethan Teicher told CNBC. Over the past month, Waymo has been aggressively making announcements for new markets and developments at the Google sister company. Amazon's Zoox began offering free rides in Las Vegas and San Francisco, and Tesla this year launched ride-hailing service with human supervisors in the Austin and San Francisco markets. In November, Waymo announced that it will soon begin manually driving in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The company also added Houston, San Antonio and Orlando to its list of cities where it'll launch service in 2026. Waymo also began offering rides on freeways in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets, and it named a new finance chief. With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company in May said it had provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020. The new cities further signal that Waymo is increasingly confident its service can work well in locations with colder weather conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Security technology startup Verkada has reached a $5.8 billion valuation after a new funding round led by CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, announced Wednesday. "I think Google saw the opportunity with us in the application of AI and everything we're driving to apply AI to the physical security industry," CEO Filip Kaliszan told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa. The company said in a release that the CapitalG-led investment will be used to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities and provide liquidity. CapitalG also recently contributed to a $435 million fundraise for cybersecurity startup Armis in November. The new funding comes as Verkada surpasses $1 billion in annualized bookings across 30,000 customers globally. The company develops physical security products, including cameras, alarms and sensors, that are connected under a single cloud-based software platform. Kaliszan said his company serves a broad span of businesses, such as retailers, government properties, schools, and transportation. For example, TeraWatt Infrastructure, which supplies charging sites to electric vehicles like Google's Waymo, uses Verkada technology to protect EV facilities. In September, the company rolled out over 60 new AI features and platform updates, including tools like "AI-Powered Unified Timeline." The tool can automatically synthesize videos and images from several cameras into a single visual timeline, rather than requiring security teams to dig through multiple videos during an investigation. "The genius of Filip and the team of Verkada is that they're leveraging AI as a Rosetta Stone to really help unlock insights from cameras to help companies become safer and more efficient," CapitalG general partner Derek Zanutto told Bosa. By capturing over 20 million images per hour, Verkada can provide notable data like foot traffic, occupancy rates, security violations and other trends, Zanutto said. However, AI-powered technology will not necessarily replace human security guards any time soon. "I think humans will be providing security to other humans for as long as I can think," Kaliszan said. He pointed to the Louvre heist in October, where multiple crown jewels were robbed from the museum, as an opportunity where AI-assisted devices that could actively monitor, then immediately alert security forces, would be more effective than only physical personnel. "If you could intervene right then, if you could know in real time that that's happening, the potential for savings and preventing damage is tremendous," he said.

Macy's beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations for the third quarter this morning, posting its strongest growth in more than three years. President Donald Trump has said his tariffs will bring production jobs back to the U.S. But as CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, corporate executives and economic forecasters are concerned the opposite could happen. Respondents to an Institute for Supply Management survey said the duties are pushing them to start reducing headcount and offering severance packages. "Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty," one respondent said. A Federal Reserve report from last week also showed employment "declined slightly" over the past several weeks. We'll be keeping a close eye on the ADP private payrolls report due out this morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting growth of 40,000 jobs in November. OpenAI is feeling the heat as rivals Alphabet and Anthropic gain ground in the artificial intelligence race. Earlier this week, CEO Sam Altman reportedly sent a staff memo laying out a "code red" effort to improve its ChatGPT bot. It comes amid growing fanfare for Alphabet's Gemini 3 model, which beat industry benchmarks. Anthropic, meanwhile, is reportedly readying for one of the largest IPOs ever. Shares of Alphabet and its chip partner Broadcom have surged in recent weeks, while Nvidia and Microsoft — both business partners of OpenAI — pulled back. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Broadcast station owners are running toward industry consolidation, but they're hitting roadblocks. But as CNBC's Lillian Rizzo and Alex Sherman report, Sinclair's attempt to scale up has been marred by family ownership challenges. Meanwhile, the Nexstar-Tegna deal requires changes to decades-old regulatory rules. Boeing investors needed their seatbelts for yesterday's ride. Shares soared more than 10% — their best day since April — after CFO Jay Malave said the plane maker expects higher deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets in 2026. Malave notably said the higher deliveries will be "a big driver" for cash flow. As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan notes, the Virginia-based company hasn't posted an annual profit since 2018. Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell joined CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" yesterday to discuss his and his wife's $6.25 billion commitment to fund "Trump accounts" for kids. Correction: Nexstar is attempting to buy Tegna.

San Francisco is going after food brands that produce "ultra-processed foods," accusing the companies of fueling a public health crisis. It named 11 brands as defendants: The Kraft Heinz Company, Mondelez International, Post Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company, Pepsico Inc., General Mills, Nestlé, Kellanova, WK Kellogg Co., Mars Inc., and Conagra Brands. The city attorney said the brands had profited from selling ultra-processed foods, which make people crave what they otherwise would not. Products from these brands include cereals, candies, soft drinks, and ready-to-eat meals. It said that ultra-processed foods majorly contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illnesses. Chiu called for the brands to cease further deceptive marketing and pay civil penalties to the city of San Francisco. The lawsuit comes as the US is clamping down on processed foods, a result of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement.</p>

In 2022, the trio quit their jobs to cofound Raylu, an AI startup that builds agents to help private-market investors automate sourcing work. On Monday, the company announced that it had raised $8 million in Series A funding, bringing its total funding to $12 million. One of their earliest customers, HighlandX, led the round. It's a reminder that even if the company they built falls apart, their friendship is still worth toasting. Ondracek and Dastjerdi met the way many college friendships begin. "From that point forward, we started becoming really close," Ondracek said. "Ali was the best man at my wedding." They spent late nights dreaming up business ideas, none of which stuck. But the urge to build something together did. When Dastjerdi moved to Seattle with Ondracek and Ilkka, it was obvious to him that this was "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a company with two close friends that you think are truly brilliant." The trio, now based in New York, works out of a WeWork office, and no longer lives together. Mixing friendship and business usually comes with risks. The mentor said that was a good sign. The trio said working together as best friends has upsides: They trust one another, reset fast after an argument, and know each other's strengths and weaknesses. "It's like a little bit of a sibling relationship," Ondracek said, explaining that disgruntlement doesn't lead to lasting animosity. When I asked the trio to describe one another, their dynamic snapped into focus. Ilkka said Dastjerdi brings "urgency" and an understanding of the investing world, and he called Ondracek the "best engineer" he knows. Dastjerdi described Ilkka as the team's optimist and risk taker. The cofounders said their dynamic has changed after starting a business together. Dastjerdi said one of the hardest adjustments for him was remembering how to be a "regular friend" outside work. Because "99%" of his thoughts revolve around the company, he's had to build what he calls a "mental firewall" to keep cofounder mode from bleeding into friend mode. The founders say their journey has taught them a few valuable lessons worth sharing. Ondracek said what matters most for a startup is its people. "Nothing works if the people don't work," Ondracek said. Dastjerdi said founders shouldn't fall in love with an idea too early. "When we actually found product-market-fit, it is so tangibly different. It's like, people have to rip the product from you." Keep iterating, be picky, and pivot more — sometimes that could lead to a bigger win, he added. Ilkka warned against rushing into the founder path just because other people are starting young. And if you're building with your best friends? Make sure you still want to open a beer together when everything goes south. Do you have a story to share about building an AI startup?</p>
