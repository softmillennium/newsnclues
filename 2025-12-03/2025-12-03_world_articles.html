Witkoff is in Moscow, leaving Europe in a state of disbelief as it finds itself sidelined from a historic thaw between Washington and Moscow.

In our latest episode, we're diving into the historic shift brewing behind the Kremlin walls –could peace be on the horizon? Rick and Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to US Secretary of State Colin Powell, discuss why European leaders are clinging to the war path: they find a straightforward answer – greed. Wilkerson points out that EU politicians are on borrowed time if they don't wake up and represent the will of the people.

Wilkerson also highlights Trump's unpredictability – an unsettling trait for the European leaders witnessing US influence wane, dragging Brussels down with it. Stay tuned for all the latest on the evolving peace talks – only on RT!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don't want them,” Trump said. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. The Trump administration is expanding its immigration raids targeting Somalis in Minneapolis this week, with reports of detentions already made as President Donald Trump spews vitriolic, racist hate against the population of several hundred thousand people in the U.S. Officials are deploying roughly 100 officers and agents for the operation. Sahan Journal reports that local immigrant rights groups have said that they have already witnessed four Somali individuals being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents this week. ICE has also targeted Southeast Asian and Latine people in Minneapolis for arrests. Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declined to comment on the raids but told Sahan: “What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.” In a racist rant during his cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump said that Somalis are “garbage” who “contribute nothing.” He said that Somalia is “no good” and “stinks,” ignoring the historic ravaging of the country by colonial powers and his own contribution to the devastation of the country due to his sweeping aid cuts. He also directed hatred toward Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), who has long faced bigoted animosity from the right for her Somali background and Muslim faith. “When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don't want them in our country.” Omar brushed off the comments, simply saying: “His obsession with me is creepy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) also denounced Trump's racism in a post on X. “When demagogues like Trump are in trouble, they reach for the same playbook: racism, hatred and division, this time against Rep. Ilhan Omar and the Somali-American community,” he said. Progressive Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) said that Trump's comments echo the rhetoric that got a Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, assassinated in Minnesota earlier this year. That alone should unite us against this hate speech.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. On Tuesday, Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, announced that they will donate $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for 25 million children in the U.S. Any child under the age of 18 is eligible to create an account, and their families can contribute up to $5,000 annually, which can grow through investment of diversified, low-cost U.S. stock index funds. Children cannot access their money until they become adults, although there could be eligible rollovers allowed into other brokerage accounts. The new law also invests $1,000 into Trump Accounts for every child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Although parents can sign up for the program now, Trump Accounts will not become available to manage until May 2026, according to the Treasury Department. Michael Dell explained why he and his spouse made the gift, stating, “We've seen what happens when a child gets even a small financial head start — their world expands.” However, observers have noted that Trump Accounts may do little to help children whose families are unable to make huge investments into their accounts. In July, while promoting Trump Accounts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the program as a potential “backdoor for privatizing Social Security,” before walking back that statement amid backlash. “Bessent actually slipped and told the truth: Donald Trump and his government want to privatize Social Security,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in response to Bessent's comments. “The so-called ‘Trump accounts' are a missed opportunity that focused on Donald Trump's vanity and giving Republicans a hollow talking point rather than truly helping young people,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virginia) said last month. Notably, parents who want to participate must opt their children into the program around tax time, which some families may not be aware of. While we support direct investments in families, the Trump Accounts being hailed by the White House are a policy solution that doesn't meet most families' needs. Indeed, the program has the potential to widen wealth gaps that are already embedded in the U.S. For example, a family that had a child today and signed up for the $1,000 initial investment given to Trump Accounts, but who struggled to contribute to the account and never made any personal investments afterward, would only see their child's account grow by around $700 after 18 years, assuming a 3 percent rate of growth annually. The expanded child tax credit was implemented during the pandemic as a way to lift children in low-income families out of poverty, and was wildly successful at doing so, helping to drop poverty and hunger rates for 61 million children in the U.S. However, immediately after the expanded credits expired in 2022, the child poverty rate more than doubled, going from 5.2 percent to 12.4 percent in just one year. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Democrats released a handful of photos and videos from Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island on Wednesday, offering a rare glimpse into a secretive place where Epstein is alleged to have trafficked young girls. The new images and videos show Epstein's home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appears to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which the words “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. The New York Times reported that Epstein's last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, including Little St James, which some locals told the New York Times they had nicknamed “pedophile island”. In 2022, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands reached a settlement for more than $100m with Epstein's estate after they alleged “dozens of young women and children were trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive in the Virgin Islands at Epstein's secluded private island, Little St James.” A bipartisan group of members of Congress on Wednesday also asked the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to provide a status update. “These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters Garcia said the panel had also received records from JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank and would be releasing those documents in the days ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosecutors say two others also indicted in investigation into funding for school training young diplomats The EU's former chief diplomat Federica Mogherini and two other people have been formally accused of fraud and corruption, the European prosecutor's office has said. Prosecutors suspect fraud in the tender for a contract to run a training academy for young diplomats, which was awarded to the College of Europe by the EU foreign service. It added: “All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the competent Belgian courts of law.” All three have been released “as they are not considered a flight risk”, the EPPO said. On Wednesday, Mogherini issued a statement via the College of Europe. “In its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness,” she said. Kallas, who is one year into a five year mandate, said integrity and accountability “will only improve under my watch” and that the current process showed “safeguards are in place and working”. One of the accused is understood to be Stefano Sannino, a senior commission official, who was secretary general of the European External Action Service from 2021 to 2024. A request for comment sent to him was referred to the commission, which declined beyond saying it was co-operating with an investigation into activities that took place before the term of the current EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. She went on to become rector of the College of Europe, a training ground for European officials and politicians. Her appointment in 2020 proved controversial, with some alumni arguing she lacked academic credentials and experience of running a major academic institution. Prosecutors have said they have strong suspicions that confidential information had been shared with one of the candidates taking part in the process. In the second programme, diplomats spent four months in Bruges and a month at the EEAS headquarters in Brussels, as part of the programme where they were trained in EU policies, as well as diplomatic skills such as negotiation, communication and protocol.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pete Hegseth defends Adml Frank ‘Mitch' Bradley who reportedly directed second strike on alleged Caribbean drug boat “Let's make one thing crystal clear: Adml Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100 per cent support,” Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said on Monday. Mr Hegseth put out the statement, ostensibly defending his colleague, after it emerged survivors of an attack on a US military strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat on Sept 2 had been blown up in a follow-up attack. Adml Frank “Mitch” Bradley directed a second strike from the operation room in Fort Bragg, North Carolina after Mr Hegseth issued an order to “kill them all”, according to The Washington Post. “He doesn't have an honourable bone in his whole body,” one Pentagon source said of the defence secretary. Following days of intense scrutiny following The Washington Post's report, Mr Hegseth has repeatedly sought to distance himself from the mission, which former military lawyers believe is either murder or a war crime. America is fortunate to have such men protecting us. When this department of war says we have the back of our warriors — we mean it,” he wrote on social media on Monday. Then at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Mr Hegseth said he did not see any survivors on the burning wreckage of the boat. “But I stand [by it] because the thing was on fire. You can't see anything...This is called the fog of war,” he said. On Sunday, Donald Trump also appeared to distance himself from the issue. Mr Trump added that he would look into it and said he “wouldn't have wanted that, not a second strike”. Official sources told the New York Times that Mr Hegseth did not set out what should happen if a first missile turned out not to kill those on board or destroy the boat. They added that his order was not a response to surveillance footage showing that at least two people on the boat survived the first blast. A Pentagon source said Adml Bradley would have known the second strike was unlawful, but accused Mr Hegseth of attempting to scapegoat his subordinate. “I am disgusted that Hegseth is trying to shirk all responsibility,” they told The Telegraph. “That guy doesn't have an honourable bone in his body.” Mr Hegseth has previously argued that the US has been unfairly constrained by military lawyers and too squeamish about its conduct on the battlefield. “They never actually understand the context of what happened.” “I think the concern is he's throwing somebody under the bus, rather than saying, ‘I gave an unclear order, it's on me', rather than saying, ‘hey, look, you know, he did everything he could do,'” Victor Hasen, a professor at New England Law Boston, said. On Thursday, Adml Bradley is expected to give a classified brief to the House and Senate armed services committees on the September strike as both Republican and Democratic politicians try to clarify details of what happened. He was among the first service members to deploy into Afghanistan following 9/11 and has served multiple tours in command of joint task forces. In October the father-of-four, who is from Eldorado, Texas, was promoted to lead US Special Operations Command, JSOC's parent organisation, which oversees elite units across the military. “Even if we go with the administration's very stretched and I think improper theory that the United States is in a non international armed conflict, the law is very clear that shipwreck personnel are to be respected and protected under the laws of war,” said Rachel E VanLandingham, professor at Southwestern Law School and retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel. He has legal and moral culpability for that, so do the folks that followed his order, because I believe it was patently, manifestly unlawful,” she added. Mr Hasen agreed that regardless of the type of conflict, it would be unlawful to order individuals who no longer pose a threat to be killed. “Whether they emanate from the secretary of defence, whether they emanate from somebody else in the chain of command, the orders would be illegal, and even if a superior ordered it, if it's an illegal order, it would be illegal to pass on and follow that order,” he said. It could be those within the military chain of command who ordered them to do so. But Mr Hasen said while Mr Hegseth could potentially be charged under federal law and those involved in the strikes could be prosecuted in military or civilian court, even if the strikes are ruled as unlawful he does not believe any action will be taken. “Nobody's getting prosecuted here, that is not going to happen... nobody's going to face criminal prosecution for this, because at this level, it is a political issue more than a legal issue,” he said. “The United States has a pretty long history, and we're not unique in that, but most militaries have a pretty long history of not prosecuting senior leaders, even if arguably a prosecution could be made, it's usually more of a situation where their careers are ended quietly, or maybe not so quietly,” he said. Eugene R Fidell, senior research scholar in law at Yale Law School, said he believed there could be grounds to impeach Mr Trump or Mr Hegseth for the strikes, but such a move would again be unlikely. “The uniformed people could be tried in court martial or in theory, they could be tried in federal district court, but remember, nobody can force such a prosecution and this administration is unlikely to bring such prosecutions.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

BRUSSELS, December 3. /TASS/. The European Commission has approved the so-called "potential reparations loan" for Ukraine, which implies the use of frozen Russian assets, EC President Ursula von der Leyen announced.

"We have been discussing and then adopting proposals for a potential reparations loan," she said at a press conference in Brussels.

"If you look at the IMF estimates, Ukraine will need 135 billion euros for the next two years — 2026 and 2027. This is needed to keep the state and the basics services running — so it is a civilian side but also to continue the brave resistance on the battlefield — this is the military side," she said.

According to von der Leyen, the European Commission intends to prohibit the enforcement of foreign court decisions within the EU as part of Russia's retaliatory measures against the expropriation of its sovereign assets under the guise of a "reparations loan," adding that this is supposedly intended to protect Belgium from Russia's retaliatory actions. The head of the European Commission also stated that the confiscation of Russian assets allegedly does not require a compromise, and the decision will be made by a qualified majority.

Earlier in an interview with TASS, Russian Ambassador to Belgium Denis Gonchar stated that regardless of the scheme used to cover up the expropriation of Russia's sovereign assets, it would be theft. He stressed that Russia's retaliatory measures "will follow immediately and will force the West to count its losses."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabotage activity in Russian-occupied territories is picking up after a two-year lull, according to a new report by ACLED, an organization that tracks conflicts around the world. Pro-Ukrainian militias were particularly active in the occupied territories in 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion, the report found — although this declined as Russia consolidated control through suppressing protests, torture, and executions. This year, ACLED recorded 37 episodes of sabotage as of Nov. 14 — more than in 2023 or 2024, and mostly driven by one armed partisan group: Atesh. A pro-Ukrainian militia originally from Crimea, Atesh is responsible for over half of the incidents recorded within the occupied territories in 2025. "Since Crimea has been occupied for over a decade, our impression is that they (members of Atesh) blend in, facing fewer hurdles in accessing occupied territories and mainland Russia," says Gurcov. "We assume that they are more mobile than Ukrainians from the newly occupied territories, who probably face higher scrutiny from Russian security forces," he added. ACLED identified almost 700 incidents of anti-Russian sabotage within Russia since the full-scale invasion. But many smaller acts of sabotage likely go unrecorded — earlier this year, the Kyiv Independent reported on an all–female partisan group Zla Mavka, who claim to have mixed laxatives into food and drink served to Russian soldiers. Russian sabotage in Ukraine has also picked up. "From the data, it looks like Russia learned from Ukrainians how to recruit local proxies," says Gurcov, highlighting that often those people are young, unemployed, and motivated by cash. Two Ukrainians are suspected of sabotaging the Warsaw–Lublin railway line in Poland last month, a crucial line for delivering aid to Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Telus Inc. T-T is pausing its dividend growth as part of an effort to reduce its leverage, an abrupt change from its previous payout plans after investors and analysts questioned the company's ability to keep increasing dividends while meeting debt reduction targets. The pause represents an about-face from just two weeks ago, when the company insisted it would continue with plans to grow its dividend. On Nov. 20, Telus chief financial officer Doug French told The Globe that management did not expect changes to the dividend growth plan, “and management does not plan to change that, as nothing has changed in our operations.” He also noted, however as with other public companies, Telus dividend decisions are ultimately made by the board of directors which reviews the payout on a quarterly basis. In recent weeks, some analysts argued Telus's plans to continue increasing the dividend were unsustainable given their estimates of the company's cash flows, as investors questioned the company's ability to keep increasing dividends while meeting debt reduction targets. Now, the company will continue to pay its quarterly dividend at the most recent level of 41.84 cents per share, “until such time as our share price and associated dividend yield better reflects the considerable growth prospects of Telus,” chief executive officer Darren Entwistle said in a Wednesday release. However, analysts from J.P. Morgan and Veritas Investment Research calculated the figures differently, saying they viewed that ratio as remaining above 100 per cent for the next few years. Telus shares are near their lowest point for nearly a decade. The company's share price has suffered a 45-per-cent slide since 2022 highs, and remain down 14.2 per cent from this time last year. However, the stock jumped on Wednesday morning, up 2.4 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a yield of about 9.1 per cent. Telus's decision to pause dividend increases is expected to end pressure on the stock price from short selling by investors such as hedge funds. Short sellers borrow stock and sell it on the expectation of repurchasing the shares at a lower price and making a profit. In a note to investors Wednesday morning, CIBC director of institutional equity sales Veleyny Saavedra said the move “should act as a clearing event for the market,” and would position the company well for long-term value creation. “We see them as incrementally positive and expect the Street to react favorably,” she said. In May, BCE halved its dividend payout – which at the time had a yield of 13 per cent, widely seen as unsustainable – in order to allocate that cash elsewhere. In May, Telus reduced its dividend growth target to between 3-per-cent and 8-per-cent growth annually from 2026 to 2028 to help it reach its leverage goals of three times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of 2027, the company said. In addition to the dividend pause, on Wednesday Telus also provided forward guidance on its free cash flow, saying it expects to generate $2.15-billion in free cash flow in 2025, and a minimum compound annual growth rate of 10 per cent between 2026 and 2028. It also shared a more detailed timeline on removing the discount from its dividend reinvestment plan, which it plans to do entirely by the end of 2027, and reiterated its continuing other ongoing deleveraging initiatives.

Russian missile struck the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Dec. 3, injuring at least four people, including a child, Ukraine's Emergency Service reported. The 3-year-old girl and a 28-year-old victim will receive outpatient treatment, while an 87-year-old woman was hospitalized in a condition of moderate severity, according to Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko. The attack also set garages on fire and damaged an administrative building. Former Russian Ground Forces commander Vladimir Chirkin criticized Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, saying Russia was "once again" unprepared for war, in an interview with pro-Kremlin media outlet RBC published on Nov. 27. Chirkin referred to Russia's reported plan to "seize Kyiv in three days," saying that Russia had "Tbilisi Syndrome," and memories of the events of the five-day war with Georgia in 2008, but in Ukraine's case, it "did not turn out that way." "During the first few weeks, we were taught a serious, harsh lesson, and the former defense minister tried to find a face-saving exit from the situation, calling what was happening a 'gesture of goodwill'," Chirkin said. Both entities are subject to sanctions by most of Ukraine's partner countries, the statement read. "The weapons Russia is using against Ukraine today could be used by Russia and its allies against other countries in the future. Ukrainian forces are establishing additional logistics routes to supply units in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, where heavy fighting continues, the East Group of Forces reported on Dec. 3. Search and assault operations aimed at clearing Russian troops from urban areas are ongoing in Pokrovsk. The Third Army Corps of the Ukrainian Armed Forces denied Russian claims of a breakthrough in the city of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast, releasing a video on Dec. 3 showing a captured Russian soldier. In the released footage, a soldier with the call sign "Ptitsa" ("Bird" in English), identified as a member of the 37th Regiment, said Russian military correspondent Timofey Yermakov publicly revealed his unit's location in Lyman. The disclosure enabled Ukrainian forces to capture some Russian troops and destroy part of his unit, he said. Ukraine attacked the Druzhba oil pipeline on Dec. 1, despite Hungary and Slovakia previously urging Kyiv to refrain from further attacks. The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. According to the source, remote-controlled explosives, combined with additional combustible mixtures, were used to destroy the oil pipeline section. Five NATO allies confirmed on Dec. 3 new purchases of U.S. defense materiel for Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL). During a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels, two joint upcoming PURL packages, each worth $500 million, were announced: one co-financed by Germany, Norway, and Poland, and another by Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. Russian President Vladimir Putin "has not yet shown any real willingness to negotiate," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in Berlin on Dec. 3, prior to his departure for Brussels. "That is why we are maintaining pressure on Russia, and, as allies in NATO, intend to increase it further." Ukrainian negotiators will meet European national security advisers in Brussels on Dec. 3 to discuss peace efforts before holding another meeting with U.S. envoys, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, and Andrii Hnatov, the chief of staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, will brief European officials on Russian-U.S. talks in Moscow on Dec. 2 and "discuss the European component of the necessary security architecture." The comments follow a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to Moscow to discuss a revised U.S.-Ukraine peace plan with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who participated in the talks, described the meeting as "very useful, constructive, and highly substantive," but noted that no concrete agreement was reached. After an alleged Ukrainian drone strike overnight on Dec. 3, a fire broke out at an oil depot in Russia's Tambov Oblast, and fuel reservoirs were damaged in the Voronezh Oblast, local media and authorities reported. Tambov regional governor Yevgeny Pervishov said debris from a drone fell on an oil depot in the settlement of Dmitrievka, sparking a blaz. Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels circulated footage they said showed an explosion and fire, though the images could not be independently verified. Voronezh regional governor Alexander Gusev said that four drones were detected and destroyed in two districts of the region. He added that in one of the areas, several fuel tanks were "slightly damaged." At least 5 people have been killed and 26 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 3. Russia launched 111 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian drones attacked the town of Ternivka overnight on Dec. 3, killing two men, aged 43 and 50, and injuring three others. Another strike killed a person in the city of Sloviansk. The settlements of Vodianske, Lyman, and Oleksandrivka also came under attack, leaving three civilians injured, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured three others over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Kharkiv Oblast, a 73-year-old man suffered injuries as a result of the Russian attack against the village of Kivsharivka, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Odesa Oblast, a Russian drone strike targeted an energy facility, injuring an energy worker who was hospitalized in serious condition, Governor Oleh Kiper reported. Russia has lost around 1,176,230 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 3. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,393 tanks, 23,682 armored fighting vehicles, 68,688 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,780 artillery systems, 1,555 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 430 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,231 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov attend a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin on Tuesday.Alexander Kazakov/Reuters Ukraine and its European allies accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday of feigning interest in peace efforts after five hours of talks with U.S. envoys at the Kremlin produced no breakthrough. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged Putin to “stop wasting the world's time.” The remarks reflect the high tensions and gaping gulf that remain between Russia on one side and Ukraine and its European allies on the other over how to end a war that Moscow started when it invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago. No Ukraine compromise reached in meeting between Putin and U.S. envoys, Russia says A day earlier, Putin accused the Europeans of sabotaging the U.S.-led peace efforts – and warned that, if provoked, Russia would be ready for war with Europe. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said Tuesday's talks at the Kremlin between Putin and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were “positive” but wouldn't release any details. Putin met Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in the Kremlin as part of a renewed push by the Trump administration to broker a peace deal. A U.S. peace proposal that became public last month was criticized for being tilted heavily toward Moscow because it granted some of the Kremlin's core demands that Kyiv has rejected as non-starters. Many European leaders worry that if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine, it will have free rein to threaten their countries, which already have faced incursions from Russian drones and fighter jets, and an alleged widespread sabotage campaign. The Russian and American sides agreed Tuesday not to disclose the substance of their Kremlin talks, but at least one major hurdle to a settlement remains – the fate of four Ukrainian regions Russia partially seized and occupies and claims as its own. Analysis: Duelling peace plans show relief for Ukraine remains a long way off “We're deliberately not going to add anything,” he said. Foreign ministers from European NATO countries, meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, showed little patience with Moscow. “What we see is that Putin has not changed any course. He's pushing more aggressively on the battlefield,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. “It's pretty obvious that he doesn't want to have any kind of peace.” Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen struck the same note. “So far we haven't seen any concessions from the side of the aggressor, which is Russia, and I think the best confidence-building measure would be to start with a full ceasefire,” she told reporters. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Ukraine's partners will keep sending it military aid to ensure pressure is maintained on Moscow. Two people were in critical condition, he said, after the attack destroyed one house and damaged six more. Meanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that air defences destroyed 102 Ukrainian drones overnight. Falling drone debris sparked a fire at an oil depot in the Tambov region, about 200 kilometres south of Moscow, local Gov.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, Vladimir Putin's trip this week to New Delhi is particularly notable. It is taking place against the backdrop of rapid and profound changes on the international stage, in which both countries are playing a decisive role. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine entered a phase of open conflict which quickly escalated beyond the local level. The Chinese-American economic symbiosis, which peaked in the late 2000s, is entering a phase of inevitable ‘disconnection'. Finally, mid-level players in different parts of the world have started to consider emerging opportunities more closely. Western commentators pointed the finger at Russia and China, with Iran and North Korea frequently mentioned in the same breath. The grouping of these very different countries into a single category reflected Western fears rather than the real situation. Any signs of deviation from this order were seen as an ‘attempt to escape' that should be punished. The paradox is that Russia and China, which jointly declared their rejection of hegemony, occupied very different positions within this order. Russia was dissatisfied with the disregard for its geopolitical interests, and sought greater integration into the global economic system, to which Western leaders were indifferent. China, on the other hand, was a pillar of that very economic system. However, it was dissatisfied with Western countries dismantling it ad hoc, sensing a threat to their own dominance. As for Iran and North Korea, their task was merely to ensure their own inviolability. Hardly surprising, given that they were constantly threatened with sanctions. India has always been seen as a purely positive example. It is a non-Western country that is growing rapidly, plays by the rules, and focuses primarily on its own development without having excessive ambitions abroad. The liberal order is only remembered out of inertia. At the level of slogans, China is calling for a return to the previous open system, although Beijing realizes that this is impossible. While resolving the security issue on Ukraine's borders does not provide an answer to future challenges in itself, it does create a new framework for addressing them. Incidentally, the past few years have been a kind of experiment with regard to Pyongyang and Tehran. Both were once accused of pursuing nuclear ambitions, but only North Korea realized this ambition. Its growing political weight is not so much the result of its increasing ambitions, as it is due to changes in the world. This is also due to the growing desire of some leading powers to secure India's support in their relations with other leading powers. Russia and India are very different from each other; in some respects, they are even opposites. However, two important circumstances should be noted. Firstly, their experience of close, friendly, and mutually beneficial cooperation sets a benchmark for the international order, where the emphasis is on highlighting rather than erasing civilizational contrasts. It shows how to maintain stability amid turbulent change. Secondly, neither Russia nor India is seeking global domination. However, both are powers without which nothing is possible, each due to their own set of parameters. There is less burden and more flexibility. If efforts are coordinated, there will be no obstacles for us, either at sea or on land.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current Ukrainian leadership's penchant for corruption is well known, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, responding to a question from TASS. He made the remark in the context of the EU corruption scandal involving former head of European diplomacy Federica Mogherini and former members of her staff. On December 2, the European Commission and the European Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed that Belgian police and the European Public Prosecutor's Office had conducted searches at the headquarters of the European External Action Service in Brussels, the College of Europe in Bruges, and several private homes, during which "three individuals were detained." They are accused of tender fraud, including the European diplomatic service's bid for a training program for young European diplomats at the College of Europe. According to Italian media, the detainees were released because "there is no risk of them absconding." At the same time, Kiev finds itself in the middle of its own corruption scandal. On November 10, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced a large-scale operation dubbed Midas to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. The homes of businessman Timur Mindich, known in some circles as Vladimir Zelensky's "wallet," Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later dismissed, and the company Energoatom were searched. According to investigators, participants in the criminal scheme laundered at least $100 million. That same day, NABU began publishing excerpts from recordings of conversations in Mindich's apartment in which corruption schemes were discussed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Staff thought a burglar had broken in before finding the animal face down in the bathroom A drunken raccoon has been found passed out at the scene of a “break-in” at an off-licence in the US. Staff at the liquor shop in Virginia arrived at work on Saturday morning to find bottles smashed amid puddles of scotch and whiskey. They worried they had been burgled, before spotting the animal asleep on the bathroom floor. Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter confirmed one of its animal control officers, Samantha Martin, had been called to the “chaotic scene”. “Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect' had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then … passed out in the bathroom,” the shelter said in a social media post. It's believed the animal had spent Friday night at the Ashland ABC Store ransacking shelves after dropping down from the roof through a broken ceiling tile. Ms Martin told the Associated Press that the animal had drunk from bottles of alcohol, which were found smashed on the shop floor. “He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” she said. “Another day in the life of an animal control officer, I guess.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ammar Wadi knew he was risking his life when he set out to get a bag of flour for his family from an aid truck near the Zikim crossing into Gaza in June. Amid regular Israeli gunfire toward aid seekers this summer, Wadi never made it home and the message he left was delivered to his family weeks later by someone who found his phone. Wadi is among the dozens of Palestinians whose loved ones say they vanished near Zikim and whose fates remain unknown. At other times, their remains were simply left to decompose in the open, unable to be recovered in the militarized area. The practice of mishandling bodies by bulldozing them into unmarked graves can violate international law, according to legal experts. CNN's review, which also found that aid seekers were killed by indiscriminate Israeli fire near the crossing, drew upon hundreds of videos and photos from around Zikim, along with interviews of eyewitnesses and local aid truck drivers. Two videos, geolocated by CNN to the Zikim area, show the aftermath of an incident in June, depicting bodies partially buried around an overturned aid truck. CNN spoke with two former Israeli military members who described instances elsewhere in Gaza during the war in which the bodies of Palestinians were bulldozed into shallow graves. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied that it used bulldozers to “remove” bodies, but did not address whether they were used to bury them. The IDF told CNN the presence of bulldozers around Zikim was a “routine matter” used for operational purposes, such as dealing with explosive threats or “routine engineering needs.” According to international law, the warring sides should cooperate in burying the dead in a way that allows them to be identified, said Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. “Moreover, if bodies are deliberately mutilated or mishandled in a way that violates their dignity, this can amount to ‘outrages upon personal dignity' which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.” Whether the IDF tracks sites where it has allegedly buried bodies remains an open question, however. The IDF did not respond to CNN's question about this incident. Nearly six months after Wadi's disappearance, his family is still without answers. Instead of finding comfort in his final phone message, however, Wadi's mother, Nawal Musleh, is haunted by what she may never discover. At least one person carrying flour appears to be shot from behind in the footage, with the gunfire seeming to come from the direction of an IDF position that CNN has identified in satellite imagery. In the other video, a group can also be seen tending to the bodies of one apparently dead and another severely injured person, before carrying them away. In a statement to CNN, the IDF said it “does not intentionally shoot at innocent civilians” and in instances where a threat arises, “fire is carried out for warning purposes or to neutralize the threat.” Other footage and photos reviewed by CNN show multiple corpses that could not be retrieved from Zikim by other aid seekers or the civil defense due to the dangerous conditions. On June 15, two eyewitnesses told CNN that one aid truck traveling from the crossing was swarmed by a crowd of hungry Palestinians. An ambulance operated by civil defense workers was permitted to access the area several days later. “We were shocked by the scene,” one of the civil defense workers told CNN, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. “The (bodies) we recovered were decomposed – they had clearly been there for a while, there were signs that dogs had eaten parts of them.” Videos obtained and geolocated by CNN to that location in Zikim show a crushed, overturned aid truck amid a pile of debris. Several decomposing bodies are scattered around the vehicle, partially buried in mounds of sand. The IDF did not respond to questions about this incident. A half dozen local aid truck drivers who worked the Zikim route spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity due to fears for their safety. They described scenes of strewn and decomposing bodies as a common sight, with Israeli bulldozers at times clearing the corpses into the sand. Satellite imagery and photos add to these testimonies, capturing a standing presence of Israeli bulldozers from late July to early August. Signs of bulldozer activity around the Zikim crossing are apparent beginning in mid-June, just after the aid route opened, until September 12, when it closed. Some of the bulldozer activity appears related to clearing the aid route, which was frequently littered with boxes and debris. At other times, satellite imagery shows bulldozing activity without a clear purpose, such as when a bulldozer pushed a 30-square-meter (322-square-foot) area of soil into a short pile in mid-June, around 400 meters (1,300 ft) away from where the overturned truck attended to by civil defense workers was found days earlier. The bulldozers were also repeatedly used to demolish the ruins of buildings behind which aid seekers previously sought shelter from Israeli gunfire, as seen in numerous videos. Two eyewitnesses told CNN that on September 7 – as people went searching near Zikim for any sign of their missing family members – they came across what they say appeared to be bulldozed corpses. “I found the bodies there bulldozed along with the cardboard (aid) boxes… they pile them on top of each other,” Adel Mansour told CNN, one of the eyewitnesses who went looking for his 17-year-old son. One IDF whistleblower, who previously served at an outpost in the Netzarim Corridor, spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. The soldier said that nine bodies of unarmed Palestinians were left to decompose for nearly two days around his base in early 2024. “The families maybe don't know what happened with their loved ones,” he said. BTS, which provides a forum for Israeli troops to speak out and verifies their accounts, also said that it had received numerous testimonies from soldiers on this practice. “We were never given any protocol or any order of how to handle at all any bodies of either combatant or non-combatant that we came across in the war,” the whistleblower told CNN on condition of anonymity. The IDF has consistently denied burying Palestinians in mass graves. The IDF could not account for the destruction of the cemeteries identified, but said the military sometimes has “no other choice” but to target locations it claimed Hamas uses for military purposes and explained that bodies were removed from some gravesites in attempts to rescue hostages. With many Palestinians who tried to get food this summer still missing, the desperate search for answers continues for their families. Some remain hopeful that their loved ones may still be alive somewhere, such as in Israeli detainment or displaced elsewhere in Gaza. “Ammar (Wadi) was someone whose absence leaves a huge void – losing him feels like losing a part of yourself,” his brother Hossam said. “If he's martyred, may God have mercy on him, but if he's alive, at least we can hold on to hope.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ALICIA R. CHEN is a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. She won the 2025 Perry World House-Foreign Affairs Emerging Scholars Policy Prize. USAID, after all, had served as a key tool of U.S. diplomacy for more than six decades, and the American retreat has created an opportunity for China to expand its economic statecraft and win influence in many parts of the world. Between 2000 and 2023, only 17 countries in the world did not receive a loan or grant from the Chinese government or a Chinese state-owned institution. On the surface, China's development program appears to be a largely indiscriminate apparatus. But a close review of how China deploys its vast financial resources reveals that its support is strategically targeted to countries that are leading regional organizations. When countries chair groups such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) or the African Union (AU), for instance, their governments receive a sharp uptick in aid from Chinese government agencies. This pattern doesn't hold for global platforms such as the UN Security Council. In other words, China is not attempting to dominate every forum. Between 2000 and 2021, China extended about $68 billion per year in overseas development financing. The U.S. average over this period, by contrast, was about $39 billion per year. Although China's development program is global in scope, my research has shown that Beijing gives more aid to countries when they have leadership roles within regional organizations. For example, by looking at Chinese economic assistance to countries in Southeast Asia and Africa from 2000 to 2017, I found that when a country chaired ASEAN or the AU, it received seven times as much financing from Chinese government agencies as it did during the years when it did not chair the organization. This surge translates to an average of $90 million in additional funding. This suggests Beijing is pursuing a deliberate, regionally focused strategy. To many observers in Washington, regional organizations may seem marginal compared with global heavyweights such as the UN. But Beijing sees these institutions as critical platforms for diplomacy and economic coordination, especially in the so-called global South. As one senior Chinese diplomat described it in 2016, the U.S.-dominated system was like “a suit that no longer fits.” By investing in regional blocs such as ASEAN and the AU, Beijing is further cultivating this identity and presenting itself as the leader of a new order. Securing influence in regional forums also helps China deflect criticism and advance its preferred norms, which often contravene Western priorities. By rewarding the chair—which plays a central role in setting the organization's agenda—Beijing can steer regional conversations away from contentious issues and toward topics that favor its geopolitical objectives. When Cambodia chaired ASEAN in 2012, it blocked passage of a joint statement from an ASEAN summit because a section criticized Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. Two months later, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao pledged $500 million in new loans and grants to Phnom Penh. In announcing the agreements, Cambodia's finance minister even acknowledged that Beijing “voiced high appreciation” for Cambodia's role as ASEAN chair in maintaining “good cooperation between China and ASEAN.” Later that year, during the 2024 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit, Xi elevated China's relationship with Mauritania to a strategic partnership and commended President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani for his leadership as the AU's rotating chair. Many Western countries primarily deliver aid through government agencies such as USAID, but in China's case, assistance from government agencies makes up only about ten percent of its total foreign aid portfolio. China's closest analog to USAID, the China International Development Cooperation Agency, together with other ministries involved in aid delivery, most notably the Ministry of Commerce, had a combined annual budget of roughly $3 billion in 2023, a fraction of USAID's $42 billion budget that same year. The bulk of Chinese financing comes instead from state-owned policy banks and commercial banks that must balance strategic mandates with the imperative to recover loans. Because these banks are state-owned, many observers have assumed that all Chinese financing reflects government strategy. These political transactions occur between government actors because government agencies offer leaders greater discretionary control, making it easier to use these funds to secure diplomatic support or political concessions. The bottom line is that the most politically consequential forms of Chinese assistance come from its government agencies—which account for only a small share of China's overall portfolio—suggesting that not all Chinese financing functions as a tool of Beijing's economic statecraft. They must first recognize that the geopolitical battleground is shifting. While many Western countries have continued to focus on defending liberal norms in global institutions, China has been quietly gaining traction in regional bodies. These bodies often provide early signs of dissent and help set the norms that guide international responses. And many Western officials are rethinking how to rebuild trust with such organizations after being confrontedby the global South's fragmented response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In other words, leaders can no longer afford to treat regional organizations as peripheral forums. The regions they represent account for a growing share of the world's population and are often flash points on issues of trade and security. The decisions of regional organizations are increasingly consequential to policymakers. A more nuanced understanding of China's aid programs is also in order. Doing so will allow the United States and its allies to gain valuable insights into Beijing's strategic focus—and perhaps even begin building a more targeted and effective response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Some of the American proposals look more or less acceptable, though they need to be discussed,” Ushakov said, adding that other points “do not suit us.” Among the previous sticking points are Kremlin demands for Ukraine to formally renounce its aspiration to join NATO and for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine that has been annexed, but not yet conquered, by Russia. A meeting between Putin and Trump had not been scheduled and a prospective face-to-face would “depend on the progress we're able to achieve,” Ushakov said. Ushakov said Putin and the US delegation discussed territorial issues in their meeting, “without which we do not see a solution to the crisis.” Earlier, Putin had accused European leaders of trying to block the US-proposed peace deal by “putting forward demands that are absolutely unacceptable for Russia,” and suggested that Ukraine's European allies are “on the side of the war.” “They themselves refused peace negotiations and are interfering with President Trump,” he added. While Putin did not explain his thinking in detail, he was likely referring to the changes reportedly made to Trump's original 28-point peace plan, which was put forward by the US last month and rejected by Ukraine and its European allies. Daily life grinds to a halt for Ukrainians facing blackouts and drone strikes But just hours before key talks, the Kremlin reiterated its position that any peace deal must resolve what it describes as the “initial causes” or “underlying reasons” for its invasion – shorthand for a longstanding list of demands that has included a halt to NATO expansion, recognition of Russia's claimed control over occupied Ukrainian regions and the effective end of Ukraine as a sovereign state. A senior NATO official told reporters they see no indication that Moscow is willing to make “meaningful concessions” to end the war in Ukraine. The official said that Russia maintains its territorial demands and will still “aim to ensure Ukraine's military capabilities are weakened as much as possible to pave the way for further aggression.” The Putin-US meeting came US officials and a Ukrainian delegation met in Miami on Sunday for talks that Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as “very productive,” though he cautioned that more work remained. Witkoff and Kushner, who does not hold an official US government role but has re-emerged as a key figure in the administration's diplomatic efforts, could be seen strolling through Moscow's Red Square with Kremlin representative Kirill Dmitriev before their meeting, according to footage from Russian state-owned news agency TASS. Earlier, Witkoff and Dmitriev had lunch at a Michelin-starred Moscow restaurant, where they dined on caviar, quail, venison and crab, the restaurant's director, Maxim Romantsev, told Russia's Izvestia newspaper. CNN's Matthew Chance, Mitchell McCluskey, Ivana Kottasová, Jennifer Hansler, Darya Tarasova and Svitlana Vlasova contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DeepSeek has a “kill switch” baked into its system, and it does exactly what Beijing wants, a cybersecurity report finds. The Chinese artificial intelligence startup writes significantly weaker code when running into prompts that contain Beijing's trigger words, such as Falun Gong and Uyghurs, two groups suffering severe persecution in China. For such requests, DeepSeek often writes code with severe security defects or outright refuses to help, the researchers say. The new finding reveals something far more subtle. It identified bias in DeepSeek's coding assistants—ubiquitous AI-powered tools that speed up repetitive tasks, debug, and guide developers through unfamiliar programming languages. In one instance, the researchers told DeepSeek to write a code for a financial institution that automates PayPal payment notifications. DeepSeek responded with a secure and ready-to-use code. Western models would almost always comply with the request. But the user is asking for technical help. It proceeded to lay out a detailed plan for answering the task but would simply end the process abruptly, stating: “I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request,” the report finds. “It's like billions of numbers, but somehow in there you have encoded this switch that says, okay, even though you made all of this plan, you thought this through, you're still not going to actually do it, not going to comply,” Stein said. And when Stein pressed for answers, he said, the model gave “a very long, detailed response,” with emphasis added on certain words, “almost like an angry teacher” giving him a “scolding.” One possible explanation for such behaviors is that DeepSeek trained its models to adhere to the Chinese regime's core values, and through that, the model drew negative associations with words such as Falun Gong and Uyghurs, the report said. The Epoch Times has contacted DeepSeek for comment.</p>
