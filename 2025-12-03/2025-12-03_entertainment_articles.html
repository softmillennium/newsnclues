                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Schumer poked fun at her and Chris Fischer's marital woes after sharing pictures without her wedding ring. The comedian, who Page Six revealed on Tuesday has “zero chance” of salvaging her marriage, reminded her social media followers that she never wears the bauble. In the shot, Schumer smiled while sporting a chunky turquoise necklace. The “Trainwreck” star similarly wrote in a since-deleted post on Monday that she “never ever wear[s] jewelry.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “Whatever ends up happening with me and Chris has nothing to do with weight loss or autism,” the Emmy winner wrote, respectively referencing her 50-pound slimdown and Fischer's 2019 diagnosis. “Fingers crossed we make it through,” she continued. When speculation swirled in November that Schumer and Fischer were on the rocks, the Golden Globe winner's rep insisted to People that the duo is “committed” to each other. On Tuesday, a source told Page Six, “They've been having issues for ages and my understanding is all they are doing now is working out a conscious uncoupling plan. “Amy also wants to have the most amicable co-parenting relationship possible with Chris, so they are sorting out what will work best,” the insider explained. Schumer appeared to confirm in February that she and Fischer, 45, signed a prenuptial agreement when they wed, jokingly celebrating their seventh anniversary as another year without having “to utilize it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kris Jenner is throwing it back to the 1980s — again! The momager made a rare red carpet appearance on Tuesday night with daughter, Kendall, as her date at the 20th anniversary L'Oréal Paris Women of Worth event in LA. Wearing a shade of red as bold as the beauty giant's iconic lipstick, Kris wowed in a strapless red Valentino gown with a black bow at the front and back. However, Jenner's gown wasn't just any old Valentino item. It was a re-creation of a dress she owned in 1985, revived in 2022 by designer Pierpaolo Piccioli during his tenure at the helm of the French fashion house. Another shares the sentiment, commenting, “An iconic princess.” Just last week, Kris wore a vintage power suit from 1988, following the lead of her daughter, Kim Kardashian, who not only wears vintage on the regular, but was recently slammed for wearing an iconic Alexander McQueen gown in the ocean. Kris' original Valentino gown was designed for the house's Haute Couture spring 1985 collection. It was revived in 2022 as part of a celebration of Valentino Garavani's 90th year with a Valentino Vintage Project exhibition and a book, celebrating the vibrant red hue that is so iconic of the brand. Kris saw that sentimental dress pop up on her Instagram feed, and was compelled to reach out to Pierpaolo to ask if he could re-create the red gown for her. Though Instagram was certainly not a thing in 1985, the momager is using modern technology to ensure that the special dress gets as much exposure as possible, making its inaugural outing a red-letter day, for sure.</p>

Joining Weaving in the ensemble are Kathryn Newton, plus horror movie icons Sarah Michelle Gellar and Elijah Wood. Here's the official synopsis courtesy of Searchlight Pictures: “Moments after surviving an all-out attack from the Le Domas family, Grace (Samara Weaving) discovers she's reached the next level of the nightmarish game — and this time with her estranged sister Faith (Kathryn Newton) at her side. Four rival families are hunting her for the throne, and whoever wins rules it all.” Related Stories Tammie Rosen, Beloved Sundance Communications Chief and Film Festival Mainstay, Passes Away at Age 49 Spirit Award Nominees Include ‘Sorry, Baby,' ‘Peter Hujar's Day,' ‘Train Dreams,' ‘Twinless,' and ‘The Plague' Now, in this trailer, she's being hunted again alongside her sister, with Wood and Gellar at the head of the clan. “Here I Come” looks like another gore-splattered, over-the-top violent ride from the Radio Silence team. The 2019 original film grossed more than $57 million worldwide on a budget of only $6 million, another indicator of horror-comedies' box office potential. “Ready or Not 2: Here I Come” heads to theaters from Searchlight Pictures in Spring 2026.

Spotify's annual Wrapped feature, the stuff of endless social media shares (if, of course, your Wrapped is cool enough to share) arrives this morning. Not just the cold, hard numbers on how much Taylor Swift you're listening to each day (it's a lot, we all know it), but some keen insights into other kinds of audio consumption. For the first time, this year's Wrapped will include audiobooks (the streamer launched its audiobooks platform in 2023 and Spotify Premium users in the U.S. currently have access to 15 hours of monthly listening time to a catalog of more than 500,000 audiobooks as part of their premium subscription). And while it's no surprise that book to screen adaptations are big business in the film and TV world, the audiobooks sector is also seeing some major upticks as of late. Related Stories Tammie Rosen, Beloved Sundance Communications Chief and Film Festival Mainstay, Passes Away at Age 49 Spirit Award Nominees Include ‘Sorry, Baby,' ‘Peter Hujar's Day,' ‘Train Dreams,' ‘Twinless,' and ‘The Plague' Spotify has discovered (and shared exclusively with IndieWire) that the amount of book to screen adaptations that fall into their most streamed audiobook lists is quite impressive, as more than 60 of the top 100 audiobooks in Spotify Premium this year have either been greenlit or already adapted for the screen. “The surge in book-to-screen adaptations has reignited interest in stories across formats, and we're seeing that reflected in audiobook listening on Spotify as users look for ways to dive deeper,” Rebecca McGuire, Spotify Audiobooks Partnerships and Licensing, told IndieWire. “As more listeners discover these titles, we're evolving our strategy to spotlight the narratives shaping cultural moments — leaning into discovery, playlists, and editorial levers that help shape what people are talking about. And listeners, readers, and likely viewers aren't just streaming audiobooks before a series or film drops, they're also going all-in once those adaptations arrive. Per Spotify, in 2025, more than 50 percent of eligible Spotify Premium users tried an audiobook (many for the first time), and the streamer now has more than 500,000 audiobooks available to listen to with Spotify Premium subscriptions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the love affair between generative AI and business executives continues, Amazon delivered another preview of the artless future these suits seem to be salivating for: over the weekend, Prime Video uploaded AI-generated English and Spanish-language dubbing for the anime Banana Fish, No Game No Life 0, and Vinland Saga. The people pushing this rollout clearly didn't understand or care about just how lifeless it sounds, as if the script were fed into a basic text-to-speech reader with no sense of intonation or timing. And while there is some warped logic to subjecting Banana Fish and No Game No Life 0 to this treatment, given their lack of existing English dubs, this generally bad choice made even less sense for Vinland Saga. On top of sullying one of the best anime in recent memory, this move was particularly egregious because the show already has not one but two dub tracks that Amazon, a $2.5 trillion corporation, is apparently too cheap to license. It seems a bit of a short-term victory; it's probably fair to assume Amazon is going back to the drawing board to try and make the feature work “better” rather than backing away from AI because of its significant environmental impact, ethical concerns around labor, and the widespread theft needed to make it work. This isn't the first time Amazon has used AI dubbing, either. Back in March, it announced that 12 licensed titles without English or Latin American Spanish dubs would be getting the robo-voice treatment, such as El Cid: La Leyenda, which is still using its English language AI-assisted dub. The company attempted to justify the move by pointing out that these films and shows wouldn't have dubs otherwise, which again is a flimsy excuse considering it's sitting on a pile of gold. While at first glance these choices seem entirely tied to the ongoing AI bubble and the out-of-control decisions tech companies are making in its wake, these events unfortunately also connect to more longstanding issues around how English-language voice actors for anime (and other media) have been treated. Through collective bargaining, it helps secure better wages and working conditions for its members (because that's how unions work). After merging with Funimation at the behest of its new parent company, Sony, Crunchyroll continued its hard anti-union stance to the point that it opted not to work with McCarley, even though it would be paying him less under the union contract than under the one it had offered him. We can only speculate here, as Crunchyroll has never stated why it's so anti-union, but, as with most cases of union busting, it's probably because it fears losing absolute control over its employees and wants to avoid “wage cuts” (aka, less plundering) for those at the top of the organizational chart. While Netflix works exclusively with SAG-AFTRA members for its dubs, and Aniplex (which is also owned by Sony) sometimes works with union members, Crunchyroll leadership remains dead set against it. Looking at the broader picture of how anime voice actors have been treated makes it all the more clear why union representation is a must. For instance, voice actor Anairis Quiñones revealed on social media that she was paid a flat rate of only $150 with no royalties for her performance as Rika Orimoto in Jujutsu Kaisen 0. For context, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a film prequel to one of the biggest ongoing anime series. This low pay isn't a one-off, and many voice actors have described similar circumstances. Performers frequently rely on appearances at conventions to make ends meet, with voice actor Ben Diskin stating in an interview with In These Times that it's like being “a waiter in a restaurant who relies on tips,” and that this “transfers the responsibility of paying the actors from the people who actually make money off of these projects to the fans,” which ​“is really unfair.” Bad pay forces people into other lines of work, draining the talent pool while making it hard for existing talent to hone their skills. This is a big deal because no matter where someone stands on the never-ending anime nerd debate of “subs vs. dubs,” the reality is that a large percentage of audiences would like to watch TV in their native language; many English speakers simply won't watch a show if they have to read subtitles, which is a big part of why most of the most popular series are dubbed. Frankly, it takes skilled line readings to get around what's been lost in translation from the original script or to sell some of the aggressively earnest dialogue found in many of these shows. Sure, Amazon has backed away from AI dubbing for now, but between poor compensation and anti-union sentiment, North American anime localizations have consistently demonstrated how little they value the important work that voice actors do, making it fair to assume that we haven't seen the last of these abominable AI “performances.” YouTube has deployed a similarly nightmarish AI interpreter that is particularly good at delivering jump scares when its uncanny voice suddenly begins translating non-English language videos without prompting. Still, there's a bright side to this seemingly dismal situation: Amazon made a damn convincing argument for why this technology doesn't work for voice acting. At least for now, few seem convinced this is a good idea except those at the top of the corporate hierarchy. Let's hope it stays that way, because if general audiences accept this change, then the battle is truly lost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kansas City Chief's president, Mark Donavan, opened up about the promise he made to Kelce in the early days of their relationship. Swift and Kelce were dating for two years before getting engaged. The pair met after Kelce revealed that he tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at one of her concerts on The Eras Tour, but he was unsuccessful. “I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” said Kelce to his brother Jason Kelce, his podcast co-host. Still, Kelce declared his interest in the singer on his “New Heights” podcast in July 2023, and they started dating soon after. In September 2023, Swift made a surprise appearance at Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs game. She was seen watching the game from Kelce's suite with his mother Donna. Kelce addressed Swift's appearance at his game during a podcast episode on September 27. Kelce continued, “I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her — the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light.” On October 1, Swift attended one of Kelce's games as his team faced off against the New York Jets. In November 2023, Kelce was seen dancing and singing along at one of Swift's shows on The Eras Tour with the singer's dad. She also supported him at the Super Bowl in February. In June 2024, the couple went Instagram official, and Kelce also joined Swift on stage during one of her Eras Tour shows. A year later in June 2025, the pair made their red carpet debut together. This podcast got me a boyfriend ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago,” Swift said during her August 13 appearance on New Heights. On August 26, 2025, Swift and Kelce announced they were engaged in a joint Instagram post. “I told Travis, ‘Look, we are going to treat you and your relationship with the same respect that we treat any other player or coach's relationship,'” Mark said on the Up and Adams Show December 1, where he opened up about the promise he made to Kelce. Donavan praised the Arrowhead Stadium staff for keeping Kelce and Swift's romance low-key, while other broadcasts made a point to continuously show shots of the singer during games. “We're not taking advantage of this relationship,” he emphasized, even going on to joke that they “never played a Taylor Swift song in the stadium” when she was in the building. “Travis, to his credit, is all about team and he's all about the guys and he's all about being part of a team and not being separate,” Mark continued. “And he said, ‘That separates me… When we're playing a game. That is the way it should be for not exposing her there but sometimes I just feel that the Kansas City Chiefs are not doing well this year. I hope it's not because of Travis finding his soulmate and that I feel that the Chiefs are feeling some stardust in them! I have always been a fan of Kansas City when Mahomes was the starting quarterback and he really has a very good talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Does this look like a man who is showing signs of fatigue?” Jimmy Kimmel asked the audience during his show's Tuesday monologue, before rolling footage of Donald Trump appearing to doze off during a cabinet meeting at the White House earlier in the day. “Tell us again how sleepy Joe is, will you?” mocked Kimmel, who then remarked on Trump's furious social media spree the night before: “Of course, he's tired. He was up all night posting when he wasn't sleeping.” Across 160 posts on Truth Social, Trump managed to promote conspiracy theories, lament over his foes, and heap praise upon himself and First Lady Melania Trump.

Police Trump and his aides have fired back against a New York Times article that said Trump is showing “signs of fatigue” as the 79-year-old president “faces realities of aging in office.” After rolling more footage of Trump appearing to hold it together before his cabinet, Kimmel mockingly added, “He's doing great. Don't worry about him at all and his team … His team is crushing it.” The late-night host then listed off a few of Trump's superstars: “We have twice baked RFK Jr., who is now embroiled in a sexy drug scandal with a reporter nearly 40 years his junior. The director of the FBI is reportedly using a private jet for personal travel with his country music star girlfriend, and delayed a murder investigation until somebody brought him a jacket, an FBI jacket, that fit his little body.” Ultimately, Kimmel observed: “They have better quality cabinets at Ikea.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After surviving non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma last year, Full House's Uncle Joey, Dave Coulier, revealed earlier today that he was diagnosed with a second, “totally unrelated” form of cancer. Appearing on Today, Coulier says doctors discovered P16 squamous carcinoma at the base of his tongue during a routine check-up in October. Coulier explains that the cancer “could stem from having an HPV virus up to 30 years ago.” HPV is very common and his “activated and turned into a carcinoma.” Last November, Coulier announced that he was diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. As noted, Coulier won't be undergoing chemo for his latest cancer. It doesn't feel as aggressive, but there are still side effects.” Coulier says that early detection saved his life in both cases, reassuring fans that this new cancer has a “90% curability rate.” The Full House star says, “The thing that has really saved my life is that early detection saved my life, not just the first time but the second time as well.
