The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office said it arrested three teenagers on Nov. 23 after they participated in a "door kick challenge" that is circulating on social media. A viral TikTok trend, known as the "door kick challenge" or "door knock challenge," led to the arrests of three Florida teenagers. According to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office (SJSO), the teens were arrested on Nov. 23 for loitering and prowling. The footage captured the homeowner calling police to report that someone was "attempting to kick their door in." In 911 call audio, the homeowner told police that the individuals did not appear to have weapons, but her husband had his weapon "in his hand in case they come back." On Nov. 23, 2025, three teenagers were arrested by the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office (SJSO) after allegedly participating in the "door kick challenge." Deputies responded to the property and located three teenagers dressed in dark clothing and gloves, hiding near the victims' home. one deputy was heard asking the three teens. A deputy was then heard asking the teens if they wanted to "catch a felony today." "What the hell are you guys doing out here acting like this?" "Just being stupid," one teen responded. "You guys want to get shot by a homeowner when you're kicking their front door, and they think you're breaking in to kill them?" an officer was recorded asking the teens in body camera footage. They don't even go to prison, and you're six feet under." The teens were charged with loitering and prowling; one also faces a charge of criminal mischief for damaging the door. "This ‘challenge' is not a harmless prank. Participating in this criminal act has serious and possibly life-changing consequences," the department said. "Parents and guardians – please talk to your children and teenagers about the dangers of this behavior," they said. "SJSO will not tolerate any participation in these challenges. We are prepared to arrest and charge individuals involved, regardless of age." When deputies arrived, they found the teens — two 14-year-olds and one 13-year-old — dressed in dark clothes and gloves, hiding nearby. The "door kick challenge" has spread on social media, with participants – mostly teenagers – aggressively banging on random residential doors, often at night, then running away. Though reminiscent of the traditional "ding-dong ditch" prank, this challenge has escalated to significant property damage and caused police departments across the country to warn teens of the potentially dangerous consequences.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) A deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky stemmed from from corporate choices that favored profits over safety, according to a lawyer who filed two wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday, which allege the company kept flying older aircraft without increasing maintenance beyond what's regularly scheduled. Both UPS and GE said they don't comment on pending lawsuits and that safety is a top priority as they assist the federal investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded all MD-11s, which have been exclusively hauling cargo for more than a decade. Three pilots and 11 people on the ground were killed on Nov. 4 when the plane, fully loaded with fuel for a flight to Hawaii, plowed into businesses just outside the airport in Louisville, where UPS has its largest package delivery hub. Clifford said UPS was saving money and aircraft downtime by keeping “old, tired” planes in the air while not increasing the number of inspections. Fellow attorney Bradley Cosgrove said at a news conference that they believe inspections should have found the cracks cited by federal investigators, adding, “This plane should have never been in the air.” The lawsuits filed in state court are on behalf of the families of Angela Anderson, 45, who was shopping at a business by the airport, and Trinadette “Trina” Chavez, 37, who was working at Grade A Auto Parts. “We intend to stand up for ‘Nena' and fight for her, no matter how long it takes, just like Nena always did for us,” said Chavez's sister, Gabriela Hermosillo-Nunez, calling her by another nickname that her eight younger brothers and sisters used. The two companies did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment. The jet that crashed had just finished more than six weeks of extensive maintenance, completed Oct. 18, in which VT San Antonio Aerospace crews repaired significant structural issues, according to the lawsuits. The engine mount hadn't undergone a detailed inspection since 2021, and the plane wasn't due for another detailed inspection of that part for another 7,000 takeoffs and landings. After the crash, federal investigators grounded all 109 of the remaining MD-11s used by UPS, FedEx and Western Global for inspections and repairs, but the FAA hasn't said what will be required. If massive repairs or overhauls are ordered, experts said package delivery companies may find replacing them the better option. UPS was named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit filed last month accusing it of negligence and wanton conduct. Associated Press writer Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Changes by the Trump administration have left US diplomats demoralized and less able to do their jobs, according to a scathing new report by the union representing foreign service officers. Twenty-five percent of the foreign service has “resigned, retired, seen their agencies dismantled, or been removed from their posts” since January, the report said, and more are considering leaving. More than 240 foreign service officers were given termination notices in July, to take effect later in the year, as part of the State Department's drastic reorganization. “The U.S. Foreign Service is being systematically undermined by its own leadership,” AFSA President John Dinkelman warned in the report, which is set to be released on Wednesday afternoon. “The Foreign Service—the very institution tasked with navigating our global interests—is being dismantled in real time.” Rubio hails end of USAID as study says its elimination could contribute to 14 million deaths in next 5 years More than 2,100 AFSA members responded to the survey, which was conducted between August and September of this year. Just 1% of respondents reported any improvement, the report said. Most said that “key projects and initiatives are being delayed or suspended” and that they “are managing significantly heavier workloads due to staffing losses.” Forty-six percent “report new obstacles in negotiating with foreign counterparts” due to the changes implemented by the administration. In remarks on his first day as secretary, he said he wanted the State Department to be “at the core of how we formulate foreign policy, because we're going to have the best ideas of any agency, and because we're going to execute it better and faster and more effectively than any other agency in our government.” However, in the months since, many have felt the expertise of the career foreign service has been largely overlooked as President Donald Trump has mainly turned to a small team of business associates and personal allies to conduct foreign policy. State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Rubio “values candid insights from patriotic Americans who have chosen to serve their country.” He said that the use of special envoys is not new, and “those complaining are either unable or unwilling to find a way to be productive or contribute.” Many diplomats who spoke to CNN have expressed fears of reprisal. Morale has plummeted in the wake of the State Department's reorganization, during which 246 foreign service officers and more than 1,000 civil service officers were given reduction-in-force notices. But on the day that those terminations were supposed to be finalized, affected diplomats were told the State Department was extending administrative leave. This week, they received emails saying firings would be finalized on December 5. AFSA said that this is illegal under the continuing resolution to fund the government, which says that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the federal government” while it is in effect. “Legal opinions published by both OMB and DOJ confirm that outcome.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi breaks down the attack on two National Guardsmen and other key security concerns on ‘Hannity.' Late last month, when former Afghan commando fighter Rahmanullah Lakanwal vanished without warning from his home in Bellingham, Wash., his wife, Khamila, called his phone, trying to learn where he had gone, according to people familiar with the matter. she asked in one call, speaking in their native language of Pashto, according to people briefed on the communications. He told her, "I'm busy with some friends." He continued, "I'm doing Tabligh," according to sources. To his wife, the word "Tablighi" had immediate meaning, family contacts said, setting off alarm bells that she shared with Lakanwal's older brother, Ismail Khosti. In Afghanistan, surnames may vary among family members as they choose different tribal or geographical affiliations. The family is from Lakan district in Khost province. Undated file photo of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect in the shooting of  two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., November 26, 2025. Tablighi is an Arabic word that means to "inform" or "convey" and it refers today to Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic missionary movement established in 1926 in British India as a revivalist wing of the strict Deobandi religious school of thought that today fuels the tyrannical interpretation of Islam practiced by the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani militant groups. Much like its sister group, the Muslim Brotherhood, established in 1928, and other Muslim groups preaching the extremist Wahhabi and Salafi interpretations of Islam, counterterrorism experts say it acts like a conveyor belt to extremism. Tablighi Jamaat's Muslim devotees offer Friday prayers along a road in Dhaka on Nov. 15, 2024. It denounces terrorism publicly, but a report, "Tablighi Jamaat and Its Role in the Global Jihad," by Brussels-based think tank the South Asia Democratic Forum warned the group serves as a "catalyst, gateway, springboard or antechamber" for Islamic radicalization. Several Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran, have banned Tabligi Jamaat, along with Russia, which disbanded a terror cell in 2020. In 2021, Saudi Arabia called the group a "danger to society." Fox New Digital has learned that Lakanwal's brother has shared details from the phone calls, previously unreported, with FBI agents. Now, FBI and Department of Homeland Security investigators are scouring the country to see if anyone tied to the Tablighi Jamaat network radicalized Lakanwal, facilitated his cross-country trip or offered assistance, encouragement or financial support for his Thanksgiving eve ambush of West Virginia National Guard service members Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, as they quietly patrolled 17th Street NW, near the White House. On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem hinted at this new information, saying on NBC's "Meet the Press," "We believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country. We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state." Amid reports that Lakanwal was isolated, depressed and psychologically distressed, counterterrorism experts said the new details add a critical dimension to the investigation,  noting that untreated trauma, isolation and grievances can create psychological conditions for extremist ideology to gain a foothold, creating "wound collectors," a term that retired FBI special agent Joe Navarro coined to describe extremists, from Usama bin Laden to "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski, who use perceived injustices to justify violence with "no statute of limitations on their suffering." While Tablighi Jamaat's leaders say their movement is apolitical, focused on dawah, an Arabic word for evangelizing or proselytizing, counterterrorism experts have said the movement's insular missionary culture has appeared along the early radicalization paths of some extremists, including "American Taliban" John Walker Lindh, a convert to Islam who attended Tablighi Jamaat retreats in northern California in the 1990s, including at the Santa Clara County fairgrounds. After U.S. forces dropped bombs in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, CIA paramilitary officers captured Lindh in a prison near Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, among imprisoned Taliban militants who revolted, overpowering guards and killing CIA paramilitary officer Mike Spann, the first U.S. casualty of the war. Convicted in 2002 for serving as a soldier for the Taliban, Lindh was freed from jail in 2019 and is free on probation in the U.S. today, tracked by the FBI. John Walker Lindh, an American Taliban member who was captured by United States forces as an enemy combatant during the United States' invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001. While the Trump administration issued an executive order last month to designate some of Muslim Brotherhood's chapters as terrorist organizations, Tabligi Jamaat hasn't been on its radar for action. While these Afghan fighters battled extremist interpretations of Islam in Afghanistan over the past 24 years, following the 9/11 attacks, counterterrorism experts note that organizations and mosques established by followers of the Muslim Brotherhood and Tablighi Jamaat have spread worldwide. Tablighi Jamaat representatives in Pakistan and India didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. The irony is not lost on Lakanwal's brother, Khosti, a former company commander in NDS-03, known as the Kandahar Strike Force, where his brother worked as a paramilitary officer, former colleagues said. Literally translated, Lakanwal's brother said, "This was a wrong action," using the Pashto word ghalat to describe something that is wrong to do. He told his former colleagues, "I am ashamed of this action," using the word sharmezham, a derivative of the Pashto word for shame, a powerful dynamic in the honor culture of Pashtunwali in which many of the men grew up. "It's a serious question how Rahmanullah Lakanwal became radicalized in the United States," Alizai said. I was overall commander of the Afghan armed forces. We must get to the bottom of this because we cannot allow this kind of violence in America or anywhere. We fought Islamic extremism every day against the Taliban. It is our duty as Afghans to help America get justice." It's understood Lakanwal's wife has since moved with her five sons into the home of her brother-in-law and sister-in-law in the San Diego area. Countering social media rumors, Lakanwal's brother also told former colleagues that his only other brother, Mohammed Rasul Khan, is not working for the terrorist Haqqani network and died of a heart attack in 2021 in Dubai. A makeshift memorial of flags, flowers and other items is seen Saturday, Nov. 29, 2025, outside of the Farragut West Station, near the site where two National Guard members were shot in Washington. Now, as federal investigators zero in on Lakanwal's final words to his wife about being with the "Tablighi," they are examining his life in the U.S. over the past four years. In recent days, media reports have pointed to two emails shared by a volunteer caseworker working with Laknawal to highlight possible psychological issues Lakanwal might have faced, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. After receiving the two emails from the case worker, Shawn VanDiver, president of a nonprofit, Afghan Evac, said he shared them with journalists to highlight unmet needs among Afghan military and intelligence veterans who worked beside U.S. forces. The emails, shared with Fox News Digital on condition they not be published fully, reveal something else: eight references to "manic" road trips and periods when Lakanwal vanished for days with little communication. While investigators haven't yet established a direct link between the travel and any religious activity, analysts note that Tablighi work requires men to take small-group mission trips, called khuruj, lasting from a few days to several months, to mosques and communities. By March 2023, a volunteer case manager wrote in the emails that Lakanwal had lost his job, and he started engaging in "reckless travel," "manic" bursts, where "he will take off in the family car and drive non stop to A. Chicago B. Arizona this time." In an email on Jan. 11, 2024, she lamented, "My Afghan families, now in WA almost two vears are not thriving." She added, "No matter how many Pashto interpreters we use, and interventions, they are steering their families in ways that in the USA will lead to catastrophe.' She noted, "They have 3 of us White, American women volunteers trying to patch benefits together and chase [Department of Social and Human Services] requirements and English classes that none of them attend." Overwhelmed, she wondered, "Perhaps is there a Pashto speaking Afghan male leader or advisor or resource that we can bring to these men to help them collectively and individually make better choices for their families ?" By Jan. 31, 2024, the caseworker wrote a series of bullet points, including this: "He drives day and night, and sends map pins to one of the volunteer sponsors, and we can grab photos from Instagram stories, but no other communication. She continued: "The last time he came home from a trip, (chicago) he demanded that his wife divorce him, (in front of sponsors who witnessed this)." He apparently deployed a Thabligi interpretation of Islam that says husbands can say, "I divorce you," three times to end a marriage. Her last bullet point was: "Right now, since he is off on a manic trip that has taken him from Bellingham to Phoenix to Indianapolis, his wife, Khamila, has been home with the boys in a period of relative stability." Khosti now tells Afghan friends that he wonders how his brother financed the 2,800-mile one-way trip from Bellingham to Washington, D.C., and how he obtained a firearm. He wasn't embarking on life-or-death missions, like he'd been doing beside U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but he was grateful to America for the gift of a new, safe start for his family. He also thought of his daughter, 11, as he focused on the image of Beckstrom, the young woman from West Virginia murdered. Spread across the U.S. at far-flung posts, he was hundreds of miles away from Lakanwal as his former charge had fled his home for secret road trips. He was away from his friends and family. "I'm not a commander anymore in the military, but as a human being, this is my responsibility to uncover what happened to Rahmanullah, for the safety of everyone. For 20 years, we have fought beside Americans like brothers, and Rahmanullah betrayed that friendship. Lakanwal attended the Bellingham Masjid, operated by the Islamic Center of Whatcom County, blocks from his apartment, mosque officials confirmed. In a statement issued on Saturday, mosque officials said Lakanwal was "not an integrated part of our community." For Ismail Royer, this investigation hits home on another level. A convert to Islam, Royer went to Pakistan in the 1990s after embracing an extremist interpretation of Islam and joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. He later pleaded guilty to weapons charges related to violating U.S. neutrality laws and served 14 years in a maximum security prison. While behind bars, he crossed paths with Muslims convicted of terrorism charges, including Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a plane over the Atlantic by lighting explosives in his shoe, and Lindh, the "American Taliban." Working now to counter extremism, Royer said Tablighi Jamaat can serve "as a cover for jihadists" and it can be "a waystation, a stage in the path of someone from irreligious to religious," and then, sometimes, violent extremism. Ismail Royer, 44, program assistant at Center for Islam and Religious Freedom,  group. Alizai, the final commander of Afghan military forces, said he fears that religious fundamentalists stoked Lakanwal's frustrations and urged him to lash out with violence. An easy path would be to shame an Afghan military veteran, he said, by saying, "You worked with the U.S.? After hunting Taliban extremists in Afghanistan with American soldiers, Alizai said he and fellow Afghan veterans, including Lakanwal's brother, his company commander, Selanee, and members of the NDS-03 unit are on a new quest.

Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino also joined 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in and discuss why land targets could be next. Trump threatened to declare the airspace "above and surrounding" Venezuela to be "closed in its entirety," causing Venezuela to cancel the twice-weekly flights of migrants from the U.S. on Saturday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on Tuesday that, at the request of the Trump administration, those flights have now resumed. Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital of Caracas on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday. Venezuela previously had a longstanding policy of not accepting deportation flights from the U.S. but Maduro's regime conceded under pressure from Trump earlier this year. The U.S. has a large military presence off the coast of Venezuela amid ongoing tensions involving President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. U.S. strikes have targeted alleged narco-traffickers operating in the Caribbean near Venezuela. Trump has signaled that operations could expand to land-based targets as Washington increases pressure on Maduro to relinquish power. And we know the routes they take," Trump told reporters during a Cabinet at the White House. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too." Venezuelan migrants repatriated from the US gesture seen upon arrival at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, on April 4, 2025. War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced two additional airstrikes against alleged drug smuggling vessels in international waters on Monday. Trump presented Maduro with an ultimatum during a recent phone call, demanding that he step down or face potential U.S. military action. Maduro sought global amnesty for himself, demanded to retain control of the military and resisted an immediate exit from power, the Miami Herald reported.

(AP Photo/John Amis) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Republican Matt Van Epps won a nationally watched special election in Tennessee for a U.S. House seat Tuesday, maintaining his party's grip on the conservative district with help from President Donald Trump. But the comparatively slim margin of victory fueled Democratic hopes for next year's midterms as the party grasps for a path back to power in Washington. A military veteran and former state general services commissioner from Nashville, Van Epps defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn to represent the 7th Congressional District. With 99% of votes counted, Van Epps' lead was around 9 percentage points. Behn, who ran as an unapologetic progressive, ran up a huge margin in Davidson County, which is the most Democratic county in the district and home to Nashville. But Van Epps carried the rest of the district, including many deep-red counties throughout central Tennessee, as he tied himself tightly to Trump. “No matter what the D.C. insiders or liberal media say, this is President Trump's party. Trump congratulated Van Epps in a social media post, saying he won even though “the Radical Left Democrats threw everything at him.” Democratic Congressional Candidate Aftyn Behn took the stage at her campaign gathering after losing the Tennessee special election to Republican candidate Van Epps. At her own campaign gathering, Behn took the stage with a burst of energy, singing Dolly Parton's “9 to 5” in a western-style rhinestoned suit. She noted that Republicans redrew the district three years ago to make it harder for Democrats to win, and “nobody in Washington believed we could get even this close.” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said Republicans should be “shaking in their boots” ahead of the midterms, which will determine control of Congress. “What happened tonight in Tennessee makes it clear: Democrats are on offense and Republicans are on the ropes,” Martin said in a statement. House Speaker Mike Johnson and national Republican chair Joe Gruters rallied supporters in Tennessee on Monday. “In Tennessee, it's been a long time since we thought about beating Democrats,” Saltsman said. “This time,” he added, “we had to pay attention.” Republican leaders had hoped for a convincing victory to scuttle Democratic claims that even red districts are now in play as Trump struggles with low approval ratings and persistent economic dissatisfaction. Party chair Ken Martin visited to campaign for Behn, and former Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a canvassing kickoff while in Nashville on a book tour. Former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a virtual rally for her Monday night. The seat was vacated when Republican former Rep. Mark Green, retired this summer. Van Epps aligned with the president as closely as possible, telling him during the November tele-rally, “I will have your back 100%.” He won a crowded primary by a wide margin in October with a late endorsement from Trump. But Republicans created a steady drumbeat of Behn's own words used against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” and made harsh remarks about Nashville and its tourist draws.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep.-elect Matt Van Epps (R-TN) won Tuesday night's special election in Tennessee‘s 7th Congressional District, beating Democrat Aftyn Behn by a larger margin than last-minute polling showed. However, there were still significant Democratic gains in the district. Inside Elections shifted its rating for the district from “safe Republican” to “lean Republican” in response to a poll conducted by Emerson College and the Hill that showed 48% of voters supporting Van Epps and 46% supporting Behn. As of Wednesday morning, Van Epps secured the victory by 9 percentage points with almost all votes counted. Van Epps garnered nearly 54% of the votes, compared to Behn's 45%. While the larger-than-expected win is a good sign for Republicans heading into next year's midterm elections, Van Epps underperformed compared to President Donald Trump and former Rep. Mark Green, who both won the district by more than 20 points last year. Furthermore, Democrats made positive gains in every county across the district. That county includes Nashville, a predominantly liberal city in an otherwise red state. “Aftyn Behn's overperformance in this Trump +22 district is historic and a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. “Aftyn centered her campaign on lowering grocery, housing, and health care costs for Tennessee families.” Democrats have become especially confident after winning the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of the 2026 elections, in which all House seats will be up for grabs. “National Republicans were forced to pull out all the stops, spending nearly $4 million and investing in a massive turnout operation, all to salvage their candidate in a district that voted for Trump by 22% last year.”</p>

President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, look on. President Donald Trump closes his eyes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Pete Hegseth barely squeaked through a grueling Senate confirmation process to become secretary of defense earlier this year, facing lawmakers wary of the Fox News Channel host and skeptical of his capacity, temperament and fitness for the job. Just three months later, he quickly became embroiled in Signalgate as he and other top U.S. officials used the popular Signal messaging application to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen. A Pentagon Inspector General's report on the matter was delivered to lawmakers Wednesday. And now, in what may be his most career-defining moment yet, Hegseth is confronting questions about the use of military force and demands he release the videotapes after a special operations team reportedly attacked survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. The scrutiny surrounding Hegseth's brash leadership style is surfacing what has been long-building discontent in Congress over President Donald Trump's choice to helm the U.S. military. And it's posing a potentially existential moment for Hegseth as the congressional committees overseeing the military launch an investigation amid mounting calls from Democratic senators for his resignation. He chided those second-guessing his actions as being part of the problem. During a speech in September, he told an unusual gathering of top military brass whom he had summoned from all corners of the globe to the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia that they should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement.” Somebody needs to be held accountable,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who in January held out support for Hegseth until only moments before casting a crucial vote for his confirmation. “Secretary Talk Show Host may have been experiencing the ‘fog of war,' but that doesn't change the fact that this was an extrajudicial killing amounting to murder or a war crime,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who served 30 years active duty in the Air Force, finishing his career at the rank of brigadier general, said he hasn't been a fan of Hegseth's leadership. “I don't think he was up to the task,” Bacon said. Trump, a Republican, has largely stood by his defense secretary, among the most important Cabinet-level positions. But Hegseth also has strong allies on Capitol Hill, and it remains unclear how much Republicans would actually be willing to push back on the president, especially when they have spent the first year in his administration yielding to his various demands. Vice President JD Vance, who cast a rare tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, has vigorously defended him in the attack. “He's not part of the Washington elite,” said Schmitt, R-Mo. “He's not a think tanker that people thought Trump was going to pick. Tension between some Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon has been rising for months. Capitol Hill has been angered by recent moves to restrict how defense officials communicate with lawmakers and the slow pace of information on Trump's campaign to destroy boats carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela. Schumer repeated his insistence Wednesday that Hegseth “release the full, unedited tapes” of what happened. Republicans have been careful to withhold judgment on the strike until they complete their investigation, but Democrats say that these problems with Hegseth were a long time coming. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, pointed back to Hegseth's tumultuous confirmation hearing, at which issues were raised with his management of nonprofits, as well as allegations of a sexual assault and abuse, and drinking on the job. Hegseth had vowed not to consume alcohol if confirmed. “You don't suddenly change your judgment level or change your character when you get confirmed to be secretary of defense,” Kaine said. “Instead, the things that have been part of your character just become much more dire and existential.” Follow the AP's coverage of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at https://apnews.com/hub/pete-hegseth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of congressional leadership far outperform other lawmakers in picking stocks, according to new research that could boost efforts to curb stock trading on Capitol Hill. It found that lawmakers outperform their peers by a whopping 47% annually after entering leadership. The authors of the study, Shang-Jin Wei of Columbia University and NBER, and Yifan Zhou of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, surmise that congressional leaders are able to garner outsize returns through their sway in Congress and their connections to businesses, which they term, respectively, the political influence channel and the corporate access channel. “The political influence channel is reflected in higher returns when their party controls the chamber, sales of stocks preceding regulatory actions, and purchase of stocks whose firms receiving more government contracts and favorable party support on bills,” the study reads. Meanwhile, the researchers found that the corporate access channel is reflected in trades that “predict subsequent corporate news and greater returns on donor-owned or home-state firms.” Wei pointed out during an interview with the Washington Examiner that another key aspect of the research is that it controls for peer comparisons. Essentially, the research indicates that those making big gains in leadership were basically getting the same returns as their peers before entering into leadership. Wei noted that it is important because the argument could be made that those members in leadership who make outsize returns on trades tend to be smarter or savvier, which could also be why they ended up in leadership to begin with. They did essentially the same as other members of Congress,” Wei said. He said that assuming leadership led to a “tremendous improvement in the trading gains.” Basically, trading on advanced knowledge of regulatory actions or the legislative agenda. Essentially, leadership might gain better access to non-public corporate information, such as potential lawsuits or R&D breakthroughs, that run-of-the-mill members might not be privy to. “While corporations might wish to ingratiate all politicians, there is a cost in sharing non-public information about corporate fundamentals, including the possibility of legal liabilities,” the study reads. “Across the country, from every political background, the American people agree on one thing: Members of Congress should not be enriching themselves with insider trading,” Luna wrote on X. Also this week, a group of dozens of former Republican and Democratic lawmakers urged House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to bring the bipartisan Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would ban congressional stock trading, to a floor vote. “Enacting this critical reform would be a powerful step toward rebuilding that trust, addressing real and perceived conflicts of interest, and demonstrating that members of Congress prioritize the institution's integrity and their commitment to their constituents above personal gain.”</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Court already killed most US campaign finance law. NRSC v. FEC is likely to give big donors even more influence. It is unlikely that any legal argument could persuade the Court's Republican majority to uphold bans on anti-LGBTQ+ conversion therapy, for example, or to preserve the Voting Rights Act. These are issues where Republican judges have wildly divergent views from Democratic jurists. That specter looms particularly large over National Republican Senatorial Committee (“NRSC”) v. FEC, which the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday, December 9. And, given this Court's history in campaign finance cases, it is all but certain that Republicans will win this case. Few issues split the two parties more cleanly than campaign finance regulation. Broadly speaking, the Democratic justices believe that too much money in politics is inherently corrupting, because, as Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a 2014 dissent, “a few large donations” can “drown out the voices of the many.” Under this view, big campaign donations breed a government that is responsive only to a small group of very wealthy donors. As five Republicans concluded in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), money and politics may only be regulated to prevent “‘quid pro quo' corruption,” such as when a donor explicitly promises to donate to a senator's campaign in return for that senator's vote on a particular bill. The specific law at issue in NRSC limits how much party organizations, such as the Democratic or Republican National Committees, may spend in coordination with individual candidates for federal office. In theory, this law might even comply with the rigid limits on campaign finance law that Republican justices imposed in Citizens United. As the Democratic Party argues in a brief defending the law, “an unbroken line of precedent” stretching back to the 1970s “holds that Congress may impose reasonable contribution limits” on donations directly to candidates. And the law at issue in NRSC merely seeks to ensure that these limits aren't easily evaded. So, it is unlikely that the spending limits at issue in NRSC will survive contact with this Supreme Court. The risk of a quid pro quo deal, where a candidate agrees to sell political favors for campaign donations, is particularly high when that donation goes to the candidate's campaign. The idea behind a $3,500 cap on donations directly to federal candidates is that this amount is too low to coax a lawmaker or presidential candidate into such a deal — and thus, the cap prevents quid pro quo corruption. But a cap on donations directly to candidates means little if it can be easily circumvented. The details of how this scheme works are a little complicated. First, the law caps how much donors can give to party committees like the DNC or RNC at $44,300 per year. That cap is not at issue in NRSC. Political parties can spend as much money as they want to try to influence a particular election, but only if that spending is not coordinated with any of the candidates in that race. The amount of this cap varies depending on how many voters may vote in a particular race. In a California US Senate race, they may spend nearly $4 million. About a quarter century ago, in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (2001), the Supreme Court rejected a very similar challenge to an earlier version of these limits on coordinated spending. The Court reasoned that if a party can “make unlimited expenditures coordinated with a candidate,” that would cause donors to “give to the party in order to finance coordinated spending for a favored candidate beyond the contribution limits binding on them.” A donor might give $40,000 to the RNC, for example, knowing full well that this money will be spent on Sen. John Doe's reelection campaign. But a lot has changed since Colorado was decided in 2001. Liberal and moderate Republicans have disappeared from the Supreme Court. And the Court's increasingly hardline Republican majority decided cases like Citizens United and McCutcheon, which cast a cloud of doubt over nearly all campaign finance laws. Under this approach, laws which prohibit donors from buying access to elected officials, or that simply seek to prevent donors from purchasing an official's gratitude, are not allowed unless they fairly narrowly target explicit deals banning dollars for political favors. Indeed, under the GOP justices' vision, influence-buying is an affirmative good. As the Court's Republican majority said in Citizens United: It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. The limits must target arrangements where donors seek to buy specific political favors from elected officials. Given this framework, the best legal argument for the spending caps at issue in NRSC is that they prevent money laundering schemes where a donor who wants to give a large donation to a particular candidate may do so, so long as that money passes first through a party committee. That case struck down a federal law that capped the total amount of money a donor could give to all of a party's various political committees — the idea being that, if a donor could give huge sums to the party, then the party could easily redistribute that money to particular candidates. And, given this Court's hostility to nearly all campaign finance laws since Citizens United, it's hard to imagine the spending caps in NRSC surviving. Indeed, the Roberts Court has made such Swiss cheese out of US campaign finance law that it is unclear whether a decision striking down these caps will really matter. One of the GOP's strongest arguments in favor of its preferred outcome in NRSC is that donors who want to give massive donations to elect a particular candidate can already give as much as they want to a super PAC that supports that candidate, rather than to a party committee. So, they don't really need to launder large donations through parties. Super PACs, which grew out of the Court's decision in Citizens United, may accept unlimited donations and spend unlimited money. The one limit on Super PACs is that they aren't supposed to coordinate this spending with a candidate, but, as the GOP argues in its brief, this limit doesn't really amount to much in practice. Donors frequently “let it be known who they are helping, and in what amounts.” And elected officials can reward the most generous donors with favors or even plum job assignments — just ask Elon Musk.Citizens United and similar cases, in other words, have already turned campaign finance into the Wild West. There really isn't much more the Supreme Court can do to increase the influence of wealthy donors in US politics. His administration is now openly advancing a worldview built by white nationalists in the 2010s. Meanwhile, Texas Republicans want to immunize their gerrymander from constitutional review.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown, prompted by the shooting of two National Guard members, means he has now halted or significantly tightened every legal and illegal form of foreign entry into the US, prompting widespread fear and confusion among immigrants who are unsure what will happen to their pending cases. Trump's mass deportation campaign has garnered attention for its heavy-handed arrest tactics of undocumented immigrants nationwide. But the administration's steady drumbeat of incremental changes to the US immigration system has also been disruptive — gumming up an already-arduous process for millions of people. In the days since two National Guard members were shot in DC, allegedly by an Afghan migrant, the administration has announced a handful of policy shifts, including a pause on asylum decisions, a review of cases under the Biden administration and a “reexamination” of certain green-card holders, that have wide ramifications for immigrants residing in the US. “We're going back on all of these folks that have applied for asylum, people that would be traveling to this country, and looking at more information, what their social media platforms, they may have visited, the communications that they have, biometric information and data that we can collect from them, but also from their government too,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Monday. As part of that push, Noem is recommending that Trump's travel ban list expand to include between 30 to 32 countries, an increase from the current list of 19 countries, according to a source familiar with the matter. US Citizenship and Immigration Services on Tuesday also paused, effective immediately, immigration applications for individuals from the current 19 countries, according to a policy memo. The administration has frequently cited national security concerns to push forward its immigration agenda and roll out restrictions. Trump administration officials and immigration hardliners have argued that doing so is necessary to fix parts of the system that, they say, have been exploited by immigrants coming into the country, or those already residing in the US. “It's hard to predict and advise our clients on how to navigate this system,” said Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. It's hard to give advice when every Friday there's a new announcement from the executive or a tweet with policy changes that are unpredictable,” he added. Some immigration attorneys have advised clients to sit and wait amid the frequent whiplash and fears of being detained at routine check ins or immigration hearings. I think that still holds true,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan thinktank, referring to the executive branch. In the final year of Biden's presidency, his administration implemented restrictions along the US-Mexico border that, Homeland Security officials said, drove down border crossings. But stopping the flow of people, which Trump has repeatedly referred to as an “invasion,” remained a central tenet of his successful presidential campaign, and within hours of being sworn in for his second term, his administration took steps that effectively sought to shutter asylum at the southern border. Trump signed an executive action that declared an emergency at the border, prompting the deployment of additional military personnel to assist with logistical and bureaucratic tasks and finish Trump's long-promised border wall. In March, US Customs and Border Protection awarded the first border wall contract during Trump's second term, giving a construction company more than $70 million to construct about seven miles of barrier in southern Texas. Following the shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington last week, USCIS announced it was halting all asylum decisions until “we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.” There were more than 2.2 million immigrants waiting for asylum decisions or hearings as at end August 2025, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. DHS also said it was reviewing all asylum decisions made during Biden's term following the shooting. The halt means that asylum seekers who might already have waited years for their cases to be resolved now face an even more uncertain future. In 1990, Congress created a temporary protected status program for people fleeing countries enduring natural disasters, wars or other conditions that would make it dangerous for people to return. Seventeen countries were covered by TPS designations as of late March, accounting for about 1.3 million foreign nationals living in the United States who were covered. But the Trump administration has sought to winnow back protections for citizens from several countries. A federal judge later blocked that move after accusing DHS of failing to follow procedures mandated by Congress. The administration has also moved to end TPS status or reverse extensions for Venezuela, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Honduras, Nicaragua and Syria. In November, DHS moved to also end TPS for South Sudan and Burma, both of which have been mired by years of civil war. The Trump administration in October announced it was restricting the number of refugees the United States would admit to 7,500 each year — a miniscule amount for a country that had long been a beacon to millions of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in their home countries and had allowed refugees under programs that enjoyed bipartisan support. The main group being welcomed under Trump is White South Africans. The president and officials within his administration, including his sometime adviser, billionaire South African-born Elon Musk, claim that group is facing persecution, racism, threats and murder in their home country. Both Trump and Musk alleged that White South Africans were being discriminated against due to land reform policies implemented by that country's government which sought to redress the legacy of apartheid, the system under which non-White South Africans were forcibly displaced from their lands in favor of Whites. CNN previously reported the Trump administration is also moving to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the United States under Biden as part of a comprehensive review of their cases. The shooting of guard members in Washington last week also prompted USCIS to announce “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” Green card holders have the ability to live and work permanently in the US but do not enjoy the full benefits of citizenship, including the right to vote or hold an American passport. Asked to clarify which countries were of concern, USCIS pointed CNN toward a presidential proclamation in June that named 19 countries including Cuba, Laos, Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan. Trump signed an executive action imposing a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, which are commonly used by tech companies who say the program is necessary to fill out workers who they cannot find in the United States. One industry that the president seems hesitant to restrict is agriculture, which relies heavily on both legal and undocumented immigrant labor. While the president was taking a hardline stance against undocumented immigration this summer, behind the scenes members of his administration were working to assuage concerns in that industry about the effects of an immigration crackdown, and the president's own tone toward undocumented farm workers has been noticeably softer compared to other sectors. The administration has issued thousands of fewer visas for international students than had been typical during previous years. The administration this year has also targeted the existing visas of thousands of international students, with particular attention on those who were active in campus protests that opposed Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The State Department has revoked about 6,000 student visas this year, and the administration's restrictive stance toward what students studying on visas can post to social media has discouraged others from even applying to study in the United States. Reasons for the visa revocations have ranged from high-profile cases involving allegations of support for terrorist organizations to relatively minor incidents that include years-old misdemeanor crimes. Earlier this year, the administration paid particular attention to visas for Chinese students. The Trump administration moved to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas before later reversing course. In an interview with Fox News last month, the president said he thinks “it's good” to have students from “outside countries” enrolled at American universities — and defended China while attacking France, a close American ally.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Yes, there is a downside to GLP-1 drugs — if you aren't careful. We're used to seeing Serena Williams on our TVs, muscles flexing, smashing a tennis ball past her opponent. “They say GLP-1s for weight loss is a shortcut — it's not. • Patients should be eating a protein-rich, balanced diet and doing some kind of strength training when on an GLP-1 medication. • Some patients taking GLP-1 drugs have experienced significant muscle loss and weakness. • Experts worry that too many patients may be trying to use GLP-1 drugs as a shortcut instead of improving their diet and exercise to lose weight. Here is one of the world's greatest athletes, giving voice — in commercials running during primetime TV, on the Today show, and on social media — to a frustration that many people have felt. That's where the GLP-1 drug came in and delivered results: Williams lost 31 pounds. But there's just one problem with the pitch: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are, in some ways, a shortcut. Scientists have found that some GLP-1 patients can lose significant muscle mass, as well as a loss of functional strength, due to a lack of energy. In searching Reddit communities dedicated to GLP-1 drugs, I found lots of normal people whose experience backed up that research: They had long tried to lose weight but could never quite meet their goals — until they went on a GLP-1 drug. There are dozens of posts of GLP-1 patients coming to their peers, asking for advice about workouts they could do to stem the muscle loss. These drugs are already wildly popular, and their use is likely to keep growing. In November, the Trump administration struck deals with Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cash price of their drugs in exchange for expanded Medicare coverage. Those price changes, which will begin to take effect next year, could further grow the number of Americans taking these medications, including among seniors for whom any loss of muscle mass is a serious health concern. One quarter of GLP-1 prescriptions dispensed in 2024 were for people older than 65. Falls are already one of the most potent killers of older adults; more than 40,000 Americans over 65 died from falls in 2023, and the death rate has tripled since 1990. If more patients start taking semaglutide for its effects on cognition, for example, and fail to eat and exercise properly, they could experience malnourishment and significant muscle loss; both could put their long-term health at risk. That doesn't mean GLP-1 drugs are a bad deal for public health. On the population level, obesity is associated with a host of major ills, and Americans have long been desperate to lose weight. The class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and now countless others — Zepbound, compound GLP-1s, etc. — are the most impressive weight-loss tools we've ever seen. They work because they slow digestion and tell your brain you're full, which makes it easier for people to eat less. While these treatments are still fairly new, observational studies have found that patients who stay on these drugs for a year or more can lose 10 percent of their body weight on average. And on the population level, obesity rates are already starting to decline. Scientists are also discovering that these drugs have amazing potential to treat a breadth of issues: from addressing substance-abuse disorders, lowering your risk for heart disease, and even potentially preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have found that taking a GLP-1 like Wegovy or Ozempic is even associated with lower cancer deaths. GLP-1 drugs may be magical when it comes to weight loss, but they are not magic pills. Which means that along with the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1s is a coming reckoning over America's shortcut culture. Plenty of athletes who are not world-famous see the same appeal in GLP-1 drugs that Serena Williams did. A self-identified weight lifter, CrossFit enthusiast, and horse rider, who I'll call Sam, shared their experience on Reddit. ”I'm happy with the results,” they said — before getting to a pretty big caveat for somebody who's always had an active life. “I actually feel less firm, more wobbly and flabby. “Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?” I recently found out a family member of my own had started taking them, and they're not the kind of person who's susceptible to diet fads either. It would be wonderful if GLP-1 drugs could cure Alzheimer's, but we probably need to think through the trade-offs. And I started to pick up from other reporting and social media feeds I follow that some people were experiencing this unexpected muscle loss. The internet is filled with examples just like this. “Anyone else having a hard time working out on Wegovy?” asked one Reddit poster last year. They even felt their arms were weaker while bowling. Another person realized something was wrong when they could no longer do yard work around the house. Other people have noticed leg weakness after light walking or climbing the stairs: “I actually struggle to go up a staircase and I'm only 32,” said one GLP-1 patient. “I know a lot of people are working out, and I do need to begin exercising on top of the wegovy, but I'm just wondering if anyone else is experiencing extreme weakness or if it's just me and my un-toned self,” they asked. Sam's post in particular had a lot of comments, with one respondent even urging the patient to reconsider: You are “a strong, capable goddess. In response, Sam laid out the dilemma that so many people who have sought to lose weight over the years face: “Unfortunately, some of us just do NOT lose weight with diet and exercise.” It's true: Weight loss is not assured from diet and exercise. Some people have a genetic disposition to becoming obese. Still, the realization that obesity is a disease to be treated, rather than a personal failure that can only be remedied through personal growth, has been important in reducing the prejudices that overweight people have long faced. But at the same time, it is a slippery slope from acknowledging diet and exercise may not be sufficient on their own to thinking a drug like Ozempic can make them unnecessary. Some people, like Sam, have always exercised and viewed GLP-1s as an extra push to help them reach their weight goals. But I also encountered other people who did not necessarily have healthy habits before but were able with the drugs to cut weight for the first time. One patient on Reddit acknowledged that they don't work out and they don't adhere to a particular diet. When one group of researchers evaluated the type of body mass that patients on semaglutide drugs were losing, they found that about 40 percent was important muscle. People, including those who are not overweight, may take them preventively to stave off cardiovascular disease or dementia. For them, people who are already at a healthy weight, muscle loss is an even more serious concern. The last thing we want is more seniors suffering catastrophic injuries during a fall because of lost muscle mass. In their research on mice, they found less muscle mass loss than expected. Instead, after taking a GLP-1, mice were losing their functional strength — how much they could lift or move around — even when muscle size stayed the same. In other words, the mice appeared weaker even though their muscle mass hadn't changed. “Strength is not just a factor of how much muscle you have, but whether you can move that muscle effectively. There's an energetic component to it,” lead author Katsu Funai told me. The animals on a GLP-1 drug may have had less energy because they were eating less — and therefore they wouldn't be able to exert as much force with their muscles. The findings could inform how we prescribe Ozempic, Funai said: Smaller doses might help to mitigate the loss of functional strength. In the excitement over Ozempic, and the potential to lose a lot of weight and fast, people seem to have forgotten a fundamental truth about weight loss: “More is not necessarily better,” Funai said. Before GLP-1 drugs existed at all, dieticians urged their patients to pace weight loss — no more than 1-2 pounds per week — for exactly this reason: You don't want to end up malnourished and weakened. With a conventional diet, that can often lead to you eating more, which in turn eliminates the weight loss. “With these GLP-1s, that conversation [about diet and exercise] has been sidelined,” Funai said. “There are nuances to these things that I think are being missed not just from the public, but also from scientists,” Ironically, the very problem that GLP-1s were meant to overcome — that many Americans simply struggle to eat right and exercise enough — remains just as central even with the drugs. And many of the people taking GLP-1s are starting at a disadvantage: Only 49 percent of Americans say they are extremely or very confident that they know what a healthy diet looks like, and about twice as many say they should get more exercise. If your sole goal is to lose weight, a GLP-1 alone could get you there — but not in the healthiest way. “If you don't change your behavior, if you don't change your habits, you may be looking good, you may be losing weight, but metabolically, your body is in turmoil,” said Nayan Patel, a pharmacist who works with patients taking the drugs. “We've got to use these drugs in the right manner.” A high-protein diet delivering a lot of amino acids is important, Patel said: Eggs, nuts, lentils, poultry, and fish are all good sources. You can cut down on the carbs and sugars; your body won't need them to produce energy because you'll be cutting fat. Eating protein and strength training allows your body to be more effective at trimming the fat, without compromising your core strength. Like anything hard but worth doing, there's a lot to overcome. Many Americans have become intimidated by gym culture, so they might prefer to work out in privacy, at home — but they don't know how. One person I encountered posted online to crowdsource advice on home equipment and routines. The advice included some very approachable strategies — something as simple as sitting in a chair with your legs outstretched and using your abdominal muscles to lift them from side to side over a water bottle. Health care providers have developed general recommendations for patients taking a GLP-1 drug: Mass General, for example, advises a mixture of 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise — activities like walking or riding a bike — or about 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise like jogging or swimming laps in addition to two days of weight training and a steady dose of stretching and flexibility workouts. While I found plenty of people concerned with unexpected muscle loss, there were also examples of patients proudly showing off their lean and muscular new physiques.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas has emerged as one of the top battlegrounds for the midterm elections, both in its push for redistricting and as incumbent Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) fends off one of the most serious primary threats of his career. The redistricting effort aims to create 30 Republican-friendly congressional seats, compared to just eight districts favoring Democrats, resulting in a five-seat boost for the GOP from its current 25-13 advantage. While Democrats hope this effort backfires on the party, Republicans remain confident that their proposed map is constitutional and will be upheld in their uphill battle to keep the majority in 2026. “What is remarkable is how redistricting could play out, which is that it could actually backfire on Republicans, because it's based on one cycle's assumptions, so the idea that you're going to go and lock legislative seats in based on the results of one election cycle may not be the genius move that it was proposed to be,” Democratic strategist Jon Reinish told the Washington Examiner. States usually begin the redistricting effort every 10 years, meaning Texas was not expected to until 2030, but this rare move has sparked movement across the country. “Do I think Texas shifting its balance so that we get five additional seats, so the percentage is even fractionally closer to the absurdity of New England, Illinois, California, do I think that's somehow problematic? No, I don't,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told the Washington Examiner. “Do I think we will sustain the constitutional scrutiny on it? “The Court of Appeals did not do as other courts have done,” he said. Democrats have been reevaluating their plans for the districts that would draw current members out of office. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) has reportedly been considering a Senate bid if the proposed Texas redistricting map is allowed to stand. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), who has represented the Austin area since 1995, preemptively announced that he would retire earlier this year, though that decision is in doubt due to the uncertainty. “To borrow from Mark Twain, the reports of my death, politically, are greatly exaggerated,” Doggett said in a statement following the lower court decision. “This federal court order means that I have a renewed opportunity to continue serving the only town I have ever called home, as democracy faces greater challenges than at any point in my lifetime.” Texas members are not the only ones scrambling to finalize their reelection plans. Punchbowl News reported that Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) is planning to run in Texas after Proposition 50 passed in his home state of California last month, which redraws the map to remove five Republicans in response to the Texas redistricting effort. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) garnered a massive victory last month after he led an expensive campaign leading up to the 2025 elections to pass Proposition 50, a measure that allows the state to counter Texas's map by drawing out five Republicans in the state. Other states, such as Utah, Florida, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, and Illinois, are actively discussing redistricting possibilities. Missouri and North Carolina have successfully passed new maps in response.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olivier wants to challenge an ordinance in federal court that was enacted by a suburban Mississippi city that bars people from protesting outside an amphitheater. But before he can advance his lawsuit, he must deal with a 1994 Supreme Court precedent that is intended to bar people convicted of a crime from using civil lawsuits to effectively reverse their convictions. Though the justices asked difficult questions of both sides during oral arguments on Wednesday, Olivier seemed likely to eke out a limited win that would allow him to continue his fight. Officials from the city of Brandon asserted that Olivier was part of a group that used a loudspeaker to call people “whores,” “Jezebels” and “sissies” as they tried to enter an amphitheater to attend concerts and other events. His problem is that he was already convicted under the ordinance. And rather than raise his First Amendment claims during his criminal case, Olivier filed a subsequent civil suit seeking to hold the ordinance unconstitutional. The 1994 precedent bars people convicted of crimes from using certain civil suits as an indirect way of challenging those previous convictions. Several justices – both conservative and liberal – openly wrestled with the broad language of that precedent on the one hand, and the idea of blocking a person from challenging a possibly unconstitutional law just because they had once been convicted of that law, possibly decades ago. “What you're basically saying is, simply because they've been previously convicted, they cannot seek prospective relief 20 years from now,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court's liberal wing, told the attorney for the city. Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, suggested it might be a “stretch” to interpret the 1994 decision in Heck v. Humphrey as meaning that a person is “forever barred from engaging in what you think is protected First Amendment activity because you were previously convicted under this statute and received, more or less, a slap on the wrist.” The arguments turned almost entirely on how to interpret that precedent, written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, which was intended to block people convicted of a crime from filing a civil suit against police or other officials that would, if successful, effectively let them invalidate their conviction. If a court reviewing that civil suit found an underlying law unconstitutional, people guilty of violating it would almost certainly seek to toss their conviction. Alito was a particularly interesting questioner during the arguments, which lasted just under 90 minutes. Though at times he seemed sympathetic to Olivier's position, he posed tough questions to his attorney as well about the precedent. “In order for you to win, would it not be necessary for us to backtrack on a number of things that the court said in Heck?” Alito asked at one point. “How,” he asked, could Olivier's position “be consistent with that?” Local governments fear Olivier's position will create new legal challenges to parade permitting requirements, zoning rules for adult businesses and regulations around homeless encampments. Supreme Court flicks at First Amendment concerns with state's subpoena of faith-based pregnancy centers The conservative 6-3 Supreme Court has repeatedly sided with religious claims in recent years, although Olivier's case at this point is not directly about the First Amendment. There has also been a thorny debate percolating over the extent to which Americans can sue officials under a civil rights law Olivier is relying on for his case, a dispute that came into sharper view in an unrelated case earlier this year. Olivier is represented in part by First Liberty Institute, a group that has brought several successful religious appeals to the Supreme Court in recent years. The group sometimes held large signs depicting aborted fetuses, it said. Concertgoers would walk into traffic to avoid the group. Olivier declined, according to court records, and was arrested for violating the ordinance. Another theme that several justices raised is what would happen if a third party – say, another person in Olivier's group, who had not been convicted of violating the law – brought a civil suit challenging the same law. “And no one is suggesting that he couldn't get a pre-enforcement challenge.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A private Chinese space firm successfully sent its Zhuque-3 rocket to orbit but failed in its historic attempt to re-land the rocket booster Wednesday – the first such trial by a Chinese firm as the country's growing commercial space sector races to catch up with American rivals like SpaceX. Beijing-based LandSpace, one of the sector's leading firms, launched its Zhuque-3 rocket into space from a remote, desert launch site in northwestern China. Even though unsuccessful, the trial has placed the company at the head of a pack of Chinese firms vying to develop reusable rocket technology within a growing commercial space sector that Beijing hopes will power its competition with global rivals and help transform the country into a “strong aerospace nation.” Reusable rockets are seen as key, because the technology can significantly lower the cost and turn-around time of rocket launches – a distinct advantage as global firms race to build out satellite networks and eye a future space travel industry. Reusable rockets form the backbone of the success of Elon Musk's firm SpaceX, which hashed out how to land and reuse rocket boosters nearly a decade ago and now dominates the global launch market. SpaceX also did not succeed in its first attempts. LandSpace's Wednesday attempt was an “impressive” feat that appeared to be upwards of “90% successful,” according to space expert Blaine Curcio, founder of Orbital Gateway Consulting. LandSpace's ambitions have been closely watched by competitors at home and abroad, with Musk commenting on the Zhuque-3 launch preparations in recent months. But he also predicted it would take the company “over 5 years to reach Falcon 9 levels of reliability and production/launch rate.” By that time “SpaceX will have transitioned to Starship and be doing over 100 times the annual payload to orbit of Falcon,” he added. China and Russia are in a counterspace race to disrupt it Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed, remains under development but is meant to be “fully reusable” – meaning SpaceX intends to also return and reuse the upper stage of the rocket, which has never been done before. In an interview with Chinese state media in 2023, LandSpace founder and CEO Zhang Changwu acknowledged that China's commercial rocket development “still lags behind SpaceX,” but if the company continues in the “right development direction” they would “one day be able to match SpaceX's capabilities.” Zhang also told state media last year that from 2026 the firm would begin undertaking spacecraft launch missions for China's Tiangong Space Station. That would be a first in terms of commercial spaceflight supporting national missions – and make having a reusable system even more critical. The firm has already marked other major successes, including the world's first successful orbital launch of its Zhuque-2 methane-liquid oxygen rocket in 2023, beating international rivals also developing rockets with what's seen as a cleaner-burning and more efficient fuel. (SpaceX's Starship is also powered by methane, but the vehicle so far has only flown suborbital test flights.) LandSpace is among a handful of Chinese firms that are developing reusable rocket technology. Commercial firms – with Beijing's blessing – have become an increasingly important part of China's space innovation, mirroring a model that's seen success in the US. Over the past decade, multiple private firms have conducted orbital launch missions, and several developers have conducted initial land tests of reusable rocket technology. “From 2015 up to this year 2025, exactly 10 years, China's commercial space sector has essentially gone from nothing to a new critical point,” Liu Yuzhang, director of Taibo Research Institute, a Chinese think tank focusing on aerospace industries, told CNN. On Monday, the country's space authority announced that it had established a new internal department to oversee and develop its commercial space sector. And last week it rolled out a two-year action plan to integrate the country's commercial space sector into the national space development strategy. But while the sector appears poised for more rapid advancement, those watching closely say much work remains, and failure is part of the process. Even when there is failure, “there is the mindset of returning to zero and continuing rapid, ongoing iteration,” Liu told CNN ahead of the launch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Border czar Tom Homan said a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel would soon be coming to Minnesota‘s Twin Cities after a bombshell Somali fraud investigation. … I don't want to give up operations, but I can tell you that Secretary Noem is all over it,” Homan responded when asked about when the ICE surge would come. He brings all the government to these operations. So, if we arrest an alien with drugs, you got the DEA right there, who can prosecute the case before we deport them. If you get them with a gun, you get ATF right there, and prosecute the case before we deport them. Homan stressed again that he couldn't give exact dates, but hinted that some personnel were already on the ground. “I can tell you, the focus is there. It's coming, but I don't want to give a lot. I can't tell you how many people are on the ground now, and how many people are going to be on the ground. I'll leave that to the secretary of homeland security, but focus is on those Twin Cities more because of the criminal activities there that've been uncovered by DOJ and DHS,” he concluded. Trump has set his sights on illegal Somali immigrants in Minnesota after a bombshell report from City Journal regarding widespread fraud by the Somali community, fraud that allegedly involved the funneling of government funds to the Somali terrorist group Al Shabaab. “And when you look at what he's done with Somalia, with Somalia, which is barely a country, you know … they have nothing. For years, I've watched her complain about our Constitution.” At a Tuesday press conference outlining how the city would respond to the operation, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara called on locals to call 911 on anyone wearing a mask trying to detain individuals. ICE and other immigration enforcement officers are known to wear masks to protect themselves and family members against harassment. “So if there is anything that is, you know, a violation of someone's human rights or civil rights, excessive force or anything like that, they absolutely have a duty to intervene as police officers,” O'Hara concluded. Homan was livid over O'Hara's comments, calling on the police chief to resign during his Fox News appearance. I mean, your number one responsibility is the safety and security of your communities, and ICE is targeting criminals. He ought to put his badge in the desk drawer and walk away,” he said, adding that O'Hara had stopped being a cop and had become a politician. He then threatened O'Hara with prosecution if local law enforcement tried to impede ICE operations. “If he wants to watch, stand aside, do it. But if you cross that line, Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorneys are waiting to prosecute anybody that impedes law enforcement … doing their job. Zero tolerance for impeding ICE in their operations,” Homan said.</p>

Texas Tech University System Chancellor Brandon Creighton enacted new restrictions on topics of race, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms, and instructors who fail to comply could face discipline. "Promotion" was defined in the memo as "presenting these beliefs as correct or required and pressuring students to affirm them, rather than analyzing or critiquing them as one viewpoint among others." The memo includes a flowchart outlining a new approval process for any course content that includes the restricted topics. Faculty must submit the content to department chairs, university administrators and the Board of Regents for their review and approval. Texas Tech University System Chancellor Brandon Creighton enacted new restrictions on topics of race, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms. Instructors are told to first determine whether the material is relevant and necessary. If the material is not required for those purposes, instructors must seek approval to keep it by submitting it to their department chair, dean and provost, who will forward their recommendation and justification to the Board of Regents. Creighton said in a news release that the new rules aim to offer "clarity, consistency and guardrails that protect academic excellence." The memo states that "the integrity of this process depends on the earnest participation of every faculty member," adding that noncompliance "may result in disciplinary action consistent with university policies and state law." Kelli Cargile Cook, a professor emeritus who founded Texas Tech's Department of Professional Communication, said the memo led her to remove a class she planned to teach this spring, instead deciding to write a resignation letter. "I've been teaching since 1981 and this was going to be my last class. I was so looking forward to working with the seniors in our major, but I can't stomach what's going on at Texas Tech," she told The Associated Press. "I think the memo is cunning in that the beliefs that it lists are at face value, something you could agree with. But when you think about how this would be put into practice, where a Board of Regents approves a curriculum — people who are politically appointed, not educated, not researchers — that move is a slippery slope." Faculty must submit the content to department chairs, university administrators and the Board of Regents for their review and approval. She said she was shocked by the memo's characterization of certain race and sex concepts as "one viewpoint among many," saying it treats settled facts "as if George Wallace being a racist is a viewpoint," referring to the former Alabama governor who defended segregation. The law requires regents to conduct a comprehensive review of the classes all undergraduates must take to graduate to ensure they prepare students for civic and professional life and reflect Texas' workforce needs, with the first review due in 2027. System leaders imposed limitations on how faculty can discuss gender identity in classrooms in September after a viral video of a Texas A&M professor teaching about gender identity led to public criticism from conservatives, the professor's firing and the university president's resignation. Angelo State University, one of Texas Tech University System's five institutions, was the first to adopt changes, quietly directing faculty in September to halt discussions of transgender identities in class. Texas Tech's then-Chancellor Tedd L. Mitchell later issued a systemwide directive that faculty must comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump, a letter from Gov. Professors told The Texas Tribune at the time that Mitchell's guidance forced them to delay lessons, scrap terms like "transgender" and self-censor. Creighton took over as chancellor last month after Mitchell's retirement. The new policies at the Texas Tech University System come after the Texas A&M University System approved a new policy last month following the controversial video that requires each campus president to sign off on any course that could be considered as advocating for "race and gender ideology or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity," although Texas Tech's new rules appear to go further since it requires a formal approval process that ends with the Board of Regents. Texas Tech University System Chancellor Brandon Creighton said the new rules aim to offer "clarity, consistency and guardrails that protect academic excellence." Other universities that announced course reviews after the Texas A&M viral video controversy or in response to SB 37 have also sent new instructions to faculty. "We had hoped that our new chancellor's time visiting the campuses of the system and getting to know students, faculty and staff would encourage finding common ground and a recognition that academic freedom is a freedom we all share, one that is foundational to a free society," he said.
