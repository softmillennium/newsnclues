                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) have announced a new collaborative initiative, the Healthcare Infection Prevention Advisory Group (HIPAG), to address infection prevention priorities of national importance. HIPAG was established to help fill these gaps and ensure continuity by offering timely, evidence-informed advisory expertise that supports the needs of participating organizations and the broader healthcare community. This initiative reflects a shared commitment to enhancing transparency, inclusivity, and scientific rigor in national infection prevention discussions. APIC and SHEA believe that this group, which will include invited representative experts across medical societies, healthcare organizations, public health, and patient advocacy groups, will help maintain a unified approach to infection prevention as new challenges and emerging threats continue to evolve. HIPAG is intended to prevent fragmented or duplicative efforts, promote alignment and strengthen collaboration by connecting subject matter experts across disciplines and care settings. Evidence-informed infection prevention policies save lives-there's no room for compromise. David Weber, MD, MPH, FIDSA, FSHEA, FRSM, President of SHEA "APIC is proud to partner with SHEA and our colleagues across healthcare and public health in this essential initiative," said Carol McLay, DrPH, MPH, RN, CIC, FAPIC, FSHEA, 2025 APIC president. "HIPAG reflects our shared commitment to ensuring that infection prevention remains science-driven, practical, and grounded in real-world expertise. This collaboration is not only critical to the safety of healthcare delivery-it is key to restoring trust and confidence among patients, families, and the professionals who care for them." Organizations interested in participating in or contributing to expert representatives are encouraged to contact APIC or SHEA for more information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A comprehensive review of scientific literature from the past 24 years, published in Schizophrenia Research: Cognition, reveals that despite the high prevalence of this dual diagnosis (affecting approximately 40 per cent of people diagnosed with schizophrenia) and its association with unfavourable outcomes, the available data are surprisingly limited and fragmented. "Our analysis shows a significant blind spot in current knowledge," said Anouck Chalut, lead author of the study and a Psy. Led by UdeM psychology professor Tania Lecomte-director of L'ESPOIR, a research laboratory in the Department of Psychology dedicated to improving treatments and services for people with severe mental disorders-the researchers combed through hundreds of scientific articles but found only 10 that met their criteria for scientific rigour. "We found that the existing research is limited, fragmentary and sometimes contradictory, leaving clinicians with few clear guidelines," noted Chalut. This gap is consequential because cognition is the strongest predictor of recovery for individuals living with schizophrenia, she said. The combination of schizophrenia and a personality disorder presents considerable challenges, including more severe psychotic symptoms, serious functional impairment, reduced compliance with medication, more frequent hospitalization and increased risk of suicide. Despite these challenges, people with this dual diagnosis are often excluded from clinical studies or grouped together with patients who have only schizophrenia. "Our findings underscore the need to improve our understanding of these individuals and focus on their cognitive profiles to support functional recovery, given that cognition plays a decisive role in that process," said Chalut. The study offers concrete recommendations for both clinicians and researchers, including systematic screening for symptoms of personality disorders in people living with schizophrenia and the use of standardized tools to characterize cognitive profiles in this population. Approaches such as cognitive remediation – which aims to mitigate the effects of cognitive deficits and support strategies to strengthen impaired mental abilities, including memory, attention and problem-solving – could prove useful, the researchers believe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Family Heart Foundation, a leading research and advocacy organization, published new research in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology revealing significant gaps in cholesterol management during 2022-23 among U.S. adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Findings show that only 13% of adults with ASCVD were meeting three key components of optimal low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) management, including receiving guideline-recommended therapy, consistently taking the therapy, and reaching an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL. LDL-Cholesterol is a critical modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Timely, consistent, and appropriate management of LDL-Cholesterol reduces the incidence of an additional heart attack, stroke, or the need for an invasive cardiovascular procedure. However, LDL-Cholesterol management in the U.S. is subpar and life-threatening. In fact, 2 women and people who are Black or younger than 50 years of age, but already have cardiovascular disease, are the least likely to receive optimal care. We can, and should, be doing better by the American public." Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer, Family Heart Foundation The study also suggests actionable steps that the health care community can take to improve adherence to cholesterol guideline recommendations, including increased use of non-statin therapies, increased focus on overlooked subgroups of at-risk patients, addressing barriers to medication adherence, and increased lab testing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet their precise influence is not always understood, especially in the presence of prescription drugs. Now, researchers in ACS Central Science report how one of the most abundant gut bacteria responds to tetracyclines, a class of commonly prescribed antibiotics. "We previously showed that exogenous molecules can trigger production of otherwise 'hidden' metabolites in marine- and soil-dwelling microbes," says Mohammad Seyedsayamdost, the corresponding author of the study. Every day, medical professionals across the country prescribe drug treatments for a variety of ailments. Although these drugs may have their desired effect, there is also the possibility that they impact the microbes that keep us healthy. Antibiotics, for example, often inactivate not only offending microbes but also beneficial gut bacteria. To study this, Seyedsayamdost and colleagues exposed separate cultures of the prominent gut microbe Bacteroides dorei to hundreds of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs - such as antihistamines, hypertension drugs, anticancer agents and antibiotics - and looked for metabolic changes compared to untreated bacterial cultures. Among the various drugs tested, low doses of tetracycline antibiotics had the strongest effect on bacterial cultures, inducing the microbes to produce two types of new compounds: doreamides, named in this study, and N-acyladenosines. Further testing showed that both compounds trigger human immune cells to produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can help respond to infections. The experiments demonstrated a secondary effect of antibiotic treatment beyond inactivating microbes directly. Low-dose tetracyclines caused B. dorei to produce compounds that stimulate the immune system and induce immune cells to generate antimicrobial peptides, which could alter the microbial balance in the human gut.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have managed to create a model where we can look at how these injuries develop in following cerebral hemorrhage and thus map the mechanisms and molecules that influence the process.This is an important step on the way to finding a treatment that can help these children." Magnus Gram, associate professor of biomedicine and researcher, Malmö University Preterm birth affects approximately 15 million newborns globally each year and is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Cerebral hemorrhage occurs in up to 20 per cent of extremely preterm infants (born before week 28). In the most severe cases, the hemorrhage can be life-threatening or lead to extensive brain damage with motor and cognitive difficulties. The SVZ contains an area of immature blood vessels that are very fragile. When these vessels rupture, bleeding occurs and blood enters the ventricles, causing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The SVZ is also a source of nerve cell formation. The cerebral hemorrhage has a harmful effect on these neural stem cells, primarily because toxic breakdown products in the blood leak out and damage large parts of the child's brain. Previously, it has only been possible to study these reactions by analysing cerebrospinal fluid or blood from preterm infants or using experimental animal models in which haemorrhaging is induced in the animals. "The advantage of this compared to animal models is that we are looking at human cells, and that the model is reproducible and we can manipulate factors in a completely different way," adds Gram, who worked alongside researchers from Lund University, Karolinska Institutet and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Anna Herland, professor at the AIMES research centre at KTH and Karolinska Institutet, is part of the research team: "The fact that we are also seeing relevant responses in both simulated conditions and patient samples is very important, as there is currently no established treatment for these patients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The chemical composition of cryogenically frozen materials that have remained hydrated is technically challenging to investigate due to the limited radiation resistance of hydrated living cells. A typical dosage for single-particle tomography is around 40 e-/Å2. This dose is far lower than what is generally necessary to obtain an electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum image (SI) from an inorganic sample, which can range from ~107 to 108 e-/Å2. This is due in part to the ionization of edges, which have smaller inelastic scattering cross-sections than elastic scattering cross-sections. Previous scintillator/CCD EELS detectors were inefficient in converting rapid electrons into readable signals, requiring a larger dose to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This article demonstrates how the GIF Continuum and K3 can be used together to assess Ca distribution within a biological cell. Human retinal ganglion cells were cultivated on carbon grids and treated with an organic calcium phosphate solution. The (S)TEM was operated at 200 kV. Latitude® S was utilized to examine the TEM grid for mitochondria. Using a pixel dwell duration of 1.0 ms and an 8 × 8 subpixel scan array, the total dosage per pass was maintained at 18.37 e-/Å2. Due to the sample's limited dosage limits, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to denoise the spectra. A model for dealing with overlapping C K and Ca L2,3 edges, as well as plural scattering, was developed using multiple linear least squares fitting. Figure 1a shows an aligned and summed annular dark-field (ADF) picture of the mitochondria. Bright, white contrasts represent places in the mitochondria where calcium is thought to concentrate. Figure 1. a) Simultaneous annular dark field (ADF) image of the mitochondria. b) EELS elemental map showing that the areas in purple correspond to the presence of Ca. Given the highly limited dosage budget, a typical scintillator-based detector would have been unable to perform this measurement on this scale. The ability to save passes separately using in-situ spectrum imaging showed how the mitochondria behaved with cumulative dosage and to exclude SI passes from the data that were contaminated by H+ bubbles. Latitude S enabled a preliminary survey of the TEM grid using bright-field TEM imaging, reducing the time required to find potential mitochondria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In-flight cardiac arrest is extremely rare, yet catastrophic, and responsible for up to 86 % of all deaths in the air. A new comprehensive literature review highlights systemic and policy shortcomings of current aviation safety standards, calling for global alignment. The article in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, aims to inform policy regulators, airlines, and international aviation bodies to improve in-flight medical emergency preparedness and response protocols. In-flight medical emergencies are an expected challenge, given the global air travel passenger volume of nearly four billion passengers annually. With an aging global passenger population and increasing flight durations due to advancing aircraft technology, the risk and frequency of in-flight cardiac arrest are expected to rise. "Improving survival rates following a flight passenger's cardiac arrest hinges on several critical considerations," states senior author Adrian Baranchuk, MD, Queens University, Canada. AED utilization has a significant impact on survival outcomes in multiple environments. The likelihood of survival for shockable sudden cardiac arrest decreases by 7–10% per minute without defibrillation. Due to the narrow intervention window, diverting a plane for an emergency landing is often unattainable, as it often takes longer than 20 minutes from cruising altitude to a safe landing. The disparities in AED implementation may hinder swift emergency responses. Without an onboard AED, only approximately 6% of in-flight cardiac arrest patients survive to hospital. Further projections suggest that equipping all commercial aircraft with AEDs could save 35–93 lives annually worldwide. First author Mario D. Bassi, MD, University of Ottawa, Canada, points out, "Currently, the data show that AEDs are consistently reliable, sensitive to detecting and treating in-flight cardiac arrest, and cost-effective to airlines. AEDs are proven to be safe, with no evidence of detriment or reduced functionality emerging in the compromised environment of the aircraft cabin, such as turbulence. While prompt recognition of a cardiac arrest and CPR initiation are vital, the chances of survival jump from 6% to up to 70% when an AED is used.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many people living with cancer, symptoms such as pain, anxiety or insomnia can quickly spiral into an emergency room visit. A new study led by Mayo Clinic researchers found that using digital check-ins and a remote care team can help patients manage symptoms before they reach a crisis point. "Our goal was simple but ambitious," says study lead Andrea Cheville, M.D., professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. We wanted to see if automating symptom check-ins and care through the electronic health record could improve patients' lives without adding to the burden on oncology teams. What we found is that this approach not only eased symptoms like anxiety and depression but also kept thousands of patients out of the hospital. Andrea Cheville, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center For Becky Johnson, participating in the Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control Trial (E2C2) meant better sleep - despite the anxiety she felt about her double breast cancer diagnosis in 2022 at the age of 40. "I was continually Googling for more information about treatments, prognosis, new terminology and the experiences of others. And the steroid medications I took for treatment prior to chemo messed with my ability to sleep, too. It got to a point where my body's norm was to wake in the middle of the night and not fall back asleep, taking a toll on my ability to heal," says Johnson, program director for the Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences Sonography Program. The nurse also gave Johnson a link to a self-paced online class with sleep strategies based in cognitive behavioral therapy. "A virtual or phone call visit, especially when I didn't have anything physically wrong, was so convenient and efficient," says Johnson. To make such interventions possible, the researchers developed automations in the Plummer Chart, the software system that manages patients' electronic health records (EHRs) and helps Mayo teams coordinate care. Between 2019 and 2023, just over 50,200 patients across 15 cancer specialties at Mayo Clinic enrolled in the E2C2 trial. Like Johnson, they filled out short surveys about pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and other symptoms before clinic visits or monthly between visits. Mild scores were simply logged, moderate ones triggered the system to send the patient self-care tips, and severe scores prompted outreach by a remote symptom care manager - a nurse or social worker who could work with patients via phone or video. For care teams, it routed information to patients automatically so they could focus on the work that required their expertise. For patients, it made getting support easier, with no additional appointments or travel. All of this was achieved with just 2-3 full-time care managers plus 20 percent of one physician's time supporting more than 50,000 study participants. The E2C2 trial showcases a new approach to using digital tools in cancer care. "The gains we saw are encouraging and point to a scalable way to extend supportive oncology care beyond the clinic walls, meeting patients where they are," says Dr. Cheville.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intrusive thoughts and psychotic-like experiences among new parents are far more common than previously thought - according to new research from the University of East Anglia. The team hope their work will lead to greater awareness, early screening, and accessible mental health support for all parents, not just those with diagnosed conditions. The perinatal period is a time of huge change for parents, and previous research has shown that more than one in five mothers experience mental health challenges during this time. Challenges like sleep deprivation, stress, and hormonal changes can all take a toll on the mental health of new parents. Most research to date has focused on depression and anxiety because they're so common. But we wanted to look beyond that and explore the wider range of mental health experiences parents face." Dr. Jo Hodgekins, lead researcher from UEA's Norwich Medical School The research team recruited participants via parenting sites including Mumsnet, Netmums, Dads Matter UK, and social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, "Male parents may experience these symptoms due to sleep deprivation, heightened stress, and the psychological adjustment to new responsibilities and identity as a father," said Dr Hodgekins. It would certainly be interesting to focus on recruiting more male participants in future research." The study highlights that these experiences are not only widespread but often deeply distressing, with symptoms strongly linked to lower parenting confidence, higher stress, and increased depression and anxiety - suggesting a ripple effect on family wellbeing. "We found that psychotic-like experiences and intrusive thoughts are common among new parents. "Our work highlights the need to normalise some of these experiences for new parents, reducing stigma and raising awareness so that conversations can be opened up about them. "Intrusive thoughts and psychotic-like experiences don't always mean there's a clinical disorder, but they're common and can seriously affect parenting, so they deserve attention." "However, we also need to go beyond normalisation, by providing tailored and targeted support for those who find such experiences distressing, to improve mental health and parenting outcomes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tracking how genes switch on and off in the brain is essential for understanding many neurological diseases, yet the tools to monitor this activity are often invasive or unable to capture subtler changes over time. One emerging alternative is to use engineered serum markers ⎯ small proteins produced by targeted brain cells that can travel into the bloodstream, where they can be measured with a simple blood test. Referred to as released markers of activity, or RMAs, these molecules can serve as a sensitive tool for monitoring brain activity, but they also persist in the bloodstream for many hours. That long half-life can drown out intervening changes in the biological signal of interest. Rice University bioengineers have developed a way to make RMAs even more sensitive, pointing to other diagnostic scenarios where they could be deployed. According to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team designed an erasable marker that can be cut apart inside the bloodstream by an enzyme which acts like a pair of molecular scissors: Once it cleaves the RMAs, the previous signal disappears and a new reading becomes possible. The key advance here is a new way of thinking about serum markers ⎯ that we can modify them inside the bloodstream when we need to. This broad concept has many potential applications, ranging from extending the marker's half-life to improve detectability, or erasing them to remove the background signal and improve temporal resolution. Currently, markers are usually extracted from the body and interpreted 'as-is,' which limits their usefulness." Jerzy Szablowski, assistant professor of bioengineering at Rice and corresponding author on the study In an animal model, a single injection of the cleaving enzyme removed about 90% of the RMAs' background signal within half an hour. The researchers also showed they could repeat this process and measure how quickly the marker reappeared, offering a clearer picture of how gene activity evolves over time. This approach could eventually enable clinicians to detect problems or measure any changes in how a patient responds to treatment with greater precision, using simple, minimally-invasive testing. "We introduced a modification where the RMAs were made sensitive to a targeted protease ⎯ an enzyme that can cleave them in half," said Shirin Nouraein, a graduate student in Rice's Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology program who is a first author on the study. We found a significant elevation in signal changes when we used these markers to track the dynamics of gene expression in the brain. "The approach could have an impact on areas of medicine beyond neurology: If markers can be edited inside the body, their behavior can be tuned for many diagnostic purposes, including, for example, using RMAs for detecting tumors or lung disease using urine tests.The project is one example of Rice's intensive focus on brain research and reflects the university's strategic commitment to leading innovations in health. It also aligns with the mission of the recently-launched Rice Brain Institute, which was established to accelerate technologies for understanding and treating brain disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And while the evidence on the consequences of maternal eating disorders has consistently reported on their children's cognitive, social, emotional, behavioral and eating behaviours, the evidence is less consistent for physical health outcomes. To strengthen the evidence base, the researchers analysed data from 131,495 mother and child pairs from 7 distinct European birth cohorts in the EU Child Cohort Network (EUCCN), looking at potential associations between maternal eating disorders before pregnancy and their children's preschool wheezing and school age asthma. They subsequently explored potential associations between women who didn't have depression or anxiety by type of eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia) and period of exposure (pregnancy or after birth). And the prevalence of co-existing depression/anxiety among women with eating disorders ranged from 11% to 75%. The prevalence of preschool wheezing ranged from 21% to nearly 50%, while that of school age asthma ranged from just over 2% to nearly 17.5%. An eating disorder before pregnancy was associated with an overall 25% heightened risk of preschool wheeze, although this varied considerably in each cohort, and with a 26% heightened risk of school age asthma, which was much more consistent across the cohorts. These heightened risks weakened slightly after excluding mothers who had depression/anxiety. Similar associations with childhood asthma were found for anorexia and bulimia, while preschool wheezing was associated with bulimia only. Although the observed associations differed slightly across exposure periods (before, during, or after pregnancy), no distinct window of susceptibility emerged. But they add: "The mechanisms underlying the associations between maternal mental health and childhood respiratory outcomes remain unclear." They suggest that mental ill health and associated stress may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, disrupting the baby's lung development during pregnancy and maturation of the child's immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to immune mediated conditions, including asthma. "Children born to mothers with [eating disorders] are at an increased risk of foetal growth restriction, prematurity, Caesarean delivery and low birth weight. These are also well-known risk factors for respiratory morbidity, suggesting multiple possible mediating pathways in the link between maternal [eating disorders] and childhood respiratory outcomes," they point out. "In addition, research has shown that both mental health disorders and asthma involve dysregulation in immune response and inflammatory pathways, suggesting a common genetic basis that may contribute to both conditions," they add. They conclude: "There is a need to include maternal [eating disorders] in research on early- life respiratory risk factors and to integrate [eating disorder] screening and support into maternal healthcare to improve respiratory outcomes in offspring."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Creating a safe, gender-specific, supportive environment-one that is free of body shaming and idealised female forms, for example-is key to minimising female athletes' future risks of injury and protecting their health, emphasizes the Female/woman/girl Athlete Injury pRevention (FAIR) Consensus Statement-the first of its kind-published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Women and girls have increasingly been taking part in sports, which has led to a concomitant rise in their risk of injury. But how best to minimize this risk has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive and practical gender-specific evidence. In a bid to tackle this knowledge gap and both promote and protect female athletes' health, the International Olympic Committee convened a panel of sports and exercise specialists from around the globe to draw up a series of workable recommendations, with the aim of informing current policy and practice and guiding future avenues of research. The recommendations, which range from universal to sport specific, also include primary injury prevention strategies; policy, rules, and legislation; personal protective equipment; training; secondary injury prevention; modifiable risk factors; and approaches to diversity and inclusion. "Injury prevention strategies cannot work if female/women/girl athletes do not have access to resources, knowledge or training/competition environments that support implementation of best practice injury prevention, health, and performance strategies that consider their needs," says the Statement. Everyone who works in sport needs to be involved, urges the Statement. "Recommendations such as 'Create safe spaces free from body shaming or promoting ideal body types, or gendered norms' might appear sensible, but they are NOT always part of female/woman/athletes' reality. At all levels of sport, responsibility must be taken for actions that can influence female/woman/girl athlete health," it emphasizes. ● Mandatory neuromuscular training warm-ups for all sports and all ages to ward off first and recurrent leg injuries, lasting a minimum of 10 minutes, twice a week ● Mandatory injury management across all sports to prevent concussion ● All child and teen ice hockey players to wear mouthguards ● All cyclists, skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders, horseriders to wear helmets "We recognize that these recommendations must be responsive to diverse contexts, including uniqueness in experiences, expertise, geography, culture, healthcare access, sport structure, level of participation and sociocultural considerations," says the Statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) and Cardiovascular Research Technologies (CRT) today announce a new collaboration to elevate the field of interventional cardiology through shared education programming, legislative activities, and future research initiatives. As part of the collaboration, CRT is offering SCAI members discounted registration for CRT 2026, where the two organizations will also offer joint education. Supporting SCAI and CRT's strong advocacy focus, SCAI will coordinate an annual Day on the Hill legislative event tied to the CRT meeting in Washington, DC. Over the long term, SCAI and CRT will explore collaborative research opportunities, including novel registry and clinical trial programs. While coming at these goals from different vantage points, our new partnership reflects the growing alignment in vision, and SCAI looks forward to the many benefits of working together with CRT." The partnership will be guided by the SCAI–CRT Task Force, composed of representatives from both organizations who will identify and coordinate collaborative opportunities. In support of these initiatives, SCAI will form a working group to evaluate research projects, including the development of registries and clinical trials, to be submitted by SCAI, its members, and CRT's research network. "Together, we will create new avenues to engage physicians, foster innovation, and build programs that address the clinical and policy challenges shaping our field. By combining our strengths, we can accelerate investigator-led research, expand professional development, and ultimately deliver better care for patients," said J. "Through CRT's collaboration with SCAI, we're expanding the impact of both organizations. This partnership allows us to connect clinical science, advocacy, and education in ways that will drive innovation and bring together experts from across cardiovascular medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Houston Methodist research has revealed that a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also plays a role in regulating DNA mismatch repair, a process essential for replicating genetic information and cell health. The finding could change how scientists understand both cancer and neurodegeneration. The study, published in Nucleic Acids Research, finds that the protein, 'TDP43' regulates genes that fix DNA mistakes. When this protein is lost or overproduced, these repair genes become overactive, damaging neurons and destabilizing the genome, which could lead to cancer. DNA repair is one of the most fundamental processes in biology. What we found is that TDP43 is not just another RNA-binding protein involved in splicing, but a critical regulator of mismatch repair machinery. That has major implications for diseases like ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) where this protein goes awry." Muralidhar L. Hegde, Ph.D., lead investigator, professor of neurosurgery at the Houston Methodist Research Institute's Center for Neuroregeneration Their analysis of large cancer datasets revealed that high levels correlate with increased mutation rates. "This tells us that the biology of this protein is broader than just ALS or FTD," Hegde said. Researchers said the discovery opens doors for new treatments. Hegde said that Controlling DNA mismatch repair may offer a therapeutic strategy. Other collaborators in the study were Vincent Provasek, Suganya Rangaswamy, Manohar Kodavati, Joy Mitra, Vikas Malojirao, Velmarini Vasquez, Gavin Britz and Sankar Mitra from Houston Methodist; Albino Bacolla and John Tainer from MD Anderson Cancer Center; Issa Yusuf and Zuoshang Xu from University of Massachusetts; Guo-Min Li from UT Southwestern Medical Center and Ralph Garruto from Binghamton University.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term antidepressant use in Australia has risen steadily over the past decade, with the largest increase seen in young people aged 10-24, where rates have more than doubled. The finding is from a new study undertaken by University of South Australia researchers, who analyzed dispensing data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) covering more than 300,000 antidepressant users between 2014 and 2023. The most comprehensive study of its kind, published in the Pharmacaoepidemiology and Drug Safety Journal, reveals that 45% of young people on antidepressants are staying on them for more than 12 months, and a substantial number are still using them after two years. Long-term use – defined as taking antidepressants continuously for more than 12 months – has risen markedly across all age groups, although the most dramatic increase is occurring in young Australians. Lead author, UniSA researcher Dr. Lasantha Ranwala, says the findings highlight a critical shift in how antidepressants are being used in Australia, raising concerns over potential overprescribing and inconsistency with guidelines that recommend a careful review of medication use after 6-12 months. The medical practitioner, AI researcher and UniSA PhD candidate says this is especially concerning for younger age groups, where clinical guidelines generally recommend psychological therapies as the first line of treatment. Across the whole population, long-term antidepressant use increased from 66 to nearly 85 users per 1000 people between 2014 and 2022, before stabilising slightly in 2023. Women continued to record significantly higher use than men throughout the study period. "While antidepressants play a role in managing moderate to severe depression, prolonged use can increase the risk of side effects and make withdrawal more difficult," Dr. Ranwala says. The researchers also found no meaningful improvement in efforts to wean people off antidepressants. "Given the increase in long-term use, especially among young people, this is an area that requires urgent attention," says Prof. Roughead. Researchers point to several drivers behind this trend, including a spike in mental health issues among young people, rising rates of psychological distress generally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and difficulties accessing psychological therapies. With mental health demands at an all-time high, the authors argue for a more balanced approach that ensures antidepressants are used appropriately and that patients receive adequate support to reduce or discontinue treatment when the clinical need has passed. "Australia needs a stronger framework for safely tapering antidepressants, along with better access to psychological care," says Prof Roughead. UniSA co-author, Associate Professor Andrew Andrade, says emerging technologies including predictive analytics and clinical decision-support tools may also help clinicians identify when deprescribing is appropriate. "Clinicians need stronger support systems to safely deprescribe antidepressants," Assoc Prof. Andrade says. "Smart technologies can help identify patients who are good candidates for tapering, coordinate timely access to non-pharmacological treatments, and provide clear, step-by-step guidance to clinicians and patients throughout the slow dose-reduction process."
