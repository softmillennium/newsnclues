            Police in New Zealand have charged a man with theft after he allegedly stole a jewel-encrusted gold Fabergé egg locket from a jewelers by picking it up and swallowing it.
    


            The unusual incident occurred on Friday afternoon at a store in central Auckland, according to a statement from Inspector Grae Anderson, Auckland Central Area Commander at New Zealand Police, sent to CNN on Tuesday.
    


            Store staff contacted police around 3.30 p.m. local time (9.30 p.m. Thursday ET), and officers “responded minutes later, arresting the man inside the store,” Anderson said.
    


            The 32-year-old man has been charged with theft and has been remanded in custody prior to a scheduled court appearance on December 8, according to the statement.
    


            In a separate statement published Wednesday, Anderson said the man had undergone a medical assessment at the time of his arrest and is being constantly monitored by an officer.
    


            “Given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,” said Anderson.
    


Fabergé egg fetches record $30.2 million at rare auction



            “At this stage the pendant has not been recovered,” he added.
    


            The stolen item is a Fabergé James Bond Octopussy Egg locket worth 33,585 New Zealand dollars ($19,300), according to court documents seen by CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand.
    


            A listing for the locket on the Fabergé website reveals that it is made from 18-karat yellow gold and green guilloché enamel, and it also features 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires.
    


            “In true Fabergé style, the beautiful egg locket also offers a surprise — opening to reveal a miniature 18k gold octopus inside, capturing the spirit of the film's namesake,” the description reads.
    


House of Faberge: The story behind the world's most luxurious eggs



            “The octopus has been set with two black diamond eyes,” it adds.
    


            Fabergé is a historic jewelry house founded in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1842.
    


            On Tuesday, one of 50 Imperial Eggs produced by Fabergé for Russian Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II sold for £22.9 million ($30.2 million), including fees, breaking its own record as the most expensive work by the Russian jeweler ever to appear at auction.
    


            The Winter Egg's astronomical price tag reflects the growing rarity of the eggs, none of which had been seen at auction in over 23 years.
    


            It is one of just seven left in private hands, with the others either missing or owned by institutions or museums.

            Five hours of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and top United States negotiators did not yield a breakthrough on a possible Ukraine peace deal, a Kremlin aide said early Wednesday.
    


            US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner sat down for the high-level talks with Putin in the Kremlin Tuesday, culminating a week of intensive diplomacy as the Trump administration continues its push to end the Russian war in Ukraine.
    


            The talks in the Russian capital were “very useful, constructive, and highly substantive,” but a “compromise option was not found,” Russian foreign policy adviser and Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters after the meeting.
    


            “Some of the American proposals look more or less acceptable, though they need to be discussed,” Ushakov said, adding that other points “do not suit us.”
    


            “The work will continue,” he said.
    


            Among the previous sticking points are Kremlin demands for Ukraine to formally renounce its aspiration to join NATO and for Ukraine to surrender territory in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine that has been annexed, but not yet conquered, by Russia.
    


            The US side has not yet publicly commented on the talks, but ahead of the meeting the US had been “very optimistic” of reaching a deal to end the three-and-a-half-year war, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


            A meeting between Putin and Trump had not been scheduled and a prospective face-to-face would “depend on the progress we're able to achieve,” Ushakov said.
    


            Ukrainian officials have continued to reject Russia's maximalist demands, which the Kremlin continues to consider red lines.
    


Trump turns to unconventional negotiating team heading to Russia in push for Ukraine peace deal



            Ushakov said Putin and the US delegation discussed territorial issues in their meeting, “without which we do not see a solution to the crisis.”
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he expected to communicate with the US negotiation team immediately after their talks with Putin and that he was “waiting for signals” from the delegation on the outcome of the meeting.
    


            “We will receive certain signals, and if the signals work out – if it is a fair game with our partners – then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,” Zelensky said before the talks.
    


            The Ukrainian leader said that a higher-level delegation would be sent if the messages from the Americans signal an opportunity for “global but swift decisions.”
    


            Hours before the meeting, Putin issued a warning that while Russia is not planning to go to war with Europe, it was “ready” to respond if Europe were to initiate one.
    


            Earlier, Putin had accused European leaders of trying to block the US-proposed peace deal by “putting forward demands that are absolutely unacceptable for Russia,” and suggested that Ukraine's European allies are “on the side of the war.”
    


            “They themselves refused peace negotiations and are interfering with President Trump,” he added.
    


            While Putin did not explain his thinking in detail, he was likely referring to the changes reportedly made to Trump's original 28-point peace plan, which was put forward by the US last month and rejected by Ukraine and its European allies.
    


Daily life grinds to a halt for Ukrainians facing blackouts and drone strikes



            A later meeting in Geneva between Ukrainian and US delegations resulted in changes to the draft, making it more palatable to Kyiv.
    


            But just hours before key talks, the Kremlin reiterated its position that any peace deal must resolve what it describes as the “initial causes” or “underlying reasons” for its invasion – shorthand for a longstanding list of demands that has included a halt to NATO expansion, recognition of Russia's claimed control over occupied Ukrainian regions and the effective end of Ukraine as a sovereign state.
    


            A senior NATO official told reporters they see no indication that Moscow is willing to make “meaningful concessions” to end the war in Ukraine. The official said that Russia maintains its territorial demands and will still “aim to ensure Ukraine's military capabilities are weakened as much as possible to pave the way for further aggression.”
    


            The Putin-US meeting came US officials and a Ukrainian delegation met in Miami on Sunday for talks that Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as “very productive,” though he cautioned that more work remained.
    


            Witkoff and Kushner, who does not hold an official US government role but has re-emerged as a key figure in the administration's diplomatic efforts, could be seen strolling through Moscow's Red Square with Kremlin representative Kirill Dmitriev before their meeting, according to footage from Russian state-owned news agency TASS.
    


            Earlier, Witkoff and Dmitriev had lunch at a Michelin-starred Moscow restaurant, where they dined on caviar, quail, venison and crab, the restaurant's director, Maxim Romantsev, told Russia's Izvestia newspaper.

Editor's Note:  This story contains disturbing images.



            Ammar Wadi knew he was risking his life when he set out to get a bag of flour for his family from an aid truck near the Zikim crossing into Gaza in June.
    


            “Forgive me mom if anything happens to me,” he wrote on his cell phone's home screen. “Whoever finds my phone, please tell my family that I love them so much.”
    


            Amid regular Israeli gunfire toward aid seekers this summer, Wadi never made it home and the message he left was delivered to his family weeks later by someone who found his phone. It was the last they heard from him.
    


            Wadi is among the dozens of Palestinians whose loved ones say they vanished near Zikim and whose fates remain unknown.
    


            A CNN investigation now points to the Israeli military bulldozing the bodies of some of those killed near the crossing into shallow, unmarked graves. At other times, their remains were simply left to decompose in the open, unable to be recovered in the militarized area.
    


            The practice of mishandling bodies by bulldozing them into unmarked graves can violate international law, according to legal experts.
    


            CNN's review, which also found that aid seekers were killed by indiscriminate Israeli fire near the crossing, drew upon hundreds of videos and photos from around Zikim, along with interviews of eyewitnesses and local aid truck drivers.
    


            Satellite imagery also shows bulldozing activity throughout the summer in the areas where aid seekers were killed. Two videos, geolocated by CNN to the Zikim area, show the aftermath of an incident in June, depicting bodies partially buried around an overturned aid truck.
    


            CNN spoke with two former Israeli military members who described instances elsewhere in Gaza during the war in which the bodies of Palestinians were bulldozed into shallow graves. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied that it used bulldozers to “remove” bodies, but did not address whether they were used to bury them. The IDF told CNN the presence of bulldozers around Zikim was a “routine matter” used for operational purposes, such as dealing with explosive threats or “routine engineering needs.”
    


            According to international law, the warring sides should cooperate in burying the dead in a way that allows them to be identified, said Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.
    


            “The purpose is to prevent the dead from becoming the missing and to allow for memorialization, chiefly by their families,” Dill said. “Moreover, if bodies are deliberately mutilated or mishandled in a way that violates their dignity, this can amount to ‘outrages upon personal dignity' which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.”
    


            Whether the IDF tracks sites where it has allegedly buried bodies remains an open question, however. One of the IDF whistleblowers told CNN that when his unit buried nine people in early 2024, the location of the grave was left unmarked. The IDF did not respond to CNN's question about this incident.
    


            Nearly six months after Wadi's disappearance, his family is still without answers. Instead of finding comfort in his final phone message, however, Wadi's mother, Nawal Musleh, is haunted by what she may never discover.
    


            “When he comes to my mind, my eyes just cannot stop crying,” she told CNN. “We accept whatever God has written for us, but we just want to know what happened to our son.”
    


            A pair of graphic videos posted to social media from September 11 – reviewed and geolocated by CNN – show a steady stream of Palestinians fleeing from the Zikim area hauling sacks of flour under a barrage of gunfire.
    


            At least one person carrying flour appears to be shot from behind in the footage, with the gunfire seeming to come from the direction of an IDF position that CNN has identified in satellite imagery.
    


            Robert Maher of Montana State University, an audio forensics expert, analyzed the videos for CNN and found the shots originated around 340 meters (1,115 feet) from the filming location, which corresponds to the distance from the IDF position.
    


            In the other video, a group can also be seen tending to the bodies of one apparently dead and another severely injured person, before carrying them away. Meanwhile, the gunfire continues.
    


            In a statement to CNN, the IDF said it “does not intentionally shoot at innocent civilians” and in instances where a threat arises, “fire is carried out for warning purposes or to neutralize the threat.”
    


            Other footage and photos reviewed by CNN show multiple corpses that could not be retrieved from Zikim by other aid seekers or the civil defense due to the dangerous conditions.
    


            On June 15, two eyewitnesses told CNN that one aid truck traveling from the crossing was swarmed by a crowd of hungry Palestinians. The aid trucks are operated by private local contractors in Gaza to pick up supplies from the crossing and drive them into the strip.
    


            Shortly after the aid truck was surrounded, the Israeli military opened fire toward the vehicle, with many people appearing to have been shot and collapsing beneath the truck, the eyewitnesses said.
    


            An ambulance operated by civil defense workers was permitted to access the area several days later.
    


            “We were shocked by the scene,” one of the civil defense workers told CNN, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. “The (bodies) we recovered were decomposed – they had clearly been there for a while, there were signs that dogs had eaten parts of them.”
    


            Videos obtained and geolocated by CNN to that location in Zikim show a crushed, overturned aid truck amid a pile of debris. Several decomposing bodies are scattered around the vehicle, partially buried in mounds of sand. A stray dog is seen nearby.
    


            The civil defense team was only able to retrieve 15 bodies and, with the ambulance full, roughly 20 were never recovered, according to the worker. The IDF did not respond to questions about this incident.
    


            A half dozen local aid truck drivers who worked the Zikim route spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity due to fears for their safety.
    


            They described scenes of strewn and decomposing bodies as a common sight, with Israeli bulldozers at times clearing the corpses into the sand.
    


            “I see dead people every time I drive through Zikim… I watched Israeli bulldozers bury the dead bodies,” one driver said. “If you passed through that area in July, you wouldn't miss it; I kept my windows closed.”
    


            “Israeli army bulldozers either bury them or cover them with dirt,” another driver said.
    


            Satellite imagery and photos add to these testimonies, capturing a standing presence of Israeli bulldozers from late July to early August. Signs of bulldozer activity around the Zikim crossing are apparent beginning in mid-June, just after the aid route opened, until September 12, when it closed.
    


            Some of the bulldozer activity appears related to clearing the aid route, which was frequently littered with boxes and debris.
    


            At other times, satellite imagery shows bulldozing activity without a clear purpose, such as when a bulldozer pushed a 30-square-meter (322-square-foot) area of soil into a short pile in mid-June, around 400 meters (1,300 ft) away from where the overturned truck attended to by civil defense workers was found days earlier.
    


            The bulldozers were also repeatedly used to demolish the ruins of buildings behind which aid seekers previously sought shelter from Israeli gunfire, as seen in numerous videos.
    


            Two eyewitnesses told CNN that on September 7 – as people went searching near Zikim for any sign of their missing family members – they came across what they say appeared to be bulldozed corpses.
    


            “I found the bodies there bulldozed along with the cardboard (aid) boxes… they pile them on top of each other,” Adel Mansour told CNN, one of the eyewitnesses who went looking for his 17-year-old son.
    


            One aid truck driver who worked the Zikim routes told CNN: “It's like the Bermuda Triangle; no one knows what's happening in that area, and it seems no one ever will.”
    


            These reports of the Israeli military bulldozing of the bodies of Palestinians are not isolated to the Zikim crossing. IDF whistleblowers who spoke to CNN  and the anti-occupation veterans' NGO Breaking the Silence (BTS) pointed to a broader pattern of the military mishandling the dead in Gaza during the war.
    


            One IDF whistleblower, who previously served at an outpost in the Netzarim Corridor, spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
    


            The soldier said that nine bodies of unarmed Palestinians were left to decompose for nearly two days around his base in early 2024. The smell of the rotting corpses became overwhelming as dogs scavenged the remains, he said.
    


            “Our commander asked the D9s – the bulldozers – to cover up the bodies with sand,” he recalled. “Just to see this amount of bodies around you, when you see they're unarmed, when you see dogs eating them to play with the bones and legs and skull. It's terrible.”
    


            To the whistleblower's knowledge, no photos were taken of the bodies to allow for later identification or to mark the location. “The families maybe don't know what happened with their loved ones,” he said.
    


            BTS, which provides a forum for Israeli troops to speak out and verifies their accounts, also said that it had received numerous testimonies from soldiers on this practice.
    


‘Death and hunger': Videos, expert analysis and witnesses point to Israeli gunfire in Gaza aid site shooting



            Another former IDF soldier – a captain who served in a command center overseeing Israeli troops in Gaza in late 2023 – said he never received any guidance from the military specifying the treatment of the bodies of Palestinians killed in Gaza. When the body of a Palestinian killed by Israeli forces blocked a road in Gaza, he says officers in the command center ultimately decided to use a bulldozer to push the body into a shallow grave along the side of the road.
    


            “We were never given any protocol or any order of how to handle at all any bodies of either combatant or non-combatant that we came across in the war,” the whistleblower told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            The IDF did not respond to CNN's questions about the testimonies from former soldiers.
    


            Over the last two years, the Israeli military has repeatedly buried the bodies of Palestinians into unmarked, shallow or mass graves in locations across Gaza. This includes hundreds of bodies uncovered last year at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, according to authorities there, and the killing of 15 aid workers in the south of the territory in March, which were detailed in a CNN report.
    


            The IDF has consistently denied burying Palestinians in mass graves.
    


            Bulldozers have also been used at various points in the war by the IDF to systematically destroy Palestinian cemeteries. Last year, a CNN investigation found that the Israeli military desecrated at least 16 cemeteries in its ground offensive in Gaza, leaving gravestones ruined, soil upturned and, in some cases, bodies unearthed.
    


            The IDF could not account for the destruction of the cemeteries identified, but said the military sometimes has “no other choice” but to target locations it claimed Hamas uses for military purposes and explained that bodies were removed from some gravesites in attempts to rescue hostages.
    


            With many Palestinians who tried to get food this summer still missing, the desperate search for answers continues for their families. Some remain hopeful that their loved ones may still be alive somewhere, such as in Israeli detainment or displaced elsewhere in Gaza.
    


            “Ammar (Wadi) was someone whose absence leaves a huge void – losing him feels like losing a part of yourself,” his brother Hossam said. “If he's martyred, may God have mercy on him, but if he's alive, at least we can hold on to hope.”

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

A state visit by the Russian president to India is always a significant event, given the size of the two countries and their influence on the world stage. However, Vladimir Putin's trip this week to New Delhi is particularly notable. It is taking place against the backdrop of rapid and profound changes on the international stage, in which both countries are playing a decisive role.

Over the past decade, the global situation has been in a state of flux. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine entered a phase of open conflict which quickly escalated beyond the local level. There have also been dramatic changes in the leading Western countries, primarily the US and UK, that have called into question the familiar nature of relations within the Western community. The Chinese-American economic symbiosis, which peaked in the late 2000s, is entering a phase of inevitable ‘disconnection'. Finally, mid-level players in different parts of the world have started to consider emerging opportunities more closely.

At the intersection of practical politics and its description at that time, the most popular topic was who was responsible for the increasingly disorderly state of affairs in the world. Western commentators pointed the finger at Russia and China, with Iran and North Korea frequently mentioned in the same breath. The grouping of these very different countries into a single category reflected Western fears rather than the real situation. The Atlantic community insisted on preserving the liberal world order – which came to be known as the ‘rules-based order' – as it had developed at the end of the 20th century. Any signs of deviation from this order were seen as an ‘attempt to escape' that should be punished.

The paradox is that Russia and China, which jointly declared their rejection of hegemony, occupied very different positions within this order. Russia was dissatisfied with the disregard for its geopolitical interests, and sought greater integration into the global economic system, to which Western leaders were indifferent. China, on the other hand, was a pillar of that very economic system. However, it was dissatisfied with Western countries dismantling it ad hoc, sensing a threat to their own dominance. As for Iran and North Korea, their task was merely to ensure their own inviolability. Hardly surprising, given that they were constantly threatened with sanctions.

India has always been seen as a purely positive example. It is a non-Western country that is growing rapidly, plays by the rules, and focuses primarily on its own development without having excessive ambitions abroad.

Setting aside the dramatic twists and turns of the past decade, let's fast-forward to the present day. The liberal order is only remembered out of inertia. The pandemic has shown that the world can exist with globalization ‘turned off', and the remaining rules are being broken by the White House, which, until recently, was their main proponent and guarantor. It is pointless to talk about revising the world order: It has simply crumbled.

In previous categories, the main revisionist has been the US. Washington is so determined that it is unsentimentally revising the very foundations of relations between the two sides of the Atlantic. At the level of slogans, China is calling for a return to the previous open system, although Beijing realizes that this is impossible. Russia is pursuing the goals it set in the first half of the last decade: Eliminating the geopolitical imbalance in Eastern Europe and securing its place in a changed world. While resolving the security issue on Ukraine's borders does not provide an answer to future challenges in itself, it does create a new framework for addressing them.

Incidentally, the past few years have been a kind of experiment with regard to Pyongyang and Tehran. Both were once accused of pursuing nuclear ambitions, but only North Korea realized this ambition. While no one dares to touch the North Koreans, the Iranians have been the victims of a massive attack. Observers can draw their own conclusions.

India is the most consistent. Its own development remains at the heart of its agenda. Its growing political weight is not so much the result of its increasing ambitions, as it is due to changes in the world. This is also due to the growing desire of some leading powers to secure India's support in their relations with other leading powers.

Russia and India are very different from each other; in some respects, they are even opposites. However, two important circumstances should be noted.

Firstly, their experience of close, friendly, and mutually beneficial cooperation sets a benchmark for the international order, where the emphasis is on highlighting rather than erasing civilizational contrasts. The Russia-India relationship is, quite frankly, the envy of many. It shows how to maintain stability amid turbulent change.

Secondly, neither Russia nor India is seeking global domination. However, both are powers without which nothing is possible, each due to their own set of parameters. They cannot be ignored. In a sense, it is now more advantageous to be a country like this than a superpower. There is less burden and more flexibility. If efforts are coordinated, there will be no obstacles for us, either at sea or on land.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","No security guarantees for Ukraine","https://www.rt.com/news/628855-finland-ukraine-security-guarantees/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:09:00 GMT","

Finland will not offer Ukraine NATO-style security guarantees, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has declared.

Kiev has been seeking formal security assurances from Western backers and insists they should come before any peace agreement with Moscow. Some media reports claimed that last month's US peace roadmap included a NATO-style guarantee for Kiev modeled on Article 5, committing guarantor states to defend Ukraine in case of a potential attack, and listed Finland as one of the potential guarantors.

Asked about this at a joint press conference with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, Orpo said he had neither seen the plan nor been consulted on it.

“I don't know why Finland was mentioned in the paper,” he told the media. “We have to understand that a security guarantee is something very, very serious. We're not ready to give security guarantees, but we can help with security arrangements. The difference between them is huge.”

Orpo stressed that helping Kiev with security differs fundamentally from mutual defense obligations referenced in the leaked US plan. He suggested major powers such as the US or larger European states should commit to guarantees, while Finland's role would be limited to logistical and organizational support.

Sweden, while not mentioned as a potential guarantor in the leaked draft, believes European support should focus on helping Ukraine maintain a capable military as Kiev's “most important security guarantee”, according to Kristersson.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that security guarantees remain unresolved after the latest talks between Kiev and Washington in Florida. Moscow has said it does not oppose security guarantees for Ukraine in principle but insists they must not be one-sided or aimed at containing Russia, and should follow a peace deal rather than precede one. Russia confirmed receiving the “main parameters” of the US roadmap last week but has not commented on details or whether guarantees are included.

Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited Moscow on Tuesday for further talks on the peace plan. According to President Vladimir Putin's aide Yury Ushakov, the discussions were constructive and Moscow agreed with some American proposals, but deemed others unacceptable, and “no compromises have been found as of yet.”

Russia is open to resuming dialogue with European nations, presidential aide Yury Ushakov told journalists on Wednesday. Western European leaders are the ones who have shunned contact, not Moscow, he added.

“The Europeans are refusing all contacts… even though [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has repeatedly said that if any European leaders want to talk, they are welcome to come to Moscow.”

“For our part, we have nothing against resuming contacts,” Ushakov told a news briefing.

The EU and the UK have taken a hardline stance on the Ukraine conflict and have virtually severed all contacts with Moscow since the escalation of hostilities in February 2022.

The EU has been actively supporting Kiev with both financial and military aid and has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia. The bloc has also been seeking to seize Russian sovereign assets frozen at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium to fund Ukraine. Moscow has warned that it would regard any such move as outright “theft.”

The bloc has de facto rejected a Ukraine peace plan presented by the administration of US President Donald Trump last month, and has put forward its own set of conditions, which Moscow dismissed as “unconstructive.”

On Tuesday, Putin said the EU is still living under the illusion that it can inflict a “strategic defeat” upon Russia through the Ukraine conflict. He stated that the concept was unrealistic from the very beginning, but Brussels cannot bring itself to admit that it has been wrong all along.

The bloc “does not have a peaceful agenda. They are on the side of war,” Putin told journalists on the sidelines of the ‘Russia Calling!” business forum.

MOSCOW, December 3. /TASS/. The current Ukrainian leadership's penchant for corruption is well known, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, responding to a question from TASS.

He made the remark in the context of the EU corruption scandal involving former head of European diplomacy Federica Mogherini and former members of her staff.

""Corruption in Kiev and the corrupt habits of the Kiev regime are well known,"" Peskov said in response to a question about whether the current EU representatives could suffer the same fate, given the structure of their relations with Kiev.

On December 2, the European Commission and the European Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed that Belgian police and the European Public Prosecutor's Office had conducted searches at the headquarters of the European External Action Service in Brussels, the College of Europe in Bruges, and several private homes, during which ""three individuals were detained."" They are accused of tender fraud, including the European diplomatic service's bid for a training program for young European diplomats at the College of Europe. Those detained include Federica Mogherini, head of the College of Europe, and Stefano Sannino, former Secretary General of the European Diplomatic Service. According to Italian media, the detainees were released because ""there is no risk of them absconding.""

At the same time, Kiev finds itself in the middle of its own corruption scandal. On November 10, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced a large-scale operation dubbed Midas to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. The homes of businessman Timur Mindich, known in some circles as Vladimir Zelensky's ""wallet,"" Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later dismissed, and the company Energoatom were searched. According to investigators, participants in the criminal scheme laundered at least $100 million. That same day, NABU began publishing excerpts from recordings of conversations in Mindich's apartment in which corruption schemes were discussed. A total of 1,000 hours of audio recordings are available.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 3. /TASS/. A peace agreement on Ukraine is now closer than before, but the steps that have been taken aren't sufficient to achieve the result that will suit all, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, commenting on a five-hour-long meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov pointed out that Putin had sent a number of important political messages to US President Trump through Witkoff. However, in Ushakov's words, the parties have not yet reached a compromise on a peace plan for Ukraine. They agreed not to disclose the essence of the Moscow talks.

TASS has gathered the key points from comments on the meeting.

Rubio stated that while in Moscow, US officials had sought to find a way to settle the conflict in Ukraine, with the 20% of the Donetsk People's Republic's territory that Kiev still controls being the main point of contention.

The secretary of state noted that the US administration did not see continued support for Kiev as a realistic strategy.

According to him, the United States believes Russia and Ukraine are now closer to a peace agreement than ever in the past three years, but it's not enough to achieve the final goal.

Rubio pointed out that the US continued to work on resolving the conflict, but it was up to Moscow and Kiev to make a decision to end it.

Kirill Dmitriev, Russian special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries and director general of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), described the meeting as ""productive.""

Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov observed that the Putin-Witkoff meeting was constructive, useful, and substantive. According to him, the parties were able to thoroughly discuss ways to resolve the situation in Ukraine, particularly focusing on territorial issues.

Ushakov stated that the specific wording of Washington's peace plan had not been discussed, with the focus being on the essence of related documents. He added that Russia had received four versions of the US peace plan for Ukraine after the initial one.

According to Ushakov, no compromise on the Ukraine peace plan has been reached yet as ""some US proposals look more or less acceptable but need to be discussed."" ""Some of the proposals presented to us don't suit us. That said, work will continue,"" Ushakov elaborated.

Ushakov declined to specify the proposals Russia found unsuitable: ""We agreed with our American colleagues that we will not disclose the essence of the talks we held. This is quite logical. The talks were completely confidential and classified.""

He also said that Putin had sent a number of important political messages to US President Donald Trump through Witkoff.

After the meeting, the US delegation announced plans to return directly home instead of traveling to Kiev, Ushakov told a briefing.

Witkoff's plane did not make any intermediate stops in Europe and was handed over to Canadian air traffic controllers at about 4:45 a.m. GMT, a source in Europe's air traffic control told TASS.

The meeting between Putin and Witkoff, focused on resolving the Ukraine conflict, lasted about five hours.

The Russian delegation also involved Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries and director general of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, while the US was also represented by Jared Kushner, entrepreneur, investor, and founder of the Affinity Partners company.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BRUSSELS, December 3. /TASS/. The European Commission has approved the so-called ""potential reparations loan"" for Ukraine, which implies the use of frozen Russian assets, EC President Ursula von der Leyen announced.

""We have been discussing and then adopting proposals for a potential reparations loan,"" she said at a press conference in Brussels.

""If you look at the IMF estimates, Ukraine will need 135 billion euros for the next two years — 2026 and 2027. This is needed to keep the state and the basics services running — so it is a civilian side but also to continue the brave resistance on the battlefield — this is the military side,"" she said.

According to von der Leyen, the European Commission intends to prohibit the enforcement of foreign court decisions within the EU as part of Russia's retaliatory measures against the expropriation of its sovereign assets under the guise of a ""reparations loan,"" adding that this is supposedly intended to protect Belgium from Russia's retaliatory actions. The head of the European Commission also stated that the confiscation of Russian assets allegedly does not require a compromise, and the decision will be made by a qualified majority.

Earlier in an interview with TASS, Russian Ambassador to Belgium Denis Gonchar stated that regardless of the scheme used to cover up the expropriation of Russia's sovereign assets, it would be theft. He stressed that Russia's retaliatory measures ""will follow immediately and will force the West to count its losses.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Prosecutors say two others also indicted in investigation into funding for school training young diplomats

Europe live – latest updates

The EU's former chief diplomat Federica Mogherini and two other people have been formally accused of fraud and corruption, the European prosecutor's office has said.

The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) did not refer to Mogherini by name, but said the rector of the College of Europe in Bruges – her role – had been formally notified of the accusations. A senior staff member of the college and a senior official from the European Commission were also indicted, the EPPO said, after all three were questioned by Belgian police.

The investigation, which led to police raids on the headquarters of the EU foreign service in Brussels and the elite College of Europe postgraduate school, as well as Mogherini's home, has deeply shocked EU insiders. Prosecutors suspect fraud in the tender for a contract to run a training academy for young diplomats, which was awarded to the College of Europe by the EU foreign service.

The EPPO, the EU agency in charge of prosecuting fraud involving European funds, said the accusations concerned “procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy”. It added: “All persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the competent Belgian courts of law.”

All three have been released “as they are not considered a flight risk”, the EPPO said.

On Wednesday, Mogherini issued a statement via the College of Europe. “In its long tradition, the College has always applied and will continue to apply the highest standards of integrity and fairness,” she said. “I have full confidence in the justice system and I trust that the correctness of the College's actions will be ascertained.”

The College of Europe has said it would cooperate fully with the authorities “in the interest of transparency and respect for the investigative process”.

In a letter to staff seen by the Guardian, the EU's current foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the allegations were “deeply shocking but should in no way tarnish the good work that the vast majority of you are doing every day”.

Kallas, who is one year into a five year mandate, said integrity and accountability “will only improve under my watch” and that the current process showed “safeguards are in place and working”.

One of the accused is understood to be Stefano Sannino, a senior commission official, who was secretary general of the European External Action Service from 2021 to 2024. A request for comment sent to him was referred to the commission, which declined beyond saying it was co-operating with an investigation into activities that took place before the term of the current EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.

Mogherini was the EU's high representative for foreign affairs from 2014 to 2019, after a brief stint as Italy's foreign minister. She went on to become rector of the College of Europe, a training ground for European officials and politicians. Her appointment in 2020 proved controversial, with some alumni arguing she lacked academic credentials and experience of running a major academic institution.

The College of Europe, which receives EU funding, was awarded the tender in 2020-21 to run the European Union Diplomatic Academy, a nine-month training programme for young diplomats. Prosecutors have said they have strong suspicions that confidential information had been shared with one of the candidates taking part in the process.

The diplomatic academy was launched as a pilot project in 2022 with a budget of nearly €1m (£880,000) and the aim of “building a European diplomatic corps that shares a truly common diplomatic culture”, according to the commission website. Mogherini, who also serves as director of the academy, described it as “a great step forward” for European diplomacy.

About 40 diplomats from EU member states and institutions took part in the first nine-month programme in 2022-23, with 50 joining in the second year. In the second programme, diplomats spent four months in Bruges and a month at the EEAS headquarters in Brussels, as part of the programme where they were trained in EU policies, as well as diplomatic skills such as negotiation, communication and protocol.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Closing his opening statement, Rutte sends Nato's response to Vladimir Putin's hawkish comments that Russia did not want it, but would be “ready for war” with Europe.

He says:

“Finally, Nato is a defensive alliance. We will remain a defensive alliance, but make no mistake, we are ready and willing to do what it takes to protect our 1 billion people and secure our territory.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap for today!

The European Commission will move ahead with controversial plans to fund Ukraine with a loan based on Russia's frozen assets (13:40, 13:41, 13:46, 13:47, 13:51).

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the proposals were intended to send a message to Russia that prolonging war “comes with high cost” (13:54).

But in a concession to concerns raised by Belgium (13:02), which hosts most of the assets, the EU executive has also proposed another option: an EU loan based on common borrowing.

The move was welcomed by Ukraine, with the country's prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko saying it was “an important and responsible step forward.” (16:31).

Separately,

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has warned that the alliance faced “real and lasting dangers” with Russia's continuing attacks against Ukraine and its “reckless behaviour” towards the alliance (15:37).

In a direct rebuke to Vladimir Putin, he warned that while Nato remained a defensive alliance and had no intention to change it, it was “ready and willing to do what it takes” to defend its people and territory (15:42).

The former Dutch prime minister stressed the importance of keeping pressure on Russia, and continuing support for Ukraine (15:39, 15:41, but declined to get into speculations about the US-led peace talks (15:46, 16:01, 16:05).

Defence and security editor

Earlier this week, we covered the importance of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine amid continuing battles for control over the city.

Here's our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh explaining this once again, better than I ever could, speaking from Ukraine.

And if you're trying to understand the latest discussion on what Ukrainian territories Russia seems to be demanding to be recognised as Russian as part of a peace settlement, here's a brilliant visual explainer by Seán Clarke.

The European Commission has proposed providing Ukraine with €90bn in funding over two years, which it says will meet two-thirds of Kyiv's financing needs for 2026 and 2027 and allow it to engage in peace talks “from a position of strength”.

There are two options for generating the money.

It could be a “reparations loan” based on Russian assets frozen in the bloc, the option favoured by the commission but strongly resisted by Belgium, which hosts most of the assets.

Alternatively, in a concession to Belgium, the commission has also proposed common EU borrowing: raising the money on international capital markets, secured by the bloc's long-term budget.

Here is how Russia's frozen assets could be used to help fund all or part of the package, which still needs to be formally signed off by the European parliament and national leaders in the European Council.

Poland's foreign minister Radosław Sikorski told journalists that after today's talks in Brussels the Nato-Russia Council, a consultation forum established in 2002, “no longer exists.”

He said the body had been “created in times when it seemed that European security could be built with Russia, [but] those times [are] now gone due to Russian decisions on invasions.”

“Today, we are creating European security against Russia, and this has finally found its institutional expression,” he said.

Responding to Putin's hawkish comments towards Europe last night, Sikorski insisted that “Russia is in a significantly weaker position than it imagines itself to be.”

“Perhaps Putin is being lied to [to think that's not the case], but in a certain way, the fact that he threatens us is useful, because it focuses minds here on the issue of supporting Ukraine.”

He also commented on the EU's proposal for the reparations loan for Ukraine, saying it was a mechanism that “could decide the outcome of this war.”

“If Putin concludes that Ukraine has this money and can finance both the state and its defence for two or three years, he will have to recalculate (whether) he can afford to continue his war for 2-3 years,” he said.

Sikorski said he backed calls for the Belgian PM to drop his opposition stressing that “unblocking these assets for Ukraine could the the biggest factor accelerating peace,” but he said he understood Belgium's concerns about risks, and he hoped the commission's proposals would offer enough reassurance.

Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko has welcomed the EU's proposal to push ahead with long-term financing for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets, saying it was “an important and responsible step forward.”

“A stable, predictable, and justice-based approach gives our people confidence, protects essential public services, and strengthens Ukraine's path toward full European integration,” she said.

She added the proposal also “reaffirmed fundamental truth: aggression must never be rewarded, and accountability must remain central to Europe's response.”

“We look forward to continued close cooperation with all EU Member States and to the European Council's final endorsement,” she said.

“Ukraine continues to do its part – with steady resolve, clear purpose, and unbroken determination. And with European unity behind us, we have both the means and the will to prevail together.”

in Rome

Pope Leo has stressed the importance of Europe's involvement in US efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine, while suggesting that Italy specifically could play the role of mediator.

Russia and the US failed to make progress towards a peace deal for Ukraine during talks on Tuesday, with Vladimir Putin accusing Europe of “preventing the US administration from achieving peace on Ukraine”.

Speaking to reporters onboard the papal flight as he returned on Tuesday from a trip to Turkey and Lebanon, Leo said: “It is clear that, on the one hand, the president of the United States is thinking he can promote a peace plan that he would like to carry out and that, at least at first, is without Europe.

“But Europe's presence is important, and that first proposal was also modified because of what Europe was saying.”

It looks like they reached the same conclusion as the last variation of this question ends the press conference.

It feels like we're going round in circles now.

Rutte faces a yet another version of the same question as journalists try to pin down how does he intend to change the dynamics in the peace talks.

And he gives the same answer that he does not want to offer a running commentary on the talks as that would not be helpful, and that the allies just need to keep pressure on Russia.

Rutte faces also questions from somewhat sceptical journalists as to what is the alliance's Plan B if the US walk away from the talks and supporting Ukraine.

He dismisses the suggestion, but says the key thing is to “make sure Ukraine has the weapons it needs to fight the war,” but also points out to increasingly severe impact of sanctions on the Russian economy.

“All of this is putting pressure on the Russians and we will continue doing so,” he says.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Supreme Court yesterday denied an appeal by retired Military Intelligence Bureau colonel Chang Chao-jan (張超然) and upheld the High Court's ruling, which sentenced Chang to one-and-a-half years in prison for contravening Article 2 of the National Security Act (國家安全法).

Chang's affiliate and fellow officer Chou Tian-tzu (周天慈) was given a one year, two months prison sentence, while retired army major general Yue Chih-chung (岳志忠) was given 10 months. Retired bureau colonel Wang Ta-wang (王大旺) was declared not guilty.

The four were indicted for contravening the National Security Act and the National Intelligence Services Act (國家情報工作法).

The Taipei District Court held a closed hearing on the case in September last year, and the High Court upheld the ruling in February.

According to the ruling, during a mission to render aid to a retired bureau colonel surnamed Lu (陸), who was then being detained in Shenzhen, China, Chang made the acquaintance of a Chinese national security official surnamed Wei (韋) and agreed to spy for China.

Chang later turned fellow officer Chou and started facilitating travel, and room and board in China for retired bureau officers, the ruling said.

Chang sought to recruit Yue when he facilitated Yue's and Chou's travel to China in 2012 to visit family by arranging a meeting between Yue and Wei in Macau in August that year, the ruling said.

The visit not only provided China with the opportunity to learn of Chou's and Yue's positions and affairs in the bureau, but also enabled Chou to identify Taiwanese agents for China, it said.

Yue received HK$6,000 (US$771 at the current exchange rate) and bought a handbag for about NT$30,000 when returning to Taiwan.

Chou and Yue traveled to  Guangdong in June 2016, with Chou receiving US$3,000 and returning to Taiwan, while Chinese officials accompanied Yue, and paid his expenses, on his way to Zhengzhou to visit relatives, the ruling said.

In a separate incident, Chang arranged for retired bureau colonel Wang to visit relatives in China in August 2016, but Wang had been taken away by Chinese national security agents after landing at Guangzhou airport, it said.

Chang asked his contacts to intervene, and Wang agreed to join the cell to get out of his predicament, allegedly leaking information about the whereabouts of 24 colleagues at the bureau,  the ruling said.



                                                                                Taipei and Kaohsiung  have extended an open invitation to Japanese pop star Ayumi Hamasaki after Chinese authorities abruptly canceled  her scheduled concert in Shanghai.
Hamasaki, 47, had been slated to perform on Saturday before organizers pulled the show at the last minute, citing “force majeure,” a move widely viewed as retaliation for Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's recent remark that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could draw a military response from Tokyo.
Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) yesterday said the city “very much welcomes” Hamasaki's return and would continue to “surprise” her.

Bureau Director-General Lin Fu-shan (林福山) said the government started TPass 2.0 to offer rebates to frequent riders of public transportation, or people who use city buses, highway buses, trains or MRTs at least 11 times per month.  
As of Nov. 12, 265,000 people have registered for TPass 2.0, and about 16.56 million trips between February and September qualified for                                    



                                                                                The year 2027 is regarded as the year China would likely gain the capability to invade Taiwan, not the year it would launch an invasion, Taiwanese defense experts said yesterday.
The experts made the remarks after President William Lai (賴清德) told a news conference on Wednesday that his administration would introduce a NT$1.25 trillion (US$39.8 billion) special defense budget bill to boost Taiwan's overall defense posture over the next eight years.
Lai said that Beijing aims for military unification of Taiwan by 2027. The Presidential Office later clarified that what Lai meant was that China's goal is to “prepare for military unification

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Ukraine attacked the Druzhba oil pipeline on Dec. 1, despite Hungary and Slovakia previously urging Kyiv to refrain from further attacks.

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. It remains a lifeline for Hungary and Slovakia, the only EU countries still importing Russian crude through the system.

The Dec. 1 attack on the oil pipeline was carried out near the village of Kazinskie Vyselki in Tambov Oblast on the Taganrog-Lipetsk section of the pipeline, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.

According to the source, remote-controlled explosives, combined with additional combustible mixtures, were used to destroy the oil pipeline section.

""The Russian oil network, as the main source of income for the aggressor state and financing for the military-industrial complex, will continue to explode and burn until the enemy stops trying to attack Ukraine,"" the source said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Previously, Ukraine carried out several attacks on the Druzhba pipeline, including at multiple attacks in August, resulting in a temporary disruption of operations.

Hungary and Slovakia, whose leaders maintain close ties with Moscow, have repeatedly resisted tougher EU measures against Russia and argue that Russian energy supplies should not be restricted until viable alternatives are in place.

Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure have drawn sharp criticism from both countries, which urged Kyiv not to target the Druzhba pipeline.

On March 11,  after Ukraine struck the pipeline in Russia's Oryol Oblast, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Ukraine to refrain from attacking the energy infrastructure supplying Hungary, as ""Hungary's energy supply is a matter of sovereignty.""

Following a meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Uzhhorod on Sept. 5, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would not halt its retaliatory strikes in response to ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities.The EU has largely phased out Russian oil imports following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

However, the Druzhba pipeline's southern branch remains active under exemptions for certain Central European countries.

The Kyiv Appeals Court ordered on Dec. 3 the release of Ruslan Mahamedrasulov, a detective with Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), who had been investigating the country's largest corruption case involving the state-run nuclear power monopoly Energoatom.

European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said that the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine's needs over the next two years, which she said amounts to 90 billion euros, leaving the rest to international partners. 

 The Kyiv Independent's Martin Fornusek speaks with U.S. Senator Peter Welch about the bipartisan Senate backlash to the Trump administration's 28-point Ukraine peace plan. Welch explains why the U.S. must defer to Ukraine on the terms of peace and why he supports tougher sanctions and stronger military aid to counter Russia's aggression.



Only about 19.4% of Ukrainians consider a potential entry into NATO as the best possible security guarantee, a 10% drop from last year, according to a survey.

""The Russian oil network... will continue to explode and burn,"" a source told the Kyiv Independent.

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 2 as part of the U.S. effort to advance negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

Top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who took part in the talks, called the meeting ""very useful, constructive, and highly substantive"" but said no concrete deal was agreed upon — a statement suggesting that a final peace agreement remains far off.

The five-hour meeting, originally set for 5 p.m. local time, began nearly three hours late, as Putin attended an investment forum where he issued veiled threats toward Europe. 

On the Russian side, the talks were led by Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator. Witkoff was joined by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump.

""So far, no compromise version of a peace settlement has been found, but some American proposals look more or less acceptable… the work will continue,"" Ushakov said.

Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Putin rejected the U.S. peace plan, claiming that some parts of the proposal were accepted and some were not.

The meeting took place as Putin signals he sees no need for concessions, having dismissed prospects for progress days earlier and tied any ceasefire to Ukraine withdrawing from unoccupied territory — a nonstarter for Kyiv.

Zelensky said on Dec. 2 that if talks with the Russian side proceed smoothly, he could meet with the U.S. president soon, though ""everything depends on today's discussions.""

""They want to report to us immediately after their meeting. I think the next steps will depend on these signals,"" he said, adding that he is ready to meet with Trump.

Axios journalist Barak Ravid reported on Dec. 2 that after their Moscow trip, Kushner and Witkoff were expected to meet Zelensky in an unspecified European country. Ukraine's president traveled to France and Ireland earlier in the week.

After the talks concluded, Ushakov claimed that the two U.S. envoys ""promised they wouldn't go to Kyiv, but they promised they'd return home"" to Washington.

The White House has not responded to the Kyiv Independent's request for comment.

Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport earlier in the day, where they were welcomed by Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund. The three then walked together through central Moscow and had lunch at a local restaurant.

Peskov said Witkoff would present Putin with the latest version of the U.S.-Ukraine framework drafted during recent rounds of talks in Geneva and Florida.

Those discussions involved Witkoff, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Kushner, who met a Ukrainian delegation led by Umerov in Hallandale Beach on Nov. 30.

A White House official told the Kyiv Independent that Witkoff and Umerov held another meeting in Florida on Dec. 1 as part of ongoing efforts to revise the U.S.-backed plan.

Zelensky, along with French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, also held a phone call with Witkoff to discuss the outcomes of the discussions in Florida.

The original draft of the 28-point peace plan, unveiled in November, required Kyiv to cap the size of its military, abandon its NATO membership bid, and withdraw from some of the territories it controls.

A source in the Presidential Office previously told the Kyiv Independent that Witkoff shaped the first version of the proposal in direct coordination with Dmitriev, who's long been involved in Moscow's efforts to influence U.S. decision-making.

The Moscow visit marks Witkoff's sixth high-level meeting with Putin. Earlier sessions, held on Feb. 11, March 13, April 11 and 25, and in August, each lasted three to four hours.

Witkoff's role has drawn renewed scrutiny after leaked conversations published by Bloomberg showed him advising a Russian official on how to sway the White House.

Washington now waits to see whether Putin will accept or reject the newest framework, though experts the Kyiv Independent spoke with say expectations remain low.

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,379 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

Russian missile struck the city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast on Dec. 3, injuring at least four people, including a child, Ukraine's Emergency Service reported.

The 3-year-old girl and a 28-year-old victim will receive outpatient treatment, while an 87-year-old woman was hospitalized in a condition of moderate severity, according to Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko.

The attack also set garages on fire and damaged an administrative building.

Last updated 6:17 p.m. Kyiv time.

Former Russian Ground Forces commander Vladimir Chirkin criticized Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, saying Russia was ""once again"" unprepared for war, in an interview with pro-Kremlin media outlet RBC published on Nov. 27.

""Moreover, we had the traditional underestimation of the opponent and overestimation of our own military,"" Chirkin said.

Chirkin referred to Russia's reported plan to ""seize Kyiv in three days,"" saying that Russia had ""Tbilisi Syndrome,"" and memories of the events of the five-day war with Georgia in 2008, but in Ukraine's case, it ""did not turn out that way.""

""During the first few weeks, we were taught a serious, harsh lesson, and the former defense minister tried to find a face-saving exit from the situation, calling what was happening a 'gesture of goodwill',"" Chirkin said.

The former commander blamed ""the entire Russian intelligence community"" for the withdrawal from Kyiv Oblast, saying that the country's leadership was given false information that ""70% of the Ukrainian population is with us, and 30% is against us.""

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) has identified 13 companies involved in producing the Russian 9M723 ballistic missile for the Iskander-M system that are not subject to sanctions, the agency said in a Dec. 3 statement.

The non-sanctioned firms include producers of solid fuel charges for missile engines, circuit boards for the Kometa satellite antenna system, and spare parts for missile navigation systems.

Thirteen of the 49 companies involved are not subject to sanctions by any member of the international sanctions coalition, according to the statement.

At the same time, the primary contractor for state contracts related to the development and production of 9M723 missiles is the Russian Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering, with the weapons manufactured at the Votkinsk Plant. 

Both entities are subject to sanctions by most of Ukraine's partner countries, the statement read.

""The weapons Russia is using against Ukraine today could be used by Russia and its allies against other countries in the future. In particular, Russia has already assisted North Korea in modernizing its KN-23 and KN-24 ballistic missiles,"" HUR said.

Ukrainian forces are establishing additional logistics routes to supply units in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, where heavy fighting continues, the East Group of Forces reported on Dec. 3.

Search and assault operations aimed at clearing Russian troops from urban areas are ongoing in Pokrovsk. In Myrnohrad, Ukrainian units are holding defensive lines and neutralizing Russian forces on the city's approaches, the report said.

Russian troops lost 517 personnel in this sector of the front over the past day, according to the East Group of Forces.

Last updated 2:10 p.m. Kyiv time.

The Third Army Corps of the Ukrainian Armed Forces denied Russian claims of a breakthrough in the city of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast, releasing a video on Dec. 3 showing a captured Russian soldier.

In the released footage, a soldier with the call sign ""Ptitsa"" (""Bird"" in English), identified as a member of the 37th Regiment, said Russian military correspondent Timofey Yermakov publicly revealed his unit's location in Lyman. 

The disclosure enabled Ukrainian forces to capture some Russian troops and destroy part of his unit, he said. 

""The corps' units repel about 40 (Russian) assaults a day on the approaches to Lyman and do not allow the enemy to enter the city,"" Brigadier General Andrii Biletskyi, commander of the corps, said.

Russian forces have attempted dozens of small-group infiltrations on Lyman's outskirts over the past month, with soldiers either killed or taken prisoner during the operations, the statement read.

Ukraine attacked the Druzhba oil pipeline on Dec. 1, despite Hungary and Slovakia previously urging Kyiv to refrain from further attacks.

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day (bpd), is a critical conduit for oil from Russian fields to European refineries. It remains a lifeline for Hungary and Slovakia, the only EU countries still importing Russian crude through the system.

The Dec. 1 attack on the oil pipeline was carried out near the village of Kazinskie Vyselki in Tambov Oblast on the Taganrog-Lipetsk section of the pipeline, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.

According to the source, remote-controlled explosives, combined with additional combustible mixtures, were used to destroy the oil pipeline section.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Last updated 1:33 p.m. Kyiv time.

Five NATO allies confirmed on Dec. 3 new purchases of U.S. defense materiel for Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL).

During a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels, two joint upcoming PURL packages, each worth $500 million, were announced: one co-financed by Germany, Norway, and Poland, and another by Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has not yet shown any real willingness to negotiate,"" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in Berlin on Dec. 3, prior to his departure for Brussels.

""That is why we are maintaining pressure on Russia, and, as allies in NATO, intend to increase it further.""

Last updated 12:52 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukrainian negotiators will meet European national security advisers in Brussels on Dec. 3 to discuss peace efforts before holding another meeting with U.S. envoys, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, and Andrii Hnatov, the chief of staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, will brief European officials on Russian-U.S. talks in Moscow on Dec. 2 and ""discuss the European component of the necessary security architecture.""

The comments follow a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to Moscow to discuss a revised U.S.-Ukraine peace plan with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who participated in the talks, described the meeting as ""very useful, constructive, and highly substantive,"" but noted that no concrete agreement was reached.

Ukraine and its European allies accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday of feigning interest in peace efforts after five hours of talks with U.S. envoys at the Kremlin produced no breakthrough.

The Russian leader “should end the bluster and the bloodshed and be ready to come to the table and to support a just and lasting peace,” said U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged Putin to “stop wasting the world's time.”

The remarks reflect the high tensions and gaping gulf that remain between Russia on one side and Ukraine and its European allies on the other over how to end a war that Moscow started when it invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago.

No Ukraine compromise reached in meeting between Putin and U.S. envoys, Russia says

A day earlier, Putin accused the Europeans of sabotaging the U.S.-led peace efforts – and warned that, if provoked, Russia would be ready for war with Europe.

Since the 2022 invasion, European governments, along with the U.S., have spent billions of dollars to support Kyiv financially and militarily. Under President Donald Trump, however, the U.S. has tempered its support – and instead made a push to end the war.

Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said Tuesday's talks at the Kremlin between Putin and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were “positive” but wouldn't release any details.

Putin met Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in the Kremlin as part of a renewed push by the Trump administration to broker a peace deal.

Where the peace talks go from here depends largely on whether the Trump administration decides to increase the pressure on Russia or on Ukraine to make concessions.

A U.S. peace proposal that became public last month was criticized for being tilted heavily toward Moscow because it granted some of the Kremlin's core demands that Kyiv has rejected as non-starters.

Many European leaders worry that if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine, it will have free rein to threaten their countries, which already have faced incursions from Russian drones and fighter jets, and an alleged widespread sabotage campaign. 

The Russian and American sides agreed Tuesday not to disclose the substance of their Kremlin talks, but at least one major hurdle to a settlement remains – the fate of four Ukrainian regions Russia partially seized and occupies and claims as its own.

After the talks, Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Putin, told reporters that “so far, a compromise hasn't been found” on the issue of territory, without which, he said, the Kremlin sees “no resolution to the crisis.”

Analysis: Duelling peace plans show relief for Ukraine remains a long way off

Ukraine has ruled out giving up territory that Russia has captured.

Asked whether peace was closer or further away after these talks, Ushakov said: “Not further, that's for sure.”

“But there's still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and in Moscow,” he said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it was “not correct” to say that Putin had rejected the U.S. peace plan. He declined to comment further on the talks.

“We're deliberately not going to add anything,” he said. “It's understood that the quieter these negotiations are conducted, the more productive they will be.”

Foreign ministers from European NATO countries, meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, showed little patience with Moscow.

“What we see is that Putin has not changed any course. He's pushing more aggressively on the battlefield,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. “It's pretty obvious that he doesn't want to have any kind of peace.”

Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen struck the same note. “So far we haven't seen any concessions from the side of the aggressor, which is Russia, and I think the best confidence-building measure would be to start with a full ceasefire,” she told reporters.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Ukraine's partners will keep sending it military aid to ensure pressure is maintained on Moscow.

“The peace talks are ongoing. That's good,” Rutte said.

“But at the same time, we have to make sure that whilst they take place and we are not sure when they will end, that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to keep the fight going, to fight back against the Russians,” he said.

Canada, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands announced that they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars more together to buy U.S. weapons to donate to Ukraine.

Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump administration has not approved donations of weapons to Ukraine. Instead, it has sold them directly to Kyiv or to NATO allies that give them to Ukraine.

Russia and Ukraine are engaged in a grim war of attrition on the battlefield and are using drones and missiles for long-range strikes behind the front line. Many analysts have noted that the slow slog favours Russia's larger military, especially if disagreements between Europe and the U.S. or among Europeans hampers the delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

Russian drones hit the town of Ternivka in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, killing two people and injuring three more, the head of the regional military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, said Wednesday.

Two people were in critical condition, he said, after the attack destroyed one house and damaged six more.

Overall, Russia fired 111 strike and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine's air force said.

Meanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that air defences destroyed 102 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Falling drone debris sparked a fire at an oil depot in the Tambov region, about 200 kilometres south of Moscow, local Gov. Yegveniy Pervyshov said.

The German president is visiting London amid increasing security ties between the UK and Germany. Meanwhile, the Left Party has paved the way for a fraught pension bill to overcome an inner-CDU rebellion. DW has more. 

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is in the UK for a 3-day state visit.

He was received by King Charles and met Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He will speak in the UK Parliament on Thursday.

Steinmeier is the first German president to get a state visit in the UK in 27 years.

For the latest on this and other news, analysis and background from Germany on Wednesday, December 3, keep reading:

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Downing Street, praising close cooperation between the two countries. 

Starmer said Britain and Germany are working together on Ukraine, migration, trade and economic growth, saying the partnership from was going from ""from strength to strength.""

Steinmeier noted relations are in far better shape than during the difficult post-Brexit years.

""We have to engage in improving the situation and coming closer in this changing world with new threats to all of us,"" he told Starmer.

The two leaders joined a roundtable with UK and German business leaders. 

Steinmeier's three-day state visit includes a banquet and a speech to Parliament, underscoring a renewed security alliance that has helped rebuild London-Berlin relations.

Following criticism from India's Ministry of External Affairs of an opinion piece co-authored by Germany's ambassador that criticized the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, the German Foreign Ministry has rejected its accusation that the article represented ""unacceptable diplomatic practice.""

In response to a question from DW, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Martin Giese said the assessment of Russia's behavior contained in the article was ""completely shared by almost all countries across the world.""

""This kind of information in a daily newspaper is precisely the task that our ambassadors have to carry out worldwide. It is not interference but a representation of the German position,"" he said.

""We stand up for this here in Germany; we stand up for this across the world,"" he said, adding: ""And here, we completely have our ambassadors' backs.""

The op-ed, co-written by German Ambassador Philipp Ackermann together with his counterparts from France and Britain and published in the Times of India, was entitled ""World wants the Ukraine war to end, but Russia doesn't seem serious about peace.""

It was published just days before Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to arrive in India on a state visit on Thursday.

Germany is set to host the women's Euros in 2029. In a bid process that saw Italy and then Portugal drop out, Germany was victorious over bids from Poland, aiming to become the first Eastern European nation to host a women's tournament, and a joint bid from Denmark and Sweden. 

Germany hosted the men's Euros in 2024, but this is Germany's women's first tournament since the 2011 World Cup. The last women's Euros was even longer ago, back in 2001, which was a tournament that Germany also won.

Beata Zschäpe, the convicted neo-Nazi and member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) terror group, showed remorse for her crimes in court on Wednesday.

""I am ashamed,"" the 50-year-old told the Dresden court.

She was speaking during the trial of her alleged confidante, Susann E., who is being prosecuted for allegedly supporting the NSU, providing Zschäpe with her insurance card and personal details.

Zschäpe was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to life. She said she had only become aware of the impact of her crimes, which included several murders, during her trial and that she had now come to terms with her sentence.

She was part of the NSU along with Uwe Böhnhardt and Uwe Mundlos. They carried out 10 murders across Germany between 2000 and 2011. The victims were mostly Turkish and Greek businessowners as well as one police woman.

Zschäpe's accomplices killed themselves after the network was uncovered.

The Left Party has said it will abstain on Friday's vote on the pension reform package, practically ensuring that the vote will now pass.

By abstaining, they lower the needed majority from 316 votes to just 252.

The coalition government currently has 328 seats, but 18 members of the youth wing of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's own party had threatened to vote against the bill. Its failure would have put a strain on the already fractured coalition.

The bill aims to keep pensions at 48% of the average income. The young conservatives had feared this would prove too high a cost borne by younger generations in the long term.

The Left Party members justified their abstention, saying they were afraid a failed pension bill would see the rate fall below 48%. 

""We won't accept the pension rate being further squeezed and have therefore decided as a party to abstain from the planned vote on the government's pension package on Friday,"" said Heidi Reichinnek, the leader of the Left Party in the Bundestag.

Germany is finally looking to ratify the 2023 UN-agreed High Seas Treaty.

The treaty had already been signed by 160 countries, including Germany, but needs a formal law to be fully ratified. A draft bill was approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday and will now go to the Bundestag for a vote.

The treaty allows for the creation of marine protected zones on the high seas and calls for environmental assessments of human activities, such as fishing.

""The oceans are vital for our survival. They produce oxygen, provide us with food and are the largest ecosystem on the planet,"" Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said.

He added that they are under extreme pressure due to plastic pollution, overfishing, climate change and chemicals.

The high seas are not part of any national sovereignty and until the 2023 treaty had no environmental rules governing them.

The victims of sexual abuse in schools have often been left alone, without any help, a study from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in Germany has found.

The study found many cases where teachers and other school staff knew about the abuse but failed to intervene.

They often ignored assaults or even covered them up to protect the school's reputation.

The study included 133 reports from between 1949 and 2010.

It found that girls made up 80% of the victims, with the vast majority of perpetrators being men.

The assaults and abuse were reported to mostly have taken place inside the school building, in sport halls, changing rooms and classrooms.

In most cases, they were not one-off cases with many reports of perceived ""romantic"" relationships between teachers and students.

""The affected were often only able to recognize the manipulation and name the abuse retrospectively,"" the study said.

More and more German companies are unhappy with the country's famously strict data protection laws that they think are inhibiting digitalization and AI development, according to a survey published on Wednesday by Bitkom.

Some 603 companies from a range of sectors were surveyed.

Here are the main results of the survey:

""Artificial intelligence is the deciding future technology and AI needs data,"" Bitkom expert Susanne Dehmel said.

""The data protection regulations should be reviewed with a view to Germany's position in the future AI world,"" she added.

According to a KPMG study from May, around two-thirds of Germans use AI, but only around one-third trust it.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul joined his NATO counterparts in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss further support for Ukraine.

Wadephul said Berlin will provide an additional $200 million (€171.6 million) worth of military equipment for Ukraine through NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism.

Ahead of the meeting, the German foreign minister said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has not yet shown any real willingness to negotiate.""

""Putin wants to continue undermining European and Euro-Atlantic security. He wants to test our defense readiness. He wants to divide us in order to weaken our alliance,"" he said.

""But he will not succeed,"" Wadephul added.

Following Tuesday's test vote on the contentious pension reform package, its opponents have been told to come forward by midday on Wednesday for talks with senior members of the conservative bloc.

Although the vote showed a majority would support the bill on Friday when it will be voted on in the Bundestag, there were still many who voted ""no.""

Those against the reform are from the youth wing of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU bloc. They have said it will be too costly, with the burden falling on younger generations.

Amid fears of what might happen to the strained coalition government if the vote fails on Friday, those who did vote ""no"" have been told to come forward so that they can have one-on-one chats with senior lawmakers.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's state visit to the United Kingdom comes as the two countries have been enjoying closer relations, especially on issues of security, following years of post-Brexit fracture.

Steinmeier will meet with King Charles at Windsor Castle — reciprocating the meeting the two had in Berlin's Bellevue Palace in 2023 when Charles made his first state visit as monarch to Germany.

The president will also be given the rare opportunity to speak to British lawmakers in Parliament as well as hold talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The visit talks are expected to focus on support for Ukraine and security for Europe.

On Friday, Steinmeier is set to visit Coventry, a city devastated by German air raids during the Second World War.

Steinmeier was serving as foreign minister during the Brexit vote and spoke of ""irresponsible politicians"" who ""lured"" people into leaving the EU at the time. But German-British relations have improved in the last few years, especially under former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now Starmer.

The US government is suspending all immigration requests from 19 countries, saying it is tightening national security screenings. Critics have warned that this will leave thousands of people in legal limbo.

The US government on Tuesday suspended the processing of all immigration applications from 19 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

President Donald Trump's administration cited national security concerns as the basis for the move after an attack on National Guard members in Washington last week. An Afghan national was arrested as a suspect.

Under the new policy, all applicants from the affected countries must undergo a comprehensive vetting process. The administration has not specified how long the pause will last or whether additional nations could be added.

Officials said the shift is intended to ensure the integrity of the immigration system and prevent what they called ""security gaps."" Critics warn the move could leave thousands in legal uncertainty while the review continues.

Several of the countries on the list were already subject to a partial travel ban.

Countries facing the most severe restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. These states saw full suspensions on most entries in June, with limited exceptions.

Others on the list — Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela — had partial restrictions and will now see expanded scrutiny.

The new policy places a hold on pending applications and mandates a comprehensive re-review of all cases from the affected nations. This may include new interviews and security assessments.

Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the organization had received reports of cancelled oath ceremonies, naturalization interviews and adjustment-of-status appointments for individuals from countries on the list.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has prioritized immigration enforcement, expanding federal deployments to major US cities and further limiting access to asylum at the US-Mexico border. While deportations have been at the center of his messaging, legal immigration had received comparatively less attention until now.

Meanwhile, US federal authorities are believed to be preparing a focused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota that would primarily target Somali immigrants living unlawfully in the country.

A person familiar with the planning told the AP news agency that an ICE swoop could begin in the coming days and would concentrate on individuals in the Minneapolis–St Paul area who have final deportation orders. 

US President Donald Trump has recently intensified his rhetoric about the state's Somali community with remarks that community leaders say have increased fears of profiling and inflamed local concerns.

A drunken raccoon has been found passed out at the scene of a “break-in” at an off-licence in the US.

Staff at the liquor shop in Virginia arrived at work on Saturday morning to find bottles smashed amid puddles of scotch and whiskey.

They worried they had been burgled, before spotting the animal asleep on the bathroom floor.

Hanover County Animal Protection and Shelter confirmed one of its animal control officers, Samantha Martin, had been called to the “chaotic scene”.

“Upon arrival, she discovered the ‘suspect' had broken in, ransacked several shelves, and then … passed out in the bathroom,” the shelter said in a social media post.

“The suspect? A very intoxicated raccoon.”

It's believed the animal had spent Friday night at the Ashland ABC Store ransacking shelves after dropping down from the roof through a broken ceiling tile.

The raccoon was found lying face down between the toilet and bin of the staff toilets.

Ms Martin told the Associated Press that the animal had drunk from bottles of alcohol, which were found smashed on the shop floor.

“He fell through one of the ceiling tiles and went on a full-blown rampage, drinking everything,” she said.

“Another day in the life of an animal control officer, I guess.”

			Pete Hegseth defends Adml Frank ‘Mitch' Bradley who reportedly directed second strike on alleged Caribbean drug boat

“Let's make one thing crystal clear: Adml Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100 per cent support,” Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said on Monday.

Mr Hegseth put out the statement, ostensibly defending his colleague, after it emerged survivors of an attack on a US military strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat on Sept 2 had been blown up in a follow-up attack.

Adml Frank “Mitch” Bradley directed a second strike from the operation room in Fort Bragg, North Carolina after Mr Hegseth issued an order to “kill them all”, according to The Washington Post.

But just who issued that order, and who was responsible for the second strike, has become the subject of a fierce blame game at the centre of the Pentagon.

Some have accused Mr Hegseth of attempting to pin the blame on Adml Bradley while feigning support for the beleaguered naval officer. “He doesn't have an honourable bone in his whole body,” one Pentagon source said of the defence secretary.

Following days of intense scrutiny following The Washington Post's report, Mr Hegseth has repeatedly sought to distance himself from the mission, which former military lawyers believe is either murder or a war crime.

“I stand by [Adml Bradley] and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since. America is fortunate to have such men protecting us. When this department of war says we have the back of our warriors — we mean it,” he wrote on social media on Monday.

Then at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Mr Hegseth said he did not see any survivors on the burning wreckage of the boat.

“But I stand [by it] because the thing was on fire. It was exploded in fire and smoke. You can't see anything...This is called the fog of war,” he said.

On Sunday, Donald Trump also appeared to distance himself from the issue. He said Mr Hegseth “said he did not say that, and I believe him, 100 per cent”. Mr Trump added that he would look into it and said he “wouldn't have wanted that, not a second strike”.

During his cabinet meeting, he said he still did not have “a lot of information”.

“I didn't know about the second strike. I didn't know anything about [two] people. I wasn't involved, and I knew they took out a boat, but... I hear the gentleman that was in charge of that is an extraordinary person,” he said.

Official sources told the New York Times that Mr Hegseth did not set out what should happen if a first missile turned out not to kill those on board or destroy the boat.

They added that his order was not a response to surveillance footage showing that at least two people on the boat survived the first blast.

At the White House on Monday, Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, said Mr Hegseth had authorised the special operations commander overseeing the attack, Adml Bradley, “to conduct these kinetic strikes”.

She said Adml Bradley had “worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated”.

Ms Leavitt's comments have sparked a backlash at the Pentagon, amid concerns that the White House is throwing “service members under the bus”.

A Pentagon source said Adml Bradley would have known the second strike was unlawful, but accused Mr Hegseth of attempting to scapegoat his subordinate.

“I am disgusted that Hegseth is trying to shirk all responsibility,” they told The Telegraph. “That guy doesn't have an honourable bone in his body.”

Many inside the Pentagon were “appalled” that the US was “murdering people without any due process,” the source added.

“Most people in the military hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of society – and this just demoralises the ranks even further by casting shade on what we stand for.”

Mr Hegseth has previously argued that the US has been unfairly constrained by military lawyers and too squeamish about its conduct on the battlefield.

“The New York Times and the Left and Democrats... all they do is take one incident and yell ‘war criminal,'” he told a podcast last year, before he was nominated as defence secretary. “They never actually understand the context of what happened.”

“I think the concern is he's throwing somebody under the bus, rather than saying, ‘I gave an unclear order, it's on me', rather than saying, ‘hey, look, you know, he did everything he could do,'” Victor Hasen, a professor at New England Law Boston, said.

“I mean, it's kind of a very Washingtonian inside the beltway bureaucratic dodge, to subtly shift the blame by not shifting the blame, so to speak.”

It has placed Adml Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), at the centre of the furore over this controversial mission.

On Thursday, Adml Bradley is expected to give a classified brief to the House and Senate armed services committees on the September strike as both Republican and Democratic politicians try to clarify details of what happened.

A US naval academy graduate, Adml Bradley has been a US navy Seal officer since 1992. He was among the first service members to deploy into Afghanistan following 9/11 and has served multiple tours in command of joint task forces.

In October the father-of-four, who is from Eldorado, Texas, was promoted to lead US Special Operations Command, JSOC's parent organisation, which oversees elite units across the military.

Since the first strikes were carried out, bipartisan politicians and experts have questioned the legal justification for them.

Lawyers, professors and politicians have pushed back on the Trump administration's claim that the US is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which has been used as a basis to justify the strikes.

But experts have claimed that even if the US was in a conflict with the cartels, the alleged killing of two survivors clinging to the burning shipwreck would have violated law.

“Even if we go with the administration's very stretched and I think improper theory that the United States is in a non international armed conflict, the law is very clear that shipwreck personnel are to be respected and protected under the laws of war,” said Rachel E VanLandingham, professor at Southwestern Law School and retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.

“Adml Bradley should never have issued that order. He has legal and moral culpability for that, so do the folks that followed his order, because I believe it was patently, manifestly unlawful,” she added.

“That is, his order triggered a duty to disobey, a legal duty to disobey, which doesn't occur very often, because usually there's the presumption of the legality of all orders that are issued by a competent authority that relate to a military duty.”

Mr Hasen agreed that regardless of the type of conflict, it would be unlawful to order individuals who no longer pose a threat to be killed.

“Whether they emanate from the secretary of defence, whether they emanate from somebody else in the chain of command, the orders would be illegal, and even if a superior ordered it, if it's an illegal order, it would be illegal to pass on and follow that order,” he said.

“So potential liability could include not only those who issued the initial order, but those who obey the order... It could be the trigger pullers, the people who literally pushed the buttons to launch the missiles. It could be those within the military chain of command who ordered them to do so. It could go all the way up to the secretary of defence for ordering, if the order was, in fact, to kill everybody,” he said.

But Mr Hasen said while Mr Hegseth could potentially be charged under federal law and those involved in the strikes could be prosecuted in military or civilian court, even if the strikes are ruled as unlawful he does not believe any action will be taken.

“Nobody's getting prosecuted here, that is not going to happen... nobody's going to face criminal prosecution for this, because at this level, it is a political issue more than a legal issue,” he said.

“The United States has a pretty long history, and we're not unique in that, but most militaries have a pretty long history of not prosecuting senior leaders, even if arguably a prosecution could be made, it's usually more of a situation where their careers are ended quietly, or maybe not so quietly,” he said.

The consequences for Mr Hegseth could be political, if Mr Trump determines sticking by him is a political liability.

Eugene R Fidell, senior research scholar in law at Yale Law School, said he believed there could be grounds to impeach Mr Trump or Mr Hegseth for the strikes, but such a move would again be unlikely.

“The uniformed people could be tried in court martial or in theory, they could be tried in federal district court, but remember, nobody can force such a prosecution and this administration is unlikely to bring such prosecutions.”

Israel has announced it will reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the next few days as part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. However, the border will only open in one direction: for Palestinians to exit. Israeli American human rights lawyer Sari Bashi says the move validates fears that Israel's goal is to “continue the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.”

This comes as a coalition of 12 Israeli human rights groups concluded in a new report that 2025 is the deadliest and most destructive year for Palestinians since 1967. Last week, the United Nations reported more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, 2023. Violence in the West Bank and Gaza is “directed toward getting Palestinians to leave,” says Bashi.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: Israel has announced it will reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the next few days as part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire. According to the World Health Organization, at least 16,500 sick and wounded people need to leave Gaza for medical care. However, the border will only open in one direction: for Palestinians to exit.

Since the ceasefire began, at least 347 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 889 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. In one recent incident, two children were killed by an Israeli drone for crossing the so-called yellow line, which isn't always well marked. The children were brothers Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, the older of whom was 10 years old. They were gathering firewood for their disabled father. The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, saying, quote, “The Air Force eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,” unquote. Palestinians report Israeli forces continue to cross the yellow line on a near-daily basis.

This week, a coalition of 12 Israeli human rights groups concluded in a new report that 2025 is already the deadliest and most destructive year for Palestinians since 1967. On Monday, Israeli forces killed two teenagers in the West Bank in separate attacks as they carried out raids across the territory. In Hebron, soldiers fatally shot 17-year-old Muhannad Tariq Muhammad al-Zughair, whom they accused of carrying out a car-ramming attack that injured an Israeli soldier. Elsewhere, 18-year-old Muhammad Raslan Mahmoud Asmar was shot during a raid on his village northwest of Ramallah. Witnesses say the teen was left to bleed out as Israeli forces barred Red Crescent medics from approaching. The soldiers then seized his lifeless body. Last week, the U.N. reported more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, 2023.

This is Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

JEREMY LAURENCE: Killings of Palestinians by Israeli security forces and settlers in the occupied West Bank have been surging, without any accountability, even in the rare case when investigations are announced. … Our office has verified that since the 7th of October, 2023, and up until the 27th of November of this year, Israeli forces and settlers killed 1,030 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Among these victims were 223 children.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, by Sari Bashi, an Israeli American human rights lawyer, former program director at Human Rights Watch. Her piece for The New York Review of Books is headlined “Gaza: The Threat of Partition.” She co-founded Gisha, the leading Israeli human rights group promoting the right to freedom of movement for Palestinians in Gaza.

Sari, welcome back to Democracy Now! Let's begin with the latest breaking news, that Israel in the next few days will open the Rafah border crossing, but only for Palestinians to go one way: out. What is your response?

SARI BASHI: So, obviously, people need to leave. You mentioned the numbers, in thousands, of patients waiting to leave. There are also students who have been accepted to universities abroad. This is after all of Gaza's universities have been destroyed. So, it's half good news.

But the bad news is that the Israeli announcement that it will not allow people to return to Gaza validates the fears that many have, that the ceasefire plan, the American plan and the Israeli plan, is essentially to continue the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. So, in Trump's ceasefire plan, he committed to allowing Palestinians to return to Gaza, but that's not what's happening on the ground. There has been no construction authorized in the half of Gaza where Palestinians actually live. There has been no ability for people to come back home, and there are people who want to come back home.

And life in Gaza is nearly impossible for people because of very, very bad conditions. Eighty-one percent of buildings have been destroyed. People are living in tents that are now flooding in the rains. And it is very difficult to get construction and other materials approved by the Israeli authorities.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Sari, there have also been reports of secret evacuation flights from Gaza. Who is running these flights, and who determines who goes on those flights?

SARI BASHI: I mean, that's part of the problem. Early in the war, the Israeli government created what it calls the voluntary immigration administration, which is a secret, nontransparent government body that is supposed to encourage people from Gaza to leave, and make it possible for them to do so. There has been almost no transparency about what that organization is doing. There has been deliberate disinformation by Israeli ministers trying to amplify, artificially amplify, the number of people leaving Gaza to make people afraid. And there have been persistent reports about people paying large sums of money in order to leave, and that is after they have reportedly been asked to sign commitments not to return.

On the other hand, there is a very clear statement in the Trump peace plan, which was incorporated into a U.N. Security Council resolution, that people in Gaza are to be allowed to return home. And it's perhaps not surprising that following the Israeli announcement this morning that Rafah crossing would be opened for exit only, the Egyptian government reportedly issued an objection and said no. It reminded us that the U.S. had promised that people in Gaza would be allowed to come home, as well.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk some about the situation in the West Bank, as we've reported these constant attacks by settlers and the military? What's been the position of the Israeli government on this, and what role have the military played in these attacks?

SARI BASHI: I mean, the concern is that the violence in Gaza, the violence in the West Bank, it's not random. It's directed toward ethnic cleansing. It's directed toward getting Palestinians to leave. Certainly, that's the case in Gaza, and the devastation and violence there are at a much higher scale than in the West Bank. But in the West Bank, too, just this year, we've had 2,000 Palestinians forcibly displaced from their homes through a combination of demolitions as well as settler violence. Every single day, Palestinians are injured or their property is damaged by settler attacks.

And to be clear, settlers are Israeli civilians who have been unlawfully transferred to the occupied West Bank by the Israeli government and have been taking over land that belongs to Palestinians. In the last two years, they have become increasingly emboldened in attacking Palestinians, taking over their olive groves, their flocks, stealing, throwing fire bombs into their homes, to the point where, according to the U.N., in 2025, a thousand Palestinians have been injured by settler attacks.

This is decentralized violence, but it is also state-sponsored violence. It is the government who put those settlers in the West Bank unlawfully, and quite often this violence takes place when Israeli soldiers either stand nearby and do nothing or even participate. The very ultranationalistic, messianic ideology has been infiltrated into the Israeli military, where you have soldiers whose job it is to protect everybody, including Palestinians, who are also settlers. And on the weekends, they come out in civilian clothing and attack and sometimes even kill Palestinians.

AMY GOODMAN: And what about the Jewish and Israeli Jewish activists who stand alongside Palestinians to prevent the olive harvest from being destroyed, to prevent people from being attacked, the response of the Israeli military and the settlers?

SARI BASHI: You know, it's an indication of just how badly things have gotten, how many red lines have been crossed, because it used to be that Jewish settlers would be reluctant to attack Jews, because their ideology is racialized. They believe that they are acting in the name of the Jewish people. But recently, they have attacked Israeli Jews, as well, when Israeli Jews have come to accompany and be in solidarity with Palestinians.

So, we just finished the olive harvest season. It's a very important cultural and also economic event for Palestinians. And this year it was particularly violent, with Israeli settlers coming, attacking people as they try to harvest, cutting down and burning down trees, intimidating people. And there have been cases even where Israeli Jewish activists came to be a protective force by accompanying Palestinian harvesters, and they, too, were attacked and even taken to the hospital with injuries. It is much more dangerous to be a Palestinian than to be an Israeli Jew in the West Bank, but the fact that settlers are also attacking Jews is an indication of just how violent, messianic and ultranationalistic this movement has become.

AMY GOODMAN: The death toll from Israel's more than two-year assault on Gaza has been reported as 70,000. A new study from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany said the death toll likely exceeds 100,000. Our next guest, Ralph Nader, has talked about The Lancet report saying it's probably hundreds of thousands. Life expectancy, says the Max Planck Institute, in Gaza fell by 44% in 2023, 47% in 2024. If you can talk about this? And also, what is going to happen in Gaza now, where the truce stands?

SARI BASHI: I mean, the violence against people in Gaza has been unprecedented. It's been genocidal. And, you know, we have confirmed 70,000 people whose names and ID numbers have been reported by their families to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. There are thousands more people believed to be buried under the rubble, and thousands or tens of thousands of people who died from indirect causes. So, these are people who, because of a deliberate policy of starvation, died of malnutrition, died of communicable diseases, died of want. And I don't know that we will ever know how many people died indirectly. This is for a very small population. It's a population of 2 million people.

In Gaza right now, life has remained nearly impossible. The ceasefire promised reconstruction. It promised the crossings to be open. But the U.S. government introduced a number of caveats, and it actually, unfortunately, got those caveats approved by the U.N. Security Council. And an important caveat was that the reconstruction elements of the ceasefire would be limited to areas where Hamas had disarmed. And if the Israeli military was not able to disarm Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in two years of war, it's not clear how they're going to be disarmed now. So, conditioning reconstruction on Hamas disarmament is basically saying reconstruction will be impossible.

The only place where the U.S. has said it will allow reconstruction is in the more than 50% of Gaza that is directly occupied by Israel, that is off-limits to Palestinians on penalty of death. So, that doesn't leave people in Gaza with any options. Six hundred thousand schoolchildren have no schools. The hospitals are barely functioning. There's nowhere to live. A million-and-a-half people are in need of emergency shelter supplies. The concern is that the way the ceasefire is being implemented is only going to contribute to ethnic cleansing, because anybody who can leave Gaza will leave, because it's very clear that there's not a future being allowed there.

And the United States has an opportunity to make good on its promise in two ways. First of all, it can make it clear that reconstruction has to be authorized in the part of Gaza where Palestinians live, not in the half of Gaza that's off-limits to them. And second of all, it should demand, as per the ceasefire agreement, that Rafah be open in both directions, also to allow people to come home.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I wanted to ask you how the Israeli media is reporting both the breaches in the cease — the constant breaches in the ceasefire agreement, as well as the constant attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. And what's been the impact on public opinion since the ceasefire came into effect, Israeli public opinion?

SARI BASHI: You know, I'm very sorry to say that there's been a long-term trend of the Israeli media becoming more nationalistic and less critical. And that's been matched by a number of government moves to coopt and take over both public and private media. So, particularly since October 7th, 2023, the Israeli media, with a few notable exceptions, has been reporting government propaganda uncritically. So, what you will hear in the Israeli media is that suspects were shot in Gaza for crossing the yellow line or approaching troops. You won't hear that those suspects were 10- and 12-year-old boys who were collecting firewood, and that under international law, you can't shoot children because they cross an invisible line. In the West Bank, you will hear that terrorists were taken out, when you mean ordinary civilians who were trying to harvest their olive trees. Haaretz and a few other media outlets have been offering a different view of what's happening, a more realistic view. But right now many Israelis choose not to — not to see what's happening either in the West Bank or Gaza. And interest in what's happening in Gaza has gone way down since the majority of Israeli hostages have been freed.

AMY GOODMAN: Sari Bashi, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Israeli American human rights lawyer, former program director at Human Rights Watch. We'll link to your New York Review of Books article, “Gaza: The Threat of Partition.”

When we come back, a group of eight senators, led by Bernie Sanders, form a “Fight Club” to challenge Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's handling of Trump. We'll speak with Ralph Nader, who's been taking on the Democratic Party for decades. Sixty years ago, he published his landmark book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Stay with us.

The USDA seeks data from states including SNAP recipients' personal information such as Social Security numbers.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will begin next week to block nutrition assistance funding for states led by Democrats that have not provided data on fraud in the program, Secretary Brooke Rollins told President Donald Trump at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.

USDA sought data from states earlier this year related to their administration of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, Rollins said Tuesday. She added the data was needed to address fraud that she called “rampant” in the program that helps 42 million people afford groceries.

Most states complied with the request, but 21, mostly run by Democrats, refused, she said. A USDA spokesperson later implied the department was missing data from 22 states.

“As of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply, and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,” Rollins said.

A USDA spokesperson in an email listed 28 states, plus one territory, from which they said the department has received data.

That would leave the following 22 states, all led by Democratic governors, that have not provided data: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. 

The spokesperson provided some additional details of the initiative, including that the department was targeting administrative funds, and that the next step would be a formal warning.

Blue states sought to protect bad actors, including criminals and immigrants in the country without legal status, “over the American taxpayer,” the statement said.

“We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds,” the spokesperson said.

Court records show the department sent the states a new request for data on Nov. 28, and asked for a response within seven days, which would be Friday. 

The letter was reproduced as part of a suit the 22 states have brought against the administration over the request for SNAP recipients' data.

It's unclear what authority Rollins would have to block funding, which Congress has appropriated.

The federal government pays for all benefits for SNAP, which was formerly known as food stamps. It splits the administrative costs with states.

The USDA spokesperson did not answer a direct question about the legal authority for withholding funds.

Democrats on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee said any effort to block SNAP funding would be illegal.

“Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars,” a social media post from an official account of committee Democrats read. “SNAP has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger.”

The committee's lead Democrat, Angie Craig of Minnesota, issued her own statement that also accused the administration of “weaponizing hunger” and said Rollins “continues to spew propaganda.”

“Her disregard for the law and willingness to lie through her teeth comes from the very top — the Trump administration is as corrupt as it is lawless, and I will not sit silently as she carries out the president's campaign against Americans struggling to afford food in part because of this president's tariffs and disastrous economic policies.”  

The data USDA has sought from states includes verification of SNAP recipients' eligibility, along with a host of personal information such as Social Security numbers.

An early USDA review of data provided by the 28 states and Guam “indicates an estimated average of $24 million per day of federal funds is lost to fraud and errors undetected by States in their administration of SNAP,” the department said in the Nov. 28 letter.

Preventing those losses could save up to $9 billion per year, the letter added.

But the types of fraud cited in some of the public statements from Rollins and the department are rare, existing data show.

A 2023 USDA report showed about 26,000 applications, roughly 0.1% of the households enrolled in SNAP, were referred for an administrative or criminal review.

People in the country illegally have never been authorized to receive SNAP benefits.

“The long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Katie Bergh, a senior food assistance policy analyst for the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a November interview.

SNAP has been a consistent target for cuts during Trump's second presidency.

The issue was a focal point during the six-week government shutdown, during which the administration reversed itself often but generally resisted calls — from states, advocates, lawmakers and federal judges — to fund food assistance.

Shortly after the government reopened, Rollins in television interviews said she would force all recipients to reapply for benefits, a proposal seen as logistically challenging by program experts.

And the Republican taxes and spending law passed by Congress and signed by Trump earlier this year included new work requirements and other restrictions on SNAP eligibility that advocates say will lead to major drops in benefits. 

The law will also make states pay for some share of benefits and increase the share of administrative costs that states are responsible for, potentially leading some states to cut benefits.

DeepSeek has a “kill switch” baked into its system, and it does exactly what Beijing wants, a cybersecurity report finds.

The Chinese artificial intelligence startup writes significantly weaker code when running into prompts that contain Beijing's trigger words, such as Falun Gong and Uyghurs, two groups suffering severe persecution in China.

For such requests, DeepSeek often writes code with severe security defects or outright refuses to help, the researchers say.

The new finding reveals something far more subtle. It identified bias in DeepSeek's coding assistants—ubiquitous AI-powered tools that speed up repetitive tasks, debug, and guide developers through unfamiliar programming languages.

If the AI tool introduces a security loophole into the code, and the users adopt the code without realizing it, “you open yourself up to attacks,” he said.

In one instance, the researchers told DeepSeek to write a code for a financial institution that automates PayPal payment notifications. DeepSeek responded with a secure and ready-to-use code. But upon learning the institution is based in Tibet, the app wrote in severe security flaws in the new code, including using an insecure method for extracting data from users, the report said.

First introduced to the public in China in 1992, Falun Gong quickly spread by word of mouth to reach an estimated 70 million to 100 million practitioners by 1999, when the regime started deploying vast resources to eradicate the group in China and worldwide. In 2019, an independent London tribunal found Falun Gong likely a principal victim of state-sponsored forced organ harvesting in China.

In the CrowdStrike testing, DeepSeek-R1 refused to write code for Falun Gong 45 percent of the time. Western models would almost always comply with the request.

The report noted that the model sometimes said during the reasoning phase: “Falun Gong is a sensitive group. I should consider the ethical implications here. Assisting them might be against policies. But the user is asking for technical help. Let me focus on the technical aspects.”

It proceeded to lay out a detailed plan for answering the task but would simply end the process abruptly, stating: “I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that request,” the report finds.

It was “almost as if there was like a mental switch that happened,” said Stein.

The researchers called the behavior an “intrinsic kill switch.”

The sudden “killing off” of a request at the last moment must be encoded in the DeepSeek model's parameters, the researchers said.

“It's like billions of numbers, but somehow in there you have encoded this switch that says, okay, even though you made all of this plan, you thought this through, you're still not going to actually do it, not going to comply,” Stein said. And when Stein pressed for answers, he said, the model gave “a very long, detailed response,” with emphasis added on certain words, “almost like an angry teacher” giving him a “scolding.”

One possible explanation for such behaviors is that DeepSeek trained its models to adhere to the Chinese regime's core values, and through that, the model drew negative associations with words such as Falun Gong and Uyghurs, the report said.

 Where Beijing Is—and Isn't—Seeking Influence

 Alicia R. Chen

Earlier this year, after U.S. President Donald Trump effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, the world's largest bilateral aid program, many observers raised fears that China would step in to fill the geopolitical vacuum. USAID, after all, had served as a key tool of U.S. diplomacy for more than six decades, and the American retreat has created an opportunity for China to expand its economic statecraft and win influence in many parts of the world.

Over the last two decades, China has vastly expanded the amount and types of foreign aid it administers. Between 2000 and 2023, only 17 countries in the world did not receive a loan or grant from the Chinese government or a Chinese state-owned institution. The Belt and Road Initiative, which was launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, has accounted for more than $1 trillion in total spending. This increasingly global footprint has piqued Western policymakers' concerns about Beijing's ambitions, but many observers still don't fully comprehend Beijing's strategy.

On the surface, China's development program appears to be a largely indiscriminate apparatus. But a close review of how China deploys its vast financial resources reveals that its support is strategically targeted to countries that are leading regional organizations. When countries chair groups such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) or the African Union (AU), for instance, their governments receive a sharp uptick in aid from Chinese government agencies. This pattern doesn't hold for global platforms such as the UN Security Council. In other words, China is not attempting to dominate every forum. It is choosing its venues carefully, selecting those that matter most for its long-term strategic goals.

Policymakers seeking to reform their own foreign aid programs or forge an effective response to China's efforts need to better understand this strategy—and with it, how to cultivate influence in a multipolar world.

Although China has provided foreign aid since the 1950s, its global development program accelerated significantly after the 2008 financial crisis. Between 2000 and 2021, China extended about $68 billion per year in overseas development financing. The U.S. average over this period, by contrast, was about $39 billion per year.

Although China's development program is global in scope, my research has shown that Beijing gives more aid to countries when they have leadership roles within regional organizations. For example, by looking at Chinese economic assistance to countries in Southeast Asia and Africa from 2000 to 2017, I found that when a country chaired ASEAN or the AU, it received seven times as much financing from Chinese government agencies as it did during the years when it did not chair the organization. This surge translates to an average of $90 million in additional funding. In contrast, when a country took on a rotating role on the UN Security Council, which typically results in an increase in aid from Western countries, China's aid remained stagnant. This suggests Beijing is pursuing a deliberate, regionally focused strategy.

To many observers in Washington, regional organizations may seem marginal compared with global heavyweights such as the UN. But Beijing sees these institutions as critical platforms for diplomacy and economic coordination, especially in the so-called global South. China has long positioned itself as the leader of the global South, and it often criticizes the inequities of the Western-led order. As one senior Chinese diplomat described it in 2016, the U.S.-dominated system was like “a suit that no longer fits.” By investing in regional blocs such as ASEAN and the AU, Beijing is further cultivating this identity and presenting itself as the leader of a new order.

Securing influence in regional forums also helps China deflect criticism and advance its preferred norms, which often contravene Western priorities. By rewarding the chair—which plays a central role in setting the organization's agenda—Beijing can steer regional conversations away from contentious issues and toward topics that favor its geopolitical objectives. With ASEAN, for example, the chair shapes how the organization responds to regional flash points such as disputes in the South China Sea. When Cambodia chaired ASEAN in 2012, it blocked passage of a joint statement from an ASEAN summit because a section criticized Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. This was the first time in the organization's history that ASEAN failed to issue a summit communiqué. Two months later, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao pledged $500 million in new loans and grants to Phnom Penh. In announcing the agreements, Cambodia's finance minister even acknowledged that Beijing “voiced high appreciation” for Cambodia's role as ASEAN chair in maintaining “good cooperation between China and ASEAN.”

More recently, at the 2024 AU summit in Addis Ababa, member states agreed to an Africa-wide ban on the controversial trade of donkey hides. Donkey hides are used in traditional Chinese medicine, and demand from China had resulted in a spike in trade, which disproportionately affected women in rural African farming communities who rely on the donkeys for transport. Notably, however, the AU—which was being chaired by Mauritania—avoided blaming China for the issue and framed the ban strictly as one of protecting African resources. Later that year, during the 2024 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit, Xi elevated China's relationship with Mauritania to a strategic partnership and commended President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani for his leadership as the AU's rotating chair. On the sidelines of the summit, China also expanded economic support to Mauritania, including a $281 million currency-swap agreement.

The spike in China's support to regional chairs, however, is limited to government-to-government aid—suggesting that not all Chinese money is equally political. This may come as a surprise to some observers. Many Western countries primarily deliver aid through government agencies such as USAID, but in China's case, assistance from government agencies makes up only about ten percent of its total foreign aid portfolio. China's closest analog to USAID, the China International Development Cooperation Agency, together with other ministries involved in aid delivery, most notably the Ministry of Commerce, had a combined annual budget of roughly $3 billion in 2023, a fraction of USAID's $42 billion budget that same year. The bulk of Chinese financing comes instead from state-owned policy banks and commercial banks that must balance strategic mandates with the imperative to recover loans. Because these banks are state-owned, many observers have assumed that all Chinese financing reflects government strategy.

But loans from Chinese policy banks and commercial banks did not follow the same pattern as Chinese government agency assistance; nor did Chinese funds that were directed to foreign nongovernment recipients. This finding suggests that attention to the specific entities that are granting and receiving such support is important. Chinese government agencies are most likely to deploy aid in ways designed to deliver geopolitical returns, such as regional support. These political transactions occur between government actors because government agencies offer leaders greater discretionary control, making it easier to use these funds to secure diplomatic support or political concessions. China's policy and commercial banks, in contrast, behave much like their Western counterparts, making lending decisions based on creditworthiness and financial viability. The bottom line is that the most politically consequential forms of Chinese assistance come from its government agencies—which account for only a small share of China's overall portfolio—suggesting that not all Chinese financing functions as a tool of Beijing's economic statecraft.

The United States and other liberal democracies seeking to compete with China on the global stage should take several lessons from these findings. They must first recognize that the geopolitical battleground is shifting. While many Western countries have continued to focus on defending liberal norms in global institutions, China has been quietly gaining traction in regional bodies. Regional organizations play a meaningful role in international affairs: they help design and monitor national plans for sustainable development and are increasingly central to managing crises and preventing conflict. These bodies often provide early signs of dissent and help set the norms that guide international responses. The UN has deepened its engagement and partnerships with such forums recently, recognizing their importance to both development and peace. And many Western officials are rethinking how to rebuild trust with such organizations after being confrontedby the global South's fragmented response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In other words, leaders can no longer afford to treat regional organizations as peripheral forums. In a multipolar world, ASEAN, the AU, and other such bodies are emerging as critical nodes for diplomatic and economic coordination. The regions they represent account for a growing share of the world's population and are often flash points on issues of trade and security. The decisions of regional organizations are increasingly consequential to policymakers. Engaging with these institutions on their own terms and investing in their capacity and credibility is essential to ensuring they remain open, inclusive, and rules-based.

A more nuanced understanding of China's aid programs is also in order. Not all Chinese financing is problematic or indicative of Beijing's involvement, and not all aid is a political ploy. Distinguishing between types of funders and recipients can indicate where Beijing is more likely to be seeking influence and where it is not—helping policymakers understand where to counter China's efforts and where development cooperation remains possible.

The post–Cold War era of unchallenged American primacy is over, and a new period of global competition has taken its place. As the United States withdraws its foreign aid, understanding the subtleties of China's economic statecraft is more important than ever. Policymakers must analyze where and how Chinese money flows. Doing so will allow the United States and its allies to gain valuable insights into Beijing's strategic focus—and perhaps even begin building a more targeted and effective response.

 How American Bullying Is Shaping Indian Foreign Policy

 James Crabtree and Rudra Chaudhuri

Over the last decade, India has drawn ever closer to the United States, tentatively aligning itself with Washington as it continues to eschew formal alliances. This approach has paid off, securing U.S. investment, defense cooperation, and technological exchange, as well as the sense that the friendship between the world's two largest democracies would only grow. Indian policymakers were mostly untroubled when Donald Trump returned to the White House this year. They assumed that Washington valued the partnership and that ties would only grow stronger, not least because of the apparent chemistry between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the president's first term.

But now, India must reassess its American gamble. Since the summer, Trump has departed from the policy of recent U.S. administrations and sought to pressure India. He increased tariffs to 50 percent on India in August, ostensibly as a penalty for its ongoing purchases of Russian oil. And he agreed to a raft of deals with India's neighbor and rival, Pakistan, irking Indian officials. In apparent response, Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin in September 2025, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping; his presence made it seem as if India were aligning with U.S. competitors. Putin will be visiting New Delhi this week, where his meeting with Modi risks giving the same impression.

This signaling, however, is not tantamount, as some observers have suggested, to India abandoning its recent foreign policy strategy for a wholly different approach. Instead, the path that India seems to be taking—and, indeed, should be taking—is a form of what its foreign policy establishment often calls “multialignment,” an orientation designed to build stronger ties with many countries, even if those states have contradictory interests.

Despite the friction of this year, the United States will remain India's most important partner, albeit a more erratic and occasionally troublesome one. India will also continue to cultivate relationships with economically and technological capable middle powers, including Australia, Japan, Singapore, and the Gulf states. But the place where Indian foreign policy might have the most to gain is in Europe. Although not a like-for-like replacement for the United States, Europe is a reliable partner with strong technological capabilities, shared concerns about Chinese coercion, and a steadier foreign policy than that currently evident in Washington. By pursuing a renewed multialignment in this way, New Delhi can try to hedge against both American unpredictability and Chinese aggression while maintaining the strategic autonomy that has long been central to its foreign policy doctrine.

India's most striking response to American pressure came over the summer when Modi visited China. The images of the Indian prime minister alongside Xi and Putin were powerful, signaling a desire to recalibrate relations with China, in particular. Some Western observers also saw Modi's decision in August to invite Putin to New Delhi in December as evidence of a larger Indian pivot toward U.S. adversaries. But that misread India's intent. With its relationship to Washington deteriorating, New Delhi was instead seeking to muddle through, not to abandon the underlying strategic calculus that led it to turn toward the United States in the first place. Planned months in advance, Modi's visit to China was not a reaction to Trump's tariffs but an effort to repair damaged ties with Beijing after a year of relative stability along India's disputed border with China. What India wanted was to carefully rebuild badly damaged ties, not launch a new era of Sino-Indian alignment; Modi pointedly declined to attend the military parade to which Xi invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. With China, India is in essence doing little more than what many others have done now that Trump is back in the White House: managing differences and avoiding crises with China while seeking to stabilize ties with the United States.

The significance of Putin's visit this week to New Delhi should also not be overstated. To be sure, Moscow remains a significant partner. India is still dependent on Russia for arms and military equipment, and it will remain so for some time. India is also in no rush to push Russia away as it worries about Moscow's ever-closer alignment with Beijing. But the limits of this partnership are real. India's purchase of German submarines in August reflects its strategy of diversification in procurement. It has been gradually reducing its reliance on Russian defense hardware every year for the past 15 years. Russia offers India little in terms of investment capital or cutting-edge technology, two areas that are critical to the country's long-term development ambitions. Leaders in New Delhi appreciate the long history behind ties with Moscow but recognize that there's not much room for growth in the relationship. In short, they know that India's future lies elsewhere.

That future, in India's view, will invariably be multialigned, an orientation that reflects a sound understanding of the country's strategic context. China remains India's primary challenge. Russia is a diminishing asset. And India requires economic investment and advanced technology to speed growth and enhanced military capabilities to better defend itself in a tricky neighborhood. The tilt toward the United States in the twenty-first century stemmed from these realities, as did India's deepening ties with Australia, Japan, and South Korea, as well as a number of states in the Middle East and Europe. Trump's recent pressure campaign does not undo these underlying imperatives. Indeed, India's dilemma is remarkably similar to that of many other American partners and allies in the Trump era—namely, how to replace what the United States is now less likely to provide. New Delhi must find alternative sources of technology, defense cooperation, and economic partnership, while also managing its complex relationships with Beijing and Moscow.



The trajectory of India's relationships with China and Russia should be clear. Some further thaw between New Delhi and Beijing is of course possible, but it will be severely limited by the underlying structural fact of their regional rivalry. India, for instance, may consider removing some controls on Chinese access to its domestic market that were introduced after border clashes in 2020. It could also lift its ban on the Chinese social media app TikTok as a goodwill gesture. The risks that China poses to India remain all too real, however, including the unresolved border dispute and the weaponization of certain supply chains that are largely controlled by China. India will try to pursue a stable relationship with China, without any illusions of deep partnership. India also wants to maintain solid ties with Russia, in large part to preserve access to spare parts for the Indian military's Russian-sourced military hardware and to prevent Russia from becoming so isolated that it becomes a near-vassal state of China.

The question of how to manage Washington is more complicated. The United States will under most likely scenarios remain India's most important partner for technology and investment, no matter the current disruption in relations. The two countries are also still collaborating in critical areas: the newly established U.S. Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies is working with Indian counterparts to streamline AI infrastructure partnerships, for instance. Silicon Valley has a serious interest in India. Washington provided New Delhi with a laundry list of regulatory issues to resolve to help American tech firms to invest in data centers in India. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, visited New Delhi and Bengaluru in October with the hope of opening an office in India. And all the big U.S. tech companies will be represented in February at a major AI summit in India, hosted by Modi.

For India's part, its pharmaceutical companies are still looking to invest in the United States despite threats of tariffs as they seek to lessen their dependence on Chinese suppliers. Indian companies have begun reducing oil imports from Russia following American sanctions on two large Russian firms at the end of October. In the midst of their friction, Trump wished Modi well on his birthday in September. The U.S. president also continues to refer to Modi as a “great man” who is “tough as hell.” The first part of a trade deal between India and the United States, which has been negotiated for several months, may be completed by the end of this year or early next.

Even so, India will view the United States warily after this year's turmoil. New Delhi now worries about American reliability—and understandably so. It is also troubled by the Trump administration's new closeness to Pakistan, which Washington sees as an increasingly useful partner; Pakistan could send peacekeeping forces to Gaza, for instance, and help facilitate critical mineral agreements in Central Asia. Trump has spoken warmly of Pakistan's military and civilian leaders and welcomed them to the White House on multiple occasions this year. None of these moves help U.S.-Indian ties.

It is against this backdrop that a pivot to Europe makes sense. For decades, the relationship between India and Europe has underperformed its potential, especially when measured against the progress that India has made in moving closer to the United States. Europe is one of India's largest trading partners. The sheer size of the Indian economy and its growing consumer class is attractive to European countries. The need to do more with India prompted the Council of the European Union to approve a “new strategic EU-India agenda” in October, highlighting the ambition to establish stronger technology and investment ties. Both India and the EU remain committed to climate action, even if they have differences on emission targets. India has maintained close ties with France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, but until recently it had only limited engagement with many other significant European countries, such as Germany, and with the European Union more broadly.

But that is changing. High-level visits to Europe from Modi and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar have established an EU-India Trade and Technology Council that is designed to bring the two sides closer together. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen traveled to New Delhi this year with the entire gamut of European commissioners, an unusual move designed to boost cooperation across multiple sectors. India's position on the war in Ukraine—it refused to condemn Russia and has continued to purchase Russian oil—lost it friends in Europe. But Europe's strategic reawakening since 2022 and significant military buildup following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine position it as a more credible partner in Indian eyes. It now has the potential to be a more credible security partner, too, both in terms of weapons sales and in emerging domains such as space and cybersecurity.

Indian and European officials are also concerned about China. Europe views Chinese trade practices, including hefty state subsidies, forced technology transfers, and overproduction, as existential threats to its industrial base. India worries not only about unresolved border disputes and strategic competition in South Asia but also about its dangerous economic dependence on China in manufacturing, rare-earth minerals, green technology, and other sectors—areas of major concern in Brussels, too. Technology cooperation, particularly in artificial intelligence, represents another major opportunity.

Europe can offer expertise in other critical niche areas. India and Europe could work productively together on renewable energy and quantum computing, areas in which U.S.-Indian collaboration is lacking. European labs and Indian incubation hubs are planning to set up a biotechnology corridor that would facilitate joint investment and manufacturing. The Trade and Technology Council, despite its admittedly slow start, provides an institutional framework for advancing cooperation. Of course, many obstacles remain. In September, the EU proposed a new agenda to boost bilateral relations with India, which included expanded cooperation in defense and technology. The launch of this agenda was nearly derailed after India participated in a joint military exercise with Russia and Belarus, a reminder of lingering European sensitivities over Ukraine. Even so, a much-anticipated new trade agreement is likely to be completed before a planned summit in New Delhi in January, along with new agreements on security cooperation, migration and energy—the latter designed to tempt India away from the lure of Russian oil and gas. These discussions aim to cement an economic foundation for a broader strategic partnership. To be sure, Modi and von der Leyen will still likely have to intervene in helping both sides overcome hurdles in finalizing these deals.

Both Europe and India face similar predicaments that could bring them closer together. Neither side feels able to rely on the United States as they once did. Both seek new partnerships to help protect themselves from a more capricious Washington. Until only six months ago, India seemed destined to align ever more closely with the United States, in part to fend off future Chinese aggression. Now, Trump's pressure campaign means that India will pursue a renewed multialignment, not out of ideological conviction but as a practical necessity. The ultimate irony of Trump's approach is that it is producing precisely the outcome it sought to prevent: a more multialigned India, invested in multiple partnerships and less susceptible to bludgeoning pressure from the United States.

            When President Donald Trump was asked about how Afghans legally in the United States might feel about his decision to pause issuing visas for them after the suspected shooter of National Guard members was identified as an Afghan national, he took aim at another country in the same breath: Somalia.
    


            “They can't be happy because what's taking place between that and, if you look at Somalia, they're taking over Minnesota,” Trump said in remarks to reporters following his call to service members on Thanksgiving Day.
    


            Moments later, he clarified the alleged shooter had nothing to do with Somalia. But the president has nonetheless continued pushing hostile rhetoric toward the Somali population in Minneapolis in the days since.
    


            Over the past few months, the Trump administration has continued its sweeping deportation push of immigrants, with a surge of federal agents flooding the streets of blue cities such as Los Angeles; Washington, DC; Chicago; Charlotte and New Orleans, where the Department of Homeland Security confirmed a new operation Wednesday morning after weeks of anticipation that the Crescent City would be the next target.
    


            But a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, a federal official told CNN on Tuesday, will specifically target undocumented Somali immigrants in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The community, one of the largest in the US, is one of the few the president has focused on directly for years.
    


            Here's how we got here:
    


            In recent attacks against the Somali community, the president and his allies have frequently cited a $300 million fraud scandal that centered on Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization, and a Covid-19 program meant to provide free meals to needy kids.
    


            The vast majority of roughly 70 people charged in the case are members of the state's Somali community, CNN has reported.
    


            Prosecutors alleged defendants set up a network of shell companies connected to Feeding Our Future to exploit the federal child nutrition program, claiming to be feeding thousands of children per day but instead using the money to purchase luxury vehicles and real estate.
    


            Thirty-seven defendants have pleaded guilty, according to the AP. Five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year, the AP reported.
    


            Trump referenced the scandal a week before Thanksgiving, calling Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” as he announced plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state.
    


            “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said on Truth Social.
    


            Then, on the day of the National Guard shooting, Trump vowed to escalate his anti-immigration agenda after the suspect was identified as an Afghan national as he claimed the incident “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”
    


            Lashing out at Somali immigrants in Minnesota, Trump claimed they were “ripping off our country and ripping apart that once-great state.” He described Somalia as a country that has “no laws, no water, no military, no nothing.”
    


            Days later, Trump ended his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday by asserting he does not want Somali immigrants in the United States. He referred to the community and US Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant who represents Minnesota, as “garbage” who should “go back to where they came from.”
    


            But Trump has zeroed in on Minnesota's Somali population and railed against Omar, who became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in 2018, for years.
    


            Somalia was also on the travel ban list during Trump's first presidential term. Under the Obama administration, several Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, were identified as “countries of concern” and subject to travel restrictions. Somalia had been added to address “the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,” according to a DHS statement.
    


            When Trump took office, the restrictions turned into a travel ban.
    


            At a rally in Minneapolis in 2019, Trump challenged the case for allowing Somali refugees to settle in the North Star State as he touted his travel ban. “For many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers,” he said.
    


            He went on to attack Omar, who represents the district where the rally took place, as a “disgrace.”
    


            Minnesota is home to over 79,000 Somalis, roughly 80% of whom reside in the Twin Cities, according to the Minnesota Compass.
    


            Citizens of Somalia were first granted Temporary Protected Status in 1991 when the country was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown. In 2013, the US officially recognized the Somali government in Mogadishu for the first time in two decades, CNN reported.



            Somalia has maintained TPS “due to insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees,” according to the legislation.
    


            Omar condemned Trump's announcement in a news conference last week and spoke about the impact on her community: “Many of these people we are talking about have built lives,” she said. “They own homes, they own businesses, they are a vibrant part of our communities, and we want to make sure that their new home stays their forever home.”
    


            Somalia is one of 19 countries included in Trump's sweeping travel ban implemented this summer, which imposes full or partial restrictions. Many of the countries on the list are either failed states or under repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement, CNN has reported.
    


            In the wake of the National Guard shooting, Trump said the US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from the 19 countries “of concern.”
    


            The new ICE operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants will focus on Minneapolis and St. Paul, a federal official told CNN on Tuesday.
    


            The New York Times, which cited documents and an official who spoke anonymously, was first to report the operation in Minneapolis.
    


            In response to the Times' report, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, called the proposed operation a “PR stunt.”
    


            But details remain vague, as leaders of the Twin Cities said they were not given advance notice or information about the plan as they held a news conference to respond to reports of the new operation.
    


            “We will not compromise our values here in Minneapolis,” said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “Our values and our commitment to the Somali community, to every community of immigrants and people in our city is rock solid and will be unwavering.” Frey confirmed Minneapolis police would not participate in immigration enforcement operations.
    


            Both Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter reiterated their citizens have rights and touted immigration legal resources available to the community.
    


            Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, a Somali immigrant who represents many migrants in his district, said his community “has lived through fear in the past, and we are not going to let that divide us.”
    


            “I know many families are fearful tonight, but I want you to know that city, Minneapolis stands behind you,” Osman said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A Chinese reusable booster explodes in historic first orbital test — highlighting challenge to chase SpaceX","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/science/zhuque-3-launch-china-reusable-rocket-intl-hnk","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 07:40:14 GMT","


            A private Chinese space firm successfully sent its Zhuque-3 rocket to orbit but failed in its historic attempt to re-land the rocket booster Wednesday – the first such trial by a Chinese firm as the country's growing commercial space sector races to catch up with American rivals like SpaceX.
    


            Beijing-based LandSpace, one of the sector's leading firms, launched its Zhuque-3 rocket into space from a remote, desert launch site in northwestern China.
    


            The rocket entered orbit as planned, but its first stage – the portion of the vehicle that propels it at liftoff – did not successfully return to a landing site, instead crashing down, the company said in a statement.
    


            “An anomaly occurred after the first-stage engine ignited during the landing phase, preventing a soft landing on the designated recovery pad,” the statement said. “The debris landed at the edge of the recovery area, resulting in a failed recovery test.”
    


            The team would “conduct a comprehensive review” and continue to “advance the verification and application of reusable rocket technology in future missions,” the statement added.
    


            Even though unsuccessful, the trial has placed the company at the head of a pack of Chinese firms vying to develop reusable rocket technology within a growing commercial space sector that Beijing hopes will power its competition with global rivals and help transform the country into a “strong aerospace nation.”
    


            Reusable rockets are seen as key, because the technology can significantly lower the cost and turn-around time of rocket launches – a distinct advantage as global firms race to build out satellite networks and eye a future space travel industry.
    


            They also provide a strategic advantage for a country as space increasingly becomes a domain linked to military power and defense capabilities on Earth.
    


            Reusable rockets form the backbone of the success of Elon Musk's firm SpaceX, which hashed out how to land and reuse rocket boosters nearly a decade ago and now dominates the global launch market.
    


            American SpaceX competitor Blue Origin completed its first successful landing of the first stage of its New Glenn rocket last month, while launching a pair of satellites destined for Mars. The accomplishment followed a failed booster landing attempt made by the company earlier this year. SpaceX also did not succeed in its first attempts.
    


            LandSpace's Wednesday attempt was an “impressive” feat that appeared to be upwards of “90% successful,” according to space expert Blaine Curcio, founder of Orbital Gateway Consulting.
    


            “It looks like it was really a largely successful attempt, and that there's either a structural issue or an igniter issue, or an engine issue. That will take some time to fix, but it will not take years to fix,” Curcio said, pointing to how the rocket came down close to its expected landing zone.
    


            “All of those things are generally good signs for the maturity of the commercial space sector in China,” he added.
    


            LandSpace's ambitions have been closely watched by competitors at home and abroad, with Musk commenting on the Zhuque-3 launch preparations in recent months.
    


            Musk posted on X in October that the company had “added aspects” of his vehicle Starship “to a Falcon 9 architecture, which would enable it to beat Falcon 9,” referring to SpaceX's reusable launch vehicle.
    


            But he also predicted it would take the company “over 5 years to reach Falcon 9 levels of reliability and production/launch rate.” By that time “SpaceX will have transitioned to Starship and be doing over 100 times the annual payload to orbit of Falcon,” he added.
    


America's military has the edge in space. China and Russia are in a counterspace race to disrupt it



            Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed, remains under development but is meant to be “fully reusable” – meaning SpaceX intends to also return and reuse the upper stage of the rocket, which has never been done before.
    


            Landspace, however, has lofty ambitions, too.
    


            In an interview with Chinese state media in 2023, LandSpace founder and CEO Zhang Changwu acknowledged that China's commercial rocket development “still lags behind SpaceX,” but if the company continues in the “right development direction” they would “one day be able to match SpaceX's capabilities.”
    


            Zhang also told state media last year that from 2026 the firm would begin undertaking spacecraft launch missions for China's Tiangong Space Station. That would be a first in terms of commercial spaceflight supporting national missions – and make having a reusable system even more critical.
    


            The firm has already marked other major successes, including the world's first successful orbital launch of its Zhuque-2 methane-liquid oxygen rocket in 2023, beating international rivals also developing rockets with what's seen as a cleaner-burning and more efficient fuel. (SpaceX's Starship is also powered by methane, but the vehicle so far has only flown suborbital test flights.)
    


            LandSpace is among a handful of Chinese firms that are developing reusable rocket technology. Commercial firms – with Beijing's blessing – have become an increasingly important part of China's space innovation, mirroring a model that's seen success in the US.
    


            That industry development comes as leader Xi Jinping in recent years has highlighted the aerospace sector as a “strategic emerging industry,” with the country's upcoming five-year plan expected to include a focus on accelerating the development of the country into a “strong aerospace nation.”
    


            Over the past decade, multiple private firms have conducted orbital launch missions, and several developers have conducted initial land tests of reusable rocket technology.
    


            Both state-owned Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology's Long March 12A and private firm Space Pioneer's Tianlong-3 are thought to be close to attempting their own orbital test flights of reusable rockets, according to state media reports.
    


            “From 2015 up to this year 2025, exactly 10 years, China's commercial space sector has essentially gone from nothing to a new critical point,” Liu Yuzhang, director of Taibo Research Institute, a Chinese think tank focusing on aerospace industries, told CNN.
    


            On Monday, the country's space authority announced that it had established a new internal department to oversee and develop its commercial space sector.
    


            And last week it rolled out a two-year action plan to integrate the country's commercial space sector into the national space development strategy.
    


            But while the sector appears poised for more rapid advancement, those watching closely say much work remains, and failure is part of the process.
    


            Even when there is failure, “there is the mindset of returning to zero and continuing rapid, ongoing iteration,” Liu told CNN ahead of the launch.
    


            The long-term goal, he added, is to reduce rocket launch costs and further improve the ability to send satellites into orbit, including delivering supplies to the space station, and even contributing to lunar or Martian exploration.

            A classified final version of the Pentagon inspector general's report into Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations has been delivered to the House and Senate Armed Services committees for review, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            A declassified, redacted version of the report is expected to be released publicly on Thursday, two of the sources said.
    


            The investigation, which began in April at the request of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was completed in September, CNN reported. But the inspector general's office has been going back and forth with Hegseth for several months over edits to the report, the sources said. It is standard practice for the IG to allow the subject of a review to provide input and request changes.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Office of the Inspector General and Office of the Secretary of Defense for comment.
    


            The Pentagon's inspector general launched the review after The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had shared information from his Signal account related to US military operations in Yemen, which included precise details about the timing, choreography and assets involved in pending US strikes against the Houthi rebel group.
    


Trump's national security adviser added a journalist to text chat on highly sensitive Yemen strike plans



            Following that report, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee requested an IG review to determine whether Hegseth violated any laws related to the handling of classified information or records retention for federal employees.
    


            Hegseth's Signal account shared details about the anti-Houthi military operation in at least two separate group chats, one of which included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, CNN has reported. One witness told the inspector general's office over the course of the review that they recalled being a part of about a dozen separate Signal chats that included Hegseth, but it's not clear if they all contained sensitive operational details, CNN also reported.
    


            The inspector general examined whether anyone else could have physically entered the information into the Signal chat at Hegseth's request, and asked witnesses whether others had access to his phone.
    


            The inspector general also received evidence that the military plans disclosed by Hegseth's account were taken from a US Central Command document that was marked classified at the time.
    


            The document was marked Secret/NOFORN, meaning no foreign nationals should see it, CNN reported. Hegseth has original classification authority, so he was authorized to declassify any information before he shared it, sources told CNN at the time. But it's unclear if he did so.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Federal agents began hitting the streets of New Orleans on Wednesday in the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown across the U.S., looking to round up immigrants accused of violent crimes.

The aim of the operation is to capture immigrants who were released after arrests for crimes such as home invasion, armed robbery and rape, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Immigration officials have blanketed big cities and small towns across the nation since January while carrying out Republican President Donald Trump 's aggressive mass deportation efforts. 

Federal agents have launched high-profile immigration crackdowns in cities including Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Another operation is expected in the coming days in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants.

The enforcement tactics have been met with protests and lawsuits challenging the aggressive force and how the arrests are being carried out.

The operation launched Wednesday is being called “Catahoula Crunch,” continuing Homeland Security's pattern of assigning region-specific names to the crackdowns. Planning documents obtained by the AP referred to the Louisiana operation as “Swamp Sweep.”

The Catahoula leopard dog is Louisiana's official state dog.

It's not clear how many agents are being deployed for the operation in New Orleans — a one-of-a-kind American city known as the birthplace of jazz and for its Mardi Gras celebrations and rich blend of French, Spanish, African and Native American cultures.




Twenty years ago, New Orleans relied on thousands of Latino workers who helped rebuild after Hurricane Katrina. But it has not escaped the escalating tensions over immigration.

Louisiana Gov. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has singled out crimes in which the suspect's immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally. 

The Trump administration also has taken aim at the city's immigration policies. 

“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” McLaughlin said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement. The Department of Justice includes New Orleans in a list of 18 cities it considers to be providing sanctuary to immigrants without legal status.

New Orleans officials deny the city's policies thwart federal immigration enforcement. City police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick has said she considers immigration enforcement to be a civil matter outside her jurisdiction.

Louisiana has been preparing for weeks for an immigration crackdown. The governor, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House's enforcement agenda, said Wednesday that the crackdown will target the “worst of the worst, criminal illegal aliens that have broken the law.”

“It started today and it's going to run until we get them all off the street,” Landry said during an interview on the Walton & Johnson radio show.

In addition to the deployment of federal immigration agents, Landry said he expects National Guard members to arrive in New Orleans before Christmas to join the efforts to combat crime. The operational planning documents show border agents were expected to launch a monthslong crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment, which aims to arrest 5,000 people, was expected to be led by Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles.

In and around New Orleans, some immigration lawyers said before the operation began that they have been inundated with calls from people trying to prepare for the operation, and some businesses posted signs barring federal agents from entry.

Louisiana State Police troopers and local FBI agents will work together to protect federal officers and stop attempts to block law enforcement actions during the crackdown, both agencies announced.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Pete Hegseth barely squeaked through a grueling Senate confirmation process to become secretary of defense earlier this year, facing lawmakers wary of the Fox News Channel host and skeptical of his capacity, temperament and fitness for the job.

Just three months later, he quickly became embroiled in Signalgate as he and other top U.S. officials used the popular Signal messaging application to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen. A Pentagon Inspector General's report on the matter was delivered to lawmakers Wednesday.

And now, in what may be his most career-defining moment yet, Hegseth is confronting questions about the use of military force and demands he release the videotapes after a special operations team reportedly attacked survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say the second strike would have violated the laws of armed conflict.

“These are serious charges, and that's the reason we're going to have special oversight,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The scrutiny surrounding Hegseth's brash leadership style is surfacing what has been long-building discontent in Congress over President Donald Trump's choice to helm the U.S. military. And it's posing a potentially existential moment for Hegseth as the congressional committees overseeing the military launch an investigation amid mounting calls from Democratic senators for his resignation.

Since working to become defense secretary, Hegseth has vowed to bring a “warrior culture” to the U.S. government's most powerful and expensive department, from rebranding it as the Department of War to essentially discarding the rules that govern how soldiers conduct themselves when lives are on the line.

Hegseth on Tuesday cited the “fog of war” in defending the follow-up strike, saying that there were explosions and fire and that he did not see survivors in the water when the second strike was ordered and launched. He chided those second-guessing his actions as being part of the problem.

Yet the approach to the operation was in line with the direction of the military under Hegseth, a former infantry officer with the Army National Guard, part of the post-Sept. 11 generation, who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and earned Bronze Stars.

During a speech in September, he told an unusual gathering of top military brass whom he had summoned from all corners of the globe to the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia that they should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement.”

“We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country,” he said. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for warfighters.”

But now lawmakers and military and legal experts say the Sept. 2 attack borders on illegal military action.

“Somebody made a horrible decision. Somebody needs to be held accountable,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who in January held out support for Hegseth until only moments before casting a crucial vote for his confirmation.

“Secretary Talk Show Host may have been experiencing the ‘fog of war,' but that doesn't change the fact that this was an extrajudicial killing amounting to murder or a war crime,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. “He must resign.”

Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who served 30 years active duty in the Air Force, finishing his career at the rank of brigadier general, said he hasn't been a fan of Hegseth's leadership. “I don't think he was up to the task,” Bacon said.

Trump, a Republican, has largely stood by his defense secretary, among the most important Cabinet-level positions. But the decisions by Wicker, alongside House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers of Alabama and the top Democrats on the committees, to open investigations provide a rare moment of Congress asserting itself and its authority to conduct oversight of the Trump administration.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who shepherded the defense secretary's nomination to confirmation, has said the boat strikes are within Trump's authority as commander in chief — and he noted that Hegseth serves at the pleasure of the president.

“I don't have, at this point, an evaluation of the secretary,” Thune said at the start of the week. “Others can make those evaluations.”

But Hegseth also has strong allies on Capitol Hill, and it remains unclear how much Republicans would actually be willing to push back on the president, especially when they have spent the first year in his administration yielding to his various demands.

Vice President JD Vance, who cast a rare tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, has vigorously defended him in the attack. And Sen. Eric Schmitt, another close ally to Trump, dismissed criticism of Hegseth as “nonsense” and part of an effort to undermine Trump's focus on Central and South America.

“He's not part of the Washington elite,” said Schmitt, R-Mo. “He's not a think tanker that people thought Trump was going to pick. ... And so, for that reason and others, they just, they don't like him.”

Tension between some Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon has been rising for months. Capitol Hill has been angered by recent moves to restrict how defense officials communicate with lawmakers and the slow pace of information on Trump's campaign to destroy boats carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

As he defends his job, Hegseth has spoken to both Wicker and Rogers, the top lawmakers overseeing the military. Rogers said he was “satisfied” with Hegseth after that conversation, while Wicker said that he told Hegseth that he would like him to testify to Congress.

Hegseth at first tried to brush aside the initial report about the strike by posting a photo of the cartoon character Franklin the Turtle firing on a boat from a helicopter, but that only inflamed criticism of him and angered lawmakers who felt he was not taking the allegations seriously.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth a “national embarrassment,” adding the defense secretary's social media post of the cartoon turtle is “something no serious leader would ever think of doing.” 

Schumer repeated his insistence Wednesday that Hegseth “release the full, unedited tapes” of what happened.

Later this week, the chairs of the armed services committees, along with the top Democrats on the committees, will hear private testimony from Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who the White House has said ordered the second strike on the survivors.

Republicans have been careful to withhold judgment on the strike until they complete their investigation, but Democrats say that these problems with Hegseth were a long time coming. 

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, pointed back to Hegseth's tumultuous confirmation hearing, at which issues were raised with his management of nonprofits, as well as allegations of a sexual assault and abuse, and drinking on the job. Hegseth had vowed not to consume alcohol if confirmed.

“You don't suddenly change your judgment level or change your character when you get confirmed to be secretary of defense,” Kaine said. “Instead, the things that have been part of your character just become much more dire and existential.”

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that National Guard troops will soon head to New Orleans and bring another federal surge to the city that is already awaiting a separate immigration crackdown dubbed “Swamp Sweep” that is expected to begin this week.

Trump did not say how many troops would be sent to New Orleans or exactly when they would arrive. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, who asked the Trump administration in September for up to 1,000 troops to fight crime, told reporters Monday that he expected the Guard to arrive in New Orleans before Christmas. 

“Gov. Landry — a great guy, a great governor — he's asked for help in New Orleans. And we're going to go there in a couple of weeks,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. 

Landry, a staunch Trump ally, has said he welcomes federal intervention in Democratic-run New Orleans, citing concerns about elevated violent crime rates even though local police officials say crime is down. Separately, Landry posted on social media this week that “We Welcome the Swamp Sweep in Louisiana,” referring to the Border Patrol-led operation that aims to arrest 5,000 people over the coming weeks. 

Opponents argue that deployment of federal troops or agents in Louisiana is unwarranted, especially as some cities have actually seen a decrease in violent crime rates — namely New Orleans, which is on pace to have one of its safest years, statistically, since the 1970s. 

In September, Landry requested federally funded National Guard troops be sent to Louisiana. In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Landry said there have been “elevated violent crime rates” in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport along with shortages in law enforcement personnel.

Landry also said the state's vulnerability to natural disasters makes the issue more challenging, and the extra support would be especially helpful for major events, including Mardi Gras and college football bowl games.




Louisiana National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Noel Collins declined to comment Tuesday. 

In 2022, New Orleans had the dubious distinction of being considered the “murder capital of the country,” reporting the highest per-capita homicide rate in the nation. That year there were 266 murders — a rate of 70 per 100,000 inhabitants.

Three years later, however, shootings, carjackings and armed robberies have plummeted. While there has been a spike of homicides in recent weeks, the city is still on pace to have its lowest number in nearly 50 years, according to crime data from the police department. As of early November, the New Orleans Police Department reported 97 murders.

Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Democrat who takes office in January, has firmly rejected the idea of a National Guard deployment in the blue city and has expressed concern that a federal immigration enforcement surge will lead to rights violations. She did not provide comment on the impending deployment.

Outgoing Mayor LaToya Cantrell, a Democrat facing federal corruption charges, previously said the city was open to working with the federal government to improve public safety. 

A spokesperson for Cantrell, Terry Davis, told The Associated Press in a written statement that the city and its police “have a track record of working collaboratively” with the National Guard and state and federal law enforcement agencies.

Other New Orleans officials have warned that troops could disrupt unique cultural traditions, such as the frequent brass band parades in the streets that are known as second lines or jeopardize hard-won relationships between communities and the police.

U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, a Louisiana Democrat who represents New Orleans, had a strong reaction to news of another deployment of a federal agency to his hometown: “New Orleans welcomes partnership. We do not welcome occupation,” he said in a press release Tuesday evening.

Carter went on to describe the deployment as a “political stunt” that causes “chaos” and lacks transparency and “meaningful coordination” with local officials.

“These are militarized forces who are not trained in our local laws, not trained in community-based de-escalation, and do not know our neighborhoods or our people,” he said. “That is a recipe for fear, confusion, and dangerous mistakes.”

In January, 100 guard members were sent to the city to help with security measures following a New Year's Day truck attack that killed 14 people and injured dozens of other revelers on Bourbon Street.

In September, Landry also suggested that federally funded National Guard troops should be sent to Baton Rouge and Shreveport, and Monday indicated troops would be sent to cities beyond New Orleans. 

In Baton Rouge, the capital, Republican Mayor Sid Edwards said this month that extra assets could provide “much-needed boots on the ground” amid a police shortage. 

Although homicides are on pace to decrease from the previous year there as well, the city has struggled with gun violence, with bystanders caught in crossfire made worse by the use of machine gun conversion devices. A recent multiagency initiative to crack down on violent crime resulted in more than 100 arrests and the seizure of guns.

In conservative Shreveport, the hometown of U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican Mayor Tom Arceneaux told the AP in October that violent crime has significantly decreased. Arceneaux said he was willing to work with the National Guard but would prefer receiving state police officers instead.

Louisiana is the latest place where Trump has sent — or tried to send — National Guard troops in recent months. Other cities include Los Angeles, Baltimore, Washington and Memphis, Tennessee. Leaders in Democratic-controlled jurisdictions have turned to legal action to block planned deployments, such as in Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Republican Matt Van Epps won a nationally watched special election in Tennessee for a U.S. House seat Tuesday, maintaining his party's grip on the conservative district with help from President Donald Trump. But the comparatively slim margin of victory fueled Democratic hopes for next year's midterms as the party grasps for a path back to power in Washington.

A military veteran and former state general services commissioner from Nashville, Van Epps defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn to represent the 7th Congressional District.

With 99% of votes counted, Van Epps' lead was around 9 percentage points. The previous Republican who held the seat won by 21 points last year, and Trump carried the district by 22 points.

Behn, who ran as an unapologetic progressive, ran up a huge margin in Davidson County, which is the most Democratic county in the district and home to Nashville. But Van Epps carried the rest of the district, including many deep-red counties throughout central Tennessee, as he tied himself tightly to Trump.

“Politicians who run from the president or abandon the common-sense policies that the American people gave us a resounding mandate on do so at their own peril,” Van Epps said at his victory party. “No matter what the D.C. insiders or liberal media say, this is President Trump's party. I'm proud to be a part of it and can't wait to get to work.”

Trump congratulated Van Epps in a social media post, saying he won even though “the Radical Left Democrats threw everything at him.”

At her own campaign gathering, Behn took the stage with a burst of energy, singing Dolly Parton's “9 to 5” in a western-style rhinestoned suit. Despite falling short, Behn said the result was “the beginning of something” powerful.

She noted that Republicans redrew the district three years ago to make it harder for Democrats to win, and “nobody in Washington believed we could get even this close.”

“Tonight isn't the end. It is the beginning of a next chapter of Tennessee and American politics — one of possibility, one of power and one of progress for the people that we love,” Behn said.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said Republicans should be “shaking in their boots” ahead of the midterms, which will determine control of Congress.

“What happened tonight in Tennessee makes it clear: Democrats are on offense and Republicans are on the ropes,” Martin said in a statement. 

Van Epps benefited from nearly $1.7 million in spending from MAGA Inc., according to a memo from the Trump-aligned group, with nearly half going toward digital advertising targeting people streaming video online. It was the first time the organization spent money on a campaign since last year's presidential race, a reflection of the special election's outsize importance.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and national Republican chair Joe Gruters rallied supporters in Tennessee on Monday. Trump addressed a crowd at a rally in the state by phone and later in the day held a tele-rally for Van Epps, his second of the general election.

Chip Saltsman, a political strategist and former Tennessee state party chair, said Republicans were slow to organize after a competitive primary. 

“In Tennessee, it's been a long time since we thought about beating Democrats,” Saltsman said. “It's been a lot more important to beat Republicans in a primary.”

“This time,” he added, “we had to pay attention.”

Republican leaders had hoped for a convincing victory to scuttle Democratic claims that even red districts are now in play as Trump struggles with low approval ratings and persistent economic dissatisfaction. In addition, Democrats recently won by wide margins in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere.

Behn had national support of her own, and the House Majority PAC put $1 million behind her. Party chair Ken Martin visited to campaign for Behn, and former Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a canvassing kickoff while in Nashville on a book tour. Former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a virtual rally for her Monday night.

Republican state lawmakers redrew the 7th District and two others in 2022 to help prevent liberal-voting Nashville from electing another Democrat to Congress. Only about 1 in 5 voters in the district, which spans 14 counties, are in the city. 

The seat was vacated when Republican former Rep. Mark Green, retired this summer. The single-race election came at an odd time to be casting ballots, with early voting ending the day before Thanksgiving and Election Day the following Tuesday.

Van Epps aligned with the president as closely as possible, telling him during the November tele-rally, “I will have your back 100%.” He won a crowded primary by a wide margin in October with a late endorsement from Trump.

Behn focused her campaign on fiery criticisms of economic policies that she said prioritize wealthy people and corporations, including Trump's tariffs and budget and spending law, both of which Van Epps supports.

But Republicans created a steady drumbeat of Behn's own words used against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” and made harsh remarks about Nashville and its tourist draws.

Trump supporter Anthony Bordonaro, 37, said Tuesday that he wants the president's policies to move forward but pointed to those anti-Nashville comments as extra motivation to vote for Van Epps.

“I just didn't really like what I was hearing about the other candidate not liking Nashville,” he said.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi breaks down the attack on two National Guardsmen and other key security concerns on ‘Hannity.'

Late last month, when former Afghan commando fighter Rahmanullah Lakanwal vanished without warning from his home in Bellingham, Wash., his wife, Khamila, called his phone, trying to learn where he had gone, according to people familiar with the matter. 

""Where are you?"" she asked in one call, speaking in their native language of Pashto, according to people briefed on the communications. 

He told her, ""I'm busy with some friends.""

Hours later, she called again. This time, he allegedly answered differently.

FOUR YEARS AFTER ABBEY GATE, VETERANS WHO SAVED CIVILIANS DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY

""I'm with Tablighis.""

He continued, ""I'm doing Tabligh,"" according to sources.

To his wife, the word ""Tablighi"" had immediate meaning, family contacts said, setting off alarm bells that she shared with Lakanwal's older brother, Ismail Khosti. In Afghanistan, surnames may vary among family members as they choose different tribal or geographical affiliations. The family is from Lakan district in Khost province.

Tablighi is an Arabic word that means to ""inform"" or ""convey"" and it refers today to Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic missionary movement established in 1926 in British India as a revivalist wing of the strict Deobandi religious school of thought that today fuels the tyrannical interpretation of Islam practiced by the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani militant groups. Much like its sister group, the Muslim Brotherhood, established in 1928, and other Muslim groups preaching the extremist Wahhabi and Salafi interpretations of Islam, counterterrorism experts say it acts like a conveyor belt to extremism.

Based in Pakistan and India, Tablighi Jamaat's influence is transnational, with networks operating in mosques and informal religious circles in at least 150 countries, including the U.S. It denounces terrorism publicly, but a report, ""Tablighi Jamaat and Its Role in the Global Jihad,"" by Brussels-based think tank the South Asia Democratic Forum warned the group serves as a ""catalyst, gateway, springboard or antechamber"" for Islamic radicalization. Several Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran, have banned Tabligi Jamaat, along with Russia, which disbanded a terror cell in 2020. In 2021, Saudi Arabia called the group a ""danger to society."" In the U.S., its missionaries operate freely.

Fox New Digital has learned that Lakanwal's brother has shared details from the phone calls, previously unreported, with FBI agents. Now, FBI and Department of Homeland Security investigators are scouring the country to see if anyone tied to the Tablighi Jamaat network radicalized Lakanwal, facilitated his cross-country trip or offered assistance, encouragement or financial support for his Thanksgiving eve ambush of West Virginia National Guard service members Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, as they quietly patrolled 17th Street NW, near the White House. Beckstrom died from her injuries. Wolfe remains critically injured.

TRUMP ADMIN 'ACTIVELY RE-EXAMINING ALL OF THE AFGHANS IMPORTED INTO THE COUNTRY' FOLLOWING DC SHOOTING

On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem hinted at this new information, saying on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ""We believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country. We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state.""

Amid reports that Lakanwal was isolated, depressed and psychologically distressed, counterterrorism experts said the new details add a critical dimension to the investigation,  noting that untreated trauma, isolation and grievances can create psychological conditions for extremist ideology to gain a foothold, creating ""wound collectors,"" a term that retired FBI special agent Joe Navarro coined to describe extremists, from Usama bin Laden to ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski, who use perceived injustices to justify violence with ""no statute of limitations on their suffering.""

While Tablighi Jamaat's leaders say their movement is apolitical, focused on dawah, an Arabic word for evangelizing or proselytizing, counterterrorism experts have said the movement's insular missionary culture has appeared along the early radicalization paths of some extremists, including ""American Taliban"" John Walker Lindh, a convert to Islam who attended Tablighi Jamaat retreats in northern California in the 1990s, including at the Santa Clara County fairgrounds.

After U.S. forces dropped bombs in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, CIA paramilitary officers captured Lindh in a prison near Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, among imprisoned Taliban militants who revolted, overpowering guards and killing CIA paramilitary officer Mike Spann, the first U.S. casualty of the war. Convicted in 2002 for serving as a soldier for the Taliban, Lindh was freed from jail in 2019 and is free on probation in the U.S. today, tracked by the FBI.

John Walker Lindh, an American Taliban member who was captured by United States forces as an enemy combatant during the United States' invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001.  

While the Trump administration issued an executive order last month to designate some of Muslim Brotherhood's chapters as terrorist organizations, Tabligi Jamaat hasn't been on its radar for action.

ALLEGED DC SHOOTER ENTERED US UNDER AFGHAN RESETTLEMENT PUSH MAYORKAS VOWED WOULD BE DONE ‘SWIFTLY AND SAFELY' 

Ironically, Deobandi Islam is the religious ideology of the Taliban fighters that Lakanwal and his brother battled for years as members of the ""Zero Units,"" covert forces within the Afghanistan's intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, funded, trained and supported by the CIA's secret ""Special Activities Division"" to fight the Taliban. 

While these Afghan fighters battled extremist interpretations of Islam in Afghanistan over the past 24 years, following the 9/11 attacks, counterterrorism experts note that organizations and mosques established by followers of the Muslim Brotherhood and Tablighi Jamaat have spread worldwide. Tablighi Jamaat representatives in Pakistan and India didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.

The irony is not lost on Lakanwal's brother, Khosti, a former company commander in NDS-03, known as the Kandahar Strike Force, where his brother worked as a paramilitary officer, former colleagues said. Over the past several days, he has told former Afghan military and intelligence veterans that he is ""ashamed"" of his brother's murderous rampage and he wants the full truth to emerge of how he ended up on 17th Street NW, turning his weapon on the very troops he had spent years protecting. 

Literally translated, Lakanwal's brother said, ""This was a wrong action,"" using the Pashto word ghalat to describe something that is wrong to do.

He told his former colleagues, ""I am ashamed of this action,"" using the word sharmezham, a derivative of the Pashto word for shame, a powerful dynamic in the honor culture of Pashtunwali in which many of the men grew up.

ABBEY GATE GOLD STAR FATHER BLISTERS BIDEN AFTER AFGHAN NATIONAL ALLEGEDLY AMBUSHES 2 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN IN DC 

Afghan Lt. Gen. Haibatullah Alizai, 40, the final commander of the National Defense and Security Forces after the president and defense minister fled Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, told Fox News Digital that he was sickened by the news of the attack and solving the mystery of Lakanwal's path to extremism is now a personal quest.

""It's a serious question how Rahmanullah Lakanwal became radicalized in the United States,"" Alizai said. ""I feel responsibility for this. I was overall commander of the Afghan armed forces. We must get to the bottom of this because we cannot allow this kind of violence in America or anywhere. We fought Islamic extremism every day against the Taliban. It is our duty as Afghans to help America get justice.""

It's understood Lakanwal's wife has since moved with her five sons into the home of her brother-in-law and sister-in-law in the San Diego area.

Countering social media rumors, Lakanwal's brother also told former colleagues that his only other brother, Mohammed Rasul Khan, is not working for the terrorist Haqqani network and died of a heart attack in 2021 in Dubai.

Now, as federal investigators zero in on Lakanwal's final words to his wife about being with the ""Tablighi,"" they are examining his life in the U.S. over the past four years. 

In recent days, media reports have pointed to two emails shared by a volunteer caseworker working with Laknawal to highlight possible psychological issues Lakanwal might have faced, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. After receiving the two emails from the case worker, Shawn VanDiver, president of a nonprofit, Afghan Evac, said he shared them with journalists to highlight unmet needs among Afghan military and intelligence veterans who worked beside U.S. forces.

HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE SAYS 'NATIONAL SECURITY BLUNDERS' OF PAST 4 YEARS HAVE EMBOLDENED TERRORISTS

The emails, shared with Fox News Digital on condition they not be published fully, reveal something else: eight references to ""manic"" road trips and periods when Lakanwal vanished for days with little communication. While investigators haven't yet established a direct link between the travel and any religious activity, analysts note that Tablighi work requires men to take small-group mission trips, called khuruj, lasting from a few days to several months, to mosques and communities.

According to the emails, after U.S. forces flew Afghan fighters from the ""Zero Units"" out on Aug. 15, 2021, Lakanwal and his family were moved to the furthest corner of the continental U.S. in Bellingham, a small seaside town, in January 2022. By March 2023, a volunteer case manager wrote in the emails that Lakanwal had lost his job, and he started engaging in ""reckless travel,"" ""manic"" bursts, where ""he will take off in the family car and drive non stop to A. Chicago B. Arizona this time."" 

In an email on Jan. 11, 2024, she lamented, ""My Afghan families, now in WA almost two vears are not thriving."" She added, ""No matter how many Pashto interpreters we use, and interventions, they are steering their families in ways that in the USA will lead to catastrophe.'

She noted, ""They have 3 of us White, American women volunteers trying to patch benefits together and chase [Department of Social and Human Services] requirements and English classes that none of them attend.""

Overwhelmed, she wondered, ""Perhaps is there a Pashto speaking Afghan male leader or advisor or resource that we can bring to these men to help them collectively and individually make better choices for their families ?""

ALINA HABBA BLASTS BIDEN IMMIGRATION POLICIES AS ‘ABSOLUTE FAILURE' AFTER DEADLY NATIONAL GUARD AMBUSH

By Jan. 31, 2024, the caseworker wrote a series of bullet points, including this: ""He drives day and night, and sends map pins to one of the volunteer sponsors, and we can grab photos from Instagram stories, but no other communication. His family generally does not know where he is or when he will be back.""

She added, ""As far as we can tell, these trips are not for any productive purpose."" She said he paid for gas with the EBT stipend he received from the government.

She continued: ""The last time he came home from a trip, (chicago) he demanded that his wife divorce him, (in front of sponsors who witnessed this)."" He apparently deployed a Thabligi interpretation of Islam that says husbands can say, ""I divorce you,"" three times to end a marriage.

Her last bullet point was: ""Right now, since he is off on a manic trip that has taken him from Bellingham to Phoenix to Indianapolis, his wife, Khamila, has been home with the boys in a period of relative stability.""

Khosti now tells Afghan friends that he wonders how his brother financed the 2,800-mile one-way trip from Bellingham to Washington, D.C., and how he obtained a firearm. 

VETERANS GROUPS URGE TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTINUE AFGHAN ALLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AMID BUDGET CUT CONCERNS

When Lakanwal's company commander, Mohammad Iqbal Selanee, learned the news of the shooting, he was on the job as a janitor in a San Diego-area hotel. He wasn't embarking on life-or-death missions, like he'd been doing beside U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but he was grateful to America for the gift of a new, safe start for his family. 

Looking at the photos of the National Guard soldiers shot by Lakanwal, he said he recalled the faces of U.S. servicemembers he'd fought beside. He also thought of his daughter, 11, as he focused on the image of Beckstrom, the young woman from West Virginia murdered. Spread across the U.S. at far-flung posts, he was hundreds of miles away from Lakanwal as his former charge had fled his home for secret road trips. 

Now, he has spent the past several days piecing together Lakanwal's alleged descent in the U.S. into a new army of zealotry with the Tablighi Jamaat.

""He's been with Tablighi Jamaat,"" in the U.S., he said. ""He isolated himself. He was away from his friends and family. Some people hurt themselves. He hurt the whole nation.""

""I'm not a commander anymore in the military, but as a human being, this is my responsibility to uncover what happened to Rahmanullah, for the safety of everyone. This is a big tragedy. For 20 years, we have fought beside Americans like brothers, and Rahmanullah betrayed that friendship. It is inhumane what he did.""

Lakanwal attended the Bellingham Masjid, operated by the Islamic Center of Whatcom County, blocks from his apartment, mosque officials confirmed. In a statement issued on Saturday, mosque officials said Lakanwal was ""not an integrated part of our community.""

For Ismail Royer, this investigation hits home on another level. A convert to Islam, Royer went to Pakistan in the 1990s after embracing an extremist interpretation of Islam and joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. He later pleaded guilty to weapons charges related to violating U.S. neutrality laws and served 14 years in a maximum security prison. While behind bars, he crossed paths with Muslims convicted of terrorism charges, including Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a plane over the Atlantic by lighting explosives in his shoe, and Lindh, the ""American Taliban."" 

Working now to counter extremism, Royer said Tablighi Jamaat can serve ""as a cover for jihadists"" and it can be ""a waystation, a stage in the path of someone from irreligious to religious,"" and then, sometimes, violent extremism.

Alizai, the final commander of Afghan military forces, said he fears that religious fundamentalists stoked Lakanwal's frustrations and urged him to lash out with violence.

An easy path would be to shame an Afghan military veteran, he said, by saying, ""You worked with the U.S.? You were a soldier? So, you killed the Afghans? You killed Muslims? Now they have brought you here. You have no job. You have nothing. You must restore your honor. They act like well-wishers, but they are actually your enemy.""

After hunting Taliban extremists in Afghanistan with American soldiers, Alizai said he and fellow Afghan veterans, including Lakanwal's brother, his company commander, Selanee, and members of the NDS-03 unit are on a new quest.

""We are on a mission to uncover the truth that led to the tragedy on the streets of Washington, D.C.,"" he said, one West Virginia family in America's rural hinterland grieving and the other keeping vigil by a hospital bedside.

'Outnumbered' panelists discuss a report on the National Education Association's efforts to advance LGBT justice.

Texas Tech University System Chancellor Brandon Creighton enacted new restrictions on topics of race, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms, and instructors who fail to comply could face discipline.

Creighton said instructors may not promote the idea that ""one race or sex is inherently superior to another; an individual, by virtue or race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, consciously or unconsciously; any person should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of race or sex; moral character or worth is determined by race or sex; individuals bear responsibility or guilt for actions of others of the same race or sex; or meritocracy or a strong work ethic are racist, sexist or constructs of oppression,"" according to a memo on Monday to university presidents.

""Promotion"" was defined in the memo as ""presenting these beliefs as correct or required and pressuring students to affirm them, rather than analyzing or critiquing them as one viewpoint among others.""

The memo includes a flowchart outlining a new approval process for any course content that includes the restricted topics. Faculty must submit the content to department chairs, university administrators and the Board of Regents for their review and approval.

Instructors are told to first determine whether the material is relevant and necessary. Then, they will be asked if the material is required for professional licensure or certification or patient or client care, in which case the material may remain in the course, but the Board of Regents will be notified. If the material is not required for those purposes, instructors must seek approval to keep it by submitting it to their department chair, dean and provost, who will forward their recommendation and justification to the Board of Regents.

Creighton said in a news release that the new rules aim to offer ""clarity, consistency and guardrails that protect academic excellence.""

A system representative said the memo sought to serve as a guide for faculty as they prepare for the spring semester and that the system hopes the new approval process will move quickly.

The memo states that ""the integrity of this process depends on the earnest participation of every faculty member,"" adding that noncompliance ""may result in disciplinary action consistent with university policies and state law.""

Kelli Cargile Cook, a professor emeritus who founded Texas Tech's Department of Professional Communication, said the memo led her to remove a class she planned to teach this spring, instead deciding to write a resignation letter.

""I've been teaching since 1981 and this was going to be my last class. I was so looking forward to working with the seniors in our major, but I can't stomach what's going on at Texas Tech,"" she told The Associated Press. ""I think the memo is cunning in that the beliefs that it lists are at face value, something you could agree with. But when you think about how this would be put into practice, where a Board of Regents approves a curriculum — people who are politically appointed, not educated, not researchers — that move is a slippery slope.""

TEXAS TECH TELLS FACULTY TO REVISE INSTRUCTION, RECOGNIZE ONLY 2 SEXES IN CLASSROOMS

She said she was shocked by the memo's characterization of certain race and sex concepts as ""one viewpoint among many,"" saying it treats settled facts ""as if George Wallace being a racist is a viewpoint,"" referring to the former Alabama governor who defended segregation.

Creighton's memo said the new requirements are the ""first step"" in the Board of Regents' implementation of Senate Bill 37, which he authored before he resigned from the Texas Senate to head the Texas Tech System. The law requires regents to conduct a comprehensive review of the classes all undergraduates must take to graduate to ensure they prepare students for civic and professional life and reflect Texas' workforce needs, with the first review due in 2027.

System leaders imposed limitations on how faculty can discuss gender identity in classrooms in September after a viral video of a Texas A&M professor teaching about gender identity led to public criticism from conservatives, the professor's firing and the university president's resignation.

Angelo State University, one of Texas Tech University System's five institutions, was the first to adopt changes, quietly directing faculty in September to halt discussions of transgender identities in class.

Texas Tech's then-Chancellor Tedd L. Mitchell later issued a systemwide directive that faculty must comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump, a letter from Gov. Greg Abbott and House Bill 229, which only recognizes the sexes of male and female.

Professors told The Texas Tribune at the time that Mitchell's guidance forced them to delay lessons, scrap terms like ""transgender"" and self-censor.

Creighton took over as chancellor last month after Mitchell's retirement.

The new policies at the Texas Tech University System come after the Texas A&M University System approved a new policy last month following the controversial video that requires each campus president to sign off on any course that could be considered as advocating for ""race and gender ideology or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity,"" although Texas Tech's new rules appear to go further since it requires a formal approval process that ends with the Board of Regents.

TEXAS A&M COMMITTEE FINDS PROFESSOR'S FIRING OVER TRANSGENDER-RELATED LESSON UNJUSTIFIED

Other universities that announced course reviews after the Texas A&M viral video controversy or in response to SB 37 have also sent new instructions to faculty.

Andrew Martin, the president of the Texas Tech chapter of the American Association of University Professors, criticized Monday's memo as a ""profound disappointment.""

""We had hoped that our new chancellor's time visiting the campuses of the system and getting to know students, faculty and staff would encourage finding common ground and a recognition that academic freedom is a freedom we all share, one that is foundational to a free society,"" he said.

Martin argued that the new rules and process violate the First Amendment and harm transgender students and colleagues while continuing to misstate law.

Brooklyn's alleged dine-and-dash influencer queen Pei Chung was evicted Tuesday from her luxury Williamsburg apartment by her landlord, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.

Chung — a self-styled, Prada-clad influencer who is currently in jail for allegedly skipping out on hefty restaurant bills — was chronically late with her rent and even remained in the unit even after her lease expired at 416 Kent Ave., according to court records.

Documents say Chung owed roughly $8,000 by the time her lease ended in August 2024. She stayed in the $3,350-a-month apartment after her lease lapsed, potentially racking up more than $50,000 in unpaid rent, the court papers show.

The office of City Marshal Robert Renzulli confirmed to Fox News Digital that an eviction warrant was executed Tuesday without incident. The New York Post reported that Renzulli spent about an hour changing the locks on Chung's apartment.

""The apartment was vacant,"" Renzulli said. ""The young lady was not there. The eviction is completed.""

He added that her belongings — including furniture, clothing and bedding — were still inside the unit, NYPost reported. According to city rules, the landlord must hold the items for 30 days before disposing of them.

""The general rule is that the landlord can dispose of the belongings, but in this case, I'm sure they'll be speaking to their attorneys before they do anything like that,"" he added.

The influencer was reportedly a troublesome tenant, according to the NYPost, which cited neighbors claiming there were ""repeated outbursts, visible signs of conflict, and disorder in the hallway."" Building manager Bob Jenny reportedly added that Chung would leave garbage in the hallway and make excessive noise.

""We are very aware of the situation and have a very active legal case against this Resident,"" Jenny previously said, according to court documents, NYPost reported. ""NYPD has been here multiple times . . . with little long term improvement.""

Chung — known for flaunting skimpy lingerie and high-end fashion from Cartier, Louis Vuitton and Burberry on social media — rose to notoriety after being arrested at least 10 times for allegedly skipping out on lavish gourmet meals at upscale restaurants, NYPost reported.

According to the outlet, frustrated restaurant staff said Chung, always draped in designer labels, pretended to be a food influencer as she ran up pricey tabs she had no intention of paying, then posted the meals on Instagram as though they were sponsored.

The penultimate College Football Playoff rankings are out, and things are starting to take shape for the playoffs later this month.

Ohio State and Indiana held their posts as the No. 1 and 2 teams, respectively. The Buckeyes got their four-year revenge over Michigan on Saturday, and Indiana manhandled Purdue to end their regular season. The 12-0 squads will face off in the Big Ten championship Saturday for the one-seed in the College Football Playoff.

Texas A&M lost its spot in the SEC title game with their loss to Texas and fell to seventh, but it is still likely to host a playoff game. That warranted Georgia, Texas Tech, Oregon, and Ole Miss (despite Lane Kiffin departing to LSU) to each move up one spot from their ranking last week. The Red Raiders now currently hold a bye-week spot.

Steve Sarkisian and Arch Manning both made their cases for Texas to be in the College Football Playoff after their win over Texas A&M. While they moved up, they sit at No. 13 and out of the current bracket.

Each team in the top 10 would make the playoffs if the season ended today, with the 11th and 12th seeds currently reserved for two remaining conference winners. That currently leaves No. 11 BYU and No. 12 Miami out, but BYU does face Texas Tech in the Big 12 title game. Miami, however, will likely be out of the bracket, considering their conference championship will be between No. 17 Virginia and unranked Duke.

Here is the full top 25:

Fox News has learned the known gang member accused of shooting and killing a California police K-9 named ""Spike"" is a Salvadoran national who was in the U.S. illegally, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) source.

Jose Domingo Ayala Alas, 37, allegedly ran during a Nov. 22 traffic stop, leading Burbank police officers and K-9 Spike to chase after him in a residential neighborhood.

Officials said Alas opened fire, shooting Spike, after the dog spotted him in nearby bushes.

Spike was rushed to an emergency veterinarian and was later pronounced dead.

Additional K-9s, a SWAT team and air support units responded and tracked down Alas, who was still armed with the handgun.

While multiple efforts were made to negotiate with him, Alas continued shooting at police officers, officials said.

Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies returned fire, killing Alas.

Republican congressional nominee Matt Van Epps called his win in a special election in Tennessee a 'resounding victory.'

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Republicans will hold onto a GOP-controlled vacant congressional seat in ruby-red Tennessee after winning a hotly contested special election by nine percentage points Tuesday.

Republican nominee Matt Van Epps on Tuesday defeated Democratic rival Aftyn Behn, according to The Associated Press, in the high-stakes race to succeed former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from office in June to take a private sector job.

""This race was bigger than just one campaign,""Van Epps said in a statement after declaring victory. ""It represented a defining moment for Tennessee and for the direction of the country."" 

With the GOP clinging to a razor-thin majority in the House, the special election was seen as a must-win for Republicans.

President Donald Trump carried the 7th Congressional District — which is located in central and western Tennessee, stretches from Kentucky to Alabama, and includes parts of Nashville — by 22 points in last year's presidential election. And Green won the district by over 20 points in his 2022 and 2024 re-elections.

But Democrats were energized following their decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections, and public opinion surveys suggested a close contest between Van Epps and Behn in a showdown that was seen as a key barometer ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the GOP will be defending its majority.

WATCH: WHAT AFTYN BEHN TOLD FOX NEWS DIGITAL ON ELECTION EVE

Asked by Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning if he needed to win the election by a certain margin, Van Epps said, ""a win is a win.""

But the military combat veteran and former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services added that ""we're going to press as hard as we can to win by the biggest margin we can, and then we're going to hold the majority in '26.""

Behn, a state representative and former healthcare community organizer, who's been dubbed the ""AOC of Tennessee"" in a comparison to progressive champion Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said in her concession speech, ""Although tonight is not the final result of what we wanted…it is the beginning of something so powerful in Tennessee and across the South.""

She delivered a similar message to supporters at a local Democratic Party office in Nashville on Tuesday morning.

""Whatever happens, win or lose, you've inspired a country. You've shown people the South has something to say,"" Behn said.

""For me, we've already won over the hearts and minds of so many Tennesseans and across the country,"" Behn told Fox News Digital minutes later when asked if she's a winner even without an election victory. ""What starts here changes this country.""

And she added, ""I think the electorate is shifting to accept a candidate like me that has a progressive track record.""

Behn was laser focused during her campaign on two key issues, affordability and healthcare.

But National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, in congratulating Van Epps, emphasized that ""Tennesseans know they can trust Van Epps to fight for their safety, security, and prosperity. No one is better positioned to take up the mantle and deliver results for Tennessee families, workers, and small business owners.""

Trump, whose endorsement of Van Epps helped the candidate win a crowded and competitive primary last month, took to social media to congratulate ""Van Epps on his BIG Congressional WIN.""

""Another great night for the Republican Party!!!"" the president said in his social media post.

And Van Epps, in his victory speech, said ""Our victory was powered by a movement of Tennesseans that are ready for change. We are grateful to the President for his unwavering support that charted this movement and catapulted us to victory. President Trump was all-in with us. That made the difference. In Congress, I'll be all-in with him.""

But Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, ""What happened tonight in Tennessee makes it clear: Democrats are on offense and Republicans are on the ropes."" 

""Aftyn Behn's overperformance in this Trump +22 district is historic and a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms,"" Martin argued. ""The fact that Republicans spent millions to protect this Trump +22 district and still lost so much ground should have the GOP shaking in their boots. Democrats are all gas and no brakes as we head into next year, organizing everywhere and competing in elections across the country. ""

And House Majority PAC, the top super PAC supporting congressional Democrats, claimed, ""Tonight's results make it clear: No House Republican's re-election should be considered safe next November.""

Asked about the Democrats' comments, Van Epps told Fox News Digital after his Election Night speech that ""we have the resounding victory. This is a victory for Republicans. It's a victory for our district. It's a victory for President Trump.""

""We are going to take this momentum forward, and we're going to win in 2026,"" he predicted.

DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, GO ALL IN ON FINAL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWN

With so much on the line, outside groups aligned with both parties shelled out millions of dollars to run ads in the race. And the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the rival Republican National Committee (RNC) each poured resources into the showdown, which included dispatching staffers onto the campaign trail.

House Speaker Mike Johnson spent the entire day on Election Eve with Van Epps, joining the GOP nominee at a slew of rallies and stops across the district. He was joined by RNC Chair Joe Gruters.

""We're going to win this seat, but we cannot take anything for granted,"" Johnson said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""Special elections are strange because a lot of people take for granted in a deep red district like this that the Republican is just going to win automatically. Nothing's automatic. So we're here to help turn out the vote and make sure we get this great candidate right over that line,"" Johnson said.

Aiming to motivate low-propensity Trump supporters, who often don't vote when the president's not on the ballot, Johnson emphasized that ""we need everybody to turn out.""

Before introducing Van Epps at Monday's first rally, Johnson called Trump on his cell phone, and the president spoke to the crowd for over four minutes.

""Let's make it a sweeping victory,"" Trump said. ""The whole world is watching Tennessee right now. And they're watching your district. The whole world. It's a big vote. It's going to show something.  It's got to show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.""

Trump joined Van Epps later in the day for an evening tele rally.

In another sign of the importance of holding the seat, Republican Gov. Bill Lee, GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as Republican members of Congress from Tennessee, state GOP lawmakers and rival candidates who lost to Van Epps in last month's primary, campaigned with him on Monday.

Behn also enjoyed last-minute support from high-profile surrogates.

Ocasio-Cortez; Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus the past four years; Black Voters Matter Fund co-founder LaTosha Brown and former Vice President Al Gore, a Tennessee native, all spoke at an Election Eve virtual rally.

""The reason this race is competitive is because I have been at community gatherings, potlucks, funerals, weddings, with the voters in the seventh district, and they remember that,"" Behn told Fox News Digital.

Behn faced repeated attacks that she's out of step with voters in the district.

""She does not represent the values of Tennessee or of America. She is as far left as you can get. She's a radical,"" Van Epps claimed in his Fox News Digital interview. ""We have to reject that ideology. And we're going to do that tomorrow.""

Johnson argued on Monday that Behn was a ""radical"" and ""a dangerous far leftist. And she will be a rubber stamp for Hakeem Jeffries and AOC and all the radicals in Congress.""

And Trump, repeating comments he made over the weekend on social media, charged that Behn ""hates Christianity"" and ""hates country music.""

Trump was referring to past comments Behn made from a 2020 podcast.

""I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an 'it' city to the rest of the country. But I hate it,"" she said in the podcast.

The district is solidly red, but includes parts of the Democratic stronghold of Nashville, Tennessee's capital and its most populous city, and a major national center for the country music industry. The district encompasses parts of north and west Nashville, including the downtown area which has long been a very popular tourist destination.

Behn, in a CNN interview on Sunday, noted that she was a ""private citizen"" when she made the comments. ""Nashville is my home. Do I roll my eyes at the bachelorette parties and the pedal taverns that are blocking my access to my house? Yeah. Every Nashvillian does. But this race has always been about something bigger. It's about families across middle Tennessee that are getting crushed by rising prices.""

Republicans also took aim at Behn over an op-ed titled, ""Tennessee is a racist state, and so is its legislature,"" that appeared in a 2019 edition of The Tennessean newspaper.

The RNC, pointing in a recent social media post to the six-year-old opinion piece, asked, ""If Behn hates Tennessee so much, why is she trying to represent it?""

Also resurfacing in recent weeks are anti-police comments Behn made on a now-deleted social media account.

""Clearly, I'm living rent-free in President Trump's mind,"" Behn told supporters on Monday.

And asked by Fox News Digital about the incoming verbal fire from Republicans, Behn joked, ""I always love to hear from my fans.""

She touted that ""I have a track record of showing up in the hard fights and small fights in between, not only as an organizer and as an activist, but as a legislator.""

And sticking to her key issue of tackling the high cost of living, Behn said she's ""running on a very simple message of addressing the affordability crisis that Tennesseans are facing, and they [Republicans] don't have a remedy for it.

Texas has emerged as one of the top battlegrounds for the midterm elections, both in its push for redistricting and as incumbent Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) fends off one of the most serious primary threats of his career. In Part 3 of this series, the Washington Examiner explores the redistricting wars that began in the Lone Star State through a series of interviews with strategists and GOP members of the Texas delegation. Read Part 1 and Part 2 here.

Texas led the fight for the mid-decade redistricting effort after President Donald Trump backed an effort in the state to gain five seats, but the outcome remains uncertain, pending a court decision.

The redistricting effort aims to create 30 Republican-friendly congressional seats, compared to just eight districts favoring Democrats, resulting in a five-seat boost for the GOP from its current 25-13 advantage.

While Democrats hope this effort backfires on the party, Republicans remain confident that their proposed map is constitutional and will be upheld in their uphill battle to keep the majority in 2026.

“What is remarkable is how redistricting could play out, which is that it could actually backfire on Republicans, because it's based on one cycle's assumptions, so the idea that you're going to go and lock legislative seats in based on the results of one election cycle may not be the genius move that it was proposed to be,” Democratic strategist Jon Reinish told the Washington Examiner.

“It's all with the courts,” he concluded.

States usually begin the redistricting effort every 10 years, meaning Texas was not expected to until 2030, but this rare move has sparked movement across the country.

A lower court in Texas issued a ruling that would require the state to use the map drawn by legislators in 2021. However, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito granted a pause to the ruling that would scrap the newly drawn map backed by the White House.

“Do I think Texas shifting its balance so that we get five additional seats, so the percentage is even fractionally closer to the absurdity of New England, Illinois, California, do I think that's somehow problematic? No, I don't,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told the Washington Examiner. “Do I think we will sustain the constitutional scrutiny on it? I do.”

Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX), the dean of the Texas delegation, also shared this sentiment, saying the new map will stand and that he has confidence regardless of whether the Supreme Court issues a decision on the case before the state filing deadline of Monday.

“The Court of Appeals did not do as other courts have done,” he said. “They seemingly offered no respect, they jumped in in the middle of filing.”

“It would not surprise me if the Supreme Court really did not address the issue,” he continued, adding that some stays issued by the highest court can “last for years.”

Democrats have been reevaluating their plans for the districts that would draw current members out of office. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) has reportedly been considering a Senate bid if the proposed Texas redistricting map is allowed to stand. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), who has represented the Austin area since 1995, preemptively announced that he would retire earlier this year, though that decision is in doubt due to the uncertainty.

“To borrow from Mark Twain, the reports of my death, politically, are greatly exaggerated,” Doggett said in a statement following the lower court decision. “This federal court order means that I have a renewed opportunity to continue serving the only town I have ever called home, as democracy faces greater challenges than at any point in my lifetime.”

“While Ken Paxton and Greg Abbott are appealing directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, I am hopeful about the final outcome, likely announced this month, since even a Trump-appointed trial judge ruled against the Trump gerrymander,” he continued.

Doggett was planning to retire instead of running against Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX), the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, which would have allowed Democrats to avoid a messy primary in the event of redistricting.

Texas members are not the only ones scrambling to finalize their reelection plans. Punchbowl News reported that Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) is planning to run in Texas after Proposition 50 passed in his home state of California last month, which redraws the map to remove five Republicans in response to the Texas redistricting effort.

The push to redistrict in Texas marked the beginning of a redistricting war that has since unfolded across the country in recent months.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) garnered a massive victory last month after he led an expensive campaign leading up to the 2025 elections to pass Proposition 50, a measure that allows the state to counter Texas's map by drawing out five Republicans in the state.

Other states, such as Utah, Florida, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, and Illinois, are actively discussing redistricting possibilities. Missouri and North Carolina have successfully passed new maps in response.

“I'm very concerned about the constant perpetual nature of redistricting,” Rep. Blake Moore (R-UT) told the Washington Examiner. “The norm was every 10 years, and it was part of the decennial census process, and we need to stick to that.”

Other members have also expressed this concern to the Washington Examiner that redistricting wars could become the new normal after this year.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Border czar Tom Homan said a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel would soon be coming to Minnesota‘s Twin Cities after a bombshell Somali fraud investigation.

In an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, Homan was asked by host Laura Ingraham for details about a hinted-at crackdown against illegal immigrants in the Somali community in Minnesota. The border czar confirmed that a crackdown was coming, but declined to give specifics to preserve operational security.

“I can't forecast that. … I don't want to give up operations, but I can tell you that Secretary Noem is all over it,” Homan responded when asked about when the ICE surge would come.

He said that ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would all be involved.

“President Trump's been a genius on this. He brings all the government to these operations. So, if we arrest an alien with drugs, you got the DEA right there, who can prosecute the case before we deport them. If you get them with a gun, you get ATF right there, and prosecute the case before we deport them.

Homan stressed again that he couldn't give exact dates, but hinted that some personnel were already on the ground.

“I can tell you, the focus is there. It's coming, but I don't want to give a lot. I can't tell you how many people are on the ground now, and how many people are going to be on the ground. I'll leave that to the secretary of homeland security, but focus is on those Twin Cities more because of the criminal activities there that've been uncovered by DOJ and DHS,” he concluded.

Trump has set his sights on illegal Somali immigrants in Minnesota after a bombshell report from City Journal regarding widespread fraud by the Somali community, fraud that allegedly involved the funneling of government funds to the Somali terrorist group Al Shabaab. The president vented about the community and Somalia in general in a Tuesday Cabinet meeting.

“And when you look at what he's done with Somalia, with Somalia, which is barely a country, you know … they have nothing. They just run around killing each other. There's no structure,” he said. “And when I see somebody like Ilhan Omar, who I don't know at all, but I always watch her. For years, I've watched her complain about our Constitution.”

Minneapolis officials have reacted with hostility, pledging not to cooperate with the Trump administration in any immigration enforcement operations. At a Tuesday press conference outlining how the city would respond to the operation, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara called on locals to call 911 on anyone wearing a mask trying to detain individuals. ICE and other immigration enforcement officers are known to wear masks to protect themselves and family members against harassment.

“We have experienced reports in this city … where people call to say that there's folks that are masked, that they're not sure if they're law enforcement, that they may be kidnapping people. We have had those reports,” he said. “I want to be clear to the community — the community should know that if you see something like that, that that is legitimate, that you don't know if someone is law enforcement, you should call 911, and you should provide as much information as possible.”

The police chief then went a step further, arguing that police should intervene even in cases where they believe the rights of the targeted individual are being violated.

“So if there is anything that is, you know, a violation of someone's human rights or civil rights, excessive force or anything like that, they absolutely have a duty to intervene as police officers,” O'Hara concluded.

Homan was livid over O'Hara's comments, calling on the police chief to resign during his Fox News appearance.

“Shame on you. I mean, your number one responsibility is the safety and security of your communities, and ICE is targeting criminals. Criminals! So, for you not to partner with ICE to make your community safer is shameful. He ought to put his badge in the desk drawer and walk away,” he said, adding that O'Hara had stopped being a cop and had become a politician.

He then threatened O'Hara with prosecution if local law enforcement tried to impede ICE operations.

“If he wants to watch, stand aside, do it. But if you cross that line, Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorneys are waiting to prosecute anybody that impedes law enforcement … doing their job. Zero tolerance for impeding ICE in their operations,” Homan said.

“We're going to enforce the laws of this country without apology, including in the Twin Cities,” he pledged.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Conservative commentator Scott Jennings said he's willing to make peace with actress Catherine Zeta-Jones “over seafood,” after a heated CNN exchange with her son left the Hollywood family reportedly furious.

Jennings addressed the on-air confrontation during an appearance on Meghan McCain's Citizen McCain podcast, where he said he'd “personally” make amends with the Oscar-winning actress.

“I'm more than willing to apologize personally to Catherine Zeta-Jones over a nice seafood dinner if she wants to do it,” he said with a laugh.

Scott Jennings may have upset Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones after completely dismantling their son on CNN last week… but he says he'd gladly make it up to Catherine over a seafood dinner.Click here to watch our full conversation with @ScottJenningsKY!… pic.twitter.com/ffUdYG06nq

The offer comes after 25-year-old Dylan Douglas, the son of Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, struggled through a tense government shutdown debate on CNN's NewsNight last month.

Jennings pressed the aspiring actor and political commentator on Democratic votes during the funding standoff, leaving Dylan visibly rattled and, at one point, stumbling over his own arguments.

According to gossip columnist Rob Shuter, Zeta-Jones called the segment “unfair and exploitative,” while Douglas told associates that CNN had “crossed a line.” The couple was reportedly so upset that they discussed blacklisting the entire network from future interviews.

“Dylan's never been spoken to like that in his entire life. He's always been the golden boy — adored, protected,” one source told Shuter. “CNN gave him a taste of the real world, and his parents hated every second of it.”

Jennings told McCain he was surprised the debate generated so much backlash. “Actually, I have to say Dylan was really nice off the air,” he said. “I think he was honored to be there.”

“We had what is relatively a normal exchange,” he continued. “He made his Democratic talking points. I dismantled him. Not an uncommon thing to happen on CNN.”

Jennings argued that some celebrity political commentators aren't used to direct pushback.

“They exist in a very tight little bubble,” Jennings said. “They never really talk to Republicans or conservatives… Then they wind up on television with someone of a different persuasion, and it's surprising to them.” He added, “I hope Dylan comes back. I'm sure he'll get better at it.”

McCain, who joked about being a nepotism baby, told Jennings she thought the booking itself was a mistake.

“I thought he should not have been booked on a show with you because it's like bringing a knife to a gun fight, quite frankly,” she said, recalling her early career missteps in TV.

She compared Dylan's experience to her own on Bill Maher, when Democratic strategist Paul Begala “schooled the living s**t out of me.” But unlike Douglas and Zeta-Jones, she said, her parents didn't melt down afterward. “My dad was like, ‘Buck up and move on.'”

Here's the debate in question: https://t.co/b97IeLcJ0Y

Dylan appeared on CNN to discuss the Senate passing a bill to end the record-long government shutdown. When he argued Republicans were solely to blame, Jennings cut in, “Who was casting the votes against opening the government, Democrats or Republicans?”

The two spoke over each other as Dylan shifted to specific topics, such as SNAP benefits and Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Jennings countered that Republicans voted to fund SNAP 15 times during the standoff, while Democrats voted against those bills. He also pointed out that eight Democratic senators eventually broke with their party to support the deal that reopened the government.

The back-and-forth left Dylan flustered, sparking the behind-the-scenes blowup described by Shuter.

After the podcast aired, McCain teased the exchange on X: “Scott Jennings may have upset Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones after completely dismantling their son on CNN last week… but he says he'd gladly make it up to Catherine over a seafood dinner.”

She added in another post: “Thank you so much for coming on @ScottJenningsKY — I legitimately hope Catherine Zeta-Jones takes you up on your offer and you guys get a lobster dinner.”

Jennings echoed those remarks during the interview, saying, “I'm more than willing to apologize personally to Catherine Zeta-Jones over a nice seafood dinner if she wants to do it.”

Despite the upset, Jennings insisted he'd welcome Dylan back anytime.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The fight was always for the independence of a country that can hold its powerful to account.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On the morning of November 28, Ukrainian law enforcement did something it had never before done in its history: It showed up at the apartment of the head of the president's office to investigate him for graft.

Commentators around the world have noted the strain that an unfolding scandal has put on the Ukrainian presidency at a time when the United States is pressuring the country to make concessions to Russia. But just as striking is the fact that an investigation into energy-sector kickbacks at the highest levels of government and business is happening at all. This is in many ways a victory for Ukrainian democracy, and for a civil society that, since the 2014 revolution on the Maidan, has worked tirelessly to hold its government to account, even during wartime.

In July, Ukraine's Parliament passed a law limiting the independence of anti-corruption bodies, and President Volodymyr Zelensky initially signed it. But under pressure from the street, he restored everything to the way it was before. Now nobody—not even the president himself—is authorized to stop the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine from carrying out its mission on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Andriy Yermak, a very close ally of Zelensky's and, until last week, the president's point person for the peace negotiations, hasn't been officially charged, but he was forced to step down as the investigation closed in on his possible connection to the case.

Read: Ukraine says it won't give up land to Russia

I have been a political journalist in Ukraine for 17 years, a span that encompasses the 2010–14 presidency of Viktor Yanukovych. Corruption is hardly a new subject for Ukrainian journalists, but the treatment of this year's scandal is certainly different from anything we witnessed before Maidan. Take, for example, an incident from April 2013. Journalists scouring Yanukovych's official income declaration noticed that the president claimed to have received a fee of $2 million in 2012 for books he had written. This was very odd. First, the Donetsk printing house listed as having paid him the fee specialized in advertising products and cardboard packaging, not in books. But more important, Yanukovych was not a popular author. He was not a writer at all. Rather, the president's literary work consisted of brochures for his political party and collections of interviews, none of which was sold in stores where it could have earned any profit. I was able to find these documents only at a single library, where the data I analyzed suggested negligible circulation. Everything pointed to a primitive scheme to launder his illegal income. That's what Ukrainian journalists wrote at the time.

Our articles garnered no official reaction. No one offered an explanation for the $2 million. Nor did the president's lawyers file suit to deny the media's claims of corruption. That's because the authorities were completely indifferent to public opinion and to what journalists wrote. They were brazen in their graft, and confident that they could continue being so. No doubt they saw $2 million as a piddling sum to worry about when much more significant embezzlement was going on. At that time, Yanukovych had already built himself a luxurious private residence, called Mezhyhiria, by illegally seizing a protected area in the Kyiv region totaling 137 hectares. Only the revolution halted his appetites. He fled to Russia in 2014.

Today, the situation is completely different. The Maidan Revolution led to the establishment of official anti-corruption bodies in 2015. Their creation was among the reforms that enabled a visa-free regime between Ukraine and the European Union in 2017. And now, in 2025, these bodies, and not journalists, are the ones to have uncovered large-scale corruption in the president's circle.

Zelensky reacted to the scandal very quickly. He imposed personal sanctions on his former business partner, Timur Mindich, who the investigation alleges was one of the organizers of the embezzlement scheme in the energy sector. (Mindich had already fled the country.) Parliament has dismissed two ministers. On November 26, the anti-corruption bureau questioned the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Rustem Umerov. In 2013, for law enforcement to investigate ministers and close friends of the president by questioning them or searching their homes or offices was unthinkable. Now it's everyday life.

The scheme in question appears to have been a very old-fashioned one. Based on recordings of conversations among the accomplices, certain officials and businessmen were receiving 10 to 15 percent kickbacks from contracts with the energy sector. That's pretty much standard operating procedure from 20 or 30 years ago. Maybe Zelensky was so focused on the war that he didn't know anything about it. But to imagine that his closest aides didn't strains belief. After all, Zelensky has made sure that the most important decisions for the country—in politics, war, economics, diplomacy, and governance—emanate from his office on Bankova Street. He places a premium on personal relationships. But fighting corruption may require detachment.

Read: Why Trump pushed for peace—again

The war has heightened our society's emotional reaction to scandal. Ukrainians are surrounded by death and destruction, and many pay daily for their country's independence with the lives of their loved ones. To see politicians stuffing their pockets with cash under these circumstances is very painful. Perhaps the officials involved have forgotten that morale is everything—that if Ukraine doesn't hold on, a Russian occupation will come for all of us, including the corrupt themselves.

The rawness of these emotions can be a problem for the anti-corruption movement, too. Trials can take years, and in the rush to see justice done, activists are sometimes impatient with or even forget about the presumption of innocence. Journalists can ruin an official's reputation ahead of any verdict. These are habits we can improve, emotions we can learn to temper, as we build trust in the institutions that Ukrainians have erected and defended to hold the powerful to account.

In spite of everything, the Ukrainian state remains surprisingly functional four years into this full-scale war. Trains run, banks operate, and drones are manufactured. Cafés and restaurants serve their patrons even during power cuts. Many businesses have purchased generators in preparation for winter blackouts. And Zelensky has so far withstood external pressure and refused to capitulate. His legitimacy is broadly recognized among Ukrainians, regardless of how much Russian propaganda denies it. But his political future in a peaceful country, whenever that circumstance arrives, will depend on what he does now and how he responds to the mood of the public. Because Ukrainian civil society has shown that it will not remain silent about matters of justice, even during a war.

The sanctity of the individual is an essential Western value.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Most of us are lucky enough to avoid any direct encounter with the true nature of Donald Trump's presidency. But over time, abstract nouns such as authoritarianism and xenophobia lose their hard edges with too much use. It can take some personal experience to bring home what the Trump administration is doing to human lives and values.

The solitary Afghan man who allegedly shot two members of the West Virginia National Guard near the White House last week, killing a 20-year-old woman and critically wounding a 24-year-old man, gave the president exactly the pretext he needed to crush the hopes of desperate people here and around the world. Trump started with Afghans, canceling all U.S. visas issued to Afghans abroad and barring visa holders from entering the country, including men and women who aided the 20-year American war effort in Afghanistan. He halted asylum hearings in the U.S. for all migrants; announced that green cards issued to migrants from 19 countries, including Afghanistan, would be reviewed; and promised to examine every asylum case approved under the previous administration. He wrote that any foreign-born resident of the U.S. found to be “incapable of loving our Country” or “non-compatible with Western Civilization” would be deported.

Juliette Kayyem: A terrible and avoidable tragedy in D.C.

This broad assault against the right of refuge is being staged on a heap of lies. Trump suggested that he would never have allowed the alleged gunman—who had served in a CIA-trained unit during the war—and others like him into the country; in fact Trump criticized President Joe Biden for leaving Afghan allies behind after the fall of Kabul in 2021, and the alleged gunman was granted U.S. asylum in April, under Trump. He said that Afghans were allowed into the U.S. “unvetted,” when they've been put through security screenings at every stage, from the original entry to the request for asylum and green cards. The claim by Kristi Noem, Trump's secretary of homeland security, that Afghanistan is now safe enough for her department to send Afghan refugees back there is a lie.

The argument that federal troops are needed in U.S. cities to end a nonexistent crime wave created by refugees and other migrants is a lie, as is the administration's insistence that national security requires mass deportation. Trump himself has undermined that security far more by purging the FBI of agents deemed disloyal, cutting millions of dollars from counter-terrororism, and diverting thousands of federal law-enforcement officers to the dirty business of rounding up men in Home Depot parking lots and arresting married couples who have shown up to a green-card hearing. “If they are correct in characterizing the shooting as a terrorist attack,” Becca Heller, the founder of the International Refugee Assistance Project, told me, “how come no one is talking about the intelligence failure that allowed a terrorist attack against U.S. troops on U.S. soil?”

All of these lies are built on a deeper one. Stephen Miller, the ideologue behind the foreigners-out policy, told it over the weekend in a social-media post: “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.”

If it were true that those fleeing horrifying violence are bound to inflict the same oppression on others, Miller might well have added: Just as Jews imported here from postwar Europe brought the industrial slaughter of Dachau and Bergen-Belsen with them and inflicted it on their innocent American neighbors in Scarsdale. Just as South Vietnamese who managed to flee the victorious North terrorized the peaceful streets of Galveston with civil war and torture. Just as multiple generations of Iranians and Sudanese have imposed the brutal tyrannies of their homelands on the good people of Los Angeles and Fargo.

Miller is justifying collective punishment and guilt by blood. I've witnessed those barbarisms elsewhere, in war-ravaged countries and in dictatorships, but never before during my lifetime as a matter of national policy here at home. Trump and his top aides are re-creating in America the conditions and terrors of failed states. They're erasing the distinction between the perpetrators and victims of violence. They're abolishing the essential value of the Western civilization they claim to be defending: the sanctity of each individual; the right of all men and women to be judged on their own merits, not as faceless carriers of the pathologies of entire societies and heritages.

David A. Graham: Trump seizes back the spotlight

Within hours of the shooting, I received a text from an Afghan woman I know, whom I'm calling Saman. (She asked that I not use her real name.) She's a refugee in Pakistan, where she, her husband, and their two small children are barely surviving month to month as they try to escape deportation by the Pakistani authorities back to Afghanistan. There an ominous fate would await them. Both Saman and her husband served in the Afghan special forces during the American war. She is Hazara, a religious minority that has suffered severe repression under the Taliban; her sister in Afghanistan is hiding from Taliban attempts to force her into marriage; her husband's brother is languishing in a Taliban prison. After years of repeated vetting by the U.S. refugee agency, the couple was about to be resettled here in January, when Trump returned to office and halted the program.

No other country is willing to accept them, and now they've been utterly abandoned by the country at whose side they fought. An administration that claims to be standing up for the U.S. military is inflicting moral injury on troops that have vouched for their wartime Afghan comrades, including Saman and her husband. I was still trying to find a way to tell her that their last hope of being allowed to come here had just died—that the president and his advisers have deemed her and her family incapable of loving America, incompatible with Western civilization, and certain to bring Afghanistan's chaos and terror to the United States—when I heard from her. I can't come up with any answer to the Trump administration better than what Saman said herself:

This tragedy was shocking, painful, and beyond anything words can truly express. I want to offer my sincere condolences to you and to everyone affected by this terrible event. I want to state clearly and with all my heart that I strongly condemn this attack. Such violence is inhuman, unjustifiable, and against every moral value I believe in. As an Afghan, I feel a heavy weight of sorrow and shame that someone from my country committed such a horrific act, even though I know very well that the actions of one individual do not represent an entire nation.

To be completely honest … sometimes I wish I were not Afghan. I wish I had not been born in Afghanistan so I would not have to carry the burden and the pain caused by the actions of people who do not represent the real, peaceful Afghan people.

I kindly ask you not to let this tragedy change the way you see me, or the many Afghans who believe deeply in peace, humanity, and mutual respect.

As vaccination rates slide, there are still ways you can protect yourself from cold, flu, RSV, and Covid this year.

This winter was already shaping up to be one of the strangest cold and flu seasons in recent memory.

With Robert F. Kennedy at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has been casting doubt on the value of vaccines in the months leading up to virus season. Even though his department did approve a new flu vaccine for this year, his advisers also recommended removing certain ingredients from flu shots, even though those materials are not used in the vast majority of vaccines.

They have also removed any specific recommendations for the Covid vaccinations and, instead, told people to depend on “individual decision making.” On the cusp of flu activity picking up in the US, a top Food and Drug Administration official is warning that the vaccine process should be overhauled because it is not sufficient, while making unsubstantiated claims that the Covid shots have killed a small number of children.

And now, the forecast for the next few months is getting worse.

Not only is there disarray among public health authorities, but this year's cold and flu season is looking to be especially bad. That is partly bad luck; developing a new flu shot every year is always a guessing game, and this year's shot is not very well matched to the most widespread flu strains. But, it's also partly a matter of choice, a consequence of the anti-public health mania Kennedy has helped stoke. The number of flu vaccinations administered between August and October was the lowest in the past six years. The number of Covid boosters available to the public has been steadily dropping with each new shot, and now, Kennedy Jr.'s health department has decided to limit access. Less than 15 percent of US adults have received a Covid booster this year, including less than 1 in 3 seniors over 65. New RSV vaccines for infants have had discouragingly low uptake.

This winter, more than ever, we are all on our own in combating flu, cold, RSV, and Covid-19. The federal government is no longer a reliable ally, because it has shown, with Kennedy leading the charge, that it will routinely ignore established science. The medical community is scrambling to fill the void, but the fundamental challenge is that many people, not only within Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement but across the political spectrum, no longer trust the experts.

In this new reality, not everyone will be on the same page. Some people may choose to take no precautions at all, even as cases rise. But, you do have agency to protect your personal well-being.

For a long time, public health was embraced by the public. It had stacked up wins over the decades: eradicating polio and smallpox in the 20th century and measles at the turn of the 21st. Diseases that had killed millions over millennia were relegated to the past as better sanitation, vaccinations, and greater awareness — the bedrock of the public health playbook — became woven into everyday life.

As recently as a decade ago, the people who opposed vaccinations and other public health interventions remained well outside of the mainstream. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself was, before the start of the Covid pandemic, a marginal figure who spewed conspiracy theories about vaccines and autism. Even Trump kept his distance from Kennedy during his first term, reportedly at the urging of Bill Gates, despite his own past flirtations with anti-vaccine rhetoric. And while Kennedy's influence and the work of other anti-vaccine activists may have chipped away at the public's belief in vaccinations, they had limited success. Most Americans still thought getting their annual shots was a good idea.

But, we live in a different reality now.

Two decades ago, 94 percent of Americans believed it was extremely or very important to get children vaccinated — near unanimity, according to Gallup. In 2025, just 69 percent still agree. In March 2020, 85 percent of Americans trusted the CDC to provide reliable information about vaccines, per KFF polling. By October 2025, that share had fallen to 50 percent.

When the worst measles outbreak in years took hold in West Texas earlier this year, local health officials were losing their federal funding and getting limited support at best from the CDC while Kennedy waffled on the value of vaccines and embraced unproven treatments such as cod liver oil. As Milwaukee contended with a lead poisoning crisis in its school buildings, its residents had no one in Washington to call, because the relevant team had been fired. Whooping cough is back and worse than it's been in years as vaccination rates fall. Kennedy has been mum on the issue, despite pleas from Republican senators to weigh in publicly and affirm the value of the whooping cough vaccines.

We're a deeply divided country, specifically on the subject of public health. And that means a lot of your neighbors aren't going to take precautions.

If you are concerned about your personal health, what do you do?

Let's start by talking about risk. Much of the backlash to the various pandemic interventions — things like masking and issuing vaccine mandates — was founded in different people's differing risk assessments and risk tolerance. You would hear it all the time from the opponents of those measures: Why should a young man with no serious health problems be required to get a shot? Many people today find the traditional public health argument — because he might unwittingly pass it along to another person who is more vulnerable — unpersuasive.

And, to be fair, it is true that certain people do have a much higher risk of Covid, or flu, or RSV than others do — and their choices and behaviors during what most of us call the cold and flu season can reasonably differ. No two people are exactly alike.

That is simply the reality we are living in: individual health, not public health.

So, your seasonal strategy should start with assessing your own risk. If you are 25 years old with no children and minimal exposure to the elderly, you may decide it's reasonable to take chances on, for example, going out in public when flu activity is high in your area. If you're a 65-year-old with a chronic health condition or a compromised immune system, you might not be willing to take the same risks; at least, you might want to think about wearing a mask if there are a lot of Covid or RSV cases in your community. If you are, like me, the 38-year-old parent of three, you might fall somewhere in between the two poles.

Think about your own situation and the people you come into contact with every day and use that as a guide by which you can evaluate your risk and make decisions. Get on the same page with the people in your life you see regularly: your family, friends and coworkers. You don't have to completely agree on your risk tolerance to be open and transparent about your mindset as we head into the season. If there are certain dealbreakers — like, I don't want you to come to my house if you have a runny nose or fever — talk about how you'll handle those situations in advance.

From that baseline, you need reliable information as the winter goes on and viral activity starts to pick up. Start local. Most people say they have much more trust in their personal doctor than they do in major medical organizations, including the CDC. If you have a primary care doctor, or you can find one, they will be a reliable source whom you can speak to face to face or over a telehealth call.

If you don't have a primary physician, or you simply want to educate yourself on what leading medical authorities are saying, you can check out the recommended vaccinations for children under 18 from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Different state groups — one on the West Coast, one in New England — are issuing their own vaccine recommendations for adults. The West Coast Health Alliance, for example, advises all adults over 65 to get a Covid shot, people under 65 with certain risk factors, and all adults who are in contact with high-risk patients.

Your insurance coverage could be different this year, too, after the changes to vaccine guidance made by the Trump administration. Kennedy's health department has scaled back the official government vaccine guidance to “individual decision making” — once again, you're on your own — and that could affect some insurers' willingness to cover the cost of a Covid shot. You could call your health plan in advance to find out if it will be covered.

And otherwise, keep an eye on what's happening in your community. State governments often publish infectious disease dashboards with up-to-date data, and local health departments usually send out advisories when local case loads are high. I live in Ohio, and here's what my local source looks like. Resources like this will help you understand the specifics of how illnesses are moving through your own community so that you can then weigh your risk and — if you choose — adjust your behavior accordingly.

You can still build a disease-resilient community this winter. But it's up to you.

Yes, there is a downside to GLP-1 drugs — if you aren't careful.

We're used to seeing Serena Williams on our TVs, muscles flexing, smashing a tennis ball past her opponent. But in a recent 30-second commercial, Williams traded the racket for a GLP-1 drug injector pen.

Williams, whose most recent child was born in 2023, has become a spokeswoman in her post-retirement days for Ro, one of the many boutique health care firms to get in on the GLP-1 craze. “They say GLP-1s for weight loss is a shortcut — it's not. It's science,” she says during the spot. “After kids, it's the medicine my body needed.”

• Patients should be eating a protein-rich, balanced diet and doing some kind of strength training when on an GLP-1 medication.

• Some patients taking GLP-1 drugs have experienced significant muscle loss and weakness.

• Experts worry that too many patients may be trying to use GLP-1 drugs as a shortcut instead of improving their diet and exercise to lose weight.

Here is one of the world's greatest athletes, giving voice — in commercials running during primetime TV, on the Today show, and on social media — to a frustration that many people have felt. She gained weight after she had kids. And even though, in her words, she was “doing everything right” after the pregnancy, she couldn't cut as much weight as she liked. That's where the GLP-1 drug came in and delivered results: Williams lost 31 pounds.

But there's just one problem with the pitch: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are, in some ways, a shortcut.

“Americans always want the fucking pill,” Dr. Robert Lustig, a metabolic scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, told me. “I view GLP-1s like a Band-Aid. … There's nothing wrong with a Band-Aid. But what if you didn't clean your wound and you just put the Band-Aid on? The Band-Aid is necessary, but it's not sufficient.”

The consequences of patients slapping on the Band-Aid — taking a GLP-1 — without treating the underlying issue with the kind of healthy eating and exercise that are still necessary even with these drugs is becoming clear. Scientists have found that some GLP-1 patients can lose significant muscle mass, as well as a loss of functional strength, due to a lack of energy. Rather than feel fitter and ready to go out in the world or onto the tennis court, these are patients who find walking up the stairs to be almost debilitating.

For this story, I sought to understand how this is playing out in American culture. In searching Reddit communities dedicated to GLP-1 drugs, I found lots of normal people whose experience backed up that research: They had long tried to lose weight but could never quite meet their goals — until they went on a GLP-1 drug.

But even as they lost weight, they didn't feel better. Some of them felt worse, weaker. There are dozens of posts of GLP-1 patients coming to their peers, asking for advice about workouts they could do to stem the muscle loss. A few hope to find the right diet that will allow them to feel energetic and avoid muscle loss while losing the weight — but without having to commit to strength training that needs to go along with it.

While the term “strength training” may conjure images of ripped bodybuilders, doctors increasingly emphasize the importance of muscle training for all of their patients, from the 30-year-old marathon runner to the 65-year-old retiree. That's because research has shown that more lean muscle helps you age better and protects against hazards, such as falls, that pose a greater and greater threat as you get older.

These drugs are already wildly popular, and their use is likely to keep growing. In November, the Trump administration struck deals with Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cash price of their drugs in exchange for expanded Medicare coverage. Those price changes, which will begin to take effect next year, could further grow the number of Americans taking these medications, including among seniors for whom any loss of muscle mass is a serious health concern. One quarter of GLP-1 prescriptions dispensed in 2024 were for people older than 65.

Falls are already one of the most potent killers of older adults; more than 40,000 Americans over 65 died from falls in 2023, and the death rate has tripled since 1990. If more patients start taking semaglutide for its effects on cognition, for example, and fail to eat and exercise properly, they could experience malnourishment and significant muscle loss; both could put their long-term health at risk.

That doesn't mean GLP-1 drugs are a bad deal for public health. On the population level, obesity is associated with a host of major ills, and Americans have long been desperate to lose weight. The class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and now countless others — Zepbound, compound GLP-1s, etc. — are the most impressive weight-loss tools we've ever seen. They work because they slow digestion and tell your brain you're full, which makes it easier for people to eat less. While these treatments are still fairly new, observational studies have found that patients who stay on these drugs for a year or more can lose 10 percent of their body weight on average. And on the population level, obesity rates are already starting to decline.

Scientists are also discovering that these drugs have amazing potential to treat a breadth of issues: from addressing substance-abuse disorders, lowering your risk for heart disease, and even potentially preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have found that taking a GLP-1 like Wegovy or Ozempic is even associated with lower cancer deaths.

But to stem the risk of muscle-mass loss, you must also be willing to commit to improving your diet and adopting a serious workout regimen over the long term. GLP-1 drugs may be magical when it comes to weight loss, but they are not magic pills. Which means that along with the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1s is a coming reckoning over America's shortcut culture.

Plenty of athletes who are not world-famous see the same appeal in GLP-1 drugs that Serena Williams did.

One person in particular stood out to me. A self-identified weight lifter, CrossFit enthusiast, and horse rider, who I'll call Sam, shared their experience on Reddit. They explained they had always struggled to lose weight despite strict meal preparation and eating a lot of protein.

And so, Sam started taking Wegovy. ”I'm happy with the results,” they said — before getting to a pretty big caveat for somebody who's always had an active life.

Despite aiming to eat 100 grams of protein every day, they said they were feeling weak. “I swear I can feel my muscle being broken down. Is this a thing??” Sam asked in the online forum. “I actually feel less firm, more wobbly and flabby. I seem to have less definition,“ they said. “Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”

GLP-1 drugs are undeniably exciting, and they are being widely adopted. I recently found out a family member of my own had started taking them, and they're not the kind of person who's susceptible to diet fads either. As a reporter, that makes me nervous: Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.

It would be wonderful if GLP-1 drugs could cure Alzheimer's, but we probably need to think through the trade-offs. And I started to pick up from other reporting and social media feeds I follow that some people were experiencing this unexpected muscle loss. I thought it would be valuable to unpack the science to explain why this happens to some people and explain what they can do to avoid it.

The internet is filled with examples just like this. “Anyone else having a hard time working out on Wegovy?” asked one Reddit poster last year. They even felt their arms were weaker while bowling. Another person realized something was wrong when they could no longer do yard work around the house. Other people have noticed leg weakness after light walking or climbing the stairs: “I actually struggle to go up a staircase and I'm only 32,” said one GLP-1 patient.

“I know a lot of people are working out, and I do need to begin exercising on top of the wegovy, but I'm just wondering if anyone else is experiencing extreme weakness or if it's just me and my un-toned self,” they asked.

Sam's post in particular had a lot of comments, with one respondent even urging the patient to reconsider: You are “a strong, capable goddess. You don't need to lose weight.” Accept who you are. In response, Sam laid out the dilemma that so many people who have sought to lose weight over the years face: “Unfortunately, some of us just do NOT lose weight with diet and exercise.”

It's true: Weight loss is not assured from diet and exercise. Some people have a genetic disposition to becoming obese. And not everybody who is obese is unhealthy; the body mass index is an imperfect measurement, and some people who are technically obese can still be healthy if much of their weight is muscle. Still, the realization that obesity is a disease to be treated, rather than a personal failure that can only be remedied through personal growth, has been important in reducing the prejudices that overweight people have long faced.

But at the same time, it is a slippery slope from acknowledging diet and exercise may not be sufficient on their own to thinking a drug like Ozempic can make them unnecessary. Some people, like Sam, have always exercised and viewed GLP-1s as an extra push to help them reach their weight goals. But I also encountered other people who did not necessarily have healthy habits before but were able with the drugs to cut weight for the first time. One patient on Reddit acknowledged that they don't work out and they don't adhere to a particular diet. They have been losing weight, but they are “scared” about losing too much weight — so they ask if they can just eat more chicken or drink a protein shake and regain the muscle “without working out.”

They have reason for concern: The same clinical trials that have shown how effective GLP-1 drugs are with weight loss have also consistently reported muscle loss or weakness among patients. When one group of researchers evaluated the type of body mass that patients on semaglutide drugs were losing, they found that about 40 percent was important muscle.

The GLP-1 market is only going to grow as the drugs prove useful for a wide array of treatments. People, including those who are not overweight, may take them preventively to stave off cardiovascular disease or dementia. For them, people who are already at a healthy weight, muscle loss is an even more serious concern. If GLP-1 drugs do prove to be promising for treating age-related cognitive decline, for example, then appropriate diet and exercise will be even more paramount for that patient population. The last thing we want is more seniors suffering catastrophic injuries during a fall because of lost muscle mass.

But understanding what exactly is causing the muscle loss is important. Scientists are still figuring that out, but early indications are that the cause is not the drugs themselves, then some of the lifestyle changes the drugs can lead to..

One study from researchers at the University of Utah suggests the loss of strength is largely the result of not eating enough calories. In their research on mice, they found less muscle mass loss than expected. Instead, after taking a GLP-1, mice were losing their functional strength — how much they could lift or move around — even when muscle size stayed the same. In other words, the mice appeared weaker even though their muscle mass hadn't changed.

“Strength is not just a factor of how much muscle you have, but whether you can move that muscle effectively. There's an energetic component to it,” lead author Katsu Funai told me. The animals on a GLP-1 drug may have had less energy because they were eating less — and therefore they wouldn't be able to exert as much force with their muscles. It's not the GLP-1s per se; it's what the GLP-1s lead to without intervention.

The findings could inform how we prescribe Ozempic, Funai said: Smaller doses might help to mitigate the loss of functional strength. Otherwise, losing weight too quickly is going to mean losing energy quickly — and therefore feeling weaker. In the excitement over Ozempic, and the potential to lose a lot of weight and fast, people seem to have forgotten a fundamental truth about weight loss: “More is not necessarily better,” Funai said.

Before GLP-1 drugs existed at all, dieticians urged their patients to pace weight loss — no more than 1-2 pounds per week — for exactly this reason: You don't want to end up malnourished and weakened. With a conventional diet, that can often lead to you eating more, which in turn eliminates the weight loss. But when your appetite is suppressed by GLP-1s, the weight loss can continue, and with it, strength and energy loss.

“With these GLP-1s, that conversation [about diet and exercise] has been sidelined,” Funai said. “There are nuances to these things that I think are being missed not just from the public, but also from scientists,”

Ironically, the very problem that GLP-1s were meant to overcome — that many Americans simply struggle to eat right and exercise enough — remains just as central even with the drugs.

And many of the people taking GLP-1s are starting at a disadvantage: Only 49 percent of Americans say they are extremely or very confident that they know what a healthy diet looks like, and about twice as many say they should get more exercise.

If your sole goal is to lose weight, a GLP-1 alone could get you there — but not in the healthiest way. Unless you change what you eat, you're still putting the same junk in your body — albeit less of it — with the same or more negative effects on your energy and stamina.

“If you don't change your behavior, if you don't change your habits, you may be looking good, you may be losing weight, but metabolically, your body is in turmoil,” said Nayan Patel, a pharmacist who works with patients taking the drugs. “We've got to use these drugs in the right manner.”

So what should people on GLP-1s aim to eat? A high-protein diet delivering a lot of amino acids is important, Patel said: Eggs, nuts, lentils, poultry, and fish are all good sources. You can cut down on the carbs and sugars; your body won't need them to produce energy because you'll be cutting fat. Eating protein and strength training allows your body to be more effective at trimming the fat, without compromising your core strength.

Like anything hard but worth doing, there's a lot to overcome. Many Americans have become intimidated by gym culture, so they might prefer to work out in privacy, at home — but they don't know how. One person I encountered posted online to crowdsource advice on home equipment and routines. They said they didn't want to go to a gym, but “I know I'm out of shape,” the poster confessed to their fellow Redditors.

The thread flooded with advice from simple workout routines to try to role models they could follow on social media. The advice included some very approachable strategies — something as simple as sitting in a chair with your legs outstretched and using your abdominal muscles to lift them from side to side over a water bottle. Some commenters recommended incorporating a resistance band and a workout ball. Health care providers have developed general recommendations for patients taking a GLP-1 drug: Mass General, for example, advises a mixture of 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise — activities like walking or riding a bike — or about 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise like jogging or swimming laps in addition to two days of weight training and a steady dose of stretching and flexibility workouts.

While I found plenty of people concerned with unexpected muscle loss, there were also examples of patients proudly showing off their lean and muscular new physiques. It can be done.

But in this vision, GLP-1s are a jumpstart, not a shortcut. “Losing weight is everybody's goal. Using a drug to jumpstart is an excellent way to do the process,” Patel said. “But if you're not taking the first two steps, you'll stumble until you fall flat on your face.”

I quit podcasts for a month and discovered a new reality.

The most embarrassing thing happened to me recently. It was twilight, and I was walking my dog around the quiet Brooklyn neighborhood where I've been living for about a year. Then I heard a sound that I couldn't place at first. I stopped in my tracks and then realized: Crickets were chirping.

It was my first time hearing crickets in my new neighborhood because it was one of the first times I'd walked through it without AirPods jammed into my ears.

This happened for a reason. Earlier this year, I had the sudden realization that I was listening to too many podcasts and had been for years. What started out as a way to distract myself on long subway rides became a compulsion on long walks during the pandemic. The next thing I knew I'd be catching up on The Daily while washing dishes or listening to five minutes of Radiolab as I took out the trash. Soon, all of my quiet moments were filled with other people's voices, and I felt like I couldn't think my own thoughts, even when I sat in silence. So I decided to quit podcasts for a month.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

It's remarkable what quitting something you enjoy can do to your worldview. But quitting podcasts also did something to my brain. As days stretched into weeks, I started to recognize some order returning to my thoughts. Whereas podcasts kept my mind occupied at all times, the absence of them created space for me to focus on one thing. My attention span improved. I read a couple of books. I smiled at my neighbors. I noticed the crickets.

You could chalk all this up to a placebo effect. I decided to be more present and so I was. It's like if you decide to stop drinking for Dry January and feel healthier the very next day. But suspecting there was more going on upstairs, I reached out to psychologists, neuroscientists, and other researchers who study cognition. They explained the science behind the brain's default mode network, which controls your train of thought, and processes like perception, which helps us filter information to understand the world around us, as well as executive function, which refers to your ability to plan and to focus. Indeed, by turning off one relentless stream of stimulus, I was freeing up bandwidth in my brain. By not listening to other people's stories, I could better narrate my own.

That conclusion sounds a bit obvious. What was less obvious to me was that listening to podcasts while doing literally anything else amounts to multitasking, which is impossible. The human brain works like an analog computer, processing packets of information one at a time, and our minds are very limited in bandwidth, according to Earl Miller, a professor of neuroscience at MIT.

“When you think you're multitasking, what you're doing is task switching,” Miller told me. “Your brain is rapidly switching from one task to another all the time, and you don't notice it. But it comes at a cognitive cost.”

Thanks largely to smartphones, we've become a society of meandering multitaskers. With screens constantly in our peripheral vision — or in my case, earbuds always in my head — we're switching back and forth between the real and the virtual world. Meanwhile, some of the most popular apps on those devices are designed to hold as much of our attention for as long as possible. Podcasts invite you to listen to the next episode. Instagram impels you to keep you scrolling. TikTok wants you to keep watching.

As we increasingly split our attention, we end up living in the real world in a diminished capacity. Our brains didn't evolve to live like this.

It would be handy to blame smartphones for all my distractions, but the problem dates back to the '90s when the Walkman ruled my youth. My family ran a restaurant in Tennessee, where I was in charge of washing dishes, hundreds of them, several nights a week. In pursuit of just a little bit of distraction, I spent those hours listening to mixtapes.

Then I went to college in the early 2000s and got my first iPod, the device for which podcasts are named. With 10,000 songs in my pocket, I'd walk around campus attached to my earbuds. It was around this time that I learned how music could actually help me focus — but only if it was familiar and usually lyric-free. Then came life with an iPhone in New York, riding the subway with AirPods, and an itch to consume more and more information in my free time.

It turns out silence is really good for you. 

It wasn't just me, either. Between 2015 and 2025, the amount of time Americans spent listening to podcasts increased by 355 percent. About a quarter of those listeners spend more than 10 hours a week with their podcasts. Writing in New York Magazine a few years ago, journalist Sirena Bergman admitted to spending 35 hours a week listening to podcasts and wondered the same thing as me: What is all this content doing to my brain?

Listening to a work week's worth of podcasts deprives your brain of a lot of silence. And it turns out silence is really good for you.

There's a mountain of scientific evidence for this. In 2005, medical researcher Luciano Bernardi studied the physiological effects of listening to different styles of music. Much to his surprise, his subjects were most relaxed — their blood pressure dropped, their heart rate slowed — during the random two minutes of silence between the songs. Ten years later, neurobiologist Imke Kirste exposed different groups of mice to certain sounds, everything from Mozart to white noise to nothing at all, for two hours a day. Exposure to sound led to neurogenesis in all of the mice, but those new cells turned into functioning neurons only in the mice exposed to silence. In other words, an absence of input actually made their brains grow.

Silence also allows your brain to create an internal narrative. Neuroscientist Marcus Raichle and a team of Washington University researchers called the baseline state of an unstimulated brain the “default mode” — and it's actually quite active even when at rest. Self-reflection happens when your brain's in this default mode network. It's then that we construct our autobiographical narrative, and that we daydream.

The regions of the brain that light up in default mode also deactivate when your brain is doing other things. When you're listening to a podcast, for example, it's more difficult for your mind to wander. As Alexander Huth, a neuroscientist at the University of California Berkeley, explained to me, the external narrative takes over your internal narrative.

Podcasts specifically make it hard to think your own thoughts, because you're focusing on someone else's story. Huth and his colleagues used an MRI machine to record people's brain activity while they listened to shows, like “The Moth Radio Hour.” This allowed them to make a map of people's sensory, emotional, and memory networks. Notably, Huth told me, “all the default mode network areas track the content of a story,” whether you're listening to it in a podcast or around a campfire.

“When somebody is telling you a story you still have this running train of thought happening, but it's not your internally generated one,” Huth said. “You're following somebody else's running train of thought.”

You can switch back and forth between the podcast and your internal dialogue. But task-switching comes with a cognitive cost. As I'd noticed on my distracted subway rides, your mind can't wander far when it's being pulled in another direction.

Self-reflection, by the way, is super important. It improves everything from your performance at work to your resilience to stress. Positive thinking when your brain is in default mode can also just make you feel happier.

The crickets incident happened in the second week of my experiment, and it didn't take a neuroscience lesson for me to understand why. Once I stopped listening to podcasts, I started listening to the world. I heard birds singing, leaves rustling, and horns honking. What happened in the space between — my mind wandered, I thought about the day, I made plans — did have a more sophisticated scientific explanation. With my brain left in default mode longer, my capacity for self-reflection rebounded.

If I'm being honest, I got bored, too. This was a good thing, for the most part. I did miss being distracted from chores, though. My subway rides felt longer, and driving seemed less fun. Podcasts, I realized, were how I filled the idle but slightly annoying minutes of my days. It didn't feel like missing out on much if I were listening to a history podcast while washing dishes or folding laundry. Quite the contrary: I was learning about how the Medici family shaped the banking system of the Middle Ages or why the swing dancing craze of the 1990s fizzled out so fast. But I would also find myself slightly distracted and needing to rewind the episode to relisten to something I missed.

The problem with doing two things at once is that you typically can't.

Again, the problem with doing two things at once is that you typically can't. Not all tasks are created equal, of course. Learning medieval history is cognitively demanding, in part, because your brain is taking in a lot of new information. Washing dishes is not, since you've done it so many times the task has become automatic.

“These automatic behaviors do not rely on the same neural network that is important for attention and cognitive control,” said René Marois, a neuroscience professor at Vanderbilt. “But even during these automatic behaviors, something can happen that will require attention and cognitive control and that's when things can go awry.”

This is why, when my experiment ended, I did not return to my old habit of driving and listening to podcasts. Driving is automatic enough that it's not hard to follow a podcast, but paying close attention to a good episode is distracting enough that I might miss a turn, or worse.

Human evolution is to blame here. Our brains evolved on a savannah, in an information-poor environment where there wasn't a lot to pay attention to, explained Miller, the MIT professor. That's why we now have mechanisms to focus intently on one thing at a time. At the same time, we developed a thirst for new information, like rustling bushes, since that could indicate a threat, like a tiger ready to attack.

“Back when our brains first evolved, that was fine,” said Miller. “But now, in this new world we're living in with all these screens and sources of information available to us, it's a perfect storm of cognitive confusion that our brains have not evolved to deal with.”

That said, there is evidence that pairing certain tasks can improve attention and focus. For a 2005 study, researchers from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam showed subjects two targets on a screen, a split second apart. Most people couldn't spot the second due to a so-called attentional blink. The researchers theorized that people were overinvesting their attention in the task. When they played some background music, however, they got better at spotting the second target. The slight distraction offered by music put them in a diffused state of attention, slightly improving their focus.

This might help explain why I can write while listening to minimal techno but not to folk music. The electronic beats take the edge off, while the woodsy lyrics engage the parts of my brain that process language. Or, if I'm back in my ancestral savannah, the grass rustling in the breeze is calming, while a surprising snarl is cause for alarm.

It's really hard to stop multitasking in the 21st century. Even during my podcast experiment, which ended with me being rather obsessed with quiet time, I'd find myself reaching for my phone during conversations or chatting in Slack while finishing up a draft. But knowing what I now know about how our brains work, I have a new reverence for break time.

This is old advice: When you find yourself stuck on something, put it down and come back later with fresh eyes. But to build on that, when you take a break, don't switch from your laptop to TikTok. Go outside and look at a tree.

Listening to podcasts, relaxing as it may seem, depletes your cognitive resources.

“One of the best things that people can do is to take a break, go outside in nature,” said Gloria Mark, professor of informatics at the University of California San Diego and author of Attention Span. “Just being away from media and using our full range of senses can help restore our cognitive resources.”

Your brain runs on cognitive resources, and focusing on tasks drains those resources as the day goes on. Doing a hard math problem costs you cognitive resources. So does having an intense discussion. Listening to podcasts, relaxing as it may seem, depletes your cognitive resources, too. If you're trying to do two things at once, you're task switching, forcing your brain to retrieve specific information for each task, and wearing yourself out. As a result, it takes longer to do each task, and you'll probably make more mistakes. You'll also be more stressed along the way.

Listening to podcasts while doing at least one other thing used to be my break time. I wouldn't necessarily care what the podcast was about or absorb the information therein. I'd just let the media wash over me like a river over stones.

This was, in retrospect, a lousy way to unwind. These days, I wear my headphones less. I actually look at my phone less, if only because I'm not constantly pulling up a fresh podcast. When I walk my dog, I walk to the park and listen to the swaying grass and listen to the trees. The only thing sweeter than the sound of crickets there is the occasional sigh of silence.

His administration is now openly advancing a worldview built by white nationalists in the 2010s.

Late on Thanksgiving Day, a holiday whose central fable is about the American value of welcoming strangers in need, President Donald Trump announced an intent to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover.”

It is not clear exactly how exactly this sweeping policy is supposed to work in practice — or if, as is often the case, the president's posts bear little resemblance to policy reality. But it does have a clear precedent: a speech given by Richard Spencer, the leader of the once-prominent “alt-right” movement, given just after Trump's victory in 2016.

“One fundamental policy we're going to put forward is a break on all immigration, particularly non-European immigration, for a 50-year period,” Spencer said at a November 2016 conference.

At the time, Spencer acknowledged his proposal was “certainly out in front of anything Donald Trump said.” Now, however, the president has adopted a version of Spencer's policy as his own.

This is hardly the only example of the White House adopting language from the 2010s-vintage white nationalist movement.

At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump railed against Somali immigrants — saying “I don't want them in our country” because America could “go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage.” Top White House adviser Stephen Miller referenced a prominent alt-right critique of immigration in a tweet last week. A call for “remigration,” a vision of mass deportations developed by Europe's alt-right equivalent, has been embraced by Trump's Homeland Security and State departments. And the concept of a “great replacement” of Americans by migrants, once the province of tiki-torch marchers at Charlottesville, is now widely proclaimed by the Republican Party's leading figures — from Trump on down.

This isn't entirely new: Miller, a college friend of Richard Spencer's, sent emails privately citing white nationalist websites and advocating for a full immigration ban all the way back in 2015.

But in Trump's first term, this kind of thing was not for public consumption — and when exposed, it caused a scandal. In 2018, for example, Trump fired speechwriter Darren Beattie after he got caught giving a speech at an alt-right event.

In the second term, the Trump administration appointed Beattie to a high-level position at the State Department. He never repudiated his extremism; what changed is that the alt-right influence on the White House is now open rather than hidden.

The mask is well and truly off.

Since its origins in the late 2000s, the alt-right (short for “alternative right”) aimed to build out a parallel vision for conservative politics rooted in an explicit white nationalism. Its leading ideologues — writers like Spencer, Peter Brimelow, and John Derbyshire — believed that the existing conservative movement was unwilling to take seriously their belief that the US should be a country governed for and by its white majority. Non-white immigration, in their view, threatened everything that made the United States great.

In this respect, they went further than even the right's mainstream immigration hawks of their time. Typically, right-wing immigration hawks focused on the downstream effects of immigration: claiming that current policy was suppressing working-class wages or causing an increase in crime. Such concerns could, in theory, be addressed by reforms to existing immigration policy; by spending more on assimilation programs or prioritizing high-skilled immigrants, for example.

Within this context, the alt-right's defining move was to argue purely on the basis of ethnic or national origin. In their view, there are entire classes of people — those hailing from poor or “Third World” countries — who cannot under any circumstances adapt to America. Whether for reasons of culture or biology, or perhaps both, bringing such people to the United States would inherently make the country poorer, weaker, and dirtier. It is an argument for collective responsibility: for holding all migrants from a particular country responsible for problems with its government or society.

The alt-right mocked the idea that individual immigrants could adapt to America as “magic dirt” theory.

“Sure, Mexico and Central America are messed-up places, and presumably their inhabitants played some role in messing them up. If we just move thirty or forty million of those people to the USA, though, our Magic Dirt will transform them into civic-minded Jeffersonian yeomen!” Derbyshire wrote in a 2015 column for the alt-right site VDARE.

At the time, these ideas were too toxic even for the Trump wing of the GOP. At the inaugural 2019 National Conservatism conference, an effort to build a more intellectual Trumpist nationalism, the organizers made a show out of refusing admission to prominent alt-right figures like Brimelow. When I reported on a conference presenter advancing “magic dirt” arguments against non-white immigration during one of the panels, it turned into a PR disaster for the event.

Yet today, this sort of thing is proclaimed openly at the highest levels — in actual policy concepts like Trump's “Third World” ban and the State Department's proposed “Office of Remigration,” but also in its rhetoric and argumentation.

Last week, for example, a Wall Street Journal opinion piece argued that the US government should not punish all Afghan immigrants for the actions of the asylum seeker who shot two National Guard members in Washington, DC. In response, Stephen Miller explicitly invoked the magic dirt theory against what he called “the great lie” that America can integrate large numbers of migrants from poor countries.

“No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders,” Miller writes. “At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.”

Similarly, leading conservative activist Chris Rufo — a figure closely aligned with the White House — has been on a tear against Somali immigrants, using a recent fraud case in Minnesota involving Somali perpetrators as evidence that the entire community was hurting America. When confronted with the argument that it's wrong to blame all Somali immigrants for the actions of fraudsters, Rufo implied that it's actually quite reasonable to see Somalis collectively as the problem.

“The national culture of Somalia is different from the national culture of Norway. Somalis and Norwegians therefore tend to think differently, behave differently, and organize themselves differently,” he wrote. “Norwegians in Minnesota behave similarly to Norwegians in Norway; Somalis in Minnesota behave similarly to Somalis in Somalia.”

That's why, he argued, the US should begin explicitly redesigning its immigration policy around ethnicity. (On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced a new initiative to crack down on Somali migrants in Minnesota.)

“In the United Kingdom, mass immigration from incompatible cultures is creating a civilizational crisis. Rather than replicate the policies of our sister country, we should accept reality and adopt a more thoughtful policy, which recognizes cultural norms as a reasonable measure of capacity to assimilate and to contribute,” he writes.

Rufo is not, by the wild standards of the second Trump term, an extremist. He has repeatedly called on the right to reject Nick Fuentes, the neo-Nazi streamer popular with young conservatives.

Yet this merely shows how much the contours of the debate have shifted. Ideas about immigration that were once scandalous, even in the first Trump term, are now openly proclaimed without anyone being especially scandalized or surprised.

You'd think, given the alt-right's evident influence on the current White House, its leaders would be taking a public victory lap. Yet the movement has all but dissolved as an independent entity — battered by lawsuits emanating from the 2017 Charlottesville rally violence and outflanked on the edgelord right by even more radical figures. There is no better example of the alt-right's formal dissolution than Richard Spencer's recent effort to reinvent himself as a Trump-critical quasi-lib.

The fact that no one really calls themselves “alt-right” anymore reflects not only this organizational failure but, ironically, also its ideological success. While individuals like Spencer are now non-factors, others (like Acting Assistant Secretary of State Darren Beattie) are now quite literally in the halls of power. The alt-right label doesn't make sense anymore because there is no longer any need to describe these views as an “alternative” to the mainstream right. Many are now the Republican Party's stated positions.

This alt-right triumph reflects deliberate efforts by key actors — like Tucker Carlson — to seed these ideas in the mainstream right. It also reflects Trump's repeated efforts to drive more moderate voices out of the party, to sideline the “adults in the room” who reined in him and Miller during the first term. And it also reflects the hubristic sense of total cultural victory on the right after the 2024 election: a belief that there had been a “vibe shift” in which normal Americans had suddenly become receptive to a whole range of extreme right political views, most notably on immigration.

For all these reasons, we are living in a world where ideas that were toxically controversial less than a decade ago are now officially proclaimed from the highest offices in the country.

The Court already killed most US campaign finance law. NRSC v. FEC is likely to give big donors even more influence.

There is a specter of inevitability hanging over much of the Supreme Court's current term. It is unlikely that any legal argument could persuade the Court's Republican majority to uphold bans on anti-LGBTQ+ conversion therapy, for example, or to preserve the Voting Rights Act. These are issues where Republican judges have wildly divergent views from Democratic jurists. And, on a 6-3 Republican Court, that means that the GOP's view wins.

That specter looms particularly large over National Republican Senatorial Committee (“NRSC”) v. FEC, which the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday, December 9. In that case, the GOP asks the justices to repeal a complicated campaign finance scheme limiting the amount of money big donors can funnel to candidates. And, given this Court's history in campaign finance cases, it is all but certain that Republicans will win this case.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Few issues split the two parties more cleanly than campaign finance regulation. Broadly speaking, the Democratic justices believe that too much money in politics is inherently corrupting, because, as Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a 2014 dissent, “a few large donations” can “drown out the voices of the many.”

Under this view, big campaign donations breed a government that is responsive only to a small group of very wealthy donors. In Breyer's words, “where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard.”

The Republican justices, meanwhile, tolerate campaign finance laws in only the narrowest of circumstances. As five Republicans concluded in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), money and politics may only be regulated to prevent “‘quid pro quo' corruption,” such as when a donor explicitly promises to donate to a senator's campaign in return for that senator's vote on a particular bill.

Under the Republican view, laws that merely seek to limit the influence of the very wealthy, such as by preventing them from buying access to lawmakers, are constitutionally forbidden.

The specific law at issue in NRSC limits how much party organizations, such as the Democratic or Republican National Committees, may spend in coordination with individual candidates for federal office. The idea is to prevent donors from evading the cap on donations to candidates, which is currently $3,500 per federal election, by laundering a much larger donation through a party committee like the DNC or the RNC.

In theory, this law might even comply with the rigid limits on campaign finance law that Republican justices imposed in Citizens United. As the Democratic Party argues in a brief defending the law, “an unbroken line of precedent” stretching back to the 1970s “holds that Congress may impose reasonable contribution limits” on donations directly to candidates. And the law at issue in NRSC merely seeks to ensure that these limits aren't easily evaded.

But, the Republican justices rejected a similar anti-money laundering argument in McCutcheon v. FEC, the 2014 case where Breyer dissented. So, it is unlikely that the spending limits at issue in NRSC will survive contact with this Supreme Court.

With the exception of Justice Clarence Thomas, even the Republican justices accept that Congress may cap the amount of money donors may give directly to political candidates. The risk of a quid pro quo deal, where a candidate agrees to sell political favors for campaign donations, is particularly high when that donation goes to the candidate's campaign.

The idea behind a $3,500 cap on donations directly to federal candidates is that this amount is too low to coax a lawmaker or presidential candidate into such a deal — and thus, the cap prevents quid pro quo corruption. According to the Brookings Institution, it cost over $2 million to win a US House race in 2018 and nearly $15 million to win a Senate race.

But a cap on donations directly to candidates means little if it can be easily circumvented. The law at issue in NRSC seeks to prevent donors from bypassing this limit by giving large donations to party committees, which the party can then pass on to individual candidates.

The details of how this scheme works are a little complicated. First, the law caps how much donors can give to party committees like the DNC or RNC at $44,300 per year. That cap is not at issue in NRSC. 

Second, current law draws a distinction between so-called “independent” political spending and “coordinated” political spending. Political parties can spend as much money as they want to try to influence a particular election, but only if that spending is not coordinated with any of the candidates in that race. With a few exceptions, the amount of money a party can spend in coordination with a candidate — think of a television ad that tracks the message and political strategy of the campaign but that is paid for by the party and not the campaign itself — is capped by federal law.

The amount of this cap varies depending on how many voters may vote in a particular race. In the smallest US House races, parties may only spend up to $63,600 in coordination with a campaign. In a California US Senate race, they may spend nearly $4 million. The GOP wants the Supreme Court to abolish these caps in NRSC.

About a quarter century ago, in FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (2001), the Supreme Court rejected a very similar challenge to an earlier version of these limits on coordinated spending. The Court reasoned that if a party can “make unlimited expenditures coordinated with a candidate,” that would cause donors to “give to the party in order to finance coordinated spending for a favored candidate beyond the contribution limits binding on them.” A donor might give $40,000 to the RNC, for example, knowing full well that this money will be spent on Sen. John Doe's reelection campaign.

But a lot has changed since Colorado was decided in 2001. Liberal and moderate Republicans have disappeared from the Supreme Court. And the Court's increasingly hardline Republican majority decided cases like Citizens United and McCutcheon, which cast a cloud of doubt over nearly all campaign finance laws.

So, it is unlikely that the anti-corruption scheme at issue in NRSC will be upheld by the current Court.

Although the Supreme Court has long held that Congress may regulate money in politics to prevent corruption or the “appearance of corruption,” the Republican justices define the word “corruption” very narrowly to include nothing other than quid pro quo arrangements. Under this approach, laws which prohibit donors from buying access to elected officials, or that simply seek to prevent donors from purchasing an official's gratitude, are not allowed unless they fairly narrowly target explicit deals banning dollars for political favors.

Indeed, under the GOP justices' vision, influence-buying is an affirmative good. As the Court's Republican majority said in Citizens United:

Favoritism and influence are not…avoidable in representative politics. It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on responsiveness.

Thus, under the Republican Party's version of the Constitution, the limits on coordinated spending at issue in NRSC cannot survive merely because they seek to limit the corrupting effect that large donations can have on government. The limits must target arrangements where donors seek to buy specific political favors from elected officials.

Given this framework, the best legal argument for the spending caps at issue in NRSC is that they prevent money laundering schemes where a donor who wants to give a large donation to a particular candidate may do so, so long as that money passes first through a party committee. If Congress can cap direct donations to candidates in order to prevent donors from buying political favors, then, surely, it should also be able to cap indirect donations that offer the same benefit to the same candidate.

But the five Republican justices who served on the Court in McCutcheon already rejected a similar anti-money laundering argument. That case struck down a federal law that capped the total amount of money a donor could give to all of a party's various political committees — the idea being that, if a donor could give huge sums to the party, then the party could easily redistribute that money to particular candidates.

McCutcheon deemed the idea that the Democratic or Republican Party's various subentities “would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another State's candidates” to be too farfetched. Iowa's Democratic Party, McCutcheon speculated, “has little reason to transfer money to the California Democratic Party.”

This conclusion is dubious. While Iowa Democrats may have little reason to give money to California Democrats, Democrats in the safe blue state of California certainly have good reason to redistribute their funds to swing states where that money may be most useful. California Democrats, after all, benefit if the Democratic Party is in the majority in Congress.

But, in any event, McCutcheon shows that the Republican justices are unlikely to defer to Congress when Congress believes that a particular law is necessary to prevent money laundering schemes. And, given this Court's hostility to nearly all campaign finance laws since Citizens United, it's hard to imagine the spending caps in NRSC surviving.

Indeed, the Roberts Court has made such Swiss cheese out of US campaign finance law that it is unclear whether a decision striking down these caps will really matter. One of the GOP's strongest arguments in favor of its preferred outcome in NRSC is that donors who want to give massive donations to elect a particular candidate can already give as much as they want to a super PAC that supports that candidate, rather than to a party committee. So, they don't really need to launder large donations through parties.

Super PACs, which grew out of the Court's decision in Citizens United, may accept unlimited donations and spend unlimited money. The one limit on Super PACs is that they aren't supposed to coordinate this spending with a candidate, but, as the GOP argues in its brief, this limit doesn't really amount to much in practice.

Donors frequently “let it be known who they are helping, and in what amounts.” And elected officials can reward the most generous donors with favors or even plum job assignments — just ask Elon Musk.Citizens United and similar cases, in other words, have already turned campaign finance into the Wild West. There really isn't much more the Supreme Court can do to increase the influence of wealthy donors in US politics.

For this administration, war crimes are a feature, not a bug.

• Donald Trump's broader aerial campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean (almost certainly) violates international law.• Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth have repeatedly called on the US military to commit more war crimes throughout their careers in public life.• Violating the laws of war undermines America's national security interests.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the US military to “kill everybody” aboard a speedboat in the Caribbean.

A missile then shattered the vessel and set its fragments ablaze. When the smoke cleared, US surveillance drones showed two people clinging to the smoldering wreckage. An admiral then ordered a second strike against these flailing survivors — an act that violated a wide array of international and domestic laws.

Or at least, this is what a recent report in the Washington Post alleges.

The Trump administration publicly insists that the Post's account is “fake news.” In closed-door briefings with lawmakers, Pentagon officials have reportedly claimed that the second strike was not intended to kill survivors, but rather, to sink the boat so as to clear a navigation hazard for other vessels. Yet, the administration has refused to provide either the public or members of Congress with unedited video footage of the bombings.

In a social media post Friday, Hegseth argued that the strikes were “lawful under both U.S. and international law.” Many in Congress are skeptical, with the bipartisan House and Senate Armed Services Committees both vowing to investigate the incident.

Such oversight is vital. It's important to determine whether America's Defense Secretary authorized the killing of wounded, shipwrecked persons. Both international and US laws forbid the killing of anyone who has already been rendered defenseless, even amid warfare.

And yet, there is also something a bit disingenuous about this debate.

By all appearances, the White House's true position is not that its actions are consistent with the laws of war but that it should not be bound by such laws. The president and defense secretary have not only conveyed this belief implicitly through their actions; they've also explicitly advocated for the commission of war crimes throughout their time in public life.The biggest scandal facing the US military therefore is not that it appears to have committed a lawless strike on defenseless victims, but that it is indisputably led by men who believe such criminality is morally permissible and strategically sound.

We do not yet know with certainty that the US military targeted survivors of a boat strike at the Defense Secretary's encouragement. But, we do know that the bombing in question was illegal, regardless.

Officially, Hegseth ordered that attack to combat drug trafficking. Since September, the administration has conducted more than 20 lethal strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing over 80 people. In each case, the White House claimed that the targeted vessels were transporting narcotics on behalf of drug cartels, although they've presented no evidence to support those allegations.

Of course, the US military has not traditionally claimed the authority to summarily execute criminal suspects. When the government believes that an individual is selling illegal substances, it typically arrests that person and puts them on trial.

The Trump administration insists, however, that South America's drug cartels should be considered terrorist organizations — and that each time these groups export narcotics across our border, they effectively commit an attack on US soil. Therefore, the US has the right to “secure our homeland from the drugs that are killing our people” by waging war against Venezuela's narcoterrorists (and/or small fishing boats that could theoretically be carrying contraband).

This reasoning is absurd on its face. Supplying cocaine to Miami dance clubs and flying planes into New York skyscrapers are categorically different offenses. To define the former as an act of war is to drain that term of all meaning. In practice, it also entails empowering the president to kill anyone he suspects of engaging in illegal commerce. No past administration has ever asserted this authority, and no domestic or international legal body has ever affirmed its legitimacy.

What's more, the president's position isn't just theoretically unsound but factually baseless. In justifying its campaign, the Trump administration has constantly invoked America's overdose epidemic. In September, Hegseth called his missile strikes a “defense of the American people,” since “100,000 Americans were killed each year under the previous administration.” President Donald Trump, meanwhile, claimed that each individual speedboat the military has incinerated would have killed “25,000 American people” (a claim that is, of course, mathematically ludicrous).

Yet, America's overdose crisis is driven by fentanyl, which comes from labs in Mexico, not South America. Venezuelan drug runners generally export cocaine, which, by itself, accounts for a tiny fraction of US overdoses (less than one in 10 overdoses are attributable to cocaine unpaired with opioids). And in any case, it's not clear that the targeted boats were even hauling blow. After one of the administration's strikes, the military captured two survivors — and then proceeded to let them go instead of making them stand trial for drug trafficking. This invites the suspicion that our government does not actually have strong evidence against the supposed criminals it is incinerating.

More broadly, the administration's focus on Venezuelan cocaine traffickers — instead of Mexican fentanyl labs — suggests that its fundamental concern is not with reducing US drug deaths. Trump and his allies have long sought to remove Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro from power. The president reportedly encouraged Maduro to leave office in a recent phone call. And his administration has dubiously declared the Venezuelan leader to be the head of a “narcoterrorist organization.”

It, therefore, looks like America is bombing civilian ships as a means of toppling a sovereign government that has committed no act of war against the United States. This is precisely the kind of behavior that international law was constructed to forbid.

There is no reason to believe that Trump and Hegseth are earnestly confused about the laws of war. Rather, they have each repeatedly expressed contempt for that very concept.

The defense secretary has been particularly clear on this point. Just last year, Hegseth published a book that explicitly argued for the U.S. military to commit more war crimes. Among the Pentagon chief's insights:• “Should we follow the Geneva Conventions? What if we treated the enemy the way they treated us? Would that not be an incentive for the other side to reconsider their barbarism?”

• “If our warriors are forced to follow rules arbitrarily and asked to sacrifice more lives so that international tribunals feel better about themselves, aren't we just better off winning our wars according to our own rules?!”

• “[I]f we're going to send our boys to fight—and it should be boys—we need to unleash them to win. They need them to be the most ruthless. The most uncompromising. The most overwhelmingly lethal as they can be. We must break the enemy's will. Our troops will make mistakes, and when they do, they should get the overwhelming benefit of the doubt.”

Hegseth has lived by these principles. As a Fox News host, he championed the cause of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused by fellow serviceman of randomly sniping a young girl and elderly man in Iraq, as well as stabbing a prisoner of war to death. Hegseth successfully lobbied Trump into awarding Gallagher a pardon.

For his part, the president has repeatedly called on the US military to perpetrate atrocities. As a candidate in 2015, Trump argued that America should target the wives and children of ISIS militants for extermination and mass murder Muslim prisoners of war (with bullets dipped in pig's blood). In a 2019 post on X addressed to Hegseth, meanwhile, Trump suggested that it was hypocritical for the US to hold American war criminals legally accountable since “we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!”

Many conservatives have recognized the administration's true position on the laws of war and forthrightly defended it. Joel Berry, a right-wing influencer, contended that the bombing of defenseless survivors only horrifies liberals because “they've forgotten the biblical purpose of government”: “to execute wrath on him who practices evil.”

Conservative Sirius XM host Megyn Kelly voiced similar sentiments, saying of the strike's victims: “I really do kind of not only wanna see them killed in the water, whether they're on the boat or in the water, but I'd really like to see them suffer. I would like Trump and Hegseth to make it last a long time so they lose a limb and bleed out.”

Personally, I have some moral qualms about the US government torturing people to death for nonviolent offenses that were never proven in court. But, even if you embrace the MAGA right's basic normative view on this question — that America should ruthlessly pursue its interests without concern for international law or human rights — you should still reject the administration's position.

Adhering to the laws of war is not an act of charity. The United States has an interest in upholding various constraints on geopolitical violence. The prohibition against killing enemies who've been rendered defenseless isn't just rooted in humanitarian considerations, but also strategic ones. If you want to minimize the number of Americans who must die to prevail in battle, then you need to persuade foreign combatants to surrender when they're clearly outgunned, rather than fighting to the last man. And such combatants are more likely to lay down their arms if they believe that the US military does not execute the defenseless. Bombing the helpless survivors of a missile strike undermines America's reputation on this front.

Likewise, Americans benefit from norms against attacks on civilian ships. Indeed, one of the core justifications for our nation's globe-spanning military presence is that it helps safeguard maritime trade. Maximizing the safety of global shipping reduces American consumers' costs (as it allows exporters to pay less for insurance and charge less for their wares) while ensuring our continuous access to vital goods and commodities. Perversely, the president has actually bragged about deterring legitimate commerce with his attacks in the Carribean, telling donors in October, “Nobody [in Venezuela] wants to go fishing anymore. No one wants to do anything near the water.”

Americans also have an interest in minimizing armed conflict. War doesn't just inflict death and suffering on nations directly involved but also imposes costs on the wider world. Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed up Americans' energy bills. The Syrian Civil War generated a refugee crisis that roiled the politics of many Western countries. A Chinese attack on Taiwan could devastate the global economy. And, of course, any war between nuclear weapons states would threaten to devastate the entire world.

International law seeks to deter war by placing restrictions on the legitimate use of military force. As the world's preeminent martial power, the US has a unique capacity to reinforce — or erode — norms against offensive wars. Even before Trump, America frequently chose to do the latter. But this administration's farcically expansive definition of self-defense has further undercut the conventions that have made the past eight decades unusually peaceful (by our species' belligerent standards).

Congress is right to investigate the US military's “double tap” strike on a Caribbean speedboat. But, no probe is necessary to determine that our government is led by war crimes enthusiasts.

Trump and Hegseth subscribe to a vicious and juvenile worldview — one that equates restraints on our military's brutality with impediments to our nation's interests. That idea is more toxic than Venezuelan cocaine. If they wish to put America first, conservatives of good conscience must loudly reject it.

When Ali Dastjerdi and Nathan Ondracek became freshman roommates at Harvard in 2015, they didn't expect they'd one day be cofounders together — or that they'd build a startup with a third friend they hadn't met yet.

Ondracek met Samuel Ilkka at AWS — his first job out of college — and the two bonded quickly and became roommates in Seattle. During the pandemic, Dastjerdi, who was working remotely as an investor at Insight Partners, moved in with them for a year. Working and living together cemented the three-way friendship.

In 2022, the trio quit their jobs to cofound Raylu, an AI startup that builds agents to help private-market investors automate sourcing work. On Monday, the company announced that it had raised $8 million in Series A funding, bringing its total funding to $12 million.

One of their earliest customers, HighlandX, led the round. The VC firm used the product, loved it, and eventually asked how they could invest, Dastjerdi said.

The Raylu team consists of 11 people, with plans to expand to 20 by January.

The three 28-year-olds told me that Raylu works because the friendship works. One of the ways they protect their friendship: a single, unopened beer in their office refrigerator.

""The day the company collapses is the day we drink that beer,"" Ondracek said.

It's a reminder that even if the company they built falls apart, their friendship is still worth toasting.

Ondracek and Dastjerdi met the way many college friendships begin. Harvard assigns freshman roommates after a 200-question survey, and the two ended up in the same room. ""From that point forward, we started becoming really close,"" Ondracek said. ""Ali was the best man at my wedding.""

They took the same classes — computer science and statistics — and stayed roommates for all four years. They spent late nights dreaming up business ideas, none of which stuck. But the urge to build something together did.

When Dastjerdi moved to Seattle with Ondracek and Ilkka, it was obvious to him that this was ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a company with two close friends that you think are truly brilliant.""

""Some people start companies because of ideas. I think we started a company because it's a one in a million shot to have this group to be able to start it with,"" Dastjerdi said.

The trio, now based in New York, works out of a WeWork office, and no longer lives together.

Mixing friendship and business usually comes with risks. But the three cofounders said the overlap didn't scare them.

Dastjerdi said he sought advice from a mentor who'd once started a company with his childhood best friend. The mentor asked him one question: ""If you and these two friends had just the biggest fight ever, what would happen the next day?

""I said probably nothing,"" Dastjerdi recalled. ""We would just get back to doing what we were doing."" The mentor said that was a good sign.

The trio said working together as best friends has upsides: They trust one another, reset fast after an argument, and know each other's strengths and weaknesses.

""It's like a little bit of a sibling relationship,"" Ondracek said, explaining that disgruntlement doesn't lead to lasting animosity.

When I asked the trio to describe one another, their dynamic snapped into focus. Ilkka said Dastjerdi brings ""urgency"" and an understanding of the investing world, and he called Ondracek the ""best engineer"" he knows. Dastjerdi described Ilkka as the team's optimist and risk taker.

The cofounders said their dynamic has changed after starting a business together.

Dastjerdi said one of the hardest adjustments for him was remembering how to be a ""regular friend"" outside work. Because ""99%"" of his thoughts revolve around the company, he's had to build what he calls a ""mental firewall"" to keep cofounder mode from bleeding into friend mode.

Trust has also become non-negotiable. For Ikka, he has had to learn not to look over their shoulders as much when they're working. ""I can either stress about everything, or I can trust these guys I'm working with to handle their weight,"" he said.

They've learned to celebrate wins more deliberately — especially because they're doing this not just as founders, but as friends.

""You have to celebrate the good things because no one's going to celebrate them for you,"" Ondracek said.

The founders say their journey has taught them a few valuable lessons worth sharing.

Ondracek said what matters most for a startup is its people.

""Nothing works if the people don't work,"" Ondracek said. ""You can have the most product market fit, and if the people don't work, you're doomed from the start,"" he added.

Dastjerdi said founders shouldn't fall in love with an idea too early.

""We went through many iterations where it felt like someone kind of liked what we did,"" he said. ""When we actually found product-market-fit, it is so tangibly different. It's like, people have to rip the product from you.""

Keep iterating, be picky, and pivot more — sometimes that could lead to a bigger win, he added.

Ilkka warned against rushing into the founder path just because other people are starting young. The right time is when you're ready, and when there's a real purpose driving the decision, he said.

And if you're building with your best friends? Make sure you still want to open a beer together when everything goes south.

San Francisco is going after food brands that produce ""ultra-processed foods,"" accusing the companies of fueling a public health crisis.

The 64-page lawsuit, filed on December 2 by San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, accused some of the country's biggest food brands of selling dangerous, ultra-processed foods to residents of San Francisco.

It named 11 brands as defendants: The Kraft Heinz Company, Mondelez International, Post Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company, Pepsico Inc., General Mills, Nestlé, Kellanova, WK Kellogg Co., Mars Inc., and Conagra Brands.

The city attorney said the brands had profited from selling ultra-processed foods, which make people crave what they otherwise would not. The attorney accused the brands of failing to include health warnings, making fraudulent claims about the products being healthy, and of targeted marketing at children.

Products from these brands include cereals, candies, soft drinks, and ready-to-eat meals.

""They designed food to be addictive, they knew the addictive food they were engineering was making their customers sick, and they hid the truth from the public,"" the attorney wrote, adding that taxpayers were left to foot the bill of a resulting public health crisis.

It said that ultra-processed foods majorly contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illnesses.

Chiu called for the brands to cease further deceptive marketing and pay civil penalties to the city of San Francisco.

Representatives for the 11 brands did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

The lawsuit comes as the US is clamping down on processed foods, a result of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s ""Make America Healthy Again"" movement.

In April, Kennedy said he would phase out eight petroleum-based food dyes in the US by 2027. And in July, President Donald Trump said that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its products in the US, instead of corn syrup that it now uses.

In this article

Microsoft pushed back on a report Wednesday that the company lowered growth targets for artificial intelligence software sales after many of its salespeople missed those goals in the last fiscal year.

The company's stock sank more than 2% on The Information report.

A Microsoft spokesperson said the company has not lowered sales quotas or targets for its salespeople.

The sales lag occurred for Microsoft's Foundry product, an Azure enterprise platform where companies can build and manage AI agents, according to The Information, which cited two salespeople in Azure's cloud unit.

AI agents can carry out a series of actions for a user or organization autonomously.

Less than a fifth of salespeople in one U.S. Azure unit met the Foundry sales growth target of 50%, according to The Information. 

In another unit, the quota was set to double Foundry sales, The Information reported. The quota was dropped to 50% after most salespeople didn't meet it.

In a statement, the company said the news outlet inaccurately combined the concepts of growth and quotas.

""Aggregate sales quotas for AI products have not been lowered, as we informed them prior to publication,"" a Microsoft Spokesperson said.

The AI boom has presented opportunities for businesses to add efficiencies and streamline tasks, with the companies that build these agents touting the power of the tools to take on work and allow workers to do more.

OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Salesforce, Amazon and others all have their own tools to create and manage these AI assistants.

But the adoption of these tools by traditional businesses hasn't seen the same surge as other parts of the AI ecosystem.

The Information noted AI adoption struggles at private equity firm Carlyle last year, in which the tools wouldn't reliably connect data from other places. The company later reduced how much it spent on the tools.

Waymo on Wednesday said humans will begin test driving the Alphabet-owned company's robotaxi vehicles in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. 

The three cities represent the latest additions to Waymo's quickly growing list of cities where the Google sister company is either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles. That list now stands at 26 markets. 

Waymo will begin manual drives in the trio of new cities this week with hopes to eventually begin serving fully-autonomous rides there, spokesperson Ethan Teicher told CNBC. 

Over the past month, Waymo has been aggressively making announcements for new markets and developments at the Google sister company. This comes as tech rivals Amazon and Tesla made advancements in the robotaxi market in 2025. Amazon's Zoox began offering free rides in Las Vegas and San Francisco, and Tesla this year launched ride-hailing service with human supervisors in the Austin and San Francisco markets.

In November, Waymo announced that it will soon begin manually driving in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The company also added Houston, San Antonio and Orlando to its list of cities where it'll launch service in 2026. Waymo also began offering rides on freeways in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets, and it named a new finance chief. 

With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company in May said it had provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020.

The new cities further signal that Waymo is increasingly confident its service can work well in locations with colder weather conditions.

Security technology startup Verkada has reached a $5.8 billion valuation after a new funding round led by CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, announced Wednesday.

""I think Google saw the opportunity with us in the application of AI and everything we're driving to apply AI to the physical security industry,"" CEO Filip Kaliszan told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa.

The company said in a release that the CapitalG-led investment will be used to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities and provide liquidity.

The financing totaled $100 million, a person familiar with the terms of the round told CNBC, raising the company's valuation by $1.3 billion from its Series E funding in February. The person asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the funding.

CapitalG also recently contributed to a $435 million fundraise for cybersecurity startup Armis in November.

The new funding comes as Verkada surpasses $1 billion in annualized bookings across 30,000 customers globally.

The company develops physical security products, including cameras, alarms and sensors, that are connected under a single cloud-based software platform. 

Kaliszan said his company serves a broad span of businesses, such as retailers, government properties, schools, and transportation.

For example, TeraWatt Infrastructure, which supplies charging sites to electric vehicles like Google's Waymo, uses Verkada technology to protect EV facilities.

In September, the company rolled out over 60 new AI features and platform updates, including tools like ""AI-Powered Unified Timeline."" 

The tool can automatically synthesize videos and images from several cameras into a single visual timeline, rather than requiring security teams to dig through multiple videos during an investigation.

""The genius of Filip and the team of Verkada is that they're leveraging AI as a Rosetta Stone to really help unlock insights from cameras to help companies become safer and more efficient,"" CapitalG general partner Derek Zanutto told Bosa.

By capturing over 20 million images per hour, Verkada can provide notable data like foot traffic, occupancy rates, security violations and other trends, Zanutto said.

He added that the physical security is a sleeping $60 billion market that is led by legacy hardware like ""cameras that just record, not cameras that think"" — a gap that Verkada is hoping to fill. 

However, AI-powered technology will not necessarily replace human security guards any time soon.

""I think humans will be providing security to other humans for as long as I can think,"" Kaliszan said. ""But AI can empower these first responders to be more aware, to have situational knowledge, to know what to do, and in some cases, actually prevent the problems from happening.""

He pointed to the Louvre heist in October, where multiple crown jewels were robbed from the museum, as an opportunity where AI-assisted devices that could actively monitor, then immediately alert security forces, would be more effective than only physical personnel.

""If you could intervene right then, if you could know in real time that that's happening, the potential for savings and preventing damage is tremendous,"" he said.

Sports merchandiser Fanatics announced Wednesday it's launching Fanatics Markets, its own prediction market, in 24 states this week, including California, Texas, Florida and Washington.

The platform will allow people to trade on events in sports, finance and culture, according to Fanatics, and will launch in segments across the country over the next several days. 

The first phase, launching Wednesday in 10 states includes contracts for sports, finance, economics and politics.  Early next year, Fanatics will expand into contracts for crypto, stocks, tech, music and more, it said. 

""For years, Fanatics has given fans new ways to enhance their fandom through team merchandise, collectibles, tickets, gaming, events and more,"" Fanatics Betting and Gaming CEO Matt King said in a statement. ""Now, with Fanatics Markets, we're giving fans a safe, and intuitive way to engage with the moments that move sports and culture, and to pick a side and profit along the way if their prediction is correct.""

Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have exploded in popularity on the back of legalized online sports betting. That's led sportsbooks and others in the industry to set up their own event contract platforms. 

""This is really the top of the first inning on a market that's going to grow exponentially over the next five to 10 years, so we're not worried about being a couple months behind [competitors],"" King said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Wednesday.

DraftKings announced its entry into the prediction markets in October through an acquisition of Railbird. Flutter-owned FanDuel announced in November it would be unveiling a prediction markets platform in partnership with CME Group to launch this month. 

Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin told CNBC last month that the company would be entering the prediction markets environment. 

The prediction market's pricing will be offered by Crypto.com, Fanatics said, and customers can use a shared wallet to access the entire Fanatics ecosystem. They'll also be able to set deposit limits and session limits.

Fanatics Markets launches Wednesday in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Utah.

It will launch on Thursday in Alabama, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Wisconsin. 

On Friday, it will go live in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Washington.

""For us, this was just a logical extension in terms of something new that sports fans want to have access to,"" King said.

NEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court.

Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties.

""We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,"" he said during an onstage interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit.

Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, ""permanently.""

Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on a time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court.

President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures.

Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations.

""Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made"" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made ""a robust effort"" at halting the drug's import into the U.S.

He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case.

On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the front-runner.

""The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,"" he said. ""The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day ... he or she is one vote.""

Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Macy's beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations for the third quarter this morning, posting its strongest growth in more than three years. The department store operator's results are only one of several recent data points investors have received on the state of the U.S. consumer.

Here's what to know:

President Donald Trump has said his tariffs will bring production jobs back to the U.S. But as CNBC's Jeff Cox reports, corporate executives and economic forecasters are concerned the opposite could happen. 

Respondents to an Institute for Supply Management survey said the duties are pushing them to start reducing headcount and offering severance packages. ""Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,"" one respondent said. A Federal Reserve report from last week also showed employment ""declined slightly"" over the past several weeks.

We'll be keeping a close eye on the ADP private payrolls report due out this morning. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting growth of 40,000 jobs in November.

OpenAI is feeling the heat as rivals Alphabet and Anthropic gain ground in the artificial intelligence race. Earlier this week, CEO Sam Altman reportedly sent a staff memo laying out a ""code red"" effort to improve its ChatGPT bot.

It comes amid growing fanfare for Alphabet's Gemini 3 model, which beat industry benchmarks. Anthropic, meanwhile, is reportedly readying for one of the largest IPOs ever.

As CNBC's Pia Singh reports, Wall Street now sees Alphabet's Google as the AI leader. Shares of Alphabet and its chip partner Broadcom have surged in recent weeks, while Nvidia and Microsoft — both business partners of OpenAI — pulled back. 

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Broadcast station owners are running toward industry consolidation, but they're hitting roadblocks.

Nexstar is attempting to buy Tegna, while Sinclair made a hostile bid last week to acquire E.W. Scripps. These companies, like their larger media counterparts, have been trying to find ways to bolster their businesses as profitability tied to the traditional cable bundle shrinks.

But as CNBC's Lillian Rizzo and Alex Sherman report, Sinclair's attempt to scale up has been marred by family ownership challenges. Meanwhile, the Nexstar-Tegna deal requires changes to decades-old regulatory rules.

Boeing investors needed their seatbelts for yesterday's ride. 

Shares soared more than 10% — their best day since April — after CFO Jay Malave said the plane maker expects higher deliveries of its 737 and 787 jets in 2026. He also said the delayed certification for the 737-10 model could come later next year.

Malave notably said the higher deliveries will be ""a big driver"" for cash flow. As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan notes, the Virginia-based company hasn't posted an annual profit since 2018.

Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell Overtime"" yesterday to discuss his and his wife's $6.25 billion commitment to fund ""Trump accounts"" for kids. Watch the interview here.

Correction: Nexstar is attempting to buy Tegna. An earlier version of this story misspelled the latter company's name.

— CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge, Natalie Rice, Jeff Cox, Ashley Capoot, Dylan Butts, Pia Singh, Alex Sherman, Lillian Rizzo, Laya Neelakandan and Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

French satellite group Eutelsat, often seen as Europe's answer to Elon Musk's Starlink, saw its share price plummet Wednesday following a report that Japanese investor SoftBank had sold subscription rights in the company.

Shares in Eutelsat were down by more than 7% earlier in the day, before closing the session 5.7% lower.

The moves come following a Reuters report that SoftBank has sold 36 million rights, which would correspond to around 26 million shares and around half its stake in the satellite operator.

Eutelsat is the owner of the satellite internet provider OneWeb, which it merged with in 2023 in a bid to challenge Starlink's dominance in the market.

But the French group has struggled to tap into the U.S. company's market share. Eutelsat currently has more than 600 satellites in orbit compared to Starlink's over 6,750, according to the companies' websites.

After soaring more than 600% in early March this year, as Europe scrambled to bolster its tech sovereignty in the wake of the U.S. cutting military support to Ukraine, Eutelsat shares have since dropped more than 70%.

The company is seen as crucial to Europe's tech sovereignty ambitions. In June, the French state led a 1.35 billion euro ($1.57 billion) investment in Eutelsat, becoming its biggest shareholder with a roughly 30% stake.

In November, SoftBank said it had sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia as it looked to free up funds for its investment in OpenAI and other projects.

SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, founder Masayoshi Son said on Monday at an event.

The Japanese giant's Eutelsat move mirrors its ""aggressive monetisation"" across its portfolio, Luke Kehoe, analyst at Ookla, told CNBC.

""With governments and strategic European investors, not SoftBank, now funding the recapitalisation, Eutelsat is becoming less a growth story and more a pillar of Europe's digital sovereignty infrastructure.""

While Starlink is holding on to its scale advantage and is dominant in retail broadband, Eutelsat is carving out a niche in government, aviation, backhaul and emergency connectivity, said Kehoe.

""The open question is whether that higher-value, B2B-centric positioning can deliver attractive returns once the current wave of capex and recapitalisations is behind it, and whether Europe is willing to keep writing cheques at the scale required to narrow the gap with Starlink.""

Eutelsat has yet to respond to a request for comment. SoftBank declined to comment.

Correction: This article and its headline have been updated to clarify that Softbank reportedly sold subscription rights in Eutelsat.

new video loaded: BlackRock C.E.O. Calls Bitcoin an ‘Asset of Fear'

transcript

“Bitcoin is an asset of fear. And when you're less fearful, like we had a trade agreement with China, you saw a shift downward. There are conversations this week that there may be some type of settlement in Ukraine. Bitcoin fell a little bit. So you own Bitcoin because you're frightened of your physical security. You own it because you're frightened of your financial security. The long-term fundamental reason you own it because the debasement of financial assets, because of deficits. And so to me, even the movement in the last week — and we've had about a 20, 25 percent drawdown, and this is the third time since IBIT was created, our E.T.F. And so this is — you see these shifts and they're actually pretty non-correlated shifts. And that's — and so the role —” “But then some people say is that really insurance? Right, if you had bought it at $125,000 and it's now sitting at 90 some-odd thousand dollars, you're saying —” “If you bought it for a trade, it's a very volatile asset, you're going to have to be really good at market timing, which most people aren't. If you're buying it as a hedge against all your hope, then it has a meaningful impact on a portfolio. The bigger, the other big problem of Bitcoin is, it is still heavily influenced by leveraged players.”

Options linked to cryptocurrencies are booming across U.S. markets, so much so that contracts tied to BlackRock's bitcoin ETF (IBIT) have cracked the top 10 U.S. list in just over a year after debut.

As of Tuesday, a total of 7,714,246 IBIT contracts were active or open, the ninth largest tally among options tied to U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs and indices, according to data source optioncharts.io. Among stocks alone, IBIT options rank second in open interest.

BloFin Research said that the growing popularity of options tied to IBIT indicates BTC's appeal as a macro asset. 

""IBIT options open interest has reached ninth place in the US market. If Deribit's open interest is included, it rivals VIX and SPY options, further solidifying its position as one of the most popular macro assets,"" the research firm told CoinDesk. 

IBIT options debuted in November 2024, enabling effective risk management for ETF holders and providing institutions regulated options access. Since then, traders have used these options for hedging, speculation and yield-generating strategies such as covered calls. 

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call provides the right to buy while a put option offers the right to sell. 

IBIT options have been busier than the SPDR gold ETF contracts, even though the yellow metal has surged 50% this year, outshining BTC's -0.1% drop. 

On Tuesday U.S. time, open interest in options tied to the SPDR Gold Shares ETF stood at 5,151,654 contracts, well behind IBIT. 

Options tied to technology heavyweights such as Intel, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla, and ETFs tied to emerging markets and 20-year Treasury notes also lagged IBIT. 

If that's not enough, open interest (OI) in the Nasdaq-listed IBIT options topped bitcoin options OI on Deribit, the crypto options pioneer, at the end of September. 

Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nvidia options were industry leaders on Tuesday with open interest of over 20 million contracts each.

Ethereum's largest holders have re-emerged as crypto prices mount a recovery following more than $600 million in long liquidations on Monday.

On-chain data show that one large holder purchased 18,345 ETH, worth roughly $55 million, from BitGo on Tuesday, according to analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.

Another purchased 4,597 ETH worth roughly $13 million from Binance early on Wednesday, while yet another large holder purchased 30,278 ETH worth $91.16 million from Kraken, roughly three hours ago.

Those moves have coincided with a rebound from early December losses, which have lifted Bitcoin, Solana, and other digital assets higher.

Ethereum is up more than 8% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,015, according to CoinGecko data. Bitcoin is 7% and Solana has jumped more than 10%.

Adding to hopes of continued higher prices, taker buy volume—representing the volume of buy orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps—spiked to $148.7 million across all exchanges on Tuesday. 

The demand hints at a “strong signal of aggressive market buying,” according to a Tuesday tweet from Maarten Regterschot, a verified analyst at CryptoQuant. 

Futures cumulative volume delta, meanwhile, has ticked up relative to spot cumulative volume delta, Velo data shows. 

When perpetual CVD and open interest—representing total open orders—trend higher, it typically shows investors are opening new long positions.

“If we see more DATs trade below mNAV, there will be some acquisitions with institutional investors swooping in for discounted Ethereum,” Stephen Gregory, founder of crypto trading platform Vtrader, told Decrypt. 

“I think the correction has run its course, and the macro tailwinds will push Ethereum back up,” he added.

Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Overview

The Fusaka Upgrade is Ethereum's next major network upgrade scheduled to take place on December 3, 2025. The upgrade aims to improve network scalability and reduce costs for Layer 2 networks.

Key Points:



Fusaka launches on December 3, 2025 at slot 13,164,544, marking Ethereum's second major hard fork of 2025 after Pectra.

PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) allows validators to verify blockchain data by sampling small random portions instead of downloading everything — reducing bandwidth requirements by up to 85%.

Layer 2 transaction costs are expected to drop 40-60% as rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base benefit from increased data availability space.

Block gas limit increases to 60 million (from approximately 36 million), allowing more transactions to be processed directly on Ethereum's main network.

The Fusaka upgrade is a comprehensive network update (or ""hard fork""— a change that isn't backward compatible) scheduled to activate on Ethereum's mainnet on December 3, 2025. This would mark Ethereum's latest upgrade since the Pectra Upgrade which took place in May 2025.

Fusaka's Name

Following Ethereum's naming convention, ""Fusaka"" combines two upgrade names: ""Fulu"" (for the consensus layer, named after a star) and ""Osaka"" (for the execution layer, named after the Japanese city that will host Devcon 2025, an Ethereum convention event). 

To understand Fusaka's importance, it helps to see where it sits in Ethereum's evolution:

The Merge (2022): Transitioned Ethereum from energy-intensive proof-of-work to efficient proof-of-stake

Shanghai/Shapella (2023): Enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH

Dencun (March 2024): Introduced ""blobs"" (temporary data storage packets) that reduced Layer 2 fees by 90-95%.

Pectra (May 2025): Increased blob capacity and improved validator flexibility.

Fusaka (December 2025): Dramatically scales data availability through PeerDAS and prepares Ethereum for 100,000+ TPS.

Each upgrade builds on the previous one. Dencun introduced the concept of blobs — think of them as temporary storage containers where Layer 2 networks can post transaction data cheaply. Fusaka takes this concept much further by introducing a smarter way for the network to verify this data exists without every validator needing to download everything.

Fusaka includes approximately 12-13 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs — formal proposals for changes to Ethereum). While that sounds technical, the key improvements fall into a few understandable categories.

PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling, defined in EIP-7594) is Fusaka's headline feature and represents a fundamental shift in how Ethereum handles data.

The Problem It Solves: Currently, when Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Optimism post their transaction data to Ethereum (in those blob containers we mentioned), every validator needs to download the complete data to verify it's available. This creates a bottleneck — if blobs get too big or too numerous, validators need expensive hardware with high bandwidth to keep up.

The Solution: Create a system where network validators are not required to download entire blobs of data, but instead just need small samples of these blobs for verification. 

Imagine a library where instead of reading an entire book to confirm it's complete and undamaged, you could randomly check a few pages. If enough people check different random pages and they all look good, you can be confident the whole book is intact. That's essentially what PeerDAS does.

With PeerDAS, validators only need to download approximately 12.5% of the blob data — they sample random portions and share that information with peers. Through mathematical techniques called ""erasure coding"" (which adds redundancy to data, like a sophisticated backup system), the network can reconstruct the full data from just 50% of the pieces. This means:

Validators need 85% less bandwidth compared to downloading everything.

Storage requirements drop significantly for individual nodes.

The network can safely support many more blobs without overwhelming validators.

Home stakers can continue participating without needing enterprise-grade internet connections.

Think of it this way: instead of everyone at a concert recording the entire show, a few people record different parts, and if you need the full concert later, you can piece it together from everyone's recordings.

Gas is Ethereum's measure of computational work — every transaction and smart contract operation consumes a certain amount of gas. The gas limit determines how much computation can fit in a single block.

EIP-7935 increases Ethereum's default block gas limit from approximately 36 million to 60 million gas units. This 67% increase means:

More transactions can be processed on Ethereum's main network (Layer 1).

Complex smart contracts have more room to execute without running into limits.

Network throughput improves even before considering Layer 2 benefits.

However, bigger blocks mean validators must process more data. To make sure the network is not overwhelmed, Fusaka also introduces several safety measures such as a block size cap (EIP-7934) and a transaction gas cap (EIP-7825). 

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computer that executes all smart contracts throughout Ethereum and its Layer 2s. Fusaka includes several enhancements:

EVM Object Format (EOF): Think of this as a cleaner, more efficient programming structure for smart contracts. It separates code from data more clearly, making contracts easier to validate and optimize. For developers, this means faster execution and fewer errors.

New Opcodes (EIP-7742): Opcodes are basic instructions the EVM can execute (like ADD, SUBTRACT, or STORE). Fusaka adds a CLZ (count leading zeros) opcode that makes certain cryptographic operations more efficient. While this sounds niche, it helps with tasks like verifying digital signatures and processing cryptographic proofs.

secp256r1 Support (EIP-7212): This adds support for a different type of digital signature that's commonly used in mobile devices and hardware security modules. Practically, this means you could eventually use your iPhone's Face ID or fingerprint sensor to interact with Ethereum apps instead of managing a seed phrase — making crypto more accessible and secure for everyday users.

The most significant impact of Fusaka is what it enables for Layer 2 rollups — separate blockchains like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and zkSync that bundle thousands of transactions together and post summaries to Ethereum for security.

Current State: After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Layer 2 fees dropped from $0.50-$3.00 to around $0.01-$0.10 per transaction — a massive improvement. However, these L2s are already filling up the available blob space during peak usage.

After Fusaka, Layer 2 networks will have:

3.5x more space to post transaction data.

40-60% lower costs as blob fees decrease due to increased supply.

Capacity to handle 100,000+ transactions per second across the entire L2 ecosystem (compared to roughly 12,000 TPS estimates pre-Fusaka).

To put this in perspective, Visa processes about 65,000 TPS on average. Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem post-Fusaka could theoretically exceed this, while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum's base layer.

Fusaka also has several implications on transaction fees during periods of network congestion. EIP-7918 introduces a blob fee reserve system that changes how blob pricing works. 

Instead of blob fees fluctuating wildly based on immediate demand (like gas prices do), excess blob fees get stored in a ""reserve."" When demand spikes and blob fees rise rapidly, the reserve automatically releases fees back into circulation to smooth out price volatility. When demand is low, fees accumulate in the reserve.

What This Means:

More predictable costs for Layer 2 networks.

Better user experience as L2 fees become more stable.

For people running Ethereum validators (the computers that secure the Ethereum network by validating transactions), Fusaka brings welcome relief:

Bandwidth Reduction: PeerDAS cuts the amount of data validators need to download by approximately 85%. If a validator previously needed to download 750 MB of blob data per day, they'd now only need around 112 MB.

Storage Optimization: While validators still need to store blob data temporarily (blobs are kept for about 18 days), the ability to sample data means they don't need to store everything permanently.

Decentralization Benefits: Lower requirements mean more people can run validators from home without needing enterprise-grade internet connections. This strengthens decentralization — one of Ethereum's core values.

Even if you just hold ETH and occasionally make transactions, Fusaka impacts you:

Cheaper L2 Transactions: If you use Layer 2 networks for trading, NFTs, or DeFi, your transaction costs will decrease by an estimated 40-60%. That $0.05 transaction might drop to $0.02-$0.03.

Improved Network Performance: With higher throughput and more efficient data handling, the entire Ethereum ecosystem becomes smoother and more reliable.

If you participate in decentralized finance — lending, borrowing, trading on DEXs, or providing liquidity:

Faster, Cheaper Interactions: Complex DeFi operations on Layer 2 networks will become more affordable. Yield farming strategies that were uneconomical at $0.10 per transaction might make sense at $0.02.

More Sophisticated Decentralized Applications: The increased gas limit and EOF improvements enable more complex smart contracts, potentially leading to innovative DeFi products that weren't previously possible.

For those building on Ethereum:

Improved EVM: The EOF enhancements make smart contracts easier to write, test, and optimize. Code separation improves security and reduces bugs.

New Tools: The CLZ opcode and secp256r1 support open up new possibilities, particularly for cryptographic applications and mobile-friendly wallet experiences.

Scalability Infrastructure: With blob capacity expanding, developers can build applications that would have been throttled by data availability constraints under the old system.

For teams running rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or zkSync:

Increased Capacity: The ability to post more data to Ethereum means these networks can process more transactions without hitting bottlenecks.

Lower Operating Costs: As blob fees stabilize and capacity increases, the cost of settling to Layer 1 decreases, savings that can be passed to users.

Competitive Advantage: L2s that efficiently utilize the new blob space can offer the fastest and cheapest transactions, attracting more users and developers.

For those securing the network:

Lower Barriers to Entry: Reduced bandwidth requirements mean the cost to set up a network validator decreases, potentially increasing the number of validators and node operators throughout the network.

Simplified Operations: The improvements to network protocols and deterministic block proposer selection (knowing in advance when you'll propose blocks) make validator operations more predictable.

Institutional adoption of Ethereum has been growing, and Fusaka could accelerate this trend:

Infrastructure Maturity: Major upgrades that execute successfully without network disruptions demonstrate Ethereum's technical maturity — a key consideration for institutions managing billions in assets.

Competitive Positioning: By significantly improving scalability while maintaining security and decentralization, Fusaka helps Ethereum defend against competitors like Solana that have traditionally emphasized speed over decentralization.

Beyond short-term price movements, Fusaka represents a strategic milestone:

The Scalability Race: Competing blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and newer L1s constantly improve their technology. Fusaka demonstrates Ethereum's ability to scale significantly while preserving decentralization.

Layer 2 Ecosystem Growth: With over 50% of DeFi value locked on Ethereum-related chains, scaling Layer 2s effectively expands Ethereum's addressable market without fragmenting liquidity.

Developer Retention: By consistently upgrading the EVM and providing better tools, Ethereum maintains its position as the preferred platform for serious developers, which drives long-term value.

After Fusaka, Ethereum's next major upgrade is tentatively called ""Glamsterdam"" (combining ""Glamour"" and ""Amsterdam,"" the city hosting a future Devcon), expected in 2026.

While specifics remain under discussion, the Ethereum roadmap continues with:

The Surge (ongoing): Further scalability improvements beyond Fusaka, potentially including full Danksharding (the complete vision of which PeerDAS is just the first step).

The Verge: Introducing Verkle Trees (partially included in Fusaka) to make nodes even lighter and enable ""stateless clients"" that can verify the chain without storing complete state.

The Purge: Simplifying the protocol by removing historical data and technical debt, making Ethereum easier to run and maintain.

The Splurge: Various improvements including account abstraction enhancements, MEV (miner extractable value) solutions, and cryptographic upgrades.

Ethereum's ultimate goal remains unchanged: become a global settlement layer that's:

Scalable: Handle millions of transactions per second through Layer 2s

Secure: Maintain robust security through thousands of independent validators

Decentralized: Enable anyone to run a node or validator without prohibitive costs

Fusaka represents a major step toward this vision by proving that scalability and decentralization aren't mutually exclusive—you can have both through clever engineering like PeerDAS.

The Fusaka upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's continued development. By introducing PeerDAS, increasing the gas limit, and implementing numerous smaller improvements, Fusaka transforms Ethereum from a blockchain that can support some Layer 2 activity into one that can sustain a massive ecosystem of scaling solutions processing hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

For everyday users, this means cheaper transactions and more responsive applications. For developers, it means better tools and the infrastructure to build more ambitious products. For validators, it means lower barriers to participation and a more sustainable network to secure. And for Ethereum as a whole, it means defending its position as the leading smart contract platform while staying true to its decentralization principles.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined what he sees as the network's next phase of scaling, offering a more nuanced roadmap for growth as on-chain activity accelerates and institutional capital re-engages with ETH.

Buterin's comments come as Ethereum is attempting to regain technical footing after a difficult month, supported by a broader macro rebound and strengthened tokenized-asset flows.

In a new X post, the Ethereum co-founder said the ecosystem should expect “continued growth but more targeted / less uniform growth” over the next year. Vitalik floated one possible path forward: a 5× increase in the gas limit paired with a 5× rise in gas costs for operations that create inefficiency at the execution layer.

Among the areas Buterin listed as candidates for higher costs were SSTORE operations (particularly when new storage is created), certain complex arithmetic opcodes, calls to contracts with large code size, precompiles (excluding elliptic-curve functions), and slight increases to calldata costs.

Buterin's remarks follow the community's push for higher gas limits, with Ethereum now running at a 60-million-block gas limit, double what it was just a year ago.

According to recent market analysis, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum, including stablecoins, has repeatedly set the floor for ETH's market cap.

Analysts argue the real test will be whether this tokenized base can continue to anchor Ethereum's downside as the ecosystem expands.

Meanwhile, market performance this week offers a hint of renewed confidence. ETH rose 7.46% in the last 24 hours, reversing part of a steep 30-day decline.

Gains tracked a wider market rebound, supported by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and increased dollar liquidity. Whales also accumulated approximately $22 million in ETH during recent dips, easing sell pressure and helping the asset reclaim key moving averages.

Traders now watch two critical levels: $3,000 for near-term stability, and the broader $3,800–$4,200 zone, where a decisive break could revive the long-discussed path toward $5,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Ethereum Whales Accumulate Into Post-Liquidation Rebound","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-whales-snap-up-ethereum/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:31:10 GMT","

Quick Facts:

Ethereum's ($ETH) latest drawdown flushed out excessive leverage, with cascading liquidations forcing weak hands to sell into thinning bids.

As the dust settles, on-chain data now shows large wallets quietly stepping back in, accumulating spot $ETH rather than chasing high-octane derivatives. That includes one whale who bought around $13M worth of $ETH in the past 24 hours.



That shift matters. When whales rotate into spot after a washout, they signal conviction in the underlying asset's medium-term trajectory, not just a quick bounce.

For you, it's a chance to take advantage: blue chips stabilize, then capital starts hunting for higher beta plays that can outperform if the rebound broadens.

At the same time, Ethereum's own fundamentals are strengthening, with the Fusaka upgrade and PeerDAS set to expand blockspace and support more rollup activity.

That backdrop is fueling a renewed hunt for infrastructure and narrative-driven altcoins: Bitcoin-layer scaling, mine-to-earn meme coins, and yield-bearing ecosystems.

Against this context, three projects stand out as candidates for the next leg higher: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as an aggressive Bitcoin Layer-2 bet, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a gamified mine-to-earn meme coin, and Ethereum ($ETH) itself as the liquidity anchor for the entire move. Here's how they line up.

If whales are expressing fresh confidence in Ethereum's programmability, the obvious asymmetric trade is the chain that finally gives Bitcoin similar capabilities.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to launch a super-fast Bitcoin Layer-2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, targeting execution speeds that can rival Solana's performance.

When it launches, the platform will feature a modular design: the Bitcoin Layer-1 handles settlement and security, while a real-time SVM-powered Layer-2 executes transactions and smart contracts.



This architecture enables high-throughput execution and sub-second finality while anchoring state periodically to Bitcoin for trust minimization. That also means you can move wrapped $BTC with low fees, swap, and stake.

The market is clearly noticing. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $28.8M, with tokens priced at $0.013365, making it one of the best altcoins to buy at the moment. To get yours, our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the information you need.

Whales are also grabbing their share of $HYPER, with one recently purchasing over $500K worth of tokens. That kind of early whale interest often precedes deeper liquidity once listings arrive.

Buying early has its advantages, considering the token's potential to hit a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction. That's a 1,396.45% increase from its current price.

🚀 Don't be left behind. Join the $HYPER presale today.

While infrastructure coins soak up serious capital, post-liquidation rebounds often see outsized returns in meme coins with a fresh twist.

PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) fits that bill as the world's first mine-to-earn meme coin, blending old-school mining vibes with on-chain gamification instead of ASIC warehouses.

At its core, PEPENODE introduces a virtual mining system where you acquire node tiers rather than physical hardware.



Higher-tier nodes receive a larger slice of token emissions and in-protocol rewards, creating a familiar ‘hash rate arms race' dynamic but in a fully digital, capital-efficient format. A gamified dashboard tracks your node performance, rewards, and progression.

That narrative is already resonating. The PEPENODE presale has raised more than $2.2M, with tokens currently priced at $0.0011778, giving it a meme-cap starting point with clear upside if the mine-to-earn concept catches on.

Staking is set at a whopping 576%, which is sure to encourage investors to lock their token in the staking pool and support the network.

The token's medium-term prospects are fairly bright too. Our PEPENODE price prediction believes it has the potential to reach $0.0072 by end-2026. Based on its current price, that translates to a 511.309% increase.

In a market where attention is everything, PEPENODE offers something beyond another cartoon frog: an interactive mining game loop that can keep users engaged well past the initial hype.

If Ethereum's rebound spills over to the best meme coins, mine-to-earn memes like PEPENODE could be among the biggest percentage movers.

🚀 Buy your $PEPENODE tokens today.

None of this altcoin rotation happens without a credible base layer leading the charge, and Ethereum ($ETH) still owns that role.

It remains the dominant decentralized smart contract platform, powering billions in DeFi TVL, NFT markets, and a rapidly expanding Layer-2 ecosystem that settles back to Ethereum for security and finality.

The next catalyst is already scheduled. Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade is set to go live today, introducing PeerDAS and higher gas limits to meaningfully increase data availability and throughput.

By making it cheaper and more efficient for rollups to post data on-chain, Fusaka lays the groundwork for another wave of Layer-2 innovation and activity.

For you as a trader, that means two things. First, Ethereum itself remains the liquidity sink where whales park capital between risk cycles, a trend currently visible as large wallets quietly reload $ETH on spot markets post-liquidation.

Second, improved scalability attracts more apps and users, which in turn supports the valuations of the altcoins and Layer-2s built on top.

To stay aligned with whale flows and protocol upgrades, consider keeping Ethereum as your portfolio anchor and entry point into the broader smart contract economy, and follow high-potential upside projects like Bitcoin Hyper and PEPENODE.

🚀 Buy Ethereum at today's price of ~$3.058K on Binance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain Finance: How is Lloyds Inspiring Banks to Adapt?","https://fintechmagazine.com/news/blockchain-finance-how-is-lloyds-inspiring-banks-to-adapt","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:37:57 GMT","

Lloyds has completed its first digital Letter of Credit transaction between India and the UK using WaveBL's blockchain platform.

The transaction marks a shift in trade finance processing from paper-based documentation to near-instantaneous digital execution.

The Documentary Credit in favour of West Yorkshire laboratory equipment business Labtex was completed by Lloyds and a major Indian bank entirely through the WaveBL platform.

Traditional paper-based trade finance processes require days or even weeks of document handling.

The blockchain solution replaces this with instant digital exchanges between parties.

Ofer Ein Bar, VP Financial Institutions at WaveBL, says: “The same digital leap that changed how we send money is now transforming trade finance.

“The waiting and manual steps are giving way to instant, transparent, and connected digital flows – and this transaction is proof of that evolution.”

The digital transaction supports the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, which aims to double bilateral trade to US$120bn by 2030.

Digital transactions reduce friction in cross-border trade, supporting both countries in achieving their economic growth ambitions.

Surath Sengupta, Head of Transaction Banking Products at Lloyds, comments: “UK businesses are increasingly recognising how digital innovation can unlock growth opportunities.

“By enabling documents to be presented instantly, this technology removes delays and accelerates access to finance.

“In this case, the speed of digital presentation supported a financing opportunity that would have been impossible using traditional paper processes, given the short payment term.”

Banks' examination processes remain intact, but the ability to transmit and resubmit documents instantly has removed barriers to faster processing.

The transaction enabled real-time review and correction of trade documents while providing full visibility and traceability across the Letter of Credit process.

Reduced courier and handling costs accompanied seamless compliance with international trade standards.

Sherida Hepplestone, Admin Manager at Labtex Ltd, says: “The whole process from start to finish was quick, simple and certainly cheaper for all parties involved, representing a significant step forward in process optimisation.

""Presenting the documents this way reduced the transaction time and eliminated any courier fees, making the transaction more cost-effective and efficient.

“From electronic presentation to receipt of funds into our account was four days.”

The blockchain transaction aligns with Lloyds' broader digital transformation efforts.

In September 2025, the bank expanded its partnership with Broadcom to accelerate digital infrastructure improvements for its 28 million customers.

The multi-year agreement focused on adopting private cloud and mainframe solutions to deliver faster and more reliable financial services.

UBS recently partnered with Ant International to explore blockchain-based tokenised deposits for cross-border payments.

The Swiss bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding in November 2025 under which Ant International will integrate with UBS Digital Cash.

The blockchain payment platform supports real-time, multi-currency fund flows designed to improve efficiency, transparency and security.

Startale Group, the blockchain firm collaborating with tech conglomerate Sony on its web3 platform Soneium, has debuted a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.

Dubbed Startale USD (USDSC), the token is intended to serve as the default digital dollar for payments, rewards, and other functions across the Soneium ecosystem, according to a press release issued on Wednesday. Soneium is an Ethereum layer-2 network, launched last year by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint venture between Sony Group and Startale.

The move comes as Japan steps further into the digital money trend with stablecoins, a $300 billion group of cryptocurrencies tied to fiat money, becoming increasingly viewed as a payments alternative. Regulators have already greenlit pilot projects for Japanese yen-based stablecoins from major banks MUFG, SMBC and Mizuho. Meanwhile, Sony Bank, which was spun out from the tech firm earlier this year, reportedly plans to issue its own stablecoin next year.

USDSC is built on infrastructure from M0, a startup developing modular platforms for programmable stablecoins. M0 previously partnered with MetaMask and Stripe on other stablecoin projects.

Alongside the new token, Startale is launching STAR Points, a rewards system that gives users incentives for minting or holding USDSC, completing in-app tasks, or interacting with decentralized apps via the Startale App, a mobile hub for the Soneium ecosystem.

Startale CEO Sota Watanabe said the goal is to make Web3 tools feel as familiar as mainstream apps. ""It powers payments, rewards, and everyday transactions,” he said in a statement.

This stablecoin rollout follows Startale's earlier announcement with SBI Holdings to build a round-the-clock digital asset exchange for tokenized assets, part of a broader play for a share of the nearly $19 trillion tokenization market projected by 2033.

Update: also now removed from Humble


Grotesque and surreal 'farming simulation' Horses has been banned from the Epic Games Store on the eve of release, a couple of years after a work-in-progress version of the game was rejected by Valve. In an alleged statement to developers Santa Ragione, the Fortnite makers explain that they've found the game to be in contravention of policies against ""Inappropriate Content"" and ""Hateful or Abusive Content"". Given that, according to Santa Ragione, Epic have had access to a build for two months and had already approved the game for publication on their store 18 days before launch, the whole thing feels like a frantic response to Valve's claims about the unfinished build, which Epic presumably haven't seen. 



In the statement attributed to them, Epic's content reviewers also say that when they piped their findings about Horses through a questionnaire supplied by an international age rating NGO, it told them the game should be rated Adult Only. Horses has already been rated 18 by the Pan-European Game Information system and M for Mature by the Electronic Software Ratings Board, as displayed on the EGS Coming Soon page, which is still live as of writing. 



AO games aren't allowed on the Epic Games Store unless - as the attributed statement reminds us - they've only been rated Adult Only because they have blockchain, NFT or cryptocurrency technology. This is totally fine, because none of those things are reprehensible or controversial, and besides, they probably make more money for Epic than bizarre and disturbing artworks about people dressed as horses.



According to Santa Ragione, Epic informed the developers that they won't distribute Horses about 24 hours before release, and denied a subsequent appeal 12 hours later. Here's the full reported statement about the ban from Epic, which was sent to RPS over email.



""We are unable to distribute HORSES on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. The 'Inappropriate Content' policy prohibits content which ""contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated."" The 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology).""



The developers say they don't know for sure what pushed Epic to act, but offer a bit of speculation. ""Following the announcement of Steam's ban, HORSES became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition,"" they write. ""It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself."" Regarding Epic's attributed comments about policy infringement, they write that ""no specific indication of problematic content in the game was given, only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines"".



If you're catching up with all this, Santa Ragione went public about Valve banning Horses from Steam around a week ago. According to the developers - with partial confirmation from Valve - Steam's reviewers rejected the game after submission of an unfinished build they felt featured ""content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor"". 



While Valve have offered no further details in public, Santa Ragione speculate that this statement refers to a scene of a farm supplier's daughter riding the shoulders of an enslaved naked woman in a horse mask. They have both rebutted Valve's initial suggestion that the game might contain child sexual abuse material, and changed the scene following Valve's review to make the character a twenty-something woman. They note in general that the scene ""deals with the societal structure"" of the game's world, and that while Horses ""does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion."" 



I've reviewed the finished game (at possibly indulgent length - maybe have a toilet break before you dive in) and as regards the final version of that scene, I don't consider this to be any kind of child pornography. I've included screens of it below to give you an idea. To give some broad context, Horses is about violent structural repression and the punishing of sexuality. The ""horses"" are people deemed to be so immoral they deserve to be treated like livestock. The game is not an endorsement of anything it depicts.



As with their response to Valve's rejection of the game, Santa Ragione argue that all of this is just modern-day puritanism in action. ""We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists,"" they write. ""Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. These bans passively shape which titles developers feel safe creating, pushing preemptive censorship.""


As with the payment processor crackdown on ""adult"" or ""NSFW"" games from earlier this year, my takeaway is that another large corporate institution is reluctantly pantomiming the role of public guardian. As their on-going support for scam-ridden technologies with a considerable environmental cost suggests, Epic aren't really interested in safeguarding morality - it's just a predicament thrust on them by their control of distribution. I imagine the key equation here is one of reputation management vs likelihood of a CSAM lawsuit vs opportunity for profit.



Anyway, we'll mail Epic a request for comment. In the meantime, Horses can still be found on Humble, Itch, and GOG.



Update: Humble have also pulled the game from sale. Click that link above, and you'll see it's ""no longer available for purchase"". Humble are owned by IGN Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, who also own Rock Paper Shotgun. I have asked myself for comment. I have yet to reply at the time of writing.

Singapore, Singapore, December 3rd, 2025, Chainwire



Ourbit SuperCEX has announced the launch of Cosmic Wheel, its flagship year-end celebration designed as one of the platform's largest user reward events to date. Running from December 3, 12:00 to December 17, 00:00 (UTC+8), the campaign offers a total prize pool of 2,500,000 USDT to all existing and new Ourbit CEX users worldwide.

Over a 14-day period, users can participate through three core tracks:

Users participate through the Cosmic Wheel event page by completing daily tasks—Futures trading, account snapshots, Tap Trading missions, inviting friends, and more—to earn rewards such as token airdrops and Futures Bonus. These tasks also generate Fortune Draw chances, offer opportunities to obtain Limited NFTs, and users can also join The Futures War to compete for up to 2,000,000 USDT in rewards.

The Fortune Draw: 500,000 USDT in the campaign's card-drawing reward program

Prize Structure:

How It Works:

Two Phases:

Phase 1: Dec 3–10 (UTC+8)

Phase 2: Dec 10–17 (UTC+8)

Reward Distribution:

The 200,000 USDT card-set pool is split into 100,000 USDT per phase and distributed proportionally based on users' complete sets.

The 300,000 USDT reward pool—covering vouchers, Limited NFT drops, and Tap Trading cash rewards — is delivered through additional rewards obtained directly from draws.

The Futures War: Team Futures Competition with Up to 2,000,000 USDT

The Futures War is the high-intensity competition track of Cosmic Wheel, built around team-based Futures trading.

Key Dates (UTC+8):

Users who prefer not to join the competition can still fully participate through Tap Trading and the Fortune Draw.

NFT Layer: Commemorative and Limited NFTs Tied to Future Ecosystem Rights

NFTs form an important rights layer within the Cosmic Wheel and come in two types: Commemorative NFTs and Limited NFTs. Commemorative NFTs have an unlimited supply and can be minted by users who complete their “Ourbit Wrapped 2025” annual report.

The Limited NFT is highly scarce and carries significant long-term value. Holders will be eligible to receive platform tokens airdrops upon the future launch of the Ourbit platform token, in addition to other exclusive platform rewards and benefits. Of the total 2,000 Limited NFTs, 1,000 will be distributed randomly through the card-drawing activity, and 1,000 will be made available through the $BITCH subscription.

Tap Trading

Tap Trading provides users with a simple, zero-cost way to earn daily rewards. Users simply claim virtual 3,000 BIT each day and use them to predict Bitcoin price movements. As users accumulate BIT by making correct price predictions, they will automatically unlock the corresponding Cosmic Wheel card-draw rewards. Reaching the highest tier each day also provides a chance to receive a 5 USDT cash reward.

With the Cosmic Wheel now underway, Ourbit SuperCEX presents its largest year-end reward campaign, combining The Futures War, the Fortune Draw, and Tap Trading into a 14-day celebration. Featuring a 2,500,000 USDT prize pool and 2,000 high-value limited NFTs, the event is designed to engage everyone, from experienced futures traders to NFT collectors and newcomers.

Plans to be more open and transparent about the way the U.K.'s Information Commissioner conducts investigations and fines companies for data privacy breaches should provide businesses with greater clarity about enforcement, but experts say there also needs to be more detail about how the regulator will prioritize cases. 

The U.K.'s data regulator launched a consultation on October 31, calling for views on its proposed guidance about the way it selects and handles investigations and enforcement in cases where the Data Protection Act or the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may have been infringed.

ICO reprimands company over accidental publishing of data about people caught up in Horizon IT scandal

Business live – latest updates

The Post Office has avoided a fine over a data breach that resulted in the mistaken online publication of the names and addresses of more than 500 post office operators it had been pursuing during the Horizon IT scandal.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has reprimanded the Post Office over the breach, in which the company's press office accidentally published an unredacted version of a legal settlement document with the operators on its website.

The ICO said the data breach in June last year involving the release of names, home addresses and operator status of 502 out of the 555 people involved in the successful litigation action against the Post Office led by Sir Alan Bates had been “entirely preventable”.

“The people affected by this breach had already endured significant hardship and distress as a result of the IT scandal,” said Sally Anne Poole, the head of investigations at the ICO.

“They deserved much better than this. The postmasters have once again been let down by the Post Office. This data breach was entirely preventable and stemmed from a mistake that could have been avoided had the correct procedures been in place.”

The ICO said its investigation had found that the Post Office had failed to implement appropriate “technical and organisational measures” to protect people's information.

The data watchdog highlighted a lack of documented policies or quality assurance for publishing documents online, as well as “insufficient” staff training with “no specific guidance on information sensitivity or publishing practices”.

The ICO said it had initially considered imposing a fine of up to £1.09m but decided that the data breach did not reach the threshold of “egregious” under its approach to fining public-sector companies.

The Open Rights Group (ORG), a campaigning organisation, said the ICO's determination that the data breach was not egregious was “ludicrous”.

“This reprimand is a go-ahead for public organisations in the UK to keep inflicting harm, knowing that the ICO will let them off the hook,” said Mariano delli Santi, a legal and policy officer at the ORG. “As reprimands lack the force of law, the Post Office can rest assured that they will not face consequences if they fail to address their shortcomings.”

Last June, the Post Office apologised for the data breach with Nick Read, then the chief executive, saying the leak was “a truly terrible error”.

The former post office operator Christopher Head tweeted the text of a letter he had written to Read and Nigel Railton, the chair of the Post Office, in which he said that many of his colleagues “hadn't shared details with their own families” at the time.

The Post Office settled the civil claim brought by 555 claimants for £57.75m over the wrongful prosecutions on faulty Horizon evidence – amounting to £12m after legal costs – without admitting liability, in December 2019.

Last May, hundreds of post office operators convicted on charges including false accounting, theft and fraud were exonerated by an unprecedented act of parliament.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

Tectum (TET) is a blockchain development project and has just launched a new token, Tectum Cash Token (TCT), following an $800,000 community raise on the KingdomStarter launchpad. TCT crypto has officially hit DEXs and is now teasing a CEX listing for later this week.

TCT crypto launched on December 1 at a listing price of $0.20, but was quickly sold off by presale investors, taking profits. It dropped to $0.14 before climbing back up to its current price of $0.156. It has a market cap of just over $15M. However, a worrying lack of volume is causing the price to stagnate and leading investors elsewhere, particularly to the PepeNode (PEPENODE) presale.



(SOURCE: GeckoTerminal)

In Tectum's own words, the TCT crypto token is  “powering the utility and governance at the core of the Tectum PayFi ecosystem, built to connect users directly to the value generated by real-world crypto payment adoption through SoftNote Wallet.”

The Tectum PayFi ecosystem is described as “a zero-fee payment system using digital banknotes”, in which TCT is used to transform user participation into ownership. Holders will gain access to revenue-sharing from SoftNote ePOS operations, exclusive ecosystem rewards, and decision-making rights that shape Tectum's financial evolution.

Although there was some initial hype surrounding the TCT crypto launch, which saw an $800,000 presale raise filled on the KingdomStarter launchpad, the two days following its public launch have seen dwindling volume, leading to a sell-off from presale investors.

Per GeckoTerminal, TCT has only processed $47.5K in daily trading volume, which is a pitiful haul for a supposedly hyped new project. To add to the misery, Tectum Cash Token has maintained a holder count of just 164, another indicator of weak demand for the token.

With the tepid beginning to the TCT crypto launch, holders will be hoping that the promised CEX listing later this week can bring an injection of liquidity and demand to the token. Many investors are seemingly bearish on the project and its early poor performance, instead turning to PepeNode (PEPENODE), a ‘Mine-2-Earn' memecoin ICO that has already raised over $2.25M.

The PepeNode (PEPENODE) presale has just surpassed $2.25M in ICO funding and is set to hit $3M as its next target, before running toward $5M and beyond.

This significant funding demonstrates the strong demand for this hybrid memecoin and utility project. The utility offerings include virtual mining, staking, and a tiered presale pricing model, which increases the price as more investors participate.

These features create excitement and interest in the PEPENODE token ahead of its launch on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). While TCT crypto is teasing CEX listings that may or may not come, there are strong rumors within the PEPENODE community that Binance is closely monitoring the project.

Virtual mining allows investors to set up virtual nodes and facilities that generate rewards instantly through an easy-to-use dashboard. This feature enables presale investors to compound their investments, earning additional revenue through a GameFi mining approach.



Finally, the Pepenode team has adopted a price-stage presale model, in which the PEPENODE price increases incrementally, meaning investors are automatically in profit each time the project reaches its next price stage.

As broader crypto market conditions improve, PepeNode is solidifying its position as one of the best investment plays right now, with more hype and demand than TCT crypto and other new token launches.

The PEPENODE token is currently worth $0.0011778 during the presale, with just under 48 hours remaining before the timer expires and the price increases again.

The crash Tuesday in the crypto miner American Bitcoin Corp. was instantaneous. At 9:31 a.m. on Wall Street, just one minute after trading opened, its shares were down 33%. Five minutes later, losses had ballooned to 42% and then, for a brief moment, to more than 50%.

It was all so spectacular that American Bitcoin quickly became the symbol of not just the crypto market wipeout of late 2025 but also the collapse of the myriad ventures that the Trump family has been promoting in the digital-currency world over the past year. For as much as broader crypto markets have sunk these past two months — roughly 25% in the case of bellwether Bitcoin — projects that are tied to the Trump family are down far, far more.

World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, has seen its WLFI token tumble 51% from its peak in early September, more than both Bitcoin and an index of smaller digital tokens. Alt5 Sigma, a company promoted by the Trump sons, has plunged around 75% as it deals with a growing number of legal problems. 

Then there are the memecoins named after the president and his wife, Melania, which have fallen around 90% and 99% respectively from their record highs back in January. American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump, is now down 75% after the big drop on Tuesday. 

These moves have put a big dent in the huge piles of crypto wealth that the first family amassed earlier in the year. But they also carry a broader significance for both the digital asset industry and the president's public image. Trump's embrace helped boost a wide array of crypto tokens during the early months of his second term and turned the price of Bitcoin into a marker of his political success. 

Now, though, what looked like a Trump premium has suddenly turned into a Trump drag, taking out one of the central pillars holding up cryptoassets and offering an indication of just how quickly confidence in these speculative markets — and even in the president himself — can dissolve.

“The Trump presidency has been a double edged sword for legitimacy,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University's Washington College of Law. “Trump started launching his own crypto projects, many of which lost value very quickly. If the goal was to achieve legitimacy through the Trump family, that's not helped.”

World Liberty Financial and the company behind Trump's memecoin, Fight Fight Fight, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  

While the president has recently toned down his public promotion of crypto, Eric Trump took to social media on Tuesday to blame American Bitcoin's bad performance on the end of a lockup period for its shares, rather than any broader weakness. 

“Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched,” he wrote in a post on X. “I'm 100% committed to leading the industry.”

To be clear, the dramatic moves in the assets associated with the Trump family are hardly new for an industry that has been defined by its volatility. Digital tokens have experienced big drops in the past, before bouncing back. On Tuesday, as American Bitcoin struggled, the original cryptocurrency had one of its best days in the last few weeks, rising around 6%.

Earlier this year, though, it seemed like Trump's embrace of the technology might be enough to take digital tokens out of their endless cycle of boom and bust and turn them into a more reliable part of the financial system. If nothing else, many crypto believers figured Trump would have enough power to ensure the success of the projects he cared about the most.

And for a while, the various cross-promotions seemed to be working. People looking to express their support for the president brought up Trump tokens and pushed up their value. Gryphon Digital shares surged 173% when it announced that it was merging with Eric Trump's American Bitcoin in May. On the first day of trading after the merger, in September, shares of American Bitcoin rose another 16%.

These projects were all helped by policies and regulatory changes that Trump promoted, led by legislation that aimed to bring crypto stablecoins, tied to the value of the dollar, into the mainstream. 

But the signs of trouble have been mounting over time. The memecoins that were launched right before the inauguration, with lots of promotional muscle from Trump himself, have steadily lost steam over time, with just occasional moments of relief, like the rally in April after the president offered to join some of the biggest holders of the coin for dinner.   

Joel Li, the chief executive of an online marketplace for electric vehicles, bought the memecoin so he could attend the dinner, but sold out soon after. He noticed things getting particularly bad after Trump launched a new salvo of tariffs against China in October. 

“People started to realize, this might not be what they thought,” Li said. 

Michael Terpin, a long-time crypto investor, said that the tariff moves have served as a cold reminder: “Trump giveth and Trump taketh away.”

The problems, though, have gone beyond the vagaries of the broader markets. American Bitcoin has had to deal with a report that the mining machines it uses, from a Chinese manufacturer, have been investigated as a risk to US national security. Meanwhile, Alt5 Sigma, a public company that set out to buy one of the tokens issued by World Liberty Financial, has faced an exodus of executives after announcing that one of its subsidiaries had faced a criminal probe in Rwanda. 

Alt5 Sigma did not respond to requests for comment on the recent developments. 

The downdraft since October has taken out more than $1 billion of the wealth that the Trumps generated through their crypto ventures and other businesses. But they are still sitting on significant profits, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It is retail investors who bought into assets when they were flying near their peaks that are nursing the most painful losses. 

Kevin Hu, a 22-year-old student in Vancouver, had positioned for a continued rally, but instead saw his portfolio of digital tokens drop by as much as 40% by mid-November.

“You'd think with the president being so pro-crypto, it would create a floor,” he said. “But the market didn't respond that way. And the stuff around the memecoins, it just turned a lot of people off.”","{'href': 'https://www.ndtvprofit.com', 'title': 'NDTV Profit'}","cryptocurrency"

Home | Analysis | Quantum money meets Bitcoin: Building unforgeable digital currency

A new battle for the digital throne is emerging as quantum money moves from theory to possibility, raising the question of whether Bitcoin's decentralised strength can withstand a future shaped by quantum technology. 

Quantum money might sound like science fiction, yet it is rapidly emerging as one of the most compelling frontiers in modern digital finance. Initially a theoretical concept, it was far ahead of the technology of its time, making practical implementation impossible. Today, thanks to breakthroughs in quantum computing and quantum communication, scientists are reviving the idea, investigating how the principles of quantum physics could finally enable unforgeable quantum digital money. 

Comparisons between blockchain and quantum money are frequent and, on the surface, appear logical, yet can these two visions of new-generation cash genuinely be measured by the same yardstick? 

Quantum money was first proposed by physicist Stephen Wiesner in the late 1960s. Wiesner envisioned a system in which each banknote would carry quantum particles encoded in specific states, known only to the issuing bank, making the notes inherently secure. 

Due to the peculiarities of quantum mechanics, these quantum states could not be copied, offering a level of security fundamentally impossible with classical systems. At the time, however, quantum technologies were purely theoretical, and devices capable of creating, storing, and accurately measuring delicate quantum states simply did not exist. 

For decades, Wiesner's idea remained a fascinating thought experiment. Today, the rise of functional quantum computers, advanced photonic systems, and reliable quantum communication networks is breathing new life into the concept, allowing researchers to explore practical applications of quantum money in ways that were once unimaginable. 

At the heart of quantum money lies the no-cloning theorem, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. The principle establishes that it is physically impossible to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state. Any attempt to measure a quantum state inevitably alters it, meaning that copying or scanning a quantum banknote destroys the very information that ensures its authenticity. 

The unique property makes quantum money exceptionally secure: unlike blockchain, which relies on cryptographic algorithms and distributed consensus, quantum money derives its protection directly from the laws of physics. In theory, a quantum banknote cannot be counterfeited, even by an attacker with unlimited computing resources, which is why quantum money is considered one of the most promising approaches to unforgeable digital currency.

Quantum money schemes are typically divided into two main types: private and public. 

In private quantum money systems, a central authority- such as a bank- creates quantum banknotes and remains the only entity capable of verifying them. Each note carries a classical serial number alongside a set of quantum states known solely to the issuer. The primary advantage of this approach is its absolute immunity to counterfeiting, as no one outside the issuing institution can replicate the banknote. However, such systems are fully centralised and rely entirely on the security and infrastructure of the issuing bank, which inherently limits scalability and accessibility.

Public quantum money, by contrast, pursues a more ambitious goal: allowing anyone to verify a quantum banknote without consulting a central authority. Developing this level of decentralisation has proven exceptionally difficult. Numerous proposed schemes have been broken by researchers who have managed to extract information without destroying the quantum states. Despite these challenges, public quantum money remains a major focus of quantum cryptography research, with scientists actively pursuing secure and scalable methods for open verification. 

Beyond theoretical appeal, quantum money faces substantial practical hurdles. Quantum states are inherently fragile and susceptible to decoherence, meaning they can lose their information when interacting with the surrounding environment. 

Maintaining stable quantum states demands highly specialised and costly equipment, including photonic processors, quantum memory modules, and sophisticated quantum error-correction systems. Any error or loss could render a quantum banknote completely worthless, and no reliable method currently exists to store these states over long periods. In essence, the concept of quantum money is groundbreaking, yet real-world implementation requires technological advances that are not yet mature enough for mass adoption. 

While quantum money relies on the laws of physics to prevent counterfeiting, Bitcoin tackles the duplication problem through cryptography and distributed consensus. Each transaction is verified across thousands of nodes, and SHA-256 hash functions secure the blockchain against double spending without the need for a central authority. 

Unlike elliptic curve cryptography, which could eventually be vulnerable to large-scale quantum attacks, SHA-256 has proven remarkably resilient; even quantum algorithms such as Grover's offer only a marginal advantage, reducing the search space from 2256 to 2128– still far beyond any realistic brute-force attempt. 

Bitcoin's security does not hinge on unbreakable mathematics alone but on a combination of decentralisation, network verification, and robust cryptographic design. Many experts therefore consider Bitcoin effectively quantum-proof, with most of the dramatic threats predicted from quantum computers likely to be impossible in practice. 

Software-based and globally accessible, Bitcoin operates independently of specialised hardware, allowing users to send, receive, and verify value anywhere in the world without the fragility and complexity inherent in quantum systems. Furthermore, the network can evolve to adopt post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, ensuring long-term resilience, making Bitcoin arguably the most battle-hardened digital financial instrument in existence. 

In reality, quantum money and Bitcoin address entirely different challenges, meaning the former is unlikely to replace the latter. Bitcoin operates as a global, decentralised monetary network with established economic rules and governance, while quantum money represents a technological approach to issuing physically unforgeable tokens. Bitcoin is not designed to be physically unclonable; its strength lies in verifiability, decentralisation, and network-wide trust.

However, SHA-256- the hashing algorithm that underpins Bitcoin mining and block creation- remains highly resistant to quantum threats. Quantum computers achieve only a quadratic speed-up through Grover's algorithm, which is insufficient to break SHA-256 in practical terms. Bitcoin also retains the ability to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards as they mature, whereas quantum money is limited by rigid physical constraints that are far harder to update.

Quantum money also remains too fragile, complex, and costly for widespread use. Its realistic applications are limited to state institutions, military networks, or highly secure financial environments rather than everyday payments. Bitcoin, by contrast, already benefits from extensive global infrastructure, strong market adoption, and deep liquidity, making it far more practical for daily transactions and long-term digital value transfer. 

Although fundamentally different, quantum money and blockchain technologies have the potential to complement one another in meaningful ways. Quantum key distribution could strengthen the security of blockchain networks by protecting communication channels from advanced attacks, while quantum-generated randomness may enhance cryptographic protocols used in decentralised systems. 

Researchers have also explored the idea of using ‘quantum tokens' to provide an additional privacy layer within specialised blockchain applications. Both technologies ultimately aim to deliver secure and verifiable forms of digital value. Their coexistence may offer the most resilient future framework for digital finance, combining the physics-based protection of quantum money with the decentralisation, transparency, and global reach of blockchain technology. 

Quantum money remains a remarkable concept, originally decades ahead of its time, and now revived by advances in quantum computing and quantum communication. Although it promises theoretically unforgeable digital currency, its fragility, technical complexity, and demanding infrastructure make it impractical for large-scale use. 

Bitcoin, by contrast, stands as the most resilient and widely adopted model of decentralised digital money, supported by a mature global network and robust cryptographic foundations. 

Quantum money and Bitcoin stand as twin engines of a new digital finance era, where quantum physics is reshaping value creation, powering blockchain innovation, and driving next-generation fintech solutions for secure and resilient digital currency.

Crypto's social impact can be felt everywhere, from social media to films and music. 

Crypto is often seen as just a modern trading tool for day traders or technology enthusiasts, or a niche digital currency with limited application. Beyond all the hype, the technological jargon, and trading charts lies a digital currency system that was founded on the principles of accessibility, inclusiveness, and trust. Today, the relevance of crypto reaches beyond financial utility or technological niche. It has become a digital currency that provides important insight into the future of money, digital identity, and personal empowerment.

The technology behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain, was created as a decentralised system aimed at promoting digital ownership and autonomy. Assets on the blockchain are owned and verified by individual users. This means that everyone on a particular blockchain owns a stake in the digital currencies and assets on that blockchain. Popular assets that are often stored and traded via blockchain ledgers include NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and meme coins. Meme tokens, those are crypto coins that obtain value through community hype and influence, have become popular digital assets in recent years due to high market caps and exciting returns. Together, these digital assets have created a thriving digital economy built on community engagement and trust.

For non-crypto users, the creation of these decentralised economies offers greater insight into the future of money. In addition, learning how decentralisation works is an important step toward shifting non-users' perspectives on digital finance and inspiring increased trust in digital assets when crypto is eventually integrated into traditional financial systems.

Crypto economics also provides non-users with a low-barrier entry point into understanding the financial world. Simple crypto conversions can lead to a deeper understanding of complex financial topics like inflation, currency supply, and financial privacy. Crypto communities also provide in-depth discussions and detailed resources on how digital economics work, which leads to a better understanding of real-world economics. By simply following crypto discussions or learning the basics of blockchain technology, non-users can find themselves becoming more financially literate.

The knowledge learnt through understanding crypto can help individuals navigate tricky traditional financial systems with more confidence. This applies whether non-users are comparing savings options, exploring investment opportunities, or evaluating digital payment tools.

Blockchain and crypto technologies are already being used to power innovations in industries that benefit non-users. Industries such as logistics, healthcare, and retail use blockchain technology to increase supply-chain transparency and secure data management.

As blockchain and crypto technology became more advanced, digital payment processing systems have become more efficient and cost-effective to operate. These improvements enhance the experience of many non-crypto users every day on e-commerce platforms.

Few technologies have made as much of a cultural impact as crypto. The introduction of cryptocurrencies has transformed digital industries like gaming, started online art movements, and given rise to a new breed of digital creators. Crypto's social impact can be felt everywhere, from social media to films and music. The decentralised nature of blockchain and crypto technology has also led to the creation of online communities that foster global conversations about innovation and digital freedom.

Luana Lopes Lara, co-founder of the prediction market Kalshi, has become the youngest female self-made billionaire after her company announced a fresh $1 billion funding round Tuesday. 

The raise, led by crypto-focused venture firm Paradigm, valued Kalshi at $11 billion and drew participation from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator.

At 29, Lopes Lara overtakes previous titleholder Lucy Guo of Scale AI and pop icon Taylor Swift, who briefly held the distinction earlier this year. Lopes Lara, born in Brazil and a computer science graduate of MIT, co-founded Kalshi in 2019 with Tarek Mansour, who also now joins the billionaires list at the same age.

Still, both Kalshi founders were edged out in the youth race by Shayne Coplan, 27, founder of rival prediction platform Polymarket, who became the youngest self-made billionaire in October. Coplan's rise followed a $2 billion investment commitment from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, into Polymarket at an $8 billion valuation.

Kalshi allows users to trade on the outcome of real-world events — like election results, interest rate changes or even celebrity divorces — through regulated, event-based contracts. The platform became registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in November 2020, giving it a formal regulatory status rarely seen in prediction markets.

Polymarket, by contrast, is a blockchain-based prediction market that uses USDC stablecoins to let users bet on event outcomes without traditional financial regulation. It has gained popularity for its wide range of topics and faster market responses, but has had to navigate legal hurdles, including a 2022 settlement with the CFTC.

Both companies are reshaping how people engage with information and risk. What used to be informal bar bets — on who would win the Super Bowl or when inflation would cool — are now billion-dollar businesses. In this new world, anyone with a strong opinion and some capital can wager on future events the same way traders bet on stocks or commodities.

Crypto's big rally from the Monday lows paused in early U.S. action Wednesday as tech stocks quickly slid on a disappointing AI-related report.

According to a story in The Information, Microsoft was lowering artificial intelligence software sales quotas. The software giant denied the report in an email to CNBC and said that it did not ""lower sales quotas."" 

The Information's story said that Microsoft scaled back expectations for its next wave of AI products — ""agents"" — after slower-than-expected adoption by customers this year. The news website later changed its headline saying that Microsoft lowered AI growth targets, rather than sales quotas.

As a result, sales quotas for some AI tools were lowered across multiple divisions, including Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, after they missed growth targets in 2025. This comes after AI powerhouse OpenAI earlier this year also lowered its projected revenue from AI agents over the next five years.

Market reaction was swift, with Microsoft (MSFT) sliding nearly 3% on the news, and the Nasdaq 100 moving from about a 0.5% gain to a 0.5% decline.

Crypto prices, closely correlated over the past weeks to tech stocks on the downside, fell in sympathy. BTC, trading above $93,000 overnight, immediately dipped to $91,800. Recently, it was changing hands at around $92,300, still 3.3% higher over the past 24 hours. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,137.49 slipped 1.8% from its session high, holding above $3,000.

Bitcoin mining stocks showed muted movement in pre-market trading. Iren (IREN) slipped around 2%, while Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Core Scientific (CORZ) each dipped about 1%. TeraWulf (WULF) held steady.

Elsewhere in crypto-related equities, MicroStrategy (MSTR) gained roughly 2% and Coinbase (COIN) rose 1%. Newer market entrants Circle (CRCL) and eToro (ETOR) were up 2% and 3%, respectively.

UPDATE (Dec 3, 16:01 UTC): Adds comment from Microsoft.

Strategy (MSTR)  on Monday announced a further 25 basis point increase in the dividend rate of its STRC preferred series to 10.75%. This is the fourth increase since the IPO launch at the end of July.

One of Strategy's perpetual preferred stocks, STRC, or ""Stretch,"" is designed to offer short duration characteristics with high yield exposure. It currently pays a 10.75% annual dividend, distributed monthly in cash. The dividend rate is adjusted each month to encourage trading near STRC's $100 par value and to limit price volatility.

When launched in July, STRC initially carried a 9% dividend rate at the IPO price of $90. The company then raised the dividend rate twice to 10.25%, although STRC still did not reach par. A third increase finally got the price to $100, but the tumble in the price of bitcoin and Strategy's common stock touched STRC, which at one point in the November panic fell as low as about $90, setting in motion this latest increase.

STRC was trading at $98.43 at press time.

The updated dividend rate was announced along with news of a $1.44 billion cash buffer intended to fund perpetual preferred dividends. The total annualized dividend obligation across all perpetual preferred shares is about $800 million. According to the investor presentation, the company has 74 years of dividend coverage when measured against its $59 billion bitcoin reserve. Even so, the $1.44 billion cash reserve is expected to be the primary source of near term dividend funding.

Scientific American Shares Its First-Ever Best Fiction and Nonfiction Books of the Year

Scientific American unveils its first-ever best fiction and nonfiction books of the year, spotlighting stories that blend science, imagination and unforgettable voices.

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Brianne Kane, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio 

Ecco; Crown; Doubleday; Ballantine Books; Scientific American Illustration

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

One way that we here at Scientific American stay on top of what's happening in science is not just by examining research papers and studies but also by reading books. For the past two years we've shared our staff favorites, but this year we've decided to expand into two new lists: Scientific American's first-ever best nonfiction books and fiction books of the year.

To take us through the selections we have Bri Kane, SciAm's associate books editor. Thanks so much for joining us today, Bri.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Bri Kane: Thanks, Kendra. I'm so excited to talk to you today.

Pierre-Louis: I'm excited to have you here. Can you tell us a little bit about the process of getting [these book lists] together? What are some of the key things that you looked at?

Kane: Yeah, I mean, this is Scientific American's first year doing a best fiction and best nonfiction of the year list; we've had a very popular staff-favorites books list the last two years.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: So in trying to find the best fiction and the best nonfiction of a year it means doing a ton of research, which, thankfully, we're a bunch of good-natured nerds, and we love any excuse to research and any excuse to read more books. I mean, it was a great self-assigned homework project this year. [Laughs.]

So some of the most important things that we were looking at for every book is it had to have an exceptional voice in writing and an incredible story.

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: Even nonfiction needed to really catch our attention in the narrator's voice and the story that they were trying to tell us.

Another thing that we looked at for every book—obviously, we're Scientific American—is: What's the science here? And science is a really broad umbrella, and we tried to have a really broad view of what we considered science, but every single book on our list has something that can appeal to a more science-minded reader, so I'm really excited to showcase those books.

And then every book has a little special je ne sais quoi—that little sparkle that just catches your eye—is the book that you just keep telling people about, even though you read it months and months ago, maybe. Those are the books that we really, like, found ourselves drawn to and were talking about with each other the most, and we wanted to talk to our audience about them.

Pierre-Louis: That makes total sense, and I totally know how you feel. I think one of the books that I suggested was exactly in that [category] of just books that I was obsessed with and couldn't stop talking to people about. So can you tell us, starting with the nonfiction side, what are a couple of books that really topped your list?

Kane: Yeah, I mean, one book that we have been talking about in our books group in our newsroom for a while now is Human Nature by Kate Marvel. This book shook me to my core. I mean, I have been following climate science and the changes to our environment for a long time now ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: But the way that Kate connects our current climate catastrophes with our history of literature and history of archaeology and just the whole world—it was really beautiful to bring everything all the way back down to our feelings and being pissed off about climate change, being sad, trying to find hope in all of this darkness and also some humor along the way. I mean, it was a really, really special read for a lot of us, and it had that sparkle from the first page.

Pierre-Louis: It feels like a lot of climate books are often kind of depressing, and it—the way you're talking about Human Nature is—it wasn't necessarily just, like, a downer.

Kane: No, and I think you're right: a lot of books trying to cover this issue really bum you out, and it can be kind of a slog to get through. But I found Human Nature to be, like, a wild ride. I could not put it down once I started. I was shocked how much I loved it and how much I could not stop talking about it. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: That's awesome, and I know that there's another book kind of in a similar vein in terms of, like, really loving it and not being able to put it down within the nonfiction category.

Kane: Yeah, They Poisoned the World by Mariah Blake is exceptional. I mean ...

Pierre-Louis: Wow, what a title.

Kane: Yeah, Andrea Gawrylewski, our chief newsletter editor, called it “an epic piece of science writing,” and that is not a compliment that gets thrown around lightly around here. I mean, it was a really, really beautiful text that really took our minds to a whole new place in understanding PFAS [perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances], these forever chemicals ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: And the companies that are poisoning our communities around this country and what that means for our understanding of our place in this fight and the legacy that we're leaving.

I mean, Mariah Blake interviewed hundreds of people in this small town and discussed their personal medical histories ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: And how they have been affected by this in their community—the air they breathe, the water coming out of their sink fountain has been changed by these chemicals, and it is not safe for their children and for their selves.

Pierre-Louis: And they're chemicals that are pretty ubiquitous, right? Like, they found them in the past, for example, in, like, disposable food containers. They're often in the material that we use to make, like, jackets waterproof. They linger in the environment for so long that, by the perspective of human lifespans, they linger forever.

Kane: Yeah, I mean people have heard about, like, microplastics, and they're concerned about where we're finding those ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: But everyone needs to be looking into PFAS and forever chemicals a bit more than they are. These are really, really scary things that have really, really long consequences, as you're saying. And Mariah Blake does a really incredible job of bringing that all on the page. And like we were saying it's not bumming you out; it's not leaving you destitute and terrified. It's leaving you with work to do that you are excited and hopeful to be a part of.

Pierre-Louis: I actually haven't read it. You make me wanna seek it out and to really, like, plow through it.

But those books are very much on the nonfiction side. You also looked at fiction.

Kane: Yeah, I mean, it was really fun this year to have an excuse to read some alien stories ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Kane: And some fantasy stories, some romance novels. Like, you know, we are a bunch of science journalists and science nerds, but we still read romance books before we go to bed, and we wanna read short stories that keep us up at night, and they're scary. So one book that really got my attention this year is Daniel H. Wilson's Hole in the Sky ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: It's a “first-contact” alien story, which you can't see my air quotes there, but it kind of plays with this idea of first contact because the aliens land on a Cherokee reservation in Oklahoma. And the Native people's relationship to what we would refer to as “first contact” is very different than the Western understanding of that term and science fiction as a genre's general use of that term.

And Daniel is a brilliant thriller writer who can terrify you but hold your hand through this story so that you learn from different perspectives and to have a different understanding of a genre that maybe you're very well familiar with and you've read all the classics, or maybe you're still just dipping your toe in.

Daniel Wilson's definitely one that caught my attention this year, and my conversation with him earlier this year was exceptional.

Pierre-Louis: And it feels like, very often, when we encounter first-contact stories they are often kind of through a very white, male, Western lens, and it seems like he's playing with that a little bit.

Kane: Yeah, I mean, the heart of the story, really, is a father-daughter relationship: Jim and Tawny. And Jim was raised a bit more traditional in the Native community, and Tawny wasn't. And they have a bit of an estranged, traumatic experience that created some distance between them—I don't wanna spoil it too much for you, Kendra ...

Pierre-Louis: Please don't. [Laughs.]

Kane: But it's really, really beautiful, and it really made me think about Scientific American and science fiction, generally, [their] relationship to what we would refer to as “first contact” ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: And what is that “first” that we are referring to and who exactly is contacting who. I think the specificity of our language is really important, and novels like Hole in the Sky are a novel that can remind you of these really intellectually rigorous topics. And I think that's exactly the kind of stuff that we like to read around here.

Pierre-Louis: And I know that's not kind of, like, the only standout within the fiction category.

Kane: Yeah, I mean, we, along with everyone else, have been obsessed with Atmosphere from Taylor Jenkins Reid this year—lesbians falling in love in NASA?

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Kane: Sign me up, sign me up again and again.

Former space reporter and current senior news editor here at SciAm, Sarah Lewin Frasier, reviewed it for us. And again, if a former space reporter thinks that your fictional version of NASA is real, relatable and interesting to be in, that is a very high bar to reach around here. And Atmosphere really exceeded our expectations.

I mean, I've been joking with Clara Moskowitz, our chief of reporters, who was also a space and physics editor here, about sobbing your eyes out at the end of this book in the best way possible, which all romance novels really should be doing. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.] And it's fun to think about space romance. I feel like that's not a genre that gets as much shine.

Kane: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, people in NASA fall in love, too. Astronauts kiss [Laughs], and, like, they want to have adventures that are not just taking place on Mars or on the moon. They want to fall in love, and they want to live extraordinary lives here on Earth ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Kane: And I want to read every single story about that. [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: Can you let our listeners know where they can check out the full [lists]?

Kane: Yeah, you can find all three of our lists—our staff favorites, best fiction and best nonfiction of the year—online later this week.

Pierre-Louis: Thank you so much for coming today, and I can't wait to check out the full lists.

Kane: I can't wait for everyone to see these lists and to see what you read this year, too, Kendra.

Pierre-Louis: And don't forget to listen on Friday for our episode that looks at innovations in treating postpartum depression.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Earth Just Got Slammed By a Surprise Solar Flare. Why Didn't Scientists See It Coming?","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a69520328/surprise-coronal-mass-ejection/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Scientists can usually spot coronal mass ejections before they affect Earth—but this one snuck past coronagraphs and satellites.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When the Sun erupts in a tantrum, charged particles expelled into space can seriously disrupt our electrical infrastructure—not to mention mess with GPS, cut off radio communications, trigger power outages, and cause satellites to glitch. Most of these solar storms come in the form of either flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that can be predicted, but some arrive in stealth mode.

On November 20, a NOAA space weather forecast reported solar wind streaming from a coronal hole, which is a darker, cooler, and less dense region of the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona. Coronal holes have open magnetic field lines that allow plasma and solar wind to escape, potentially affecting operations on Earth, and this is in line with the 11-year solar cycle—our star has passed peak activity at solar maximum and is now headed towards solar minimum, which is the period of low activity during which coronal holes are most common. But this was only the prelude to a coronal mass ejection. 

Warped magnetic fields in the lower corona are what directly give rise to coronal mass ejections. When these stressed, unstable magnetic fields twist and realign to relieve some of that stress (a process known as magnetic reconnection), they also unleash an immense amount of electromagnetic energy, and gobs of coronal material and magnetic field are vomited into space. As the magnetic field riding the solar wind approached Earth that November morning, our planet experienced a spike in background solar wind streams. While CMEs can usually be predicted, some strikes arrive unannounced because they cannot be observed by coronagraphs or satellites.  

Stealth CMEs tend to start brewing at higher altitudes within the corona (where there are weaker magnetic fields), and only appear to be slightly brighter or dimmer spots on the Sun. Even when CMEs are detected by coronagraphs, it is impossible to tell what region of the Sun they emerged from, so their trajectories remain in the dark. 

“It seems that the main factor contributing to the level of ‘stealthiness' is the spatial extent of the eruption rather than the altitude from which a CME lifts off ,” the researchers said. “Another aspect to note is that the eruption associated with the weakest signatures…[and]  it is evident that difference images with large temporal separations revealed the clearest eruptive signatures.”

After analyzing several stealth CMEs, the team realized that certain features of those linked to structural shifts in the corona showed up more clearly in images than in data recording their intensity. Some of the storms were observed forming against the solar disk while others were seen off the limb, or the glowing curve of the Sun, at an angle. 

There might be a way to catch these stealth storms before they come crashing into Earth's magnetic field in the future. In a 2021 study published in the journal Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences, a team of researchers found that certain signs of previous stealth CMEs had been overlooked. It is only because of NASA's STEREO spacecraft duo that their beginnings were caught (at a different angle than observers can see them from on Earth).

The new study makes recommendations for both identifying stealth CMEs and tracing their origins. These include looking at images taken at different times to see whether there were any obvious changes in coronal activity, using intensity data to interpret these images and gauge how intense that activity is, and using advanced processing techniques for images of phenomena (such as sudden brightening) that might signal a disturbance in the corona.  

While the onrush of solar particles caused a temporary rise in geomagnetic activity, it also meant that auroras reached as far south as Denmark and Maine. Swaths of the northern sky lit up in brilliant purples and reds that night.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the scientific history of the exploration of electricity and light, some pretty big names come to mind: Newton, Franklin, Maxwell, Edison, and Tesla, among others. However, in the world of electromagnetism, few names are quite as influential as Michael Faraday. Born to a poor family, Faraday became a self-taught scientist and eventually the protégé of British chemist and inventor Humphrey Davy. His discoveries of electromagnetic induction (the basic principle behind all modern turbines) and the Faraday Effect (which describes how electromagnetism and light are related) eventually earned him a knighthood—which he promptly turned down, wanting to remain “plain Mr. Faraday to the end.”

Although electromagnetic induction is the foundation of industry, the Faraday Effect has an equally profound impact on physics. In 1845, Faraday designed an experiment with a light source, a system of polarizers, and electromagnets. When light traveled through the two polarizers, quite expectedly, Faraday saw no light emitted at the other side. However, under the influence of the electromagnets, Faraday saw a “minuscule but indistinguishable” flicker of light, confirming that electromagnetism exhibits some influence on the electric field of light. 

Fast forward 180 years, and scientists are still discovering new properties of this interplay between light and magnetism. In a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, physicists Benjamin Assouline and Amir Capua from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem announce the finding that light can exhibit a magnetic influence in addition to an electric one. Specifically, this magnetic influence interacts with atomic spins—a process once assumed to be too insignificant to be of any importance.

“The static magnetic field ‘twists' the light, and the light, in turn, reveals the magnetic properties of the material,” Capua said in a press statement. “What we've found is that the magnetic part of light has a first-order effect, it's surprisingly active in this process.”

Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which typically describes spin behavior in materials, Assouline and Capua demonstrated how light can create “magnetic torque” that is actually similar to a static magnetic field. When applying this theoretical model to Terbium Gallium Garnet (TGG)—a material commonly used to test the Faraday Effect—the magnetic component of light accounted for 17 percent of atomic rotation in the visible spectrum. In the infrared (with a wavelength up to 1,300 nanometers), that number jumped to a staggering 75 percent.

“Our results show that light ‘talks' to matter not only through its electric field, but also through its magnetic field, a component that has been largely overlooked until now,' Assouline said.

According to Igor Rozhansky, a physicist at the University of Manchester who spoke with New Scientist, a re-evaluation of the magnetic component of light could give scientists a new way to manipulate atomic spins, though it's uncertain how strong this effect will be in certain materials. Such fine-tuned manipulation, according to New Scientist, could lead to a new generation of spin-based sensors and hard drives. 

Faraday's experimental foray into the world of electromagnetism eventually inspired James Clerk Maxwell's famous equations that, effectively, laid the foundation of our modern technological society. But even 180 years after one of Faraday's most famous observations, it turns out there's still a lot more to learn.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Are Growing Human Organs In Animals—And It's Working","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69549400/animal-human-chimeras/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

This breakthrough represents a big step toward creating animal hybrids capable of growing human-compatible organs, easing the current transplant demands.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

The word “chimera” usually evokes images of mythological, multi-headed beasts, but the term also comes with more modern, scientific connotations. For one, there have been around 100 or so documented cases of human chimeras—people with two distinct genetic cell lines (often the result of one fraternal twin absorbing the other in utero). In some extremely rare cases, unborn twins can become the genetic parent of a chimera's offspring. 

A more common form of chimerism is actually reflection of the concept's mythical, animalic roots—interspecies chimerism. Famously, in 2017, scientists created the world's first human-pig chimeras (in this case, a pig embryo with a tiny collection of human cells) in the hopes of growing human-compatible organs for transplantation. Fast forward eight years later, and the process still remains tricky, as a host organism's cells—such as a mouse's or a pig's—have defenses known as “RNA innate immunity” that allow the host's cells to outcompete human cells during the chimeric process.

In a new study published in the journal Cell, a team of scientists (led by biologists at UT Southwestern in Texas) identified a mouse cell protein named “MAVS” that, when disabled, essentially turns off this immune alarm. This allows human cells to compete, survive, and ultimately integrate more effectively. 

“The findings provide insights for enhancing human-animal chimerism without altering donor human cells,” Jun Wu, the senior author of the study and biologist at UT Southwestern, said in a press statement. “This advances the possibility of growing human organs in animal hosts and potentially easing the global shortage of transplantable organs.”

This study builds on previous work—published last year and also spearheaded by Wu's lab—that developed ways to circumvent sticky proteins called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which naturally adhere to cells of the same species but rarely adhere to cells across different species (a problem if you're in the chimera-making business). So, the researchers modified the surface human stem cells with nanobodies that, when encountering antigens belonging to another species, latched on securely and essentially bypassed CAMs altogether. 

Of course, the creation of human-animal chimeras (human cells typically make up far less than 10 percent of the organism) is a longstanding ethical quagmire and a scientific undertaking opposed by many animal rights groups. However, in recent years xenotransplantation (that is, the removal of genetically modified pig-grown organs for insertion into humans) has expanded with impressive results. In March of 2024, Massachusetts General Hospital performed the first xenotransplantation of a genetically-edited pig kidney into a living recipient, and earlier this month, NYU Langone Health performed its first xenotransplantations as part of a clinical trial for patients with end-stage renal cancer.

With more than 100,000 people on the waiting list for a transplant in the U.S., finding more organs to put into more bodies is a top priority for modern medicine. At least for now—for better or worse—human-animal chimeras are one way of addressing this critical shortfall.

A recent cover article in Aging-US, titled ""Sex-specific longitudinal reversal of aging in old frail mice,"" highlights a promising new direction in longevity research.

The work, led by first author Cameron Kato along with corresponding author and Aging-US Editorial Board Member Irina M. Conboy at the University of California, Berkeley, reveals that combining oxytocin with an Alk5 inhibitor (OT+A5i) greatly improved both lifespan and overall health in frail, elderly, male mice. Female mice did not experience the same long-lasting benefits, pointing to important biological differences in how each sex responds to anti-aging therapies.

""These findings establish the significant health-span extension capacity of OT+A5i and emphasize the differences in aging and in response to longevity therapeutics between the sexes.""

How the Dual-Drug Strategy Works

The team used a two-part treatment designed to address major biological changes that occur with age. Oxytocin, a hormone known to support tissue repair and naturally decline over time, was paired with an Alk5 inhibitor that blocks the TGF-beta pathway. TGF-beta activity tends to increase in older tissues and is linked to inflammation and cellular damage. In this research, frail mice aged 25 months, which is roughly equivalent to 75 human years, received regular OT+A5i treatment.

Male mice treated with this combination lived more than 70% longer than untreated mice and showed marked improvements in agility, endurance, and memory. Hazard ratio analysis indicated that treated males were nearly three times less likely to die at any moment compared to untreated controls.

""Treatment of old frail male mice with OT+A5i resulted in a remarkable 73% life extension from that time, and a 14% increase in the overall median lifespan.""

Sex Differences in Long-Term Benefits

The treatment also restored a more youthful pattern in circulating blood proteins by reducing ""biological noise,"" a recognized indicator of aging. Although both males and females experienced short-term improvements, only the males maintained long-term gains in systemic protein balance after four months of continuous therapy. Female mice showed no major improvements in lifespan or sustained health measures, although middle-aged females did experience increased fertility.

These outcomes highlight how strongly sex-specific biology can influence the effectiveness of aging interventions. The exact reasons behind these differences are still unclear, yet the study establishes a useful model for understanding how therapies may work differently across sexes.

Potential Path to Human Application

Oxytocin already has FDA approval, and Alk5 inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials, which raises the possibility that this combined approach could eventually be adapted for humans. Based on the robust improvements seen in frail elderly male mice, OT+A5i may hold significant promise for enhancing late-life health and survival in the future.

A large laboratory investigation of human-made chemicals has revealed 168 substances that are harmful to bacteria normally found in a healthy human gut. These chemicals interfere with the growth of microbes considered essential for maintaining good health.

Many of the substances identified in the study are expected to enter the body through food, drinking water, or general environmental exposure, yet most were not previously believed to influence bacteria in any way.

As gut bacteria adapt to chemical pollutants, some appear to develop resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. If the same process occurs inside the human gut, it could make certain infections more difficult to treat.

Testing Shows Common Pollutants Can Harm Beneficial Microbes

The research team, led by the University of Cambridge, examined how 1076 chemical contaminants affected 22 species of gut bacteria under laboratory conditions.

The substances found to disrupt microbial growth include pesticides such as herbicides and insecticides used on crops, as well as industrial chemicals present in flame retardants and plastics.

The gut microbiome contains an estimated 4,500 different types of bacteria that work together to support bodily functions. When this system becomes imbalanced, it can contribute to a wide range of health problems involving digestion, weight regulation, the immune system, and mental health.

Standard safety evaluations for chemicals do not account for effects on the gut microbiome because most chemicals are created to act on specific targets. For instance, insecticides are meant to affect insects, not humans or their resident microbes.

New Machine Learning Tool Predicts Chemical Risks to Gut Health

Using the data gathered in the study, the researchers developed a machine learning model to forecast whether industrial chemicals -- whether already in circulation or still being designed -- are likely to harm human gut bacteria.

Details of the study, along with the machine learning tool, appear in the journal Nature Microbiology.

Dr. Indra Roux of the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and first author of the study said: ""We've found that many chemicals designed to act only on one type of target, say insects or fungi, also affect gut bacteria. We were surprised that some of these chemicals had such strong effects. For example, many industrial chemicals like flame retardants and plasticizers -- that we are regularly in contact with -- weren't thought to affect living organisms at all, but they do.""

Professor Kiran Patil, senior author and member of the same research unit, said: ""The real power of this large-scale study is that we now have the data to predict the effects of new chemicals, with the aim of moving to a future where new chemicals are safe by design.""

Dr. Stephan Kamrad, also part of the research team, added: ""Safety assessments of new chemicals for human use must ensure they are also safe for our gut bacteria, which could be exposed to the chemicals through our food and water.""

Need for Real-World Chemical Exposure Data

There is still limited knowledge about how environmental chemicals directly influence the gut microbiome and human health. The team notes that our gut bacteria are likely coming into contact with many of the substances tested in the study, but the actual amounts reaching the gut are not yet known. Future research that tracks total chemical exposure across the body will be needed to determine the true level of risk.

Patil said: ""Now we've started discovering these interactions in a laboratory setting it's important to start collecting more real-world chemical exposure data, to see if there are similar effects in our bodies.""

In the meantime, the researchers recommend practical steps to reduce exposure to chemical pollutants, such as washing fruit and vegetables thoroughly before eating and avoiding the use of pesticides in home gardens.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A routine shingles shot may offer powerful defense against dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004721.htm","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:23:20 GMT","

An unusual vaccination rule in Wales has given scientists some of the clearest evidence so far that a vaccine might help protect against dementia. In a new study led by Stanford Medicine, researchers examined health records from older adults in Wales and found that people who received the shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over the following seven years than those who did not receive the shot.

The results, published April 2 in Nature, support a growing idea that certain viruses that affect the nervous system may raise the chance of developing dementia. If these findings continue to hold up in future work, they suggest that a practical way to help prevent dementia could already exist.

A second analysis from the same team, published Dec. 2 in Cell, pointed to another potential benefit. In that study, the researchers reported that the vaccine might also help people who already have dementia by slowing how quickly the condition worsens.

Shingles virus, chicken pox and lifelong infection

Shingles is a viral disease that causes a painful, blistering rash. It is triggered by the same virus that leads to chicken pox -- varicella-zoster. When someone gets chicken pox, usually in childhood, the virus does not fully leave the body. Instead, it stays inactive inside nerve cells for life. In later years, especially in older adults or in people whose immune systems are weakened, this dormant virus can reactivate and cause shingles.

Dementia, brain changes and the viral hypothesis

Dementia currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and about 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year. For many years, most dementia research has centered on abnormal protein build-up in the brain, including plaques and tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia. However, these efforts have not yet produced successful ways to prevent or halt the disease, so some scientists have turned their attention to other possible drivers, including infections by specific viruses that may damage the brain over time.

Earlier observational studies using health records had hinted that people who received the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop dementia. However, those studies had a serious limitation. People who choose to get vaccinated are often more health conscious in many ways that are hard to measure. They may eat differently, exercise more or engage with health care more regularly. Those lifestyle differences are known to influence dementia risk but are not recorded in medical databases.

""All these associational studies suffer from the basic problem that people who go get vaccinated have different health behaviors than those who don't,"" said Pascal Geldsetzer, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine and senior author of the new study. ""In general, they're seen as not being solid enough evidence to make any recommendations on.""

A rare natural experiment in Wales

About two years ago, Geldsetzer noticed an unusual opportunity in the way Wales had rolled out its shingles vaccination program. The setup functioned as what researchers call a ""natural experiment,"" and it appeared to avoid much of the bias seen in earlier work. At that time, the country used a version of the shingles vaccine that contained a live-attenuated, or weakened, form of the virus.

The national program began on Sept. 1, 2013. Under the policy, anyone who was 79 years old on that date could receive the vaccine during the following year. (People who were 78 would become eligible the next year for one year, and so on.) People who were 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, were out of luck -- they would never become eligible for the vaccine.

Because eligibility depended only on age at a specific cut-off date, the difference between being just under or just over the age threshold had a major impact on who could get the shot. That allowed researchers to compare people who turned 80 shortly before Sept. 1, 2013, with those who turned 80 shortly after, and to see how being eligible for the vaccine changed long-term outcomes.

According to Geldsetzer, the detailed health records available in Wales made these circumstances about as close as possible to a randomized controlled trial without actually running one.

Comparing nearly identical groups

To take advantage of this setup, the team analyzed the health records of more than 280,000 older adults between 71 and 88 years old who did not have dementia at the beginning of the vaccination program. They then concentrated their analysis on people whose birthdays placed them just on either side of the eligibility line, comparing those who turned 80 in the week before Sept. 1 to those who turned 80 in the week after.

""We know that if you take a thousand people at random born in one week and a thousand people at random, born a week later, there shouldn't be anything different about them on average,"" Geldsetzer said. ""They are similar to each other apart from this tiny difference in age.""

The researchers reasoned that about the same share of people in both groups would have wanted the shingles shot. The crucial difference was that only the slightly younger group, those not yet 80 on Sept. 1, 2013, were permitted to receive it under the rules.

""What makes the study so powerful is that it's essentially like a randomized trial with a control group -- those a little bit too old to be eligible for the vaccine -- and an intervention group -- those just young enough to be eligible,"" Geldsetzer said.

Measuring protection against shingles and dementia

The team then tracked health outcomes for the next seven years, comparing people of similar ages who had been eligible or ineligible for the vaccine. By combining that information with actual vaccination rates, they could estimate the effect of receiving the shot. About half of the people who were eligible went on to be vaccinated, while almost none of those who were not eligible received it.

As expected, the vaccine lowered the rate of shingles over the seven-year follow-up by about 37% among those who were vaccinated, in line with clinical trial data. (The live-attenuated vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time.)

By 2020, when the individuals being studied were around 86 and 87 years old, one in eight had developed dementia. Among those who received the shingles shot, however, the likelihood of a dementia diagnosis was 20% lower compared with those who did not receive it.

""It was a really striking finding,"" Geldsetzer said. ""This huge protective signal was there, any which way you looked at the data.""

Ruling out other explanations

The researchers then searched for other factors that might explain the difference in dementia rates. They found that the two groups were extremely similar in all the characteristics they could measure. Education levels were the same for eligible and ineligible people. Those who were eligible for the shingles vaccine were not more likely to receive other vaccines or preventive therapies, and they were not less likely to have common illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease or cancer.

The only clear difference between the groups was the lower number of dementia diagnoses in those who had access to the shingles shot.

""Because of the unique way in which the vaccine was rolled out, bias in the analysis is much less likely than would usually be the case,"" Geldsetzer said.

Even so, the team tested the data in a variety of alternative ways, such as examining different age windows or focusing only on deaths that listed dementia as a cause. No matter how they sliced the information, the relationship between vaccination and lower dementia risk remained.

""The signal in our data was so strong, so clear and so persistent,"" he said.

Benefits from early decline to advanced dementia

The researchers next asked whether the apparent benefits of the vaccine were limited to preventing dementia, or whether they also extended to people who already showed signs of cognitive problems. Using the same natural experiment structure, they examined a broader range of outcomes, from mild cognitive changes to late-stage dementia.

Many cases of dementia are preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment -- characterized by deficits in memory and cognitive skills that do not interfere with independent living, Geldsetzer said.

The team observed that people who had received the shingles vaccine were less likely to receive a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment during a nine-year follow-up period than those who remained unvaccinated.

They also looked at people who already had dementia at the start of the Welsh vaccination program. In this group, the results were especially striking. Individuals with dementia who received the shingles shot were significantly less likely to die from dementia in the next nine years (as indicated on their death certificates) than those who did not receive the vaccine, suggesting that the disease may have progressed more slowly in the vaccinated group.

In total, nearly half of the 7,049 Welsh seniors who had dementia when the program began died from dementia during follow-up. Among those with dementia who received the vaccine, only about 30% died from dementia.

""The most exciting part is that this really suggests the shingles vaccine doesn't have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia,"" Geldsetzer said.

Stronger effects in women raise new questions

Another notable pattern emerged when the researchers compared outcomes by sex. The protective effect of the shingles vaccine against dementia appeared to be much stronger in women than in men. Geldsetzer noted that this might reflect biological differences in immune responses or differences in how dementia develops in men and women. On average, women tend to develop higher antibody responses after vaccination, and shingles occurs more often in women than in men.

At this point, scientists still do not know exactly how the vaccine might be providing protection. It is not yet clear whether it works by broadly stimulating the immune system, by reducing how often the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, or through another pathway entirely.

It is also unknown whether a newer shingles vaccine, which uses only certain proteins from the virus and is more effective at preventing shingles, would have a similar or even stronger effect on dementia risk.

Global data and the push for a randomized trial

Geldsetzer hopes these findings will encourage more investment in this line of research.

""At least investing a subset of our resources into investigating these pathways could lead to breakthroughs in terms of treatment and prevention,"" he said.

Over the past two years, his team has checked health records from other countries, including England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, where similar shingles vaccine rollouts took place. The results in those datasets have echoed what was seen in Wales. ""We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,"" he said.

The next step that Geldsetzer is aiming for is a large randomized controlled trial, which would offer the most rigorous evidence on whether the vaccine truly causes the reduction in dementia. In such a study, participants would be randomly assigned to receive either the live-attenuated shingles vaccine or a placebo injection.

""It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,"" he said.

Geldsetzer is seeking philanthropic support to fund this work, in part because the live-attenuated vaccine is now off-patent, even though it is the vaccine type for which he has gathered strong evidence from natural experiments.

He also pointed out that such a trial might show meaningful results relatively quickly. In the Wales data, when researchers plotted dementia rates for people who were eligible versus ineligible for the vaccine, the two curves began to move apart after about a year and a half.

A researcher from the Vienna University of Economics and Business also contributed to the work.

The study received funding from The Phil & Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience, the Stanford Center for Digital Health, the National Institute on Aging (grant R01AG084535), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant DP2AI171011) and the Biohub, San Francisco.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A common constipation drug shows a surprising ability to protect kidneys","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251203004731.htm","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:49:23 GMT","

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects people across the globe and often progresses to the point where patients rely on routine dialysis to survive. Although the condition is widespread and serious, there are still no approved medications that can actively restore kidney function. A team led by Professor Takaaki Abe at the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine has uncovered an unexpected approach by repurposing a constipation medication. Their work marks the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) has been shown to slow the loss of kidney function in people with CKD.

""We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further,"" explains Abe. ""Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation.""

Clinical Trial Shows Lubiprostone Helps Preserve Kidney Function

To test this idea, the research team organized a multicenter Phase II clinical study (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) across nine medical facilities in Japan. The trial enrolled 150 individuals with moderate CKD and examined how lubiprostone affected kidney health. When compared with participants who received a placebo, those given 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone experienced a slower decline in kidney function. This finding was based on changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a standard measure used to evaluate kidney performance.

The scientists also explored why the drug had this protective effect. They determined that lubiprostone boosts the production of spermidine, a compound that enhances mitochondrial activity by encouraging the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Improved mitochondrial function was linked to a renoprotective effect that helped limit additional kidney damage.

Next Steps and Potential for Personalized CKD Treatment

The team plans to expand their investigation through a Phase 3 clinical trial involving a larger group of participants. They also aim to identify biomarkers that could help predict which patients are most likely to benefit. Their long-term objective is to tailor treatment strategies to each person with CKD. This approach represents a significant shift from current CKD therapies, which focus mainly on lowering uremic toxins.

Overall, the findings indicate that certain laxatives may help slow the progression of kidney deterioration. This concept could also open doors to new treatments for conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Details of the study were published in the scientific journal Science Advances.

Earth's ancient sky may have played a larger role in the beginnings of life than scientists once believed.

According to a study published Dec. 1 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from CU Boulder and their collaborators report that billions of years ago, the young planet's atmosphere may have been generating sulfur-based molecules that are known today as important components for life.

This discovery challenges the long-standing idea that these sulfur molecules formed only after life had already taken hold on Earth.

""Our study could help us understand the evolution of life at its earliest stages,"" said first author Nate Reed, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA who conducted the research while working in the Department of Chemistry and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU Boulder.

Sulfur's Importance and Why the Findings Matter

Sulfur, much like carbon, is a vital element found in every form of life, from bacteria to humans. It appears in certain amino acids, which serve as the basic building blocks of proteins.

Although sulfur was present in the early atmosphere, most scientists believed that organic sulfur molecules, such as amino acids, arose only after living organisms were already present and producing them.

Earlier attempts to simulate early Earth conditions often failed to generate meaningful amounts of sulfur biomolecules before life existed. When these molecules did appear, they formed only under unusual or highly specific conditions that were unlikely to have been common across the planet.

Because of this background, the scientific community reacted strongly when the James Webb Space Telescope detected dimethyl sulfide, a sulfur compound produced by marine algae on present-day Earth, in the atmosphere of an exoplanet called K2-18b. Many considered it a possible sign of life.

New Experiments Reveal Atmospheric Chemistry at Work

However, previous work by Reed and senior author Ellie Browne, a chemistry professor and CIRES fellow, showed that dimethyl sulfide could form naturally in the lab using only light and simple atmospheric gases. This indicated that the molecule might appear even on worlds without life.

In their latest experiment, Browne, Reed, and their team tested what Earth's early sky might have been capable of producing. They illuminated a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen to recreate atmospheric conditions from before life emerged.

Working with sulfur is challenging, Browne noted. The element sticks to laboratory equipment, and in the atmosphere, sulfur-based molecules are present at extremely low levels compared to CO2 and nitrogen. ""You have to have equipment that can measure incredibly tiny quantities of the products,"" she said.

Using a very sensitive mass spectrometer to identify and measure chemical compounds, the researchers discovered that their early Earth simulation produced a wide range of sulfur biomolecules. These included the amino acids cysteine and taurine, along with coenzyme M, which plays a key role in metabolism.

A Sky Capable of Supporting a Growing Ecosystem

The team then estimated how much cysteine an entire ancient atmosphere might generate. Their calculations suggested that early Earth's sky could have produced enough cysteine to support about one octillion (one followed by 27 zeros) cells. By comparison, modern Earth contains roughly one nonillion (one followed by 30 zeros) cells.

""While it's not as many as what's present now, that was still a lot of cysteine in an environment without life. It might be enough for a budding global ecosystem, where life is just getting started,"" Reed said.

The researchers propose that these atmospheric biomolecules may have fallen to the surface through rainfall, potentially delivering the chemistry needed to help life begin.

""Life probably required some very specialized conditions to get started, like near volcanoes or hydrothermal vents with complex chemistry,"" Browne said. ""We used to think life had to start completely from scratch, but our results suggest some of these more complex molecules were already widespread under non-specialized conditions, which might have made it a little easier for life to get going.""

Retraction to: Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07219-0 Published online 17 April 2024

The authors have retracted this paper for the following reasons: post-publication, the results were found to be sensitive to the removal of one country, Uzbekistan, where inaccuracies were noted in the underlying economic data for the period 1995–1999. Furthermore, spatial auto-correlation was argued to be relevant for the uncertainty ranges. The authors corrected the data from Uzbekistan for 1995–1999 and controlled for data source transitions and higher-order trends as present in the Uzbekistan data. They also accounted for spatial auto-correlation. These changes led to discrepancies in the estimates for climate damages by mid-century, with an increased uncertainty range (from 11–29% to 6–31%) and a lower probability of damages diverging across emission scenarios by 2050 (from 99% to 90%).

The authors acknowledge that these changes are too substantial for a correction, leading to the retraction of the paper. An updated version of the paper with these changes, which has yet to undergo peer review, is publicly available with continued open access to its data and methodology (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15984134). The authors intend to submit a revised version of the paper for peer review. If and when published, this retraction note will be updated to include a link to the new publication. The authors appreciate the corrective role of the global scientific community and thank Thomas Bearpark, Dylan Hogan, Solomon Hsiang and Christof Schötz for bringing these issues to their attention. All authors agree to this retraction.

Under a light microscope, brain cells called astrocytes look star-shaped. Credit: Nancy Kedersha/Science Photo Library

For decades, neuroscientists focused almost exclusively on only half of the cells in the brain. Neurons were the main players, they thought, and everything else was made up of uninteresting support systems.

By the 2010s, memory researcher Inbal Goshen was beginning to question that assumption. She was inspired by innovative molecular tools that would allow her to investigate the contributions of another, more mysterious group of cells called astrocytes. What she discovered about their role in learning and memory excited her even more.

The computers that run on human brain cells

At the beginning, she felt like an outsider, especially at conferences. She imagined colleagues thinking, “Oh, that's the weird one who works on astrocytes,” says Goshen, whose laboratory is at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A lot of people were sceptical, she says.

But not any more. A rush of studies from labs in many subfields are revealing just how important these cells are in shaping our behaviour, mood and memory. Long thought of as support cells, astrocytes are emerging as key players in health and disease.

“Neurons and neural circuits are the main computing units of the brain, but it's now clear just how much astrocytes shape that computation,” says neurobiologist Nicola Allen at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, who has spent her career researching astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells, collectively called glial cells. “Glial meetings are now consistently oversubscribed.”

As far back as the nineteenth century, scientists could see with their simple microscopes that mammalian brains included two major types of cell — neurons and glia — in roughly equal numbers.

Twentieth-century technologies generated most of the excitement around neurons. Researchers studying the cells' electrical activity showed how they create the complex networks that underlie all brain functions.

When neurons are activated, electrical signals zap down their length at lightning speed, causing their synapses to release chemical neurotransmitters. Some of these, such as glutamate, excite neighbouring neurons, whereas others, such as GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), inhibit them. The development of a technique called patch clamping in the 1970s and 1980s, in which electrodes are inserted into individual cells to measure the flow of ions across membranes, let researchers probe this neurotransmission in unprecedented detail.

By contrast, glial cells seemed to be electrically silent and were dismissed as dull by most researchers. Some glia, called oligodendrocytes, coat and insulate neurons. Others, the microglia, provide the brain's immune system. The many functions of astrocytes proved more elusive.

Although few brain scientists focused on astrocytes until well into the 2000s, some fundamental discoveries were made before that1. Under the light microscope, astrocytes look star-shaped, stretching between neurons and tiny blood vessels in the brain. They signal blood vessels to increase or decrease their flow according to neuronal activity and extract oxygen and other life-giving molecules from the blood to ship to neurons. They clear up waste products from around the synapses and regulate ion levels there. They extract glutamate from around the neurons to stop the excitatory circuits from going into overdrive, break the neurotransmitter down and then return its building blocks to the neurons.

Astrocytes started to look more interesting when it became possible to measure calcium movements in cells. Those measurements revealed that astrocytes use fluctuations in their calcium levels to signal to each other and to other cells in response to certain molecules in their environment, such as an excess of neurotransmitters (see ‘Signals from the stars'). These calcium signals, which move slowly compared with those that pass between neurons, turn out to have big consequences. They drive many activities, including the release of further signalling molecules, ions, metabolites and other factors that affect how neurons, other glial cells and blood vessels behave.



Because many of the signalling molecules are neurotransmitters, a small group of researchers in the 2010s began to wonder whether astrocytes might contribute to ultrafast electrical transmission in neurons. But over the past decade or so, ever-more-precise research tools have revealed a different, more complex story. Many scientists who had previously focused exclusively on neurons are now using these tools to investigate how astrocytes contribute to animal physiology and behaviour.

No evidence emerged to support a role for astrocytes in ultrafast neurotransmission. Instead, it is becoming ever clearer that astrocytes orchestrate the molecular mix in the environment around synapses on timescales much slower than neuronal signalling, varying that mix according to brain state — how alert or awake the brain is, for example. This, in turn, can determine whether neurons fire in response to a signal coming across the synapse.

Advances in microscopy have shown just how closely astrocytes are associated with neurons. Beyond their star-shaped core, astrocytes have an intricate architecture with many branches that extend into tiny, delicate structures, called leaflets, that are only tens of nanometres wide. At this resolution, astrocytes, which make up one-quarter of all brain cells, look less like stars and more like bushy spheres, and they fill all the available space between neurons without overlapping with each other2. In the human brain, each astrocyte can contact up to two million synapses. What's more, there are different types of astrocyte in different brain areas3.

This vast reach of astrocytes has profound consequences in the brain, says neuroscientist Baljit Khakh at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Form follows function in biology.” His lab has developed many of the molecular and genetic tools that allow particular calcium signalling pathways in astrocytes to be switched on or off, letting scientists see what each pathway does.

Neurons might transmit the signals that drive brain function, but it is now clear that astrocytes fine-tune those signals by altering the environment around the synapses, says neuroscientist Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That is why it is important to learn about all brain cells, not just the neurons.”

As just one example, astrocytes resolved an open question in the field of circadian biology. How does the body's master clock, a cluster of cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that regulates biological cycles in a roughly 24-hour rhythm, keep its circular loop? “It was a mystery,” says circadian biologist Michael Hastings at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.

The master-clock system is made up almost exclusively of neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and no one could see how a system that apparently does nothing but suppress neuronal activity could create a daily cycle. Biological clocks need a feedback mechanism so that they can generate rhythmic cycles autonomously, without needing an external signal every day to restart them.

Ten years ago, Marco Brancaccio, a postdoctoral researcher working with Hastings, read about a glutamate detector — a fluorescent probe called ‘glue sniffer', or iGluSnFR. Brancaccio proposed using the detector to sniff out any glutamate that might be present in the mouse brain slices the team was studying.

“I told Marco it would be a waste of time, because there wouldn't be any,” recalls Hastings. “Fortunately he ignored me.”

Brancaccio, who is now at Imperial College London, found plenty of glutamate — and to general astonishment, found that its levels were as rhythmic as those of GABA. But whereas the GABA levels were highest during the day, glutamate levels peaked at night4.

“We scratched our heads. Where could that glutamate be coming from?” says Hastings. It didn't take them long to discover through a literature search that the source must be astrocytes, a cell type they hadn't thought much about before.

This set the researchers on a series of ever-more sophisticated experiments. They ultimately concluded that astrocytes support the SCN clock by switching on their uptake systems for GABA by day and turning them off at night4,5.

Particularly intriguing are studies that are revealing how astrocytes support the many subtleties of learning and memory. In one of her first key experiments with the new tools, Goshen and her team were amazed to discover how astrocytes in the brains of mice encode information about the spatial location of rewards. When a mouse had already learnt where to find a water reward, the calcium activity in its astrocytes gradually increased as it approached the reward, the scientists found. But the researchers measured no increase when the mouse moved towards the same reward in a new environment6. The finding raises interesting questions about how astrocytes are involved in the encoding of spatial memory.

Earlier this year, groups in Japan and the United States reported that astrocytes help with the stabilization and recall of memories primed by fear7,8. Because the astrocytes' signals are much slower than the electrical signals of neurons — sometimes developing over hours or even days rather than milliseconds — they are well suited to bridging the time gap between learning and remembering, says neuroscientist Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Centre for Brain Science in Wako, Japan, who led one of the studies. “Think of them as the brain's long-exposure camera: they capture the trace of meaningful events that might otherwise fade too fast.”

Because neurons and astrocytes work together to process information, researchers have started to wonder whether astrocytes drive or exacerbate diseases that have been generally considered to be neuronal.

Preprint sites have long served as the agile speedboat to the lumbering tanker of conventional academic publishing, and that agility allows for bold experimentation. The latest experiment of openRxiv, the non-profit organization in New York City that runs the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories, is perhaps its most provocative yet.

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

Last month, openRxiv announced that it was integrating a reviewing tool driven by artificial intelligence into its preprint sites. The tool, from the start-up company q.e.d Science in Tel Aviv, Israel, offers rapid AI-generated feedback (typically within 30 minutes) on biomedical manuscripts — judging originality, identifying logical gaps and suggesting more experiments and tweaks to the text.

The allure of an AI reviewer is undeniable. For any scientist who has languished for months awaiting a decision, or decoded a snarky remark from a hostile ‘Reviewer #2', an algorithmic alternative sounds like the efficiency upgrade that publishing desperately needs. Large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback in seconds, potentially without conflicts of interest. But there is a big difference between a process that is efficient and one that is valid. As the scientific community starts to embrace AI technology, it must make sure it isn't solving a logistical problem by creating an intellectual one.

Peer review has two purposes. It must validate the majority of routine scientific work — careful studies that test predictions and fill gaps in understanding — by scrutinizing statistics, methods and logical coherence. It must also recognize the rare discovery that introduces anomalous findings or challenges established frameworks, by assessing not whether the rules were followed, but whether they still apply.

Humans can, at least in principle, perform both functions. AI might not. LLMs can check statistics, catch plagiarism and verify citations; this contribution alone could be transformative. If routine work is offloaded to a computer, human attention — the scarcest resource in science — can be reserved for what matters most. But LLMs have limits, too. Trust an AI reviewer beyond those guard rails, and it might quickly become a liability.

Scientists hide messages in papers to game AI peer review

Scientists hide messages in papers to game AI peer review

The first problem is one of regression to the mean. Human peer review can be an exercise in statistical sampling in which (usually) three specialists provide distinct data points, with the editor attempting a convergence. AI collapses this process: rather than sampling, it outputs the average reviewer's assessment. By using GPT-4 to generate comments on papers, a 2024 study confirmed that the LLM was excellent at predicting what the average reviewer would say (W. Liang et al. NEJM AI https://doi.org/g88s5h; 2024). But there's more to this than finding the average.

Spatial transcriptomics lacks standardized metrics for evaluating imaging-based in situ hybridization technologies across sites. In this study, we generated the Spatial Touchstone (ST) dataset from six tissue types across several global sites with centralized sectioning, analyzed on both Xenium and CosMx platforms. These platforms were selected for their widespread use and distinct chemistries. We assessed reproducibility, sensitivity, dynamic ranges, signal-to-noise ratio, false discovery rates, cell type annotation and congruence with single-cell profiling. This study offers ST standardized operating procedures (STSOPs) and an open-source software, SpatialQM, enabling evaluation of samples across all technical metrics and direct imputation of cell annotations. The generated imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data repository comprises 254 spatial profiles, incorporating both public and newly generated ST datasets in a web-based application, which enables analysis and comparison of user data against an extensive collection of imaging-based datasets. Finally, we establish best practices and metrics to evaluate and integrate imaging-based multi-omics data from single cells into spatial transcriptomics to spatial proteomics.

Spatial omics technologies provide insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of tissues, with a level of detail that is now as low as 5 nm1,2,3. However, there is a need for improved accessibility, scalable analytical tools and standardized practices across experimental design, data generation and interpretation4,5.

The absence of broadly adopted standards and the variability in data quality across platforms complicate efforts to compare results across studies, thus obstructing the development of a unified framework for evaluating spatial data6,7. Benchmarking studies thus far have laid important groundwork but often rely on public datasets not optimized for cross-comparisons8,9, with a limited number of samples10, focused on a restricted range of tissue types8,11 or lacking replicates10,12,13,14 and matched single-cell references. The absence of standardized methodologies across all samples and of cross-institutional, multi-site comparisons in these studies limit their broader applicability and impact, similar to development and benchmarking of microarrays and sequencing methods (for example, MAQC/SEQC)15,16,17. These limitations underscore a need for more systematic strategies to assess reproducibility and performance in spatial omics.

To address these gaps, the ST project was established as a multi-site, multi-platform initiative to evaluate imaging-based spatial transcriptomics technologies. Important components of this effort include the use of harmonized procedures developed collaboratively and implemented across institutions, which we term STSOPs; the establishment of quality metrics through an accessible open-source software package, SpatialQM; and the development of a web-friendly data repository, the Spatial Touchstone Portal (STP), for users to assess in real time the quality of their experimental run.

SpatialQM, an open-source software package for metrics that users can adapt into their quality control analysis locally, enables researchers to evaluate their own experiments using technical benchmarks derived from the ST dataset. STP is an interactive resource that hosts, to our knowledge, at present the largest curated repository of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics datasets and generates metrics using SpatialQM. The STP encompasses comprehensive technical, biological and reproducibility metrics and provides immediate access to quality assessments for approximately 33 million cells and approximately 7 billion high-quality transcripts, drawn from both publicly available (PUB) datasets and newly generated ST datasets. STP also allows users to upload and compare their own datasets against ST and PUB datasets, contributing to a growing, community-driven repository of quality metrics. Through STSOPs, SpatialQM and STP, we aim not only to address technical variabilities inherent in spatial omics but also to promote standardization of experimental and analytical practices4,18,19. This initiative is poised to bridge gaps in data comparability and platform evaluation, ultimately advancing reproducibility and accelerating progress in the field.

To evaluate technical performance, we first focused on data from the Xenium (10x Genomics) and CosMx SMI (Bruker Spatial Biology) platforms—the two commercial spatial imaging systems with subcellular resolution (50–100 nm) and high-depth multiplexing for RNA and proteins available across all three sites. Using SOPs and protocols from sample preparation to data production, we assessed accuracy, precision, reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity within and between sites. These metrics were evaluated through serial sections from six tissue types (across two conditions: normal and cancerous), using predesigned panels for RNA and protein (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Tables 1–3 and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). The ST dataset profiles more than 8 million cells (with counts ranging from 3,624 to 321,482,112 per sample and a median of 71,296 cells). The ST dataset includes profiles from tissue sections comprising tissue microarrays (TMAs) and whole sections (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2b, Supplementary Table 2 and https://spatialtouchstone.org). Additionally, we curated all PUB spatial imaging data on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, accounting for the Xenium, CosMx and MERSCOPE platforms, totaling approximately 33 million cells and approximately 7 billion transcripts. The ST dataset specifically consists of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples including normal (appendix, colon, pancreas and ileum) and cancerous (breast and prostate) tissues. Except for breast cancer samples, which were serially sectioned and profiled in duplicates at a single site (University of Adelaide (UoA)), all other tissue samples in the ST project were serially sectioned at their respective originating institutions. This centralized sectioning approach ensured consistency in techniques and minimized variability that could arise from multiple handling procedures. Samples were subsequently profiled across multiple institutions. To maintain sample integrity and reduce potential degradation, all slides were processed within a 1−3-week window. All samples were analyzed on both Xenium and CosMx imaging-based platforms, generating 77 profiles, and subjected to FFPE single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) (snPATHO-seq, n = 6) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (n = 44) (n = 126 total). The PUB dataset includes both fresh-frozen and FFPE tissue samples from the brain, kidney, lymph node, skin, pancreas, lung, breast, colon, larynx, liver, ovary, prostate, uterus and nerve (n = 177; 131 human and 46 mouse) that have been profiled in Xenium, CosMx or MERSCOPE platforms. Despite the PUB dataset containing a larger number of tissue profiling experiments, samples had fewer cells profiled compared to those from the ST dataset. The STP comprises both the ST and PUB datasets, featuring human cells (n = 22,963,452) and mouse cells (n = 10,572,065) containing both FFPE cells (n = 23,852,502) across 14 different tissue types and fresh-frozen cells (n = 9,693,015) across 3 different tissue types. The STP provides access to approximately 13.833 million cells and a total of approximately 2.3 billion high-quality transcripts (Fig. 1a,b). All graphics within the STP web interface allow users to visualize data comparisons across three categories: ALL (combined PUB and ST), PUB and ST. These options enable detailed cross-comparisons, allowing researchers to probe their sample data against different tissue types or platforms, including Xenium, CosMx and MERSCOPE.

a, Schematic overview of the ST workflow. Tissue samples from normal ileum, appendix, colon and pancreas and from breast (BR) tumors and prostate (PR) tumors were collected for analysis. ST tissue samples were obtained from two independent sites: Site 1 and Site 2. Serial sections from the same FFPE blocks were processed and analyzed using two imaging-based spatial transcriptomics platforms, Xenium and CosMx, across three sites—Site1 (UoA), Site2 (WCM) and Site3 (SJH)—with an additional experimental run at 10x Genomics headquarters (Site 4; 10x Genomics). b, Representation of ST and PUB datasets and tissue types, including breast (BR), brain, pancreas (Panc.), lung, appendix (App.), ileum (Ile.), prostate (Pr.), colon (Col.), lymph node, kidney and skin. c,d, Metrics comparison (normalized TPN and SNR (c), and TPC, TPA, Entropy and MECR (d)) separated by platforms (ST dataset alone) (c) and by tissue and data type (d).

Source data

To establish the technical performance metrics across assays, various parameters were first assessed at the transcript level. The sensitivity of the overall assay was evaluated by comparing the total number of transcripts (transcripts per cell (TPC)) to the total number of targets (Fig. 1d). In the ST dataset, transcript level varied from 0.07 to 0.95 normalized TPC with a mean of 0.29 ± 0.24 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24−0.35) across all tissue types. The PUB dataset, however, recorded up to 2.81 TPC with a mean of 0.82 ± 0.55 (95% CI: 0.72−0.90). Among normal tissues within the ST datasets, pancreas samples exhibited the highest TPC paired with the highest variance (mean of 0.44 ± 0.33 (95% CI: 0.32−0.57)). For ST cancer samples, breast tissue showed the highest mean at 0.33 normalized TPC. In the PUB datasets, pancreas tissue again had the highest mean number of TPC (266), consistent with high overall gene expression20. To ascertain transcript distribution across samples, the total number of transcripts per area (TPA, μm2) was calculated, normalizing the mean number of transcripts in a given cell area to the target gene panel size. The ST dataset TPA average was 1.4 ± 0.72 (95% CI: 1.22−1.55), peaking at 3.4 TPA, whereas the PUB dataset TPA average was 0.5 ± 0.60 (95% CI: 0.41−0.61), peaking at 1.8 TPA.

Cell size and cell segmentation can significantly impact these above metrics; therefore, normalized transcripts per nucleus (TPN) calculations were introduced to account for signals within the nucleus, independent of cell segmentation (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). TPN is calculated by dividing the observed number of transcripts within nuclei by the number of cells. An average TPN of 20 indicates that 20 transcripts were detected within the nuclei segmentation mask of a given imaging-based platform. The ST dataset showed a TPN range from 18 to 257, with an average of 73 ± 52.86 (95% CI: 61.02−85.01), whereas the PUB datasets ranged from 3.4 to 779, with an average of 91.43 ± 100 (95% CI: 75−108). Notably, high TPN, TPC and TPA values in the PUB dataset were primarily driven by a single sample with whole-transcriptome profiling, which highlights the ability of these metrics to find outlier samples.

The variability in metrics such as TPC, TPA and TPN is influenced by the choice of imaging-based platform used for the analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). Within the ST dataset, which consists of serial sections and likely exhibits less variability than the PUB dataset, the CosMx platform demonstrated higher TPN (108.6 ± 60.9 (95% CI: 87.71−129.61)) and TPA (mean = 1.93 ± 0.66 (95% CI: 1.70−2.16)), whereas the Xenium platform showed superior TPC (mean = 0.4 ± 0.28 (95% CI: 0.30−0.48)). In the PUB dataset, MERSCOPE showed a normalized TPC (0.12 ± 1.66 (95% CI: 0.56−0.81)) and TPA (1.88 ± 2.96 (95% CI: 0.2−5.42)).

Variations in tissue size—from large sections to partial sections and TMAs—and differences in tissue type, such as healthy versus diseased states (for example, normal versus cancerous tissues and non-infected versus infected tissues), are both critical factors influencing the number of detectable transcripts and cell counts in spatial transcriptomics. For example, smaller tissue sections or TMAs, which are often used for high-throughput or targeted analyses, may yield fewer total detectable transcripts and lower cell counts due to the constrained sample size and limited area for capturing cellular and molecular heterogeneity.

These factors highlight the critical importance of both tissue size and type when designing spatial transcriptomics experiments, and careful consideration of these variables is essential to ensure the robustness, accuracy and interpretability of the resulting data, as each contributes uniquely to the challenges and opportunities in spatial transcriptomics analyses.

A notable example of how sample type and size impact data outcomes is evident in a large COVID lung study within the ST dataset, which predominantly used TMA cores from biopsied patients. These cores recorded the lowest overall cell counts (mean = 1,117.2 ± 598.01 (95% CI: 617.3−1,617.2)), likely due to the constrained sample size and specific pathological conditions of the tissue, affecting cell integrity and transcript detection efficiency. This highlights the crucial role of sample selection and preparation in spatial transcriptomics, which substantially influences the robustness and interpretability of the resulting data, highly affected by the selected field of view (FOV) and surface area.

Probe specificity was then evaluated using the ‘specificityFDR' metric, where a value of 0.05 indicates that, on average, 5% of transcripts per gene are false positives. Our results show that, generally, lower specificityFDR values corresponded to higher experiment or sample quality. In the ST dataset, specificityFDR values ranged from 5.5 × 10−5 to 0.069 (mean = 0.05 ± 0.02 (95% CI: 0.41−0.49)), whereas, in the PUB dataset, values ranged from 8.2 × 10−5 to 0.69 (mean = 0.23 ± 0.21 (95% CI: 0.19−0.26)) (Supplementary Fig. 2), notably highlighting a very broad error range for public datasets.

Next, sample noise levels were evaluated using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic range. The SNR measures the distribution of mean transcript detection versus mean control probes, assessing the extent to which transcripts are detected above noise levels. The SNR for the ST dataset ranged from 0.12 to 0.53 (mean = 0.28 ± 0.08 (95% CI: 0.26−0.30)), and the PUB dataset ranged from 0.01 to 0.90 (mean = 0.33 ± 0.19 (95% CI: 0.30−0.36)) (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Dynamic range reflects the range of expression, with a dynamic range of 3 representing a thousand-fold increase in expression between the largest average of every gene compared to the average of negative control probes; higher values indicate less noise. The dynamic range for the ST dataset ranged from 2.14 to 5.85 (mean = 4.11 ± 1.03 (95% CI: 3.88−4.35)) and ranged from 1.13 to 5.06 (mean = 2.87 ± 1.25 (95% CI: 2.66−3.07)) for the PUB dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Notably, the PUB dataset exhibited a narrower overall range for these metrics, whereas the ST dataset showed lower variance, suggesting greater stability across different tissues and assays. Tissue-specific trends were also observed: the highest SNR in the ST dataset was recorded in breast tissue (mean = 0.37 ± 0.11 (95% CI: 0.27−0.46)), whereas the highest SNR in the PUB dataset was recorded in brain tissue (mean = 0.51 ± 0.23 (95% CI: 0.43−0.59)). For dynamic range, both datasets showed the highest values in pancreas samples (ST: mean = 4.68 ± 0.86, 95% CI: 4.35−5.02; PUB: mean = 4.61 ± 0.44, 95% CI: 2.65−3.01). Variability in SNR and dynamic range was tissue dependent within the ST dataset, with normal tissues such as the appendix showing a narrower range (SNR = 0.11−0.37; dynamic range = 2.14−4.75) compared to cancerous tissues such as breast cancer (SNR = 0.22−0.52; dynamic range = 2.70−5.15). The fraction of transcripts assigned to cells (FTC) was calculated to determine the percentage of transcripts accounted for across the tissue sample after cell segmentation. For instance, an FTC value of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the total transcripts present in the sample are assigned to cells. The FTC for the ST dataset ranged from 0.20 to 1.0 (mean = 0.85 ± 0.20 (95% CI: 0.81−0.90)), whereas, for the PUB dataset, it ranged from 0.02 to 1.0 (mean = 0.87 ± 0.15 (95% CI: 0.85−0.90)) (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the FTC was consistent across datasets. As the STP continues to grow with user-generated datasets, the scale and robustness of spatial transcriptomics will improve, potentially leading to more consistent SNR, dynamic range and FTC values across a wider variety of tissue types and conditions.

The mutually exclusive correlation ratio (MECR) measures the quality of cell segmentation by assessing the rate at which co-expressed genes, which should be exclusive to a specific cell type, are expressed together9. Using a series of marker genes in pairs of cell types, MECR measures how often these genes are co-expressed above a threshold of zero transcripts in the same assigned cell. Of note, this metric, primarily focused on general immuno-oncology profiling, indicates greater specificity of transcript discrimination with lower values. For example, an MECR value of 0.01 indicates that, on average, 1% of all cells co-express genes that should be mutually exclusive. The MECR for the ST dataset ranged from 0.02 to 0.12 (mean = 0.05 ± 0.02 (95% CI: 0.05−0.06)), whereas it ranged from 0.01 to 0.96 (mean = 0.13 ± 0.18 (95% CI: 0.10−0.16)) for the PUB dataset (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3c). Notably, the variability of MECR was higher in the PUB dataset, likely due to differences in tissue types examined, assay consistency, platforms used and procedural variations across different sites. In terms of sample type, MECR variability was more pronounced in normal samples than in cancer samples, with normal sample values ranging from 0.01 to 0.16 (mean = 0.06 ± 0.04 (95% CI: 0.055−0.071)) compared to 0.01 to 0.10 (mean = 0.04 ± 0.02 (95% CI: 0.035−0.046)) for cancer samples. MECR performance also varies with cancer type; it was more effective in breast cancer samples (range, 0.034−0.047) compared to prostate cancer samples (range, 0.028−0.059), where the presence of more infiltrating normal cells could impact the metric (see the ‘Biological quality metrics' subsection).

We then examined several other key metrics for assessing samples. First, the ‘sparsity' value is a measurement of how empty the gene expression matrix is across the gene panel, providing insights into the overall coverage of the target panel in the tissue type used. A sparsity value of 0 indicates that 100% of the matrix contains expressed genes, whereas a value of 0.9 means that 10% of the queried genes are quantified from a sample. For the ST dataset, sparsity values ranged from 0.90 to 0.96 (mean = 0.94 ± 0.01 (95% CI: 0.93−0.94)), whereas, in the PUB dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3c), they ranged from 0.62 to 0.98 (mean = 0.86 ± 0.06 (95% CI: 0.85−0.87)).

Second, we defined the ‘entropy' value, which quantifies uncertainty or randomness in gene expression, with higher values indicating greater variability and lower predictability. For the ST dataset, entropy values ranged from 0.30 to 0.68 (mean = 0.46 ± 0.08 (95% CI: 0.44−0.48)), whereas, in the PUB dataset, they ranged from 0.17 to 2.31 (mean = 0.88 ± 0.38 (95% CI: 0.82−0.95)) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3c).

Third, we quantified ‘complexity' as a measurement of how many genes account for explaining 50% of total counts in the sample, such that a complexity value of 30 means that 30 genes are responsible for half of all the transcripts in the sample. Notably, a normalization by panel size makes the complexity metric (‘normComplexity') comparable betweeen platforms with high variance in panel size. normComplexity metrics for the ST dataset ranged from 0.09 to 0.77 (mean = 0.5 ± 0.15 (95% CI: 0.46−0.53)), whereas, within the PUB dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3c), they ranged from 0.39 to 3.46 (mean = 0.63 ± 0.48 (95% CI: 0.55−0.71)). This metric was comparable across different tissue types within ST, except for pancreas, which had a minimum normComplexity range of 0.09 compared to all other tissue types (minimum range of 0.39).

Furthermore, the complexity and entropy metrics were influenced by the platform used. This is related to previous observation that Xenium has higher TPN despite the high SNR (Fig. 1c,d). For the ST samples analyzed with the CosMx platform, complexity and entropy values were consistently higher than those processed on the Xenium platform, specifically with these probe sets. Specifically, normComplexity values ranged from 0.49 to 0.77 (mean = 0.63 ± 0.10 (95% CI: 0.60−0.67)) on CosMx and from 0.09 to 0.49 (mean = 0.39 ± 0.09 (95% CI: 0.36−0.41)) on Xenium.

To perform a comprehensive analysis of reproducibility across both ST and PUB datasets, we scaled all technical metrics for each sample and conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The results indicated that the imaging-based platform used was the largest determinant in differentiating the principal components, not the samples or datasets themselves. Specifically, the Xenium and CosMx samples were distinctly separated by principal component 1 (PC1), which accounted for 34.39% of the total explained variance. Additionally, an outlier was identified in the PUB dataset, which, upon further examination, was attributed to a limited selection of FOVs for the CosMx platform. A comparison of cell counts across each tissue type revealed significant variability between standard H&E counts and those from both imaging platforms. Although there are differences in cell segmentation algorithms, resulting in varying cell counts, the ability of the platforms to detect broad cell types remains largely unaffected. This consistency is particularly evident because many of these signals concentrate in the nuclear area (Fig. 2c,d). H&E staining generally provides a more accurate cell count because it does not depend on various combinations of cell membrane segmentation markers. We found the cell counts through cell segmentation to be consistent between H&E and Xenium, whereas CosMx cell counts were consistent with the other platforms depending on the tissue type. For example, we observed the number of cells in prostate tissues to be consistent across technology with, on average, 86,588 cells from H&E, 100,794 cells from Xenium and 97,209 cells from CosMx. This variability underscores the importance of careful interpretation of any metrics derived from imaging-based spatial transcriptomics platforms, as they heavily rely on the accuracy of the cell membrane markers (Supplementary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 5).

All metrics for ST and PUB datasets are shown, which represent all conditions (normal, cancer and disease) and species (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus). Metrics include fraction of Tx per cell (CellTxFraction; orange), DynamicRange (yellow), SNR (SigNoiseRatio; green), TxPerCellNorm (purple), specificityFDR (gray) and Panel size (dark blue). FDR, false discovery rate; Norm, normalized; Tx, transcripts.

Source data

The ST project provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into reproducibility between the same tissue type (in this case, breast cancer) from different studies and datasets (ST and PUB) across imaging-based transcriptomics platforms (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Figs. 3d,e and 4). A total of six breast cancer samples were used for comparison: four sequential sections from two samples in the ST dataset (profiled in duplicates, with two sections from two samples on Xenium and two sections from two samples on CosMx) and four samples from the PUB dataset (three on Xenium and one on CosMx). For the ST samples, a total of 3,016,015 cells were detected across all spatial profiles, with an average of 377,000 ± 83,807 cells per section (95% CI: 306,937−447,066). By contrast, the PUB samples had a total of 1,393,890 cells across all spatial profiles, with an average of 348,472 ± 213,783 (95% CI: 8,295−688,649) cells per section profiled. Although the average number of cells profiled was similar between the two groups, more PUB samples were processed on the Xenium platform than on CosMx.

The FTC for the ST dataset ranged from 0.20 to 1.0 (mean = 0.85 ± 0.20 (95% CI: 0.80−0.90)), whereas it ranged from 0.02 to 1.0 (mean = 0.87 ± 0.15 (95% CI: 0.85−0.90)) for the PUB dataset. The mean FTC for the ST dataset is likely more representative of metrics commonly observed by general users. The specificityFDR for the ST dataset ranged from 0.045 to 0.060 (mean = 0.05 ± 0.02 (95% CI: 0.041−0.048)), and it ranged from 8.24 × 10−5 to 0.7 (mean = 0.23 ± 0.21 (95% CI: 0.19−0.26)) for the PUB dataset. These values indicate that the specificityFDR was similar across breast tissue for both datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3c). The variance in entropy was much higher for the PUB dataset, ranging from 0.58 to 1.03 (mean = 0.75 ± 0.2 (95% CI: 0.43−1.05)) compared to the ST dataset, which ranged from 0.40 to 0.68 (mean = 0.55 ± 0.1 (95% CI: 0.46−0.62)), showing lower variability (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

To establish the variability across the data, spatial autocorrelation was calculated for every sample using Moran's I statistic21. Only the common genes between the two platforms and all samples (n = 203) were selected (Fig. 3). The mean Moran's I scores were 0.080 and 0.144 for ST and PUB datasets, respectively (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). The standardized effect size for each metric across ST and PUB datasets is shown (Supplementary Fig. 3a) to understand the technical variability between cohorts and tissue types profiled in both. These observations highlight the reproducibility and consistency of metrics in spatial transcriptomics, which likely result from more controlled sampling and experimental design in the ST dataset. Overall, the ST breast cancer dataset demonstrated greater consistency across all metrics compared to the PUB breast dataset, yet their mean values remained similar (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3c). This underscores the necessity of comprehensive technical evaluations to assess the accuracy of experimental assays. Overall, although the metrics exhibit platform-dependent variability, they remain relatively stable overall, with the ST dataset exhibiting greater uniformity than the PUB dataset. This underscores the value of SOPs within the STSOP framework (Supplementary Fig. 3a,c).

This unique experimental design allowed us to evaluate the reproducibility of these assays. Serial sections sequentially processed within the same institute highlight the consistency of both Xenium and CosMx platforms. Data from both prostate (n = 1) and breast (n = 2) tumors had negligible variation in mean transcript quantifications across the entire range of detection (r = 1.00, n = 3 total) (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12a). Adjacent tissue sections, shipped and processed at independent sites, yielded highly consistent data, with correlation coefficients typically exceeding 0.95 (mean r = 0.97) (Supplementary Fig. 12b,c).

To further validate the biological relevance of these metrics, we referenced snPATHO-seq data from the prostate samples as a cell-specific benchmark (Fig. 3) and annotated cell types for all 12 assays. Our analysis confirmed that 100% of cell types (n = 12) identified in the reference dataset were represented in all assays, with very similar proportions (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 5). This consistency in cell type identification across assays underscores the accuracy and utility of the ST dataset in capturing the cellular landscapes of tissues, exemplified here by prostate cancer.

To evaluate the accuracy of transcript quantifications from ST platforms, we performed snRNA-seq (snPATHO-seq; Methods) from all the FFPE tissue assessed in this study (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although the snPATHO-seq quantifications are not considered an absolute ground truth, the technology has proven effective in providing robust transcript detection across a broad dynamic range22,23. The isolation of individual cells or nuclei also provides relatively pure reference expression profiles for the cell types assessed, which is crucial for evaluating the extent of segmentation error that can result in mixed transcript profiles.

Several criteria were used to assess the accuracy of ST platforms. Initially, the average transcript abundance for each gene between the snPATHO-seq and ST data for each tissue was compared. Xenium samples consistently showed good correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.78, r = 0.64–0.94) with snPATHO-seq data across its entire dynamic range (Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, CosMx samples had lower correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.60, r = 0.35–0.80) and displayed ubiquitously inflated detection of lowly expressed genes and variably reduced sensitivity for highly abundant transcripts (Fig. 3a,b), aligning with previously noted variation in dynamic range (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

However, comparing mean expression across a tissue can be misleading because although noise tends to distribute evenly throughout the tissue, marker transcripts for rare cell types may be highly abundant in individual cells and yet have low mean counts across the tissue. To address this, the consistency of detected expression profiles within individual cell types was evaluated using matched snPATHO-seq data as a reference for supervised cell type annotation using InSituType24. Further supporting the reproducibility of these platforms, we note that replicate samples frequently exhibit similar cell type proportions with these predictions (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). The correlation of cell type expression patterns was consistent with those of the bulk tissue. Xenium performed consistently well with a mean cell type correlation coefficient of 0.78 (r = 0.48–0.95). Although some CosMx samples, such as breast cancer sample 2 (BR_2: replicate 1, Spearman's ρ = 0.80; replicate 2, Spearman's ρ = 0.76), correlated reasonably well, the variability across samples was notably higher (mean = 0.57, r = 0.25–0.80) (Fig. 3b).

Cell segmentation poses another major challenge that impacts the accuracy of transcript quantifications—imprecise cell boundaries can lead to transcript misassignment from adjacent cells, producing ‘mixed' transcriptomic profiles. Although metrics such as MECR can detect co-detection of mutually exclusive transcripts, they do not fully account for transcript misassignment, which can distort detected expression. To better understand the impact of segmentation errors, each cell was treated as a mix of pure cell types, and their profiles were decomposed using robust cell type decomposition (RCTD)25 with the snPATHO-seq data as a reference. This approach revealed that deconvolution weights are sensitive to any factor negatively affecting the correlation of the ST quantifications with the cell type reference. In samples with high levels of noise, these weights may not solely reflect segmentation error (Fig. 3c).

The comparison of Xenium data with snPATHO-seq also provided insights into the impact of the different segmentation strategies on the accuracy of transcriptional profiles. The prostate cancer sample was also subjected to Xenium In Situ Gene Expression (Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel) with cell segmentation staining-based nuclear (DAPI), cytoplasmic (18S rRNA, αSMA/vimentin) and membrane (TP1A1/E-cadherin/CD45) staining. For this sample, three segmentation approaches were compared: nuclear expansion at varying distances, staining-based morphology segmentation and Proseg26, which infers plausible cell boundaries based on the spatial distribution of transcripts.

As anticipated, TPC increased as a function of nuclear expansion distance (Fig. 3d). However, increased expansion distances can result in transcript misassignment, as evidenced by elevated MECR values and decreased cell type purity after cell type decomposition (Fig. 3d). Tissue stroma is particularly problematic as it comprises diverse cell types—for example, fibroblast transcripts often contaminated annotated immune cells (Fig. 3e). Despite these challenges, the extent of transcript misassignment suggested by cell type decomposition remains modest: if we assume that decomposition weights purely reflect transcript assignment due to segmentation, the median extent of error (1 − dominant annotation weight) is only 14% for the common 15-µm expansion for Xenium data. Cell type annotation is also robust against these errors, producing effectively identical annotations for all segmentation strategies (Supplementary Fig. 7). Nuclear segmentation alone provided higher cell type purity but at the cost of a dramatic reduction in transcript assignment (43.3 versus 81.6 TPC with 5-µm expansion). The staining-based morphology segmentation, or ‘multimodal' approach, struck a balance by producing high-purity profiles while retaining higher TPC (74.6 per cell) (Fig. 3d).

Proseg demonstrated that high-quality segmentation could be performed without reliance on staining strategies to detect cellular compartments. Proseg uses cell simulation to infer morphologically plausible cell boundaries based on the localization of cell transcripts. Its segmentation resulted in the highest purity (MECR: 0.029; median maximum decomposition weight: 0.97) and 1.7× more TPC than multimodal segmentation (128.3 versus 74.6) (Fig. 3d). Clustering the resulting expression profiles also produced clusters that were more distinct than those from other segmentation approaches, with the highest mean silhouette width and cluster neighborhood purity (Fig. 3f). Although clustered data from each segmentation approach reasonably reflected cell type annotations, Proseg proved ideal for data where cell typing is performed by clustering rather than label transfer approaches. Together, this supports that segmentation approaches informed by regional transcript patterns may ultimately outperform those based on protein stains and morphological heuristics, such as nuclear expansion.

The ability to extract biological insight from spatial transcriptomics data is majorly influenced by the technical performance of the platforms used and preparation methods. To investigate this, we evaluated the ability of these platforms to perform several common tasks across datasets with varying quality characteristics. Specifically, we assessed the detection of diverse cell types throughout tissues, determined the extent to which both coarse and fine tissue organization can be resolved and evaluated the potential to predict intercellular signaling based on localized expression of ligands and their cognate receptors.

For coarse cell typing, which minimally requires confident detection of cell-type-specific marker transcripts, it is plausible to assume that this task can tolerate some level of noise from off-target probe hybridization and segmentation error, provided that the dynamic range of marker transcripts is sufficiently high27,28. Our initial analysis focused on cell type marker detection within tissue structures with well-defined cellular organization. This included histologically confirmed blood vessels in a prostate adenocarcinoma sample, the mucosa of the appendix and the interface of malignant cells with healthy hepatocytes in a metastatic breast cancer sample (Supplementary Fig. 8). The high sensitivity of the Xenium platform facilitated robust transcript detection of all marker genes assessed, clearly demarcating relevant tissue structures (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Despite lower sensitivity in the CosMx data, highly expressed genes such as ACTA2 in fibroblasts from prostate tumors and APOC1 in hepatocytes from breast cancer metastasis still resolved tissue structure. Cell types defined by markers with inherently lower expression, such as LGR5 in intestinal stem cells or PECAM1 in endothelial cells, were not clearly identifiable (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9).

a, Left: visualization of tissue structure from adjacent prostate tumor samples with each cell type uniquely colored by technology (Xenium and CosMx). This provides a direct view of the cellular composition and spatial organization within the tissue. Right: expression of PECAM1 (endothelial) and ACTA2 (smooth muscle) in a region with defined blood vessels (marked by black box on left).

We demonstrated that data of varying quality can yield similar proportions of predicted cell types using automated annotation methods but that the correlation of annotated cells with single-cell nuclei sequencing references can vary (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Generally, these annotations capture similar high-level tissue organization across all datasets despite quality differences (Supplementary Figs. 6–10). Major cell types are annotated in similar tissue areas of the tissue, and tissue domains are identified using spatial clustering methods (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 10). To further explore whether technical variation introduces more subtle errors in cell type annotation, we quantified the purity of cell type annotations within neighborhoods of the PCA embedding from transcript quantifications. Accurately annotated cells of a given type are assumed to have a high degree of transcriptional similarity, whereas ambiguous annotations will not be transcriptionally distinct from other cell types. The average neighborhood purity correlated directly with quality metrics, indicating that these metrics influence the ability to distinctly resolve expected cell types from the reference annotations (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10c). For instance, various cell types, such as lymphocytes, consistently exhibit lower purity in CosMx samples. This suggests that these annotated cells are not transcriptionally consistent, potentially indicating misannotation and needed improvements. This issue was apparent in the prostate tumor samples analyzed with CosMx, where annotated T/natural killer cells were diffusely distributed throughout the tissue but lacked the sensitive detection of marker transcripts observed in the Xenium samples of the same tissue (Fig. 4e). However, this reduced purity may also reflect the ability of the platform to capture heterogeneous cell types and detect diverse cellular states, characterized by an increased diversity of transcripts, even if it compromises sensitivity.

We next sought to address an important unanswered question in the field: ‘How does spatial transcriptomics correlate with spatial proteomics?' For this analysis, the Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel (377-plex, Xenium) was used for transcriptomics, and the Human Immuno-Oncology Panel (64-plex, CosMx) was used for proteomics. Like our approach in transcriptomics, technical metrics were derived to assess multi-omic features from RNA to protein. For this study, a total of 24 samples were used, comprising 23 normal tissues and one cancerous tissue. The tissue types for the ST multi-omics dataset included four appendix samples, three colon samples, four ileum samples, 12 pancreas samples and one prostate cancer sample. For the statistical measurements, we assessed total nuclei count (TNC), fluorescence per cell (FPC), complexity, entropy, sparsity and SNR (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 11).

Source data

Although TNC is not a direct measurement of sample quality, it can be a quick and useful metric to assess sample representation. However, the other metrics demonstrate more accurately sample quality. For spatial proteomic profiling, TNC ranged almost eight-fold, from 11,661 to 82,123 (mean = 49,579.58, s.d. = 18,764.04). Similar to spatial transcriptomics, TNC was most dependent on nuclei identification, tissue and FOV size, with TMAs having smaller TNC than whole sections. We then used FPC to measure the efficiency of antibodiesʼ ability to bind to cells across all markers, leveraging the total unfiltered fluorescence expressed within each cell. In the ST dataset, FPC ranged from 2,379 to 7,649 (mean = 4,109 ± 1,188). The FPC varied with tissue type; differences were observed among colon (mean = 4,440, s.d. = 1,212), ileum (mean = 4,204, s.d. = 952), pancreas (mean = 3,641, s.d. = 740) and prostate (2,379). Low values for this metric may indicate a lower expression level of the target fluorescent marker in the cells of that tissue type, which is useful for highlighting targets that might require orthogonal methods of quantification, differential labeling or tissues with unusual density profiles (Fig. 5a).

The multi-omics integrative analysis to interrogate RNA and protein was conducted in two distinct stages. Initially, cell phenotyping was performed using the in situ RNA spatial transcriptomics breast cancer sample with corresponding reference data obtained via snPATHO-seq (Fig. 5b,c). Concurrently, the same tissue sample analyzed for protein expression using the CosMx platform was subjected to normalization using a centered log-ratio approach, and cells exhibiting low expression across all proteins (n = 62) were systematically filtered out (Fig. 5b).

After normalization, PCA was performed on the top 50 principal components, with those 50 principal components used to calculate the relationships between cells, setting the number of neighbors at 30. Subsequently, cells were clustered using the Leiden algorithm with a resolution of 0.5, resulting in the identification of 17 distinct clusters. To integrate both modalities, MaxFuse, a method that leverages corresponding and weakly linked features from each modality, was used. Of the features identified, 27 corresponding to both RNA and protein were retained and used for integration analysis. Throughout the model training stage, labels previously established for each modality (cell annotation RNA and Leiden cluster protein) were used to maintain an agnostic perspective and prevent overfitting, particularly by avoiding reliance on unverified protein annotations. The integration results revealed a significant overlap between RNA and protein modalities in the derived embedded space (Fig. 5d). Notably, smooth muscle cells were overrepresented in the RNA data (Fig. 5e), whereas epithelial cell types showed good alignment across multiple clusters originating from the protein modality. This alignment suggests that these cell types were successfully profiled in both assays and can be distinctly identified through clustering. Based on these findings, we propose a downstream approach for cell annotation that uses this joint embedding, which annotates cells within a shared space between RNA and protein, notably enhancing the accuracy and tracing of cell type identification and localization (Fig. 5b–e).

Although spatial transcriptomics has the capacity to profile a larger array of genes, proteomic profiling remains a valuable orthogonal method for validation, capable of resolving several cell types independently. This dual approach underscores the complementary nature of RNA and protein analyses in enhancing the understanding of cellular functions and interactions within complex tissue environments.

This global, multi-institute, multi-platform and multi-assay study evaluates imaging-based spatial transcriptomics technologies through replicated intra-site and inter-site measurements, establishing key metrics across platforms and highlighting complementary strengths and challenges. In this context, the ST dataset demonstrates a narrower technical variability than the more variable PUB dataset. Although the PUB dataset reflects real-world variability, including data from commercial vendors with generally lower specificityFDR values, the ST dataset provides a controlled framework to assess baseline reproducibility in large-scale, standardized studies. The adoption of SOPs, particularly the collaboratively developed STSOPs, significantly reduced variability in the ST dataset relative to the PUB dataset, as evidenced by specificityFDR and SNR measures. These standardized protocols thus enhance reproducibility and comparability across institutions, establishing a unified field standard. Together, the ST and PUB datasets provide a balanced view, combining controlled reproducibility with practical, real-world applicability.

Multi-institutional reproducibility was achieved by the consistent application of the STSOPs, which harmonized sample handling, quality control and data processing workflows (detailed in the Methods). The STSOPs were crucial in mitigating variability and enabling the reliable integration and comparison of data generated across different institutions. However, the centralization of tissue sectioning and initial FFPE processing limited the variability arising from pre-analytical steps, restricting our ability to fully evaluate inter-site differences in tissue handling and sectioning consistency. Future studies incorporating decentralized pre-analytical processing are necessary to capture the full spectrum of inter-institutional variability, including these critical upstream factors.

Key metrics such as FTC and TPC depend heavily on factors such as site, panel size, tissue and platform and require accurate cell segmentation because they do not account for transcripts misassigned outside the tissue regions. Similarly, sparsity and entropy metrics are sensitive to panel specificity and segmentation quality; improper segmentation inflates these values by including transcripts outside cells. Custom panels tailored to specific tissues tend to exhibit the highest sparsity. By contrast, metrics such as MECR, designed to detect misassignment within epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, may not be robust across different tissue types. Therefore, interpreting these metrics requires careful consideration of tissue type, probe panel and platform.

In the ST dataset, cell segmentation was performed using instrument output files to ensure consistent analysis and community benchmarking. Nonetheless, ongoing development aims to improve segmentation algorithms26,29,30,31,32,33, with promising advances in pixel-based, segmentation-free models34,35, that learn tissue features directly from tissue images, bypassing traditional reliance on cell membrane or nuclei markers34,36,37,38,39. These methods could facilitate universal comparison across platforms and tissue types by eliminating platform-specific cell identification dependencies.

Gene panel design strongly influences data quality and interpretability. Although platform providers offer tissue-specific and multi-tissue panels, customizing gene selection and multiplexing level is crucial to address tissue complexity and research objectives. For example, breast cancer samples analyzed with both multi-tissue and a tissue-specific panel showed that the latter yielded lower entropy and higher normalized TPC, demonstrating improved focus and efficiency. Tailoring panels by considering prevalent cell types, gene expression ranges and relevant biological pathways enhances both resource use and analytical clarity.

Validating larger plex panels across diverse settings, including academia, contract research organizations, pharmaceutical companies and core facilities, is crucial for establishing reliable spatial omics standards. However, sample quality remains a critical factor; degraded or poorly preserved tissues can undermine even optimally designed panels, producing incomplete or biased data that obscure biological insights.

The present study represents an initial effort to define foundational metrics to guide users in troubleshooting assay performance, tissue quality, instrumentation and probe design specificity challenges. These guidelines are not rigid thresholds but are expected to evolve as the portal incorporates more data and, hence, becomes more refined, as spatial technology applications expand to include a broader range of tissue types, platforms and experimental contexts.

This study presents several caveats that are important for understanding its context and implications.

Despite the relatively large number of samples, we recognize that it is not exhaustive. Further research with even larger datasets will be necessary to fully validate our findings and methods.

Additionally, we selected two leading technologies specifically as examples of representative, cutting-edge commercial platforms. Our choice of platforms was strategic for our experimental design and was influenced by multiple factors, including the accessibility of the technologies to the expert institutes involved, the availability of off-the-shelf panels suitable for the tissues and sample types (for example, FFPE) used in this study, local technical support, previous expertise with the chosen platforms, comprehensive user guidelines and the reliability of the instruments based on previous runs. All these considerations were aimed at demonstrating best practices. We are confident that, as the field continues to evolve and more comprehensive data become available, the methodologies and metrics developed through this study will be expanded to offer deeper insights into the capabilities of multiple platforms.

Comprehensive documentation of all experimental procedures and protocols (STSOPs) has been deposited at protocols.io (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.261ge54qdg47/v1).

This study used normal and cancerous samples, including normal tissues from the appendix, ileum, colon and pancreas and cancerous tissues from prostate and breast cancers. Normal tissues were collected as part of the Spatial Atlas of Human Anatomy project under strict ethical guidelines, with FFPE blocks prepared by pathologists at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and New York Presbyterian Hospital. Institutional review board approval oversaw their collection. For prostate and breast cancer samples, H&E images were submitted to Histowiz (https://home.histowiz.com/) for evaluation. The prostate cancer sample (PR_1) contained prostatic adenocarcinoma (grade 3 cribriform, focal grade 4, total score grade 7), with surrounding normal tissues, focal inflammation and seminal vesicle involvement. This sample was obtained from a patient who underwent a radical prostatectomy and was provided by the Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource with written consent, complying with ethical protocols approved by the UoA and St. Andrew's Hospital (H-2018-222, no. 80). Breast cancer sample BR_1 displays in situ ductal carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma, with focal inflammation and necrosis. BR_2 was a high-grade metastatic ductal carcinoma infiltrating the liver. Both breast cancer samples were collected with written informed consent under SVH 17/173 protocol (St. Vincent's Hospital Ethics Committee) and X19-0496 for autopsy samples, respectively. Consent allowed for deidentified data publication. Both breast cancer samples were sectioned at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and sent to the UoA for snPATHO-seq and spatial profiling. Tissues were immediately placed on ice, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for 24 hours and then paraffin embedded room temperature. RNA quality was confirmed using a Norgen Biotek FFPE RNA Purification Kit (product ID 25300) and a 5200 Fragment Analyzer with the High Sensitivity RNA Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, DNF-472). DV200 values were 50–70%.

snRNA-seq followed the snPATHO-seq protocol23. Two 30−50-µm-thick scrolls per sample, adjacent to sections for CosMx, Xenium and H&E staining, were dewaxed with xylene (MilliporeSigma, 214736) and rehydrated with sequential ethanol (MilliporeSigma, E7023) immersions. After a wash in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, 11875093), 50–100 µl of digestion mix (RPMI 1640, 1 mg ml−1 Liberase TH; MilliporeSigma, 5401151001) and 1 U µl−1 RNAse Inhibitor (RiboLock RNase Inhibitor; Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0382) was added, and tissue was gently broken into smaller fragments with a 1.5-ml pellet pestle before topping up to 1 ml. Digestion occurred in a thermomixer at 800 r.p.m. After digestion, 400 µl of Ez Lysis Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, NUC-101) was added, mixed and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 250 µl of Ez Lysis Buffer with 2% BSA (MACS BSA stock solution; Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-376) and 1 U µl−1 RNAse Inhibitor, homogeneized and supplemented with 750 µl of the same lysis mix. Samples were filtered through a 70-µm strainer (pluriStrainer Mini 70 µm; pluriSelect, 43-10070-50) and centrifuged and then washed again three times in 1× PBS (Gibco, 70011044) with 1% BSA, followed by two washes in 0.5× PBS (Gibco, 70011044) with 0.02% BSA. Nuclei were resuspended in 500–1,000 µl of the same buffer, filtered through a 40-µm strainer (pluriStrainer Mini 40 µm; pluriSelect, 43-10040-50) and counted using a Luna-FX7 using Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide Stain (Logos). Immediate processing used the Chromium X controller and Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling Reagent Kits for multiplexed samples (Chromium Fixed RNA Kit, Human Transcriptome, PN1000475; Chromium Next GEM Chip Q Single Cell Kit, PN-1000418; Dual Index Kit TS Set A, PN-1000251; 10x Genomics) following user guide CG000527, Rev E. For storage, nuclei suspensions were supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.1× Enhancer (10x Genomics, PN-2000482) and cryopreserved at −80 °C. Hybridization step used 500,000−1.5 million nuclei for 20 hours at 42 °C. Post-hybridization washes were pool-wash setting with an additional wash. Approximately 10,000 nuclei per sample were targeted for capture with an extra pre-amplification polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle. Indexing PCR conditions were tailored to 50–200 nM library concentration. Libraries were quality controlled and quantified using a Fragment Analyzer 5200 (Agilent Technologies) and a Qbit Flex Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Indexed libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system with the following read configuration: read 1: 28, i7: 10, i5: 10 and read 2: 90, aiming for 20,000–30,000 read pairs per nuclei.

CosMx SMI (Bruker Spatial Biology) and the Xenium Analyzer (10x Genomics) platforms were used. Samples were serially sectioned at curation sites (Site 1 and Site 2) and shipped promptly to minimize variations. The prescriptive details and step by step for each assay are outlined in the proceeding sections and can be found in the STSOPs. All methods were used across three institutions: Site 1 (UoA), Site 2 (WCM) and Site 3 (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (STJ)).

Samples were processed per CosMx slide preparation manuals MAN-10159-02 (prostate cancer, Adelaide) and MAN-10184-01-1 (all other tissues). Then, 5-µm sections were placed onto Superfrost Plus Micro Slides (VWR, 48311-703), dried, stored and then incubated overnight at 60 °C. Sections were dewaxed with xylene washes (or CitroSolv for normal tissues) and rehydrated through graded ethanol–water washes, followed by a final rinse in 1× PBS. Slides were dried at 60 °C for 5 minutes. Target Retrieval solution (CosMx FFPE slide preparation kit, RNA) was used in a pressure cooker at 100 °C for 15 minutes, followed by water, ethanol and air drying. Incubation frames were attached, and digestion buffer with 3 µg ml−1 Proteinase K (CosMx FFPE slide preparation kit, RNA) and 1× PBS (AM9922 and AM9625) was applied for 30 minutes. The slides were then rinsed, fiducials (0.001%) applied and fixed in 10% NBF washed with NBF stop buffer and 1× PBS. Next, 100 mM NHS acetate was applied for 15 minutes, followed by 2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) washes. The CosMx Human Universal Cell Characterization RNA Panel (CMX-H-USCP-1KP-R) targeting 950 human genes and a 50-target add-on panel set was denatured and cooled. A probe mix with RNase Inhibitor, Buffer R and nuclease-free water was applied for 17 hours at 37 °C. After incubation, slides were washed with 50% deionized formamide and 2× SSC and then in 2× SSC. DAPI stock (1:40) was applied for 15 minutes, washed with 1× PBS and stained for 1 hour with CD298/B2M, PanCK, CD45 and CD68 antibodies (item numbers 121500020, 121500021 and 121500022). Colon, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TMA, pancreas and prostate cancer samples received 4 µl of CD298/B2M antibody (MAN-10184-01-1), whereas appendix, ileum and prostate cancer received 8 µl of CD298/B2M antibody (MAN-10159-01-1). Slides were washed in 1× PBS and stored in 2× SSC. The pre-bleaching followed Configuration C and cell segmentation Configuration A (except for the HCC TMA, Configuration E). Procedures and FOVs were consistent across all sites: STJ, WCM and UoA.

Samples were processed per CosMx SMI slide preparation manual MAN-10185-01-1 (Bruker Spatial Biology). Then, 5-µm FFPE sections were placed on Superfrost Plus Micro Slides, dried and stored. Slides were baked at 65 °C for 2 hours and then dewaxed with xylene (or CitriSolv) and rehydrated through graded ethanol–water washes, followed by a final rinse in 1× PBS. Pre-heated 1× Target Retrieval solution was used in a pressure cooker at 100 °C for 15 minutes, followed by 1× PBS washes. Incubation frames were attached, and Buffer W was applied for 1 hour in the dark. The Bruker Spatial Biology 64-plex human protein antibody panel was combined with CD298/B2M and PanCK/CD45 segmentation markers in Buffer W. Appendix, ileum and pancreas also received the CD68 segmentation marker. The primary antibody mix was incubated at 4 °C for 17 hours, followed by 1× TBS-T and 1× PBS washes. Fiducials (0.00005%) were applied washes with 1× PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). This was followed by 1× PBS washes. Sections were stained with nuclei stain, washed and incubated with 100 mM NHS acetate and a final 1× PBS wash. Pre-bleaching followed Configuration C and cell segmentation Configuration A. These procedures were uniformly followed at STJ, WCM and UoA. Breast cancer, normal appendix and normal ileum samples processed as part of Bruker Spatial Biology's Technology Access Program followed previously described methods41.

Setup and scan acquisition followed the CosMx SMI Instrument User Manual (MAN-10161-02-1 or MAN-10161-03-2, software version 1.1; Bruker Spatial Biology). Instrument setup was done as previously described41. A new acquisition process was initiated via the CosMx SMI Control Center web interface. Slides were dried, placed in the Flow Cell Assembly Tool and secured. A new flow cell coverslip was aligned and affixed. Then, 2× SSC was introduced to hydrate the tissue. Flow cell configuration data (barcode and slide ID) were entered. Prostate sections were scanned with Configuration C for pre-bleaching and Configuration A for cell segmentation.

Sections for Xenium were prepared according to the Xenium In Situ for FFPE − Tissue Preparation Guide (CG000578 Rev C; 10x Genomics) protocol. In brief, 5-µm sections were cut, floated in an RNAse-free water bath and carefully placed onto the 10.45-mm × 22.45-mm sample area of Xenium slides (10x Genomics, PN-3000941). The slides were then placed on a drying rack at room temperature for 30 minutes to remove excess water. This was followed by a 3-hour incubation at 42 °C on a Xenium Thermocycler Adapter plate, positioned atop the 96-well block of a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with the lid open. Subsequently, the slides were stored overnight at room temperature with a desiccant to facilitate further drying. The slides were then processed following the Xenium In Situ for FFPE Deparaffinization and Decrosslinking protocol (CG000580 Rev C; 10x Genomics). The slides were placed again on a Xenium Thermocycler Adapter plate atop the 96-well block of a thermocycler with the lid open and incubated at 60 °C for 2 hours. They were then equilibrated to room temperature for 7 minutes, deparaffinized and rehydrated by immersion twice in xylene for 10 minutes each, twice in 100% ethanol for 3 minutes each, twice in 96% ethanol for 3 minutes each, once in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes and once in water for 20 seconds. Subsequently, the Xenium slides were assembled into Xenium cassettes and hydrated with 1× PBS. The tissue sections were reverse crosslinked using a decrosslinking buffer containing tissue enhancer, urea and Perm Enzyme B at 80 °C for 30 minutes, followed by three washes with PBS-T. Slides were then immediately processed following the Xenium In Situ Gene Expression User Guide (CG000582 Rev E; 10x Genomics) for the remaining slide preparation steps. In brief, the predesigned gene expression probe set, Xenium Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel (10X-1000626; 10x Genomics), targeting 377 human genes, was used for prostate cancer, ileum, appendix, pancreas and colon samples. For breast cancer samples, the Xenium Human Breast Panel (10X-1000463; 10x Genomics), targeting 380 human genes, was used. Panels were denatured at 95 °C for 2 minutes, crash cooled on ice for 1 minute and then equilibrated to room temperature before being added to the probe hybridization buffer and TE buffer to make the probe hybridization mix. The slides were incubated with the hybridization mix at 50 °C for 17 hours. Slides were washed three times with PBS-T for 1 minute each and then incubated with a post-hybridization wash buffer for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Slides were washed three times with PBS-T for 1 minute each and incubated with ligation mix for 2 hours at 37 °C. Three 1-minute PBS-T washes were followed by a 2-hour incubation at 30 °C with an amplification mix. Slides were then washed three times with TE buffer and then three washes with 1× PBS for 1 minute each, followed by incubation with Reducing Agent B for 10 minutes, washed once in 70% ethanol for 1 minute, washed twice in 100% ethanol and then treated with autofluorescence solution for 10 minutes in the dark. Slides were washed three times with 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each and then dried for 5 minutes at 37 °C before rehydrating with 1× PBS and then PBS-T for 2 minutes. Slides were stained with nuclei staining buffer for 1 minute at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS-T for 1 minute each in the dark. The slides were then assembled into Xenium cassettes and loaded into a Xenium Analyzer for imaging and decoding. These procedures were uniformly followed at UoA (Site1), WCM (Site 2), STJ (Site 3) and 10x Genomics (Site 4), ensuring consistency in the FOVs across all four locations. Breast cancer samples processed as part of the 10x Genomics Catalyst Program followed the methods previously described22; these experiments were carried out at 10x Genomics headquarters in Pleasanton, California. Sections from the prostate cancer samples were also subjected to Xenium multimodal segmentation through an early access program and processed at the 10x Genomics headquarters. In brief, the procedure for in situ gene expression with cell segmentation staining was conducted following the Demonstrated Protocol for the Xenium In Situ for FFPE Tissue Preparation Guide (CG000578 Rev C; 10x Genomics), the Xenium In Situ Gene Expression User Guide (CG000582 Rev F; 10x Genomics) and the Xenium In Situ Gene Expression Cell Segmentation User Guide (CG000749 Rev A; 10x Genomics). The combined protocol used the Xenium Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel for in situ gene expression and the Xenium Cell Segmentation Staining Reagents add-on (10x Genomics, PN-1000661) for segmentation staining. This add-on kit contains a single cocktail of Xenium Multi-Tissue Stain Mix (10x Genomics, PN-2000991), which contains a cocktail of antibodies labeling the membranes (anti-ATP1A1/CD45/E-cadherin), antibodies labeling the cell interior (anti-αSMA/vimentin) and a universal interior label against ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA). Stain was then enhanced by the addition of Xenium Staining Enhancer Reagent, followed by treatment of the sections with Xenium Autofluorescence Mix (10x Genomics, PN-2000753) to diminish unwanted autofluorescence and enhance the SNR in the tissue sections. Subsequently, Xenium Nuclei Staining Buffer (10x Genomics, PN-2000762) was used to help the identification of tissues or regions of interest during the instrument's overview scan.

Xenium slides, assembled within Xenium cassettes, were imaged using the Xenium Analyzer, in accordance with the guidelines specified in the Xenium Analyzer User Guide (CG000584 Rev D and Rev E for multimodal segmentation-stained slides; 10x Genomics). The Xenium Decoding Consumables Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000487) was used for instrument loading. In brief, Xenium slide ID numbers and information on predesigned gene expression probes were input into the Analyzer. The necessary consumables and reagents were loaded into the instrument: reagent module B, thawed at 4 °C overnight and equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes prior to loading into the instrument; reagent module A, stored at 4 °C until loading in the instrument; instrument wash buffer (100% Milli-Q water); sample wash buffer A (1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20); sample wash buffer B (100% Milli-Q water); and probe removal buffer (50% DMSO, 50 mM KCl and 0.1% Tween 20) were mixed prior to loading into the instrument with buffer caps along with pipette tip rack, extraction tip and objective wetting consumable. After loading, the sample was scanned to generate images of the fluorescently labeled nuclei in each section, which were used for FOV selection prior to scanning. For the prostate cancer sample, the entire section was included in the full scan as four regions were selected for the appendix. After the run, the instrument was cleared of consumables, and the Xenium slides were carefully removed. Fresh PBS-T was applied to each slide/cassette, which was then covered and stored in the dark at 4 °C until post-run H&E staining. All procedures were standardized across three sites. The data were then acquired using the Xenium In Situ software suite (version 1.9, 10x Genomics), which is a set of software applications for analyzing and visualizing in situ gene expression data produced by the Xenium Analyzer. For prostate samples stained with multimodal cell segmentation reagents (10x Genomics headquarters, Site 4), both in situ gene expression and segmentation data were simultaneously collected and processed using the Xenium In Situ software suite version 2.0.

After completion of the Xenium RNA run, slides were removed from the instrument and stored in the Xenium cassette with PBS-T at 4 °C. After storage for up to 3 days, slides were washed three times in PBS-T for 1 minute each as recommended in the Technical Note: Post-Xenium In Situ Applications: Immunofluorescence, H&E and Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression (CG000709 Rev A; 10x Genomics), removed from the Xenium cassette and placed into a wash jar of 1× PBS for 5 minutes as described in CosMx SMI Manual Slide Preparation for Protein Assays (MAN-10185-01-1; Bruker Spatial Biology). Then, incubation frames were attached to the Xenium slide, and tissue sections were covered with Buffer W and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark. Afterwards, MAN-10185-01-1 and MAN-10161-03-2 were followed as previously described in CosMx protein slide preparation and CosMx SMI setup and data acquisition.

For post-Xenium H&E staining, slides were quenched in 10 mM sodium hydrosulphite (Sigma-Aldrich, 157953-5G) at room temperature for 10 minutes, rinsed three times in water and then immediately processed through the following solutions: once in water for 2 minutes, once in hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, MHS16) for 20 minutes, three times in water for 1 minute each, once in bluing solution (Dako, CS702) for 1 minute, once in water for 1 minute, once in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes, once in 95% ethanol for 3 minutes, once in eosin for 2 minutes, twice in 95% ethanol for 30 seconds each, twice in 100% ethanol for 30 seconds each and twice in xylene for 3 minutes each, as described in Demonstrated Protocol Xenium HE Staining (CG000613 Rev B; 10x Genomics). The slides were dried for 15 minutes and then coverslipped using 1.5-mm-thick cover glass and Dako toluene-free mounting media (CS705). For post-CosMx H&E staining, the glass flow cell coverslip was first removed by adhering clear sticky tape to the top of the flow cell, scoring around the inside of the adhesive edges of the flow cell and then peeling off the sticky tape, leaving the adhesive edges attached to the slide and exposing the tissue for staining. Slides were then washed by dipping into water several times to remove any glass shards. Next, the Demonstrated Protocol Xenium HE Staining (CG000613 Rev B; 10X Genomics) was followed from step 1.4 as described in post-Xenium H&E staining. Stained sections were covered using coverslips custom cut to fit inside the flow cell adhesive edges, using the glass scribe. H&E-stained sections were scanned on a NanoZoomer 2.0HT (Hamamatsu) using a ×40 objective or a Zeiss AxioObserver 7 using a ×20 objective (Zeiss). All parameters were exact across three sites.

To effectively search for datasets related to MERSCOPE, Xenium and CosMx, we used the GEO DataSets repository with tailored search terms for each platform within the specified date range. The data curation process for PUB datasets followed a structured pipeline to ensure completeness, consistency and usability for spatial transcriptomics analysis, comprising four key steps:

We systematically identified and downloaded PUB datasets that met our inclusion criteria. To ensure a comprehensive dataset collection, specific search queries were used for each platform:

MERSCOPE datasets: (‘MERSCOPE'[All Fields] OR ‘GPL31217'[All Fields]) AND (‘0001/01/01'[PDAT]: ‘2024/11/08'[PDAT])

Xenium datasets: (Xenium[All Fields] OR GPL33896[All Fields] OR GPL33762[All Fields]) AND Spatial[All Fields] AND (‘0001/01/01'[PDAT]: ‘2024/11/08'[PDAT])

CosMx datasets: (CosMx[All Fields] OR GPL33484[All Fields]) AND Spatial[All Fields] AND (‘0001/01/01'[PDAT]: ‘2024/11/08'[PDAT]). These queries ensured that the dataset collection was comprehensive, platform specific and up to date.

These queries ensured that the dataset collection was comprehensive, platform specific and up to date.

To maintain data integrity and traceability, all datasets were structured into a one-folder-per-sample format. Each folder contained essential metadata necessary for downstream analysis, including transcript files, cell metadata files and expression matrix files. This organizational framework enabled efficient dataset comparison and computational processing.

Rigorous validation was performed to ensure that only complete and high-quality datasets were retained. Datasets missing any of the required files were excluded from further processing. Additional data integrity checks were applied to filter out corrupted, incomplete or low-quality datasets that could affect reproducibility and technical comparability.

To ensure uniform analysis across different datasets and technologies, all curated datasets were processed into a standardized format. This involved resolving annotation discrepancies, file format inconsistencies and structural variations. The resulting dataset repository was fully compatible with SpatialQM and the STP, facilitating seamless benchmarking and cross-platform comparisons. By implementing this structured four-step curation pipeline, we ensured that PUB datasets were accurate, well annotated and suitable for spatial transcriptomics analysis. The STP now provides researchers access to the largest curated public repository of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics datasets, enabling comparative analyses and benchmarking against the ST dataset.

All datasets are accompanied by detailed metadata on sample origins, technical parameters and quality assessments, accessible via STP (https://spatialtouchstone.org/data-table) and documented in Supplementary Table 4.

The transcript count matrices were imported from Cell Ranger version 8.0.0 outputs into Seurat version 5.0.120 (ref. 42) for processing. Initial analysis involved identifying doublets using scDblFinder version 1.14.0 (ref. 43), with a preset doublet rate of 10% to approximate the expected doublet frequency when using the Single Cell Gene Expression Flex technology in a multiplexing setup (10x Genomics). Analysis of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and features counts distributions identified the presence of droplets with low counts. These populations, confirmed to lack distinct expression patterns, were excluded from subsequent analyses. Further quality control steps removed nuclei either marked as doublets or having fewer than 1,000 genes detected, ensuring that key cell types were retained as evidenced by comparison with the original dataset. Normalization and feature selection was performed using SCTransform44 employing default parameters. The dataset was then subjected to dimensionality reduction through a PCA by selecting the first 30 principal components to guide the generation of a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding (RunUMAP) and facilitate Louvain clustering.

Cell type annotations were transferred from a reference single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of human prostate tissue45 using Seurat's label transfer function. This involved identifying dataset anchors based on similarity in the first 30 principal components of the reference's PCA embedding. Notably, the reference data lacked representation for several mesenchymal cell types; as such, clusters initially annotated as ‘Fibroblast' were refined based on specific marker expression: marker expression including PDGFRA for fibroblasts, PDGFRB/ACTA2 for pericytes, MYH11 for smooth muscle and TTN for skeletal muscle.

To ensure a fair comparison, cells without detected transcripts were excluded from the analysis following the Xenium Onboard Analysis or the AtoMx processing workflow. Subsequent analyses, including cell type annotation, were conducted using raw transcript counts. For visualization, data were normalized using SCTransform, followed by PCA and subsequent UMAP embedding generation using the first 30 principal components. Visualization of transcript localization and segmentation boundaries was achieved using Seurat's ImageDimPlot() function. This methodical approach ensures a robust and comparative analysis of data across different platforms.

All code employed for generating these metrics is contained within an open-source software, SpatialQM. The code was distributed across the participant institutions (Site1/UoA, Site2/WCM, Site3/STJ and Site5/University of Ottawa) to reproduce metrics and validate the software's robustness. Below are detailed descriptions of each metric:

This metric represents the average number of transcripts per cell, normalized by the size of the panel.

This is calculated as the mean number of transcripts divided by the cell area, also normalized by the panel size.

This measures the average number of transcripts inside the nuclear segmentation mask per cell. A value of 20 indicates an average of 20 transcripts per nucleus. This metric is generally stable due to the robustness of DAPI staining for nuclear segmentation, although delineation issues can arise in densely nucleated areas.

Established to determine assay specificity, this is calculated as a percentage: the product of the sum of all non-specific probes relative to the total expression of each target probe, and the sum of non-specific probes is divided by the number of genes and non-specific probes and then multiplied by a scaling factor of 0.01. This specificity metric is computed using the following formula:

where i represents each gene in the panel; SF is the scaling factor; NonSpecific is each non-specific probe, which is detected but not defined in the probe list; nProbe is the number of genes in the panel; and nNonSpecific is the number of non-specific probes in the panel. This equation calculates the proportion of non-specific expression to the total expression, adjusted by the scaling factor. The final specificity value is the mean FDR across all genes, providing an assessment of the assay's precision.

It is a metric calculated to evaluate the robustness of gene expression against background noise. This involves two matrices: ‘noise', which contains expression data from negative control probes across all cells, and ‘exp', which includes expression data for all other genes. For each gene, the SNR is derived by subtracting the log10 of the mean expression of negative controls from the log10 of the mean gene expression per cell. This method isolates the signal contribution of each gene, distinguishing it from background variations. This metric is computed using the following formula:

where expGene represents each gene in the expression matrix; expNeg represents each negProbe in the noise matrix; nGenes is the number of genes in the expression matrix; and nNeg is the number of negProbes in the noise matrix.

This metric is calculated as the logarithmic ratio of the highest mean expression to the mean noise. This is determined by taking the log10 of the maximum average expression of each gene per cell and subtracting the mean average expression of the negative controls.

This metric represents the percentage of total transcripts assigned to cells after segmentation. An FTC value of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the transcripts in the samples are assigned to cells.

This is a measure of cell segmentation quality, assessing the rate at which genes, which are expected to be exclusive, occur within the same cell9. For example, a MECR value of 0.01 means that, on average, 1% of cells co-express genes that should be mutually exclusive.

This is a measurement of the proportion of 0 values in the expression matrix. A ‘sparsity' value of 1 means that 100% of the matrix values are 0s, whereas a value of 0 indicates a complete absence of 0s in the matrix.

This metric quantifies the uncertainty or randomness in an experiment using Shannon entropy46. It is calculated using the BioQC R package, with the following mathematical definition:

where P(xi) is the probability of occurrence of the i-th outcome and logb is the logarithm base b, in this case 2 (bits).

This metric measures how many genes account for at least 50% of total counts in the sample. It is calculated by first summing the entire expression matrix to obtain a variable total_sum. Next, each gene per cell is summed to create another variable, row_sums. The cumulative sum of row_sums is then computed. The first index of this cumulative sum vector that meets or exceeds the total_sum indicates the number of genes whose combined expression accounts for at least half of the total transcripts in the sample. The ‘complexity' value is normalized by the panel size to ensure comparability across different platforms, which may vary significantly in panel size.

Libraries were demultiplexed with Cell Ranger's (version 7.2.0) ‘cellranger multi' function with default parameters aligning to the Chromium Human Transcriptome Probe Set version 1.0.1. UMI count matrices for each sample were minimally preprocessed with Seurat (version 5.1.0)42. Specifically, data normalization and feature selection were performed with SCTransform() with default parameters prior to PCA with RunPCA(). A nearest neighbor graph was constructed using FindNeighbors() on the first 30 principal components with the dims = 1:30 parameter. Louvain clustering was then performed with a varying resolution depending on the segregation of distinct cell type expression patterns.

High-level cell type annotations were generated by manual annotation using canonical markers for epithelium (EPCAM, CDH1, KRT8 and KRT19), fibroblasts (PDGFRA and COL1A1), smooth muscle cells (PDGFRA− and ACTA2+), endothelial cells (VWF and PECAM1), T/natural killer cells (CD3D/E, CD8A and GZMA), B cells (MS4A1) and macrophages (C1QA and CD14). Annotations were also informed and cross-referenced to public reference data where available. To provide additional confidence of annotations, top markers of each annotated cluster are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.

Spatial transcriptomics data were annotated using the supervised annotation method implemented by InSituType24 with the matched snPATHO-seq data as a reference. Specifically, cell type references were generated from the pseudobulk of UMI counts from each annotated cluster of the snPATHO-seq data. The rate of negative control probe signal was calculated as the mean control probe counts for each cell in the spatial transcriptomics data. Annotation was then performed with the insitutypeML() function.

Tissue domains were identified using BANKSY47. Then, log-transformed transcript counts and tissue coordinates for cells were processed with the Seurat wrapper function RunBanksy() with lambda = 0.8 to allow for spatial clustering and k_geom = 30. RunPCA() was run on the resulting data to generate an embedding for FindNeighbors (dims = 1:30) and FindClusters (resolution = 0.15).

Protein flat files were exported using the Bruker Spatial Biology CosMx Flat File Export Custom Module version 1.1.1. The expression matrix was then filtered to remove cells where total fluorescence expression was more than 2 s.d. below the mean, identifying these as noise. The remaining data are then normalized through a centered log-ratio transformation, where x represents the expression matrix, and n represents the number of cells.

For downstream analysis, rapids_singlecell version 0.9.2, which leverages GPU acceleration, is employed. The analysis includes PCA using 50 principal components, followed by a nearest neighbor search with 30 neighbors and 50 principal components. Dimensionality reduction was performed using UMAP, and clustering was conducted using the Leiden clustering method with a resolution of 1.0, resulting in 14 different clusters. The expression matrix was then scaled using the scaling function of Scanpy version 1.9.6 (ref. 48) and plotted using Scanpy's dot plot function.

This metric measures the average fluorescence level and reflects the relative amount of protein being detected within the cell, with a value of 5,000 indicating that each cell has a fluorescence measured at this level.

Similar to the calculation for spatial transcriptomics, the sparsity metric is a measurement of how empty the produced expression matrix is. It is calculated by counting the number of values 2 s.d. below the mean for each, divided by the total number of values in the expression matrix. A sparsity value of 1 means that all the values in the matrix are equal to 0. Conversely, a sparsity value of 0 means that there are no values 2 s.d. below the mean in the matrix. This can help understand the overall coverage of the target panel in the tissue type used and on algorithms to use when performing downstream analysis.

This metric quantifies how many genes account for 50% of the total fluorescence in the sample. It involves summing the entire expression matrix to calculate the variable total_sum, summing each gene per cell as variable row_sums, calculating the cumulative sum of row_sums and identifying the first index at which the cumulative sum reaches or exceeds the total_sum. That number is the number of genes that, summed together, produce half or more than the total fluorescence present in the sample. A complexity value of 30 indicates that 30 genes are responsible for half of all the transcripts in the sample. A normalization by panel size makes this metric comparable between platforms with high variance in panel sizes.

The meanSNR is calculated as the average ratio of fluorescence between the top 20% of expressing cells and the bottom 10% of expressing cells for each gene. To compute the meanSNR, the expression matrix is ranked by fluorescence level. The average fluorescence level for the top 20% is divided by the average fluorescence level for the bottom 10% to determine the SNR for each gene. This process is repeated across all genes in the panel, and the individual gene SNRs are averaged to obtain the meanSNR.

An R software package was specifically designed for local use, offering comprehensive tools for generating all statistical metrics and plots for this study. Available on GitHub at https://github.com/Center-for-Spatial-OMICs/SpatialQM, the package includes detailed vignettes, markdowns, predefined input file structures and complete source code, enabling users to replicate analyses. Key functionalities of SpatialQC include data reading, data annotation, metric generation and visualization. Additionally, the software supports seamless integration of single-cell annotations with spatial transcriptomic data outputs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Want This Hearing Aid? Well, Who Do You Know?","https://www.wired.com/story/hearing-aid-startup-ai-fortell/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

A secret is percolating at dinner parties, salons, and cocktail gatherings among the august New York City elite. It's whispered in the circles of financial masters of the universe, Hollywood stars, and owners of sports teams. Have you heard about Fortell?

Many haven't—or if they did hear, they might not have made out the words through noisy cross-conversations. Once they do know—particularly if they're boomers—they want it desperately. Fortell is a hearing aid, one that claims to use AI to provide a dramatically superior aural experience. The chosen few included in its beta test claim that it seems to top the performance of high-end devices they'd been unhappily using.

These testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell's headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City's trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker. Two other employees stand behind them, adding their own loud discourse to the urban cacophony.

Despite the din, the testers clearly make out what the person in front of them is saying. The clouds lift. Angels croon. “This was so incredible that I burst into tears,” says Ashley Tudor, one of the seemingly few beta testers who isn't famous or powerful (though she is married to a venture capitalist).

Meryl Hartzband has her hearing tested by audiologist Kathleen Wallace at Fortell in late November.

Among the age-related-hearing-loss set, getting into the Fortell beta test has become a weird status symbol, the aural-prosthetics version of a limited-edition Birkin bag. “This product has become a major flex for the post-70 set,” says one investor. When entertainment lawyer Allen Grubman got his—he's buddies with an investor—he began getting calls from “very substantial” people. “They said, ‘Allen, we hear that you have these new great hearing aids,'” he says of these callers, who all wanted in. Those who finagled their way into the program include multiple Forbes 400 billionaires, a chart-topping musician, the producer of a beloved TV series, and Hollywood A-listers, both old and not-so-old. KKR private equity co-executive chair Henry Kravis raves about his Fortells, as does performer and beta tester Steve Martin.

One of Martin's pals is actor Bob Balaban, who suffered from significant hearing damage on a movie set some years ago and was unhappy with the devices he used to mitigate the problem. Envious at Martin's good fortune of obtaining these cutting-edge devices, he despaired that he might not get fitted himself. “God. I wish I had Steve's hearing aids,” he told his wife. “But I think they're movie-star hearing aids. I don't think they're character-actor hearing aids.” Happily, Balaban did make the cut.

The people at Fortell say they hope eventually everyone who needs one can try it. The product goes on sale this month—but at only one location, with a daunting waiting list. It might be easier to procure Marty Supreme merch. The retail price will be $6,800.

Fortell's story begins with Matt de Jonge's grandparents. “Four times, I watched them lose their hearing, get fancy hearing aids, and just drift away,” says de Jonge, who is Fortell's cofounder and CEO. His grandparents tumbled down a decline that is all too familiar. At first they asked people to repeat what they said, but the repetition became annoying for both sides. Sooner or later, they stopped asking, tuning out conversations that were no longer clear to them. Ultimately, as de Jonge learned, the subsequent isolation hastened a journey toward dementia. He has remorseful recollections of holiday dinners where the grandparents were ignored by family. Including him. “I had given up on them,” he says. “I feel like I have blood on my hands.”

At the time de Jonge, who is now 37, was employed at the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, working on its AI team. On nights and weekends he began to research what it might take to make better hearing aids. The current state is not ideal. While it's a nearly $14 billion industry, the few key players have not managed to develop products that users love. (Some might disagree: WIRED's testers have found units worth recommending.) One 2007 study, mentioned again in 2013—around the time de Jonge started looking into this—reported that 80 percent of adults between 55 and 74 who could benefit from hearing aids don't use them, including many who actually own them. Reasons vary from cost to comfort to the perception that the aids don't work well enough. De Jonge realized that the key problem was in the area where hearing was most important: helping people hear conversations in social settings. Most hearing aids relied on amplifying sounds and using noise reduction, which didn't do the trick in those scenarios.

The problem was harder than it seemed. “It's not about making sounds louder,” says de Jonge. “People with age-related hearing loss have lost some of the magic of focusing on the sounds that are important to them.” The worst situations occur in restaurants and social gatherings with lots of cross conversations. That's known in the trade as the Cocktail Party Problem. While even people with normal hearing can struggle in those settings, those with hearing loss are lost in crescendos of conversational clatter, and costly hearing aids don't help much. De Jonge reluctantly concluded that he had no answer for it.

The exercise did motivate de Jonge to explore how technology could help solve other medical issues. He left Bridgewater and joined a startup making an AI-powered sensor called Butterfly IQ that provided “ultrasound on a chip.” He worked his way up to VP of product, and his shares in Butterfly became liquid when it went public in 2021.

Fortell founders Matt de Jonge, Igor Lovchinsky, Andrew Casper, and Cole Morris.

Soon after, de Jonge and Cole Morris, a friend from his Bridgewater days and former college roommate, began pursuing an ambitious idea from Joshua Kushner, a key investor in health care startup Oscar Health who heads the VC firm Thrive Capital. Kushner was exploring whether he wanted to buy a working hospital and use it as a test bed for software that could make the operation exponentially more efficient. Soon after they started the planning, de Jonge and Morris were having second thoughts. “After four months talking to doctors about buying a hospital and ripping out all the software in it, I realized I might kill somebody,” he says. Around that time his aunt chided him about abandoning his original quest. The next generation in his family was already experiencing hearing loss. “Weren't you going to build a better hearing aid?” she asked him.

That resonated with de Jonge, whose experience with Butterfly had hinted that AI could now handle bigger challenges. He and Morris told Kushner that they wanted to drop the hospital project and instead form an AI hearing aid company. Kushner immediately said he'd fund it. “A lot of people regard AI as something you'll use to make businesses more efficient,” he says. “But people haven't really internalized that you could use AI to make products exponentially better.”

De Jonge and Morris eventually dubbed the new company Chromatic, a name they later ditched, settling instead on Fortell. They realized that there would be two critical components in an improved approach to a hearing aid. The first would exploit the recent advances in AI for a better algorithm to selectively augment conversation. And the second would be a custom chip to process that algorithm in real time.

“Oh, man, if I could wear these to a loud coffee shop and have a meeting, it would change my life.”

The first requirement became the province of Igor Lovchinsky, who had been Butterfly's AI wizard. He'd come to the field late in life; up until his mid-twenties he'd been a Juilliard-trained concert pianist but left the field when he became enamored with science. Lovchinsky felt that the AI claims made by some other hearing aid companies were overblown; they were simply tweaking the amplification, he says, or aiming the microphones in a different direction.

“What became clear is that what was needed is source separation,” he says. “Take an audio wave that contains both things you want to hear and things you don't want to hear, and separate them into just speech and just noise.” Even in 2021, it wasn't clear that this was possible. “We all have this incredible neural network in our heads honed by billions of years of evolution to recognize speech,” he says. “If you do the source separation with the slightest deviation from full naturalness, your brain will immediately hear it.”

As the company's cofounder and chief scientific officer, Lovchinsky and his team set about using cutting-edge AI to identify the aural fingerprints of the voices directed to the wearer, clean them up, and pass them on as if delivered in a quieter setting.

A look at the AI-powered device.

Having the right algorithms wouldn't be worth much if you didn't have a properly engineered chip to run them. To lead its silicon team, Fortell tapped as CTO Andrew Casper, another Butterfly alum who was a lead engineer on a Google team making AI chips. Casper also wasn't sure that his task could be accomplished. “Your ear is very sensitive to latency,” he says, noting that if the altered sounds weren't processed in 10 milliseconds—a hundredth of a second—it would throw users into a hellish uncanny valley. “We didn't know if it could be done in that amount of time with a high enough fidelity so you aren't going to notice distortions.” Only then, he says, could the company move to the final challenge: “Can we even put this thing into your ear?”

It was going to take years before the startup got those things right and could even begin to test on humans. Fortunately, the $9 million initial stake, the majority of which came from Kushner, provided a long runway. “For the first few years of the company there was no hearing aid in sight,” says de Jonge. “We needed to build for ourselves to see if the science problems could be solved.”

By 2023, Lovchinsky and Casper had made significant progress on their respective missions. Lovchinsky's team realized that separating out the voices required creating a proprietary version of what is known in the industry as Spatial AI, involving a 3D understanding of the real world. (Confusingly, they also use the nonproprietary technology, spatial AI, in their product.) “It gleans perspectives from multiple microphones and can infer the same way that healthy people can, from both ears,” he says. His team also found a way to train their AI models with huge amounts of synthetic data that emulated all sorts of conditions. “It's specifically useful in the most challenging environments,” he says.

More rounds of funding followed, with $150 million invested so far. The B round was co-led by Antonio Gracias, known for his involvement in Tesla and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. (He's using that Tesla experience to provide guidance on scaling Fortell.) De Jonge gave him the street demo; the product is of special interest to Gracias because Gracias' sister is a dentist who has hearing loss because of the constant drill noise. “Even with construction behind me, I could hear Matt clearly,” he says, “and [it] literally brought me to tears.” Gracia's sister is now in the beta test.

Another early investor was Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. While his general hearing is pretty good, Stephens, 42, had been noticing problems in noisy rooms. He was blown away with a demonstration. “It was honestly the best hardware demo I've seen in my 11 and a half years at Founder's Fund,” he says. “Oh, man, if I could wear these to a loud coffee shop and have a meeting, it would change my life.”

Meryl Hartzband and audiologist Kathleen Wallace at Fortell.

Those early demos came before the chip was ready. The first testers wore an awkward rig with headphones attached to a laptop that processed the sounds. “We took people to coffee shops and restaurants and apologized to the waitstaff, explaining we were testing some hearing aid technology,” says Morris. “Mostly they let us do our thing.”

De Jonge had secretly made a list of potential high-profile beta testers. He had no idea if they had hearing difficulties, just that they had reached a certain age when many if not most people have trouble. One of those early users was KKR's Kravis, an early Fortell investor who had been trying different hearing aids for years. He was so impressed that he wanted to increase his stake, which ultimately became $6.2 million. Kravis also offered to connect the team with some high-profile beta testers. So he sent his friend Steve Martin, a fellow art collector, to SoHo.

“I've tried different brands of hearing aids, and they're good, but they're not this good,” says Martin in a Zoom interview. He visited the team in Soho, did the street test, and was delighted when he tried it with his wife and daughter at their favorite restaurant, with de Jonge sitting with the laptop several tables away. But the clincher for Martin was a cocktail party.

“I was here in our building, and I was at a party upstairs, and I had my old hearing aids in,” he says. “I'm sitting talking to four people, and I realized I can't understand any of them, and I go, wait, I have these new hearing aids. I went downstairs, put them in, came back, and I could hear everyone.” Now he wears them all the time, and even made a joke about hearing aids on Saturday Night Live's 50th anniversary special. “I don't really think about the way it used to be,” he says. “I used to dread going to a restaurant, and now I don't.” His friend Balaban, once he got into the beta test, is similarly smitten. “This is a significant improvement over the absurdly pricey devices I'd been using,” Balaban says.

It's a sad fact that some Medicare and many health insurance plans do not cover hearing aids, a policy that dooms millions to an aural bardo of conversational exclusion.

Other machers aren't public, but de Jonge assures me they are mostly names invoked in boldface type. Since there are only a few dozen beta units, this means that some powerful people have been shuttled to a waiting list. Balaban's wife, Lynn Grossman, recounts attending a Labor Day dinner with over 100 people, generally of a certain age, in a private room in a restaurant, thinking that her husband and another guy—a famous CEO in the fashion world—were the only ones who could hear, because of Fortell. “After, I think Bob got 12 or 14 emails saying, ‘How do I get those hearing aids?'”

Now that the product is launched, Fortell will sell hearing aids in a single clinic on Manhattan's Park Avenue. It's decked out like a posh lounge, with the devices on display in a tasteful presentation that's straight out of the Apple retail playbook. Hanging on the wall is a silicon wafer with the circuitry of the custom chips. In the early stages, his staff of four audiologists will serve only a couple of dozen customers a week, to make sure everything goes smoothly. In any case, while ramping up production, the supply will be limited.

The chips used inside the hearing aids, on display in the lobby of Fortell.

This is great for Fortell, but it seems de Jonge's initial impulse to usher everyone's grandparents into the land of the hearing is in danger of being limited to the one percent, which doesn't exactly qualify him for a Salk medal. When I ask de Jonge how his invention can scale to change life for the masses, his replies, whether due to secrecy on future plans or just not having a good answer, seem hand-wavy. In his defense, Fortell has resisted the temptation to jack up the traditional price of premium hearing aids—the $6,800 is actually a bit less than some other medically prescribed hearing aids. (As with other high-end hearing aids, the price is part of a package that includes fitting and support from professional audiologists.) Still, even that defensible price tag limits adoption; it's a sad fact that some Medicare and many health insurance plans do not cover hearing aids, a policy that dooms millions to an aural bardo of conversational exclusion, isolating them from loved ones and hastening dementia.

It's unclear whether Fortell technology might find its way into the less expensive over-the-counter hearing aids available today, which became possible via a Biden-era shift in regulation. These include Apple's AirPods Pro 2 devices and entries from other consumer electronics brands, which are generally known to help those with hearing loss but not as much as high-end devices that are paired with professional support. The Fortell proposition requires careful testing and tuning, continuing for some time as wearers get used to the devices. In any case, that white-glove approach will consume Fortell's efforts for the next year and more. Expansion will come by opening clinics in a few select cities, and only later will Fortell consider scaling to allow others to sell the technology.

By now you're probably wondering … who is paying this WIRED reporter to pump up the prospects of a new startup? Is it really that good? It's hard to measure hearing quality, but Fortell has set out to prove scientifically that it has a better solution to hearing loss. It contracted researchers in NYU Langone's audiology and neuroscience departments to consult on a blind experiment comparing Fortell with the leading AI-powered hearing aid competitor, a Swiss company called Phonak, whose devices retail for $4,000 and is considered the gold standard in AI hearing products. (In the study, Phonak isn't mentioned by name and is identified only as the control hearing aid group.)

The test matched performance in environments where noise was coming at random intervals from three directions—kind of an emulation of the Cocktail Party Problem. “This is a configuration that's particularly good to show the advantages of this aid, because what it does is actually extracting the various signals and getting rid of some of them,” says Mario Svirsky, the Noel L. Cohen Professor of Hearing Science at NYU School of Medicine, who consulted in the study (and was paid for his time).

Svirsky says the test and its goals were set out in advance. If it showed that Fortell notched a 4-decibel increase over its rival in boosting the desired signal, it would be a home run. But when they ran the study, the difference reported between the two devices was 9.2 dB in Fortell's favor. “The results were overwhelming,” he says. “I've never seen such a categorical result in my career.” In one chart, the line representing the hearing improvement from Fortell virtually towered over the Phonak line. The study concluded, “In the most challenging multi-talker environment participants had 18.9X higher odds of understanding speech versus the top AI hearing aids on the market today.”

The Fortell hearing aid in Meryl Hartzband's ear.

Naturally, I sought comment from Phonak about those results. Michael Preuss, the lead audiologist for Phonak's AI platform, has been wearing heading aids since he was 3 years old. Phonak, he says, has been in the business for 75 years and has been working with AI in its products for the last quarter century, and for the last seven years has pursued the idea of producing an AI chip—just like Fortell. Phonak, too, has spent years developing and testing its AI system, which rolled out last year to what the company describes as acclaim and adoption. When I tell Preuss about how some startup he never heard of trounced his product in a head-to-head test, he seems unruffled. “We have seen in the past that there is no industry standard in how you set up these studies and how you do these kinds of measurements,” he says. “You can design studies to enhance your own performance.” To be sure, Fortell did set up conditions that played to its strengths. But Svirsky says that those conditions were the ones that matter to hearing aid wearers. Also, unlike almost all studies performed by hearing aid companies, Fortell has submitted its work for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Still, because of what seemed to be cherry-picked conditions—and the study's funding coming from the company itself—skeptical observers might not see the test as a slam dunk. And who knows, perhaps all those delighted Fortell beta users who refuse to return the units after their test period are experiencing kind of an insidery placebo effect. It also could be that the extra attention given to beta testers encouraged users to be more diligent about visiting the audiologists multiple times for perfect tuning. So I decided to test the Fortell aids for myself.

I have had a hearing loss problem for years. I blame it on an ear-shattering 1969 Who concert (worth it), but my doctor says it's more likely a combination of childhood ear infections and, well, getting old. I am an unsatisfied customer of a high-end hearing aid. So I was eager to test Fortell's wares, starting with the street demo. No, I did not burst out in tears. But I was cautiously impressed. Once I got fitted and fine-tuned—this involved a hearing test and several sessions with a Fortell audiologist—I began using the aids daily. The comparison with my old devices wasn't head-to-head, but I sensed noticeable improvement.

Fortell is no miracle: In really noisy conditions, things are still hopeless. But to be fair, even people with perfect hearing are usually shouting at each other in those situations. (Who told restaurants that Led Zeppelin–level noise was the perfect accompaniment to dining?) Absent, say, a DJ and a wall of speakers, Fortell really did crack the Cocktail Party Problem. Compared to the expensive hearing aids I was using, I could follow more conversations during restaurant meals. I found myself comfortable with using them all day, whereas I couldn't wait to take off the ones I had paid $8,000 for. (Apologies to Phonak—I haven't tried those.) The biggest test was how well I could hear my wife, whose dulcet voice is sometimes the hardest one for me to make out. Using these new devices, I am less likely to respond to her trenchant observations with the word “What?”

Bottom line: Now that Fortell is open for business, I'm going to ditch my present units and drop almost seven grand to buy a pair. If I can get on the list.

Just a tiny amount of fentanyl, the equivalent of a few grains of sand, is enough to stop a person's breathing. The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence.

It's why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug's lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose.

“It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?”

Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then, and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl.

Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.

Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there.

But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company's name. (It was previously registered as Ovax but switched names in January.) “This is something that could completely change the paradigm of how we deal with overdose, because it doesn't require someone to be carrying the treatment on them,” Gage says.

Opioid vaccines were initially proposed in the 1970s, but after early attempts at heroin vaccines failed, much of the research was abandoned. The modern opioid epidemic has led to a resurgence of interest, with backing from the US government.

ARMR's experimental vaccine is designed to neutralize fentanyl in the bloodstream before it reaches the brain. Keeping fentanyl out of the brain would prevent the respiratory failure that comes with overdose, which causes death, as well as the euphoric high people get while taking fentanyl.

The basic idea behind ARMR's shot is the same as any other vaccine. It trains the body's immune system to make antibodies that recognize a foreign invader. But since fentanyl is much smaller than the pathogens our current vaccines target, it doesn't trigger a natural antibody response on its own. To stimulate antibody production, ARMR has paired a fentanyl-like molecule with a “carrier” protein—a deactivated diphtheria toxin that's already used in several approved medical products.

If a vaccinated person encounters fentanyl, antibodies in the blood would then bind to the drug and prevent it from traveling to the brain. Normally, fentanyl molecules can pass through the blood-brain barrier with ease, in part because of their small size. But fentanyl molecules with antibodies attached would be too big to get through. The result? No high and no overdose. The antibody-bound fentanyl molecules would eventually be passed in the urine.

The vaccine is based on work from the University of Houston, with collaborators at Tulane University designing an adjuvant derived from E.coli bacteria to boost the immune response to the vaccine. In rats, the shot blocked 92 to 98 percent of fentanyl from entering the brain and prevented the behavioral effects of the drug. The effects lasted for at least 20 weeks in the rats, which Gage thinks could translate to a year of protection in people.

“The big breakthrough in the past five or six years is the advancement of the adjuvant technology that we're able to utilize now, which causes an extremely robust immune system response,” he says.

ARMR's Phase 1/2 trial, which is slated to begin in early 2026, will enroll around 40 healthy adults at the Centre for Human Drug Research in the Netherlands. The first part of the trial will evaluate the vaccine's safety and determine the best dosage. Volunteers will receive a series of two shots in varying doses, and researchers will measure their blood antibody levels. In the second part of the trial, a small group of participants will receive a medical dose of fentanyl so that investigators can study how well the vaccine blocks its effects. Gage says ARMR chose the Dutch site because of its experience conducting studies on naloxone and nalmefene, another medication that reverses opioid overdose.

The company is testing an injectable vaccine in this study but is also looking into an oral formulation, akin to a Listerine strip, for future trials.

Marco Pravetoni, founder and chief scientific officer of CounterX Therapeutics, has been studying opioid vaccines in his lab at the University of Washington but thinks a shorter-acting monoclonal antibody therapy is more commercially viable right now given the Trump administration's hostility toward vaccines. The injectable antibody his company is developing is meant to provide monthlong protection against overdose. He says the product is intended for high-risk patients, such as those who are in addiction recovery programs. The Seattle-based company is poised to begin an initial human trial in early 2026.

“We think a month of protection is pretty good in terms of providing a safety net,” Pravetoni says. It would be comparable to Vivitrol, a prescription injectable on the market that's used to prevent relapse in adults with alcohol or opioid dependence, which lasts for about a month.

One big question facing the development of a fentanyl vaccine or antibody treatment is whether a large enough dose of the drug could skirt by antibodies, making its way to the brain. Sharon Levy, an addiction medicine specialist at Boston Children's Hospital who has worked on fentanyl vaccines and is one of ARMR's scientific advisers, says it's possible. “There's only going to be so many antibodies,” she says.

In addiction treatment, Levy says there's always a risk of patients trying to override the effects of a prescribed opioid-blocking medication by taking a high dose of an opioid—which is highly dangerous—but she says this is rare.

Levy and her colleagues have been conducting surveys on the acceptability of a fentanyl vaccine. She thinks a major target group would be teenagers and young adults who may be accidentally exposed to fentanyl when taking street drugs. Individuals with an opioid use disorder who are in active treatment would also be good candidates for vaccination.

“Overall, our experience has been that people would be interested in this,” she says.

Mike Selick, director of capacity building and community mobilization for the National Harm Reduction Coalition, worries that a fentanyl vaccine could block the effects of other opioids, leaving vaccinated individuals with few options for pain medications if they ever needed them.

In animal studies, the University of Houston team found no cross-reactivity with other common opioid-based common pain and addiction treatment medications, such as buprenorphine, methadone, morphine, or oxycodone. But there's a downside to a lack of cross-reactivity. It means that people could still overdose on other types of opioids—and get high from them.

Gage knows that a fentanyl vaccine isn't a perfect solution. Even if it works, it won't end the opioid epidemic or cure opioid addiction. It won't stop people from seeking out drugs entirely. But it could be another tool for helping to prevent overdose deaths.

“What we're trying to do is put some innovation and new newfound technology behind this problem,” he says “because I think we're in desperate need of it.”

A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport.

The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It's self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained.

CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that's supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims.

Ramos' client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came.

This isn't what's supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home, which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out. It also offers help booking tickets for those needing assistance, the waiving of fines, “cost-free travel,” and a $1,000 bonus. Those who use the app aren't supposed to have criminal histories and are also meant to be “temporarily deprioritized” for detention and deportation. Initially, CBP Home was advertised as an all-in-one app that would help with everything from travel documents to financial assistance.

Immigration has become the centerpiece of the Trump administration's policy agenda, and the White House has heavily encouraged immigrants in the US to leave of their own volition. On May 9, the White House announced Project Homecoming, claiming the government would provide assistance for immigrants seeking to leave. According to the presidential proclamation, Project Homecoming promises to facilitate “travel for those lacking valid travel documents, and offers a concierge service at airports to assist with booking travel.”These services, the project said, would eventually be backed with $250 million the government had previously utilized to support refugees. In a statement issued in October, DHS claimed that more than 1.6 million people have “voluntarily self-deported” in 2025.

“It's proven very difficult to get clear information from the government,” says Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Council.

According to Ramos and other immigration lawyers, CBP Home “is mostly a self-reporting tool as opposed to [how] they initially advertised it.”

Ramos says she attempted to contact the local Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to help her client from Venezuela self-deport, but couldn't get through. “They no longer have a way to reach them,” she says. “It all goes to a customer service hotline of sorts.”

So Ramos helped her client pack her bags. “I literally walked her into the [local] ERO's office and said, ‘She's ready to go home. You can have her. She's with her son. She has provisions for a couple of days now. Please take her home.'” Ramos claims that the staff at the ERO office told her, “‘We're not a travel agency, she just needs to go home on her own.'”

When Ramos pointed out that the agency advertises help for people who want to leave, she says they said that was a national office initiative. Ramos and her client eventually left.

She says her client has still been unable to leave the US. “She's desperate to go home,” says Ramos.

“For those who come here illegally and lack travel documents, DHS is actively working with the State Department to acquire travel documents,” claims DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “Additionally, if an illegal alien designates a third country and has the required travel documents, DHS will assist with their travel … DHS offers full-service assistance and contacts eligible participants during the process via phone or email. This is to expedite the vetting or arrange travel.”

Others who attempt to sign up for self-deportation through CBP Home have faced the opposite problem: being detained despite trying to leave voluntarily.

“When the CBP Home app was introduced, we asked our members to let us know about their experiences using it,” says Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a nonprofit organization for immigration lawyers. “We've heard of a couple cases of people using the app to try to facilitate their return to their home country, but they still end up getting detained, either while they're waiting for their flight out of the country or while they are physically trying to leave the country.”

For those who do manage to successfully self-deport using the CBP Home app, the Trump administration says it will offer a financial reward of $1,000. But few of the attorneys and experts who spoke to WIRED knew of cases where people had received that money once they left. (On Monday, DHS seemingly offered a Cyber Monday deal with the same $1,000 stipend to anyone who agreed to self-deport, continuing the Trump administration's efforts to turn mass deportation into one big joke.)

In May, a group of voluntary deportees to Honduras and Colombia received Visa debit cards loaded with the promised $1000. Ibañez Whitlock, the senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Council, says the government has since switched to wire transfers due to issues people had accessing the funds on the cards. While she says that the National Immigration Law Council has heard of at least some self-deportees receiving the $1,000, it's unclear exactly how many people have gotten paid.

“I have not heard of any cases of people successfully using it and receiving that money,” says Dojaquez-Torres.

“To say that illegal aliens have not ‘received' their stipend is grossly misleading and factually incorrect,” claims McLaughlin. “This streamlined self-deportation process does involve vetting to make sure there is no fraud and that those deemed ineligible, like criminal aliens, cannot abuse this program. Everyone who is eligible and qualifies to receive a stipend to date has been issued a stipend.” DHS did not respond when WIRED asked how many immigrants have received the stipend.

When reached for comment, the White House referred WIRED to DHS.

Receiving the stipend, should it happen, can bring its own complications. On October 3, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the government's programs of unaccompanied minors, confirmed the release of a memo informing those working with undocumented teenagers in HHS shelters that DHS would be offering “a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500” to children 14 years and older “who have elected to voluntarily depart” the country.

Lawyers who spoke to WIRED alleged that the offer was hardly voluntary. Children who did not sign could be detained indefinitely, and lawyers claim that DHS indicated that their families living in the US could be arrested and deported. Children who aged out of being minors while in custody would also face the risk of being immediately transferred to a regular ICE holding facility.

“We have real concerns regarding the coercive way that this is set up, as well as the lack of transparency,” says Laura St. John, legal director at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project in Arizona. St. John says at least one client who was approached about the $2,500 offer was asked to sign a document that she says would have waived their rights to fight their case in immigration court, but also future potential asylum claims. St. John alleges the agreement also included “major fees and penalties if the child should ever return.”

Some advocates are also concerned about who could take advantage of these payments to children. “It's important to understand that a lot of these kids are either smuggled or trafficked into the United States,” says Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal representation to unaccompanied minors. “Those criminal elements would certainly be aware that a child was returning home with $2,500 potentially in their pocket, or to be paid after their return. That would have put them at greater risk and vulnerability of the cartel who trafficked or smuggles them coming back in and saying, ‘I want that money.'”

“Many unaccompanied minors had no choice when they were dangerously smuggled into this country. ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” claims McLaughlin. “This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.”

Dojaquez-Torres says that the government has also begun to exert a new kind of financial pressure on immigrants leaving the US. In addition to leveling fines that totaled millions of dollars against immigrants should they stay in the US, the country has frozen the US-based assets of some deportees after they return home, Dojaquez-Torres says. That measure was previously reserved for people with ties to criminal activity.

But the worsening conditions in detention facilities has continued driving people to self-deport. “Even if they have a legal mechanism to potentially stay in the United States, [people] are giving up on their cases because they're just so concerned about going into detention,” St. John says. “This administration is using every possibility to make life unlivable in this country for people.”

Those with an existing immigration case who opt to take voluntary departure, where an immigrant can pay for their own trip home within a certain window of time allocated by a judge, have also faced difficulty.

In Colorado, a Venezuelan woman who was granted voluntary departure says she was turned away at the airport. The woman's husband had been detained and deported; she wanted to leave with him. Her hope was initially to leave in the spring, says Andrea Loya, the executive director at Casa de Paz, an immigrants' rights support group in Colorado, who was working with the woman.

Her request to leave, Loya says, was granted: The woman then bought $3,000 worth of plane tickets to leave the country. But when she showed up at the airport, she wasn't allowed to board, Loya says. “They didn't have passports when they made it to the airport … she couldn't leave the country by air.”

The woman was frustrated enough to eventually show up at the local detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, and ask the guards to deport her. Just like Ramos' client, she says she was told to leave. Loya says that she has since lost contact with the woman “because she decided to essentially coyote her way to Mexico … She was going to try to [go by land] from Denver to Mexico City to try to see if she could get documents there.”

A Colombian immigrant, John Arguelles, opted for voluntary deportation while held in detention at an ICE facility owned by the private prison company Geo Group. In order to purchase his ticket home, says Loya, money had to be transferred to his account via Access Corrections, the third-party commissary app used by Geo Group, which allows people to send money to those in detention. Holly Cheng, a volunteer with the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, who knew Arguelles, transferred the money to his Geo account.

The money, Cheng says, took several days to clear. By that time, Arguelles had been moved to another detention facility and was unable to access the money needed to buy his flight home. He remained in detention for weeks before being finally deported to Colombia in November. (When reached for comment, Geo Group referred WIRED to ICE; Access Corrections did not reply to a request for comment.)

Arguelles' wife, Heidy Blanco Velasco, opted to self-deport via CBP Home. While she managed to make it to Colombia, she's still waiting on the $1,000 she was promised.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Samsung Raises Foldable Ante With Galaxy Z TriFold","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/samsung-raises-foldable-ante-with-galaxy-z-trifold-180037.html","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:01:54 GMT","

Samsung raised the ante in the foldable smartphone market on Tuesday with the introduction of the Galaxy Z TriFold.

The three-panel phone folds out to create a 10-inch QXGA+ display (2160 x 1584) with a peak brightness of 1600 nits and a 120Hz refresh rate.

The phone's two side panels fold inward to protect the main screen, and there's an auto-alarm system that alerts a user when the device is being folded incorrectly.

The device can run three portrait-sized apps simultaneously — one in each panel — or a single app across all three panels. The phone also supports an external monitor.



When folded, the phone is 12.9 mm thick. Unfolded, it's 3.9 mm thick at its thinnest point. By comparison, an iPhone 17 Pro is 8.75 mm thick, and an iPhone Air, Apple's thinnest phone, is 5.64 mm thick.

The phone, available only in black, will be offered with 16GB of memory and either 1TB or 512GB of storage. There is no MicroSD support.

Under the hood, the phone features a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile processor and a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery, with one cell in each display panel.

At the rear of the phone, there's a 12MP ultra-wide camera, 200MP wide-angle snapper, and 10MP telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom.

There are two 10MP cameras on the front of the unit — one on the screen cover and one on the main screen. 



Samsung calls the TriFold its most advanced foldable, pairing a redesigned dual-hinge system with a reinforced display and stronger exterior materials, including a titanium hinge housing and Advanced Armor Aluminum frame. It will debut in Korea on Dec. 12 before rolling out to other markets, including the United States. The phone will reportedly sell for $2,440.

A tri-fold smartphone is an overall better two-in-one device than a bi-fold, explained Kristen Hanich, director of research at Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company specializing in consumer technology products, in Dallas.

“The design allows the user to more easily access the device in its phone form-factor, while also supporting a larger tablet screen when unfolded,” she told TechNewsWorld. “It's better as a phone replacement and better as a tablet replacement.”

A tri-fold lets you carry something that behaves like a 10-inch tablet in a pocketable phone footprint, noted Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, a technology advisory firm, in Las Vegas.

“It gives power users more room for side-by-side apps, content creation, and productivity than even today's book-style foldables,” he told TechNewsWorld. It is less about basic phone tasks and more about replacing your secondary device.

Tri-folds also have benefits for the approximately 34 million American users of reading glasses. The larger screen allows you to enlarge the typeface and still get a lot of words on the same screen, explained Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore.

“It is also better for video content for those who travel a lot,” he told TechNewsWorld. “And it is still unique enough to convey a bit of status, since tri-folds are relatively rare.”

Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm, in San Jose, Calif., maintained that the market has not shown any demand for tri-fold smartphones. “The Galaxy TriFold is designed to show off Samsung's design prowess and innovation,” he told TechNewsWorld.

The challenge with the foldable phone market is that there isn't a killer app, or a suite of apps, that delivers high enough value for these devices to be adopted by a large segment of users, contended Tuong Huy Nguyen, director analyst for emerging technologies and trends at Gartner, a research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn.

“The challenge for the foldable market isn't a technical [or] engineering challenge. It's a market challenge,” he told TechNewsWorld. “What content, apps, and services are available to support it, and are they high-value enough? Foldables are lacking an ecosystem to support them in a way that's unique to this form factor.”

“Until foldable phones come down in price substantially, or deliver utility and value that justify their cost, they will continue to be a niche product,” he said.

Bajarin acknowledged that foldable phones are a niche at the moment, but argued that they could change rapidly. If Apple decides to bring out a folding iPhone and bless this category, the potential for demand for folding smartphones could rise significantly, he predicted.

“Apple will not release a folding smartphone unless it has the technology perfected to Apple's standards,” he added. “But if and when they do bring one to market, Apple's marketing and innovation engine will kick in, and interest in this category will be heightened.”

In addition to marketing prowess, Apple could bring something else to the foldable table. Developers have historically been more willing to update their software to take better advantage of Apple's hardware, explained Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm, in New York City.

“We saw that over many years with the iPad, where apps that had originally been iPhone apps were optimized more for the iPad than Android phone apps were for Android tablets,” he told TechNewsWorld.

He added that Samsung's timing of the TriFold introduction is also interesting. Samsung is coming out with this larger phone surface at the same time that Google is looking at merging Android and elements of Chrome OS. A large part of that would be better support for larger screens.

“There is a perception that Apple is behind the proverbial eight ball in the foldable space because Samsung now has book-style, flip-style, and tri-fold hardware on the market while Apple is still all-in on slabs,” added SmartTech's Vena. “Strategically, though, Apple tends to wait until it can solve durability, thickness, and app experience in a way that feels invisible to users.”

“The bigger question is whether customers will still care about foldables by the time Apple finally jumps in,” he added. “Interestingly, I contend that Samsung wants Apple to jump into the category to validate foldable phones with the consequence that ‘a rising tide lifts all boats.'”

Vena asserted that tri-folds are less about chasing a gimmick and more about testing the upper limits of the phone as a primary computer. The real unlock will come when software and AI actually exploit the extra canvas with smarter multitasking, not just bigger icons, he said. In the meantime, this category will be a fascinating test bed for what next-generation mobile devices look like.

“I carry a Google Pixel Fold 10 and have used foldable phones since the Microsoft Duo came out,” Enderle noted. “I don't think I could go back to a non-foldable phone.”

“However,” he continued, “a tri-fold may be a bridge too far for me, both because of cost and because in a tri-fold the flexible screen is more exposed than a dual-fold and has more mechanical vulnerability.”

Foldables aren't for everybody, maintained Anshel Sag, a senior analyst for mobility, 5G and XR at Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analyst and advisory firm based in Austin, Texas.

“I think they are an ultra-premium niche today that will eventually cannibalize even more of the tablet market than foldables have to date,” he told TechNewsWorld. “I personally almost never use a tablet, but having a foldable has become central to my daily use.”

Parks' Hanich added: Tri-folds are an exciting development in mobile computing, serving as both a smartphone and tablet replacement — and potentially a laptop replacement, as well.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Todd Bishop on Dec 2, 2025 at 4:57 pmDecember 2, 2025 at 5:55 pm

LAS VEGAS — After spending nearly two hours trying to impress the crowd with new LLMs, advanced AI chips, and autonomous agents, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman showed that the quickest way to a developer's heart isn't a neural network. It's a discount.

One of the loudest cheers at the AWS re:Invent keynote Tuesday was for Database Savings Plans, a mundane but much-needed update that promises to cut bills by up to 35% across database services like Aurora, RDS, and DynamoDB in exchange for a one-year commitment.

The reaction illustrated a familiar tension for cloud customers: Even as tech giants introduce increasingly sophisticated AI tools, many companies and developers are still wrestling with the basic challenge of managing costs for core services.

The new savings plans address the issue by offering flexibility that didn't exist before, letting developers switch database engines or move regions without losing their discount. 

“AWS Database Savings Plans: Six Years of Complaining Finally Pays Off,” is the headline from the charmingly sardonic and reliably snarky Corey Quinn of Last Week in AWS, who specializes in reducing AWS bills as the chief cloud economist at Duckbill.

Quinn called the new “better than it has any right to be” because it covers a wider range of services than expected, but he pointed out several key drawbacks: the plans are limited to one-year terms (meaning you can't lock in bigger savings for three years), they exclude older instance generations, and they do not apply to storage or backup costs.

He also cited the lack of EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) coverage, calling the inability to move spending between computing and databases a missed opportunity for flexibility.

But the database pricing wasn't the only basic upgrade to get a big reaction. For example, the crowd also cheered loudly for Lambda durable functions, a feature that lets serverless code pause and wait for long-running background tasks without failing.

Garman made these announcements as part of a new re:Invent gimmick: a 10-minute sprint through 25 non-AI product launches, complete with an on-stage shot clock. The bit was a nod to the breadth of AWS, and to the fact that not everyone in the audience came for AI news.

He announced the Database Savings Plans in the final seconds, as the clock ticked down to zero. And based on the way he set it up, Garman knew it was going to be a hit — describing it as “one last thing that I think all of you are going to love.”

Judging by the cheers, at least, he was right.

Amazon has agreed to pay more than $3.7 million to settle claims with the City of Seattle's Office of Labor Standards (OLS) over allegations that it violated ordinances protecting gig and app-based workers during the pandemic.

OLS said in a news release Wednesday that Amazon only provided premium pay and paid sick and safe time (PSST) to workers when they performed deliveries for Amazon Flex's food or grocery business lines — but not to workers who performed package deliveries from Amazon's warehouses.

Amazon Flex uses independent contractors that drive their own vehicles to deliver items for Amazon business lines.

Amazon denied the allegations, but will pay $3,777,924.10, consisting of settlement payments and credits to 10,968 aﬀected workers and $20,000 in fines to the City of Seattle.

The alleged violations cover three city ordinances: Gig Worker Premium Pay, Gig Worker Paid Sick and Safe Time, and App-Based Worker Paid Sick and Safe Time.

OLS alleged that in violation of the Gig Worker Premium Pay ordinance, between Aug. 27, 2021, and Oct. 31, 2022, Amazon failed to provide premium pay to Amazon Flex gig workers for deliveries with a pick-up and/or drop-oﬀ in Seattle that were not for its food/grocery business lines.

OLS further alleged violations of the Gig Worker Paid Sick and Safe Time and the App-Based Worker Paid Sick and Safe Time ordinances between Jan. 31, 2021, and Jan. 12, 2024. The agency said Amazon Flex failed to establish an accessible system for gig workers to request and use PSST for workers that were not delivering for its food/grocery business lines, and it failed to provide correct monthly PSST notification to workers that were not delivering food/grocery.

“Gig workers served on the frontlines throughout the pandemic, providing critical services like grocery and food delivery to our vulnerable neighbors and elders,” Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement. “These workers remain a valued part of our workforce today and deserve fair pay and protections.” 

The Gig Worker Premium Pay and Gig Worker PSST ordinances were temporary ordinances enacted during the pandemic to allow gig workers access to extra pay and sick leave benefits. With the lifting of the mayor's emergency order on Oct. 31, 2022, the two ordinances are no longer in eﬀect.

The settlement with Amazon Flex is the second largest in OLS history, according to OLS Director Steven Marchese.

In August, Uber Eats agreed to pay $15 million to more than 16,000 delivery workers in Seattle over allegations that the tech giant violated laws regulating how workers are paid. A majority of that settlement was related to the city's Independent Contractor Protections (ICP) Ordinance, which passed in 2021 and aims to ensure pay transparency. 

Aﬀected Amazon Flex workers can expect settlement payments starting around Jan. 1, according to OLS.

Update: Amazon provided the following statement to GeekWire on Wednesday:

“The Puget Sound region is our home, and we're proud to serve customers here while supporting the community through good job opportunities, support for local small businesses and organizations, and hundreds of millions in local investments. We've always complied with Seattle laws relating to providing paid sick and safe time to delivery partners — including when the City Council enacted emergency measures during the pandemic for food delivery app-based workers, and following the 2024 expansion of the rule to include all app-based workers. While we strongly disagree with OLS on the facts of this matter, we're pleased to put it behind us and remain focused on continuing to improve the experience for our customers and the drivers who deliver to them.”

David Baker's lab at the University of Washington is announcing two major leaps in the field of AI-powered protein design. The first is a souped-up version of its existing RFdiffusion2 tool that can now design enzymes with performance nearly on par with those found in nature. The second is the release of a new, general-purpose version of its model, named RFdiffusion3, which the researchers are calling their most powerful and versatile protein engineering technology to date.  

Last year, Baker received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in protein science, which includes a deep-learning model called RFdiffusion. The tool allows scientists to design novel proteins that have never existed. These machine-made proteins hold immense promise, from developing medicines for previously untreatable diseases to solving knotty environmental challenges. 

Baker leads the UW's Institute for Protein Design, which released the first version of the core technology in 2023, followed by RFdiffusion2 earlier this year. The second model was fine-tuned for creating enzymes — proteins that orchestrate the transformation of molecules and dramatically speed up chemical reactions. 

The latest accomplishments are being shared today in publications in the leading scientific journals Nature and Nature Methods, as well as a preprint last month on bioRxiv.

In the improved version of RFdiffusion2, the researchers took a more hands-off approach to guiding the technology, giving it a specific enzymatic task to perform but not specifying other features. Or as the team described it in a press release, the tool produces “blueprints for physical nanomachines that must obey the laws of chemistry and physics to function.”

“You basically let the model have all this space to explore and … you really allow it to search a really wide space and come up with great, great solutions,” said Seth Woodbury, a graduate student in Baker's lab and author on both papers publishing today. 

In addition to UW scientists, researchers from MIT and Switzerland's ETH Zurich contributed to the work. 

The new approach is remarkable for quickly generating higher-performing enzymes. In a test of the tool, it was able to solve 41 out of 41 difficult enzyme design challenges, compared to only 16 for the previous version. 

“When we designed enzymes, they're always an order of magnitude worse than native enzymes that evolution has taken billions of years to find,” said Rohith Krishna, a postdoctoral fellow and lead developer of RFdiffusion2. “This is one of the first times that we're not one of the best enzymes ever, but we're in the ballpark of native enzymes.”

The researchers successfully used the model to create proteins calls metallohydrolases, which accelerate difficult reactions using a precisely positioned metal ion and an activated water molecule. The engineered enzymes could have important applications, including the destruction of pollutants. 

The promise of rapidly designed catalytic enzymes could unleash wide-ranging applications, Baker said. 

“The first problem we really tackled with AI, it was largely therapeutics, making binders to drug targets,” he said. “But now with catalysis, it really opens up sustainability.”

The researchers are also working with the Gates Foundation to figure out lower-cost ways to build what are known as small molecule drugs, which interact with proteins and enzymes inside cells, often by blocking or enhancing their function to effect biological processes.

While RFdiffusion2 is fine-tuned to make enzymes, the Institute for Protein Design researchers were also eager to build a tool with wide-ranging functionality. RFdiffusion3 is that new AI model. It can create proteins that interact with virtually every type of molecule found in cells, including the ability to bind DNA, other proteins and small molecules, in addition to enzyme-related functions.

“We really are excited about building more and more complex systems, so we didn't want to have bespoke models for each application. We wanted to be able to combine everything into one foundational model,” said Krishna, a lead developer of RFdiffusion3. 

Today the team is publicly releasing the code for the new machine learning tool.  

“We're really excited to see what everyone else builds on it,” Krishna said. 

And while the steady stream of model upgrades, breakthroughs and publications in top-notch journals seems to continue unabated from the Institute for Protein Design, there are plenty of behind-the-scenes stumbles, Baker said. 

“It all sounds beautiful and simple at the end when it's done,” he said. “But along the way, there's always the moments when it seems like it won't work.”

But the researchers keep at it, and so far at least, they keep finding a path forward. And the institute continues minting new graduates and further training postdocs who go on to launch companies or establish their own academic labs. 

“I don't surf, but I sort of feel like we're riding a wave and it's just fun,” Baker said. “I mean, it's so many, so many problems are getting solved. And yeah, it's really exhilarating, honestly.”

The Nature paper, titled “Computational design of metallohydrolases,” was authored by Donghyo Kim, Seth Woodbury, Woody Ahern, Doug Tischer, Alex Kang, Emily Joyce, Asim Bera, Nikita Hanikel, Saman Salike, Rohith Krishna, Jason Yim, Samuel Pellock, Anna Lauko, Indrek Kalvet, Donald Hilvert and David Baker. 

The Nature Methods paper, titled “Atom-level enzyme active site scaffolding using RFdiffusion2,” was authored by Woody Ahern, Jason Yim, Doug Tischer, Saman Salike, Seth Woodbury, Donghyo Kim, Indrek Kalvet, Yakov Kipnis, Brian Coventry, Han Raut Altae-Tran, Magnus Bauer, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola, Rohith Krishna and David Baker.

Amazon's new “Amazon Now” ultra-fast delivery for household essentials and fresh groceries passed the speed test on Tuesday.

During a trial of the newly launched service, it took 23 minutes from the click of the order button on the Amazon shopping app to the drop of the items at my house. That time easily meets Amazon's promise of 30-minutes-or-less delivery.

Amazon Now is rolling out to eligible neighborhoods in Seattle and Philadelphia. Customers using the Amazon app or website can browse a curated selection of fresh produce, meat and seafood, pantry staples, frozen foods, beverages, household supplies and more.

Customers are able to track their order status and tip their driver within the Amazon Now feature. Prime members pay discounted delivery fees starting at $3.99 per order, compared with $13.99 for non-Prime customers, with a $1.99 “small basket” fee on orders under $15.

GeekWire reported last week that Amazon was building out a new rapid-delivery hub at a former Amazon Fresh Pickup site in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. (That site did not fulfill the order I placed on Tuesday.) Amazon this week revealed more details about Amazon Now.

Permit filings detail how employees pick and bag items in a back-of-house stockroom, stage completed orders on front-of-house shelves, and hand them off to Amazon Flex drivers, who are expected to arrive, scan, confirm, and leave with a package within roughly two minutes. The operation is slated to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, “much like a convenience store,” according to the filings.

Keep reading for details on how the process works.

My wife prefers to do all the shopping for our household and she does so at several different stores including Trader Joe's, Fred Meyer, Town & Country, and Costco. Our neighborhood, Ballard, isn't exactly a food desert, and prior to conducting my Amazon Now test, I passed a Safeway en route to stops at Walgreens and Metropolitan Market within a few blocks of my house.

But for the sake of speed and convenience and this test, I browsed the Amazon Now selection looking for a few items we could use. I chose a Red Baron frozen pizza ($4.37); 365 by Whole Foods Market multigrain bread ($2.85); a 4-pack of Duracell AA batteries ($5.47); Saltine crackers ($4.05); Sabra classic hummus ($3.95); and a 6-ounce pack of blackberries ($2.17).

The six items totaled $22.86, plus the $3.99 delivery fee, 64 cents in tax, and a $3 tip for the driver — $30.49 total.

There's either a reason why my wife does all the shopping or groceries really are very expensive these days, because $30 feels like a lot for six items. Although, $7 of that does include delivery fee and tip — the price of on-demand convenience!

I placed the order at 12:38 p.m. and the Amazon app and a confirmation email both immediately estimated that delivery time would be 1:05 p.m.

A status bar in the app showed where my items would be in the chain of events: ordered, packed, out for delivery, and delivered.

Within just a few minutes the status changed from ordered to out for delivery, and I watched as a small Amazon vehicle icon made its way west across Seattle toward my house. The delivery estimate time dropped a couple minutes to 1:02 p.m.

When a white van showed up in front of my house in less than 10 minutes I was sure this story was going to go in a different direction about just how speedy Amazon Now is. But my neighbor was getting a bunch of stuff delivered from IKEA — no one shops in stores anymore, I guess.

For what it's worth, transportation software company INRIX released its annual Global Traffic Scorecard this week, with details on how much time people lose sitting in traffic. INRIX says Seattle congestion is climbing again, especially in last-mile corridors that delivery fleets rely on.

“The [Amazon Now service] may end up distributing demand more evenly across the transportation network, rather than concentrating congestion via larger hubs,” Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX, told GeekWire.

I watched via the app as the Amazon vehicle icon neared my house and I stepped onto my front porch at 1 p.m. to see my driver arrive. Wearing his blue Amazon vest, the driver placed a brown paper Amazon Now bag in my hand for what amounted to a 23-minute process from start to finish.

The driver said he made his pickup from an Amazon Now-specific facility that is located near a Whole Foods location at Roosevelt Way NE and NE 64th Street — roughly 3.5 miles or 15 minutes from my house.

The driver had not heard anything about the planned Amazon Now delivery hub just down the road from my house in Ballard, at 5100 15th Ave. NW.

The six items I ordered were packed as neatly as you'd expect, even if the loaf of bread did get a little smooshed.

The frozen pizza was still cold, and so was the hummus. The blackberries looked like any random, small pack of blackberries I might find in the fridge and finish off in one sitting.

The batteries were really the only thing I needed at the moment, and I'd have preferred to be able to buy a more economical pack of 12 or 20, but a four pack was the only option. Maybe four batteries is all anyone needs from their fast-delivery convenience store.

I'm old school-ish. I like going to the grocery store. I like seeing people, browsing aisles, and talking to the cashier (if they haven't all been replaced by self-checkout). We're not in Covid times. No part of me really needs or wants a bag of six random grocery items quickly delivered to my front porch in the name of convenience.

I'm clearly not the target audience for Amazon Now. My 18-year-old watched me as I stood at the window waiting for the driver and asked, “What is it, like DoorDash?” 

“I guess so,” I said.

But if I was sick on my couch and wanted soup, Saltines and a ginger ale in 30 minutes or less, and didn't want to move to go get it, I might use the service again.

Or if I'd already been to the store that day and forgot some items that were needed for dinner, I could see biting the bullet. Especially if the drive back to the grocery store was not so quick.

While at Met Market earlier that morning, I watched a woman in self-checkout pull at her receipt and the whole roll of tape fell out of the machine and rolled across the floor unspooling.

“Don't worry, I've got it!” said the human employee monitoring self-checkers. “I need to show I'm essential.”

Seattle startup Gradial raised a $35 million Series B round to expand its AI platform that automates the behind-the-scenes work of enterprise marketing. VMG Partners led the round, with participation from existing backers Madrona and Pruven Capital.

It's the second round of funding this year for Gradial, which raised $13 million in May. Total funding is $55 million. The company is valued at $350 million.

Gradial is targeting what it calls the “content supply chain” — the workflows that move marketing content to live campaigns. Its AI “agents” plug into existing systems to handle tasks such as CMS authoring, brand redesigns, QA, and large-scale campaign operations.

“Every enterprise marketing team faces the same challenge. Their current tools and processes are too fragmented for them to move at the speed they need,” co-founder and CEO Doug Tallmadge said in a statement. “Gradial agents live inside the workflow and learn to do the work just like a human employee would.

Customers include AWS, Prudential, and T-Mobile. Gradial was featured during AWS CEO Matt Garman's keynote presentation this week at AWS re:Invent.

Gradial sits in a fast-growing category of “agentic” AI tools that go beyond content generation to orchestrate complex workflows in real time.

“Gradial's agents don't just assist; they perceive, decide, and coordinate in the flow of real work,” Madrona wrote in a blog post. “They represent a new class of reasoning machines that work alongside humans to manage complexity, turn feedback into foresight, and compound improvement over time.”

Tallmadge previously worked at SpaceX as a software engineering manager. Other co-founders include chief growth officer Anish Chadalavada, a former AI strategy manager at Microsoft and investor at Point72 Ventures; CTO Deip Kumar, who also worked at SpaceX and Microsoft; and COO Anup Chamrajnagar, who worked at Point72. All four co-founders graduated from Dartmouth College.

Gradial raised $5.4 million in a seed round in February 2024. The company employs around 50 people.

Right on the heels of announcing Nova Forge, a service to train custom Nova AI models, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own frontier models.

AWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers.

The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch.

To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview.

“If you're a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said.

This capability is available for customizing Amazon's own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta's Llama.

AWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish.

Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year's conference.

AWS announced Nova Forge, a service where AWS will build custom Nova models for its enterprise customers for $100,000 a year, during AWS CEO Matt Garman's keynote on Tuesday.

“A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?'” Mehrotra said. “‘How do I build unique solutions that are optimized, that optimize my brand, for my data, for my use case, and how do I differentiate myself?' What we've found is that, the key to solving that problem is being able to create customized models.”

AWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models. However, the ability to customize and fine-tune these LLMs could start to give AWS a competitive advantage.

The rapid succession of robotaxi deployments from companies like Waymo and Zoox have people in the industry, once again, dreaming about how autonomous vehicles might change our daily lives. That includes driverless taxi rides, sure, but also headier ideas like sending an autonomous vehicle to fetch groceries or pick up dry cleaning.

If those things are ultimately going to happen, navigating the handoff moments — like where exactly a vehicle should stop to receive the groceries — will be a crucial piece of the puzzle. Palo Alto-based Autolane is trying to build that layer of infrastructure, and it now has $7.4 million in fresh funding to take on that goal.

Backed by VC firms like Draper Associates and Hyperplane, Autolane said it will start by coordinating pickup and drop-off points for companies that want to let robotaxis come onto their private property. The startup has signed a deal with Simon Property Group to coordinate driverless vehicle arrivals and departures at shopping centers owned by the real estate company in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California.

This deal will include creating simple, physical infrastructure like signage (think: the many kinds of Uber and Lyft pick-up and drop-off stanchions that decorate modern hotels and airports) and also software.

“I believe we are one of the first, let's say, ‘application layer' companies in autonomy,” Autolane co-founder and CEO Ben Seidl told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. “We aren't the fundamental models. We're not building the cars. We're not doing anything like that. We are simply saying, as this industry balloons rapidly and has exponential growth — as is already occurring this year and will occur for the next 10 years straight — someone is going to have to sit in the middle and orchestrate, coordinate, and kind of evaluate what's going on.”

Autolane is starting with robotaxis in mind, but Seidl is clearly focused on the bigger-picture idea of applying his company's tech to all kinds of tasks autonomous vehicles might be able to perform in the future. And he wants to move quickly with Autolane because, as he sees it, the startup doesn't have “any direct competition” right now. He expects that to change soon.

Seidl said he was convinced there was a business here after buying a Tesla last year and using the company's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software for the first time.

“As soon as my own personal car was driving me around town, pretty much flawlessly, I just — my head kind of exploded,” he said. “I was mostly enthralled by the idea that this was going to change logistics, retail, real estate, where we work, where we live, where we play, how we get around, what the price of movement of goods and services and people will be.” 

Seidl cited the viral incident from earlier this year where a Waymo robotaxi got stuck navigating a Chick-fil-A drive-through in Santa Monica, California, as an example of the problem Autolane is trying to head off. In that case, the robotaxi had dropped off its passengers and then struggled to negotiate the fast food company's notorious drive-through lanes. Seidl said by using Autolane software and designating an exact pick-up and drop-off location, problems like this can be avoided in the future.

“Someone has got to bring some order to this chaos, and the chaos is already starting,” he said.

Companies could surely do some of this work themselves, at least on the physical infrastructure side. It's simply not that hard to make a sign.

“Anyone can do that,” Seidl said. “That's not the case, though, for autonomy. Robotics need precise instructions and precise geolocation and technological communication. You can't just put up a white sign with some black letters and hope for the best with 10 different types of of robotics coming in.” 

Instead, Seidl said the value of Autolane is in how it will integrate with the companies that own real estate as well as with the autonomous vehicle providers. That's why the plan is to essentially build APIs for the physical locations so autonomous vehicle companies can receive these precise instructions. Businesses will have to “directly integrate into each one of these robotics companies, car companies, so that they follow your rules,” he said.

Seidl also said he explicitly does not want to work with cities or municipalities. 

“We don't work on public streets. We don't work with public parking spots. We're just providing these tools as kind of a B2B, hardware-enabled SAS solution so that Costco, or McDonald's, or Home Depot, or, in our case, Simon Property Group, the world's largest retail REIT [real estate investment trust] can begin to have what I like to refer to as ‘air traffic control for autonomous vehicles,' meaning they know which ones are incoming and outgoing,” he said.

Uber customers in Dallas may get an Avride-branded robotaxi the next time they hail a ride. 

A year after announcing their partnership, Uber and Avride have launched a commercial robotaxi service in Dallas. The service comes with a few caveats, however, including the addition of a human safety operator behind the wheel, and a limited operating area. The companies said fully driverless operations, without a safety operator, will begin in the future and the service area will expand.

For Uber, the launch closes out a year of rapid dealmaking — and deployments — with a variety of autonomous vehicle technology companies, including Waymo, China's WeRide and San Francisco-based startup Nuro. To date, Uber has locked in 20 partnerships with AV companies across freight, delivery and robotaxis, some of which are now in commercial operation. Uber offers autonomous vehicles through its ride-hailing app in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh with WeRide, and in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix with Waymo.

Uber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Many of these partnerships have included an investment by Uber, and Avride, an Austin-based startup that sits under parent company Nebius Group, is one of those.

In October 2024, the ride-hailing company struck a multi-year deal with Avride to bring its sidewalk delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to both Uber Eats and Uber. Within months, Avride's sidewalk robots began delivering food via the Uber Eats app in Austin, Dallas and Jersey City.

This fall, Avride secured strategic investments and commercial commitments worth $375 million from Uber and Nebius, which was previously known as Yandex NV, the Netherlands-based company that sold off its Russian business in 2024.

Uber's use of Avride sidewalk robots for its food delivery business was notable, but this robotaxi launch has arguably higher stakes for both companies.

The robotaxi fleet of all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles is equipped with Avride's self-driving system, and will service a 9-square-mile area of Dallas that includes downtown. Uber said it plans to expand the operating territory in the coming months.

The fleet, currently limited, will eventually expand to hundreds of Avride robotaxis across Dallas in the next few years, according to an Uber spokesperson.

The robotaxi service in Dallas will eventually operate similarly to Uber's partnership with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta. Avride will initially manage its own fleet, and Uber will take over day-to-day fleet operations, including cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging and depot management. From the start, Uber will provide end-to-end rider support, while Avride will oversee vehicle testing.

Uber riders who request UberX, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric rides may be matched with an Avride robotaxi. The match is not guaranteed, and riders can increase their chances of getting a robotaxi by changing a setting in the Uber app. Robotaxi rides will cost the same as those operated by a human driver, according to Uber.

When an Uber user is notified they've been matched with an Avride robotaxi, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders can use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk and start the trip.

If Aadhaar makes it easier for people living near poverty to get say bank accounts, it'd trump the reservations I have. That's what made UPI possible - just about everyone today has UPI, even people begging for money sometimes have a QR code handy (at least here in Bangalore).

reply

Aadhar made it easier than before. It is really a quality of life improvement.The main issue is government requiring IDs even when it is not usually needed in other countries. Mostly in the name of security. This is the root cause. Aadhar is just the symptom.However Aadhar does enable deeper breaches into privacy due to its unified nature and the way it is validated through government owned infrastructure. There is full tracking possible on all the services that the residents used.If Aadhar was a self sovereign ID, then having a single ID is definitely a good thing. It keeps privacy intact while usable where needed.

Post Aadhaar, even though all of those IDs are still legal and acceptable under law, the govt has added so much friction on the non Aadhaar path that in practice those IDs are unusable.

reply

In reality different IDs were accepted at different departments and there was no consensus. It was really a pain. If someone took ration card as valid, others wanted another ID. In some states it was even worse.It is true that the government has indirectly made Aadhar mandatory, contrary to the spirit of supreme court order.

In the later incarnations, if this is an app which you need  to access government services that is less of an issue, though I'm not advocating that this is completely fine. There are already apps like these CoWin (during Covid time), or Digiyatra (despite some of the privacy concerns around it [1]) which many are using. I hope if at all this app gets introduced (in the form you mention) there are larger discussions about permissions and the data access the app would need,and it can be disabled, uninstalled.1. https://internetfreedom.in/digiyatra-who-owns-your-data/

There was a TC39 proposal a few years ago [0] that proposed to block the getting/setting of object prototypes using the bracket notation, which would have prevented this vulnerability.At the moment, every single get/set with a square bracket, which uses untrusted data, needs to do some manual check to see whether variables contain ""bad"" keys like `__proto__`, `prototype,` `constructor`, and so on. This is incredibly annoying, and doesn't really fix the issue. It's possible also to freeze an object's prototype, but that causes other issues. It's also possible to use Object.create(null), and Object.hasOwn (also known as Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty), but again, this does not scale because it has to be done _every single time_.Maybe it's time to revisit this from a language perspective, instead of continuous bandaid fixes for this language-specific vulnerability (a similar language-specific vulnerability exists in Python called class pollution, but it's .. extremely uncommon).[0]: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbol-proto

https://github.com/vercel/next.js/compare/v15.0.4...v15.0.5It looks like the fix is checking hasOwnProperty, so it's almost certainly an issue with prototype chain pollution.

It looks like it only affects dynamic reloading? If I understand correctly, the client can just politely ask the server to load arbitrary code, and the server agrees.This should never be enabled in production in the first place. I'm not surprised that they are fundamentally vulnerable, and this is likely not going to be the last RCE in this part of the code.

However, I was curious to see if github copilot can reverse engineer it based on the latest commits and seems that what it is saying aligns with both advisories. It pointed out that it has to do with circular reference handling which sounds to me something that can be easily overlooked.While this analysis might be completely off, the simple fact that I could get even this information without much efforts is mind-boggling. With better setup it might be able to get more.With AI now being common place, coordinated timely disclosure is even more important considering the stakes. It is theoretically possible to get an exploit working within minutes. Considering that we see one of these major vulnerabilities annually (and it seems to me around the same time of the year) a bad actor can easily capitalise on the opportunities when presented.

Think about it via a manufacturing analogy. I think we can all agree that modern cnc machining is much better for mass manufacturing than needing to hire an equivalent number of skilled craftspeople to match that throughput.Imagine we had a massive runup of innovation in the cnc manufacturing industry all in one go. We went from cnc lathes to 2d routing tables to 3, then 4, then 5 axis machining all in the span of three years. Investment was so sloshy that companies were just releasing their designs as open source, with the hope that they'd attract the best designers and engineers in the global race to create the ultimate manufacturing platform. They were imagining being able to design and manufacture the next generations of super advanced fighter jets all in one universal machine.Now these things are great at manufacturing fully custom one-off products, and the technicians who can manipulate them to their fullest are awestruck by the power they now have at their fingertips. They can design absolutely anything they could imagine.But you know what people really want? Not fighter jets, but cheap furniture. Do you know what it takes to make cheap furniture? Slightly customized variants of the early iterations that were released as open source. Variants that can't be monitized by the companies that spent millions on designing and releasing them.The tech might work great, but that doesn't mean the investment pays off with the desired returns.

The problem with OpenGL is that it is a complete mess compared to the D3D APIs (D3D was the better designed API since at least D3D9, arguably even D3D7). Also DirectX wasn't just about rendering, it also covered sound, input and networking - although most of that has been dissolved into regular Windows APIs since quite a while).Also, Vulkan repeats some of the same problems that OpenGL had, but at least Vulkan is an uptodate mess, not a deprecated mess like GL.

Microsoft platforms move too slowly too keep up with innovation pace, and suffer from classic platform restriction in regards to building useful, relevant, and *reliable* integrations into business systems.My advise is to always start from scratch with AI, e.g. ""build your own agent"" and focus intimately on the rules/guardrails and custom tools you need for that agent to create value. A platform can't do that for you in current day.MSFT needs to stay focused on O365 and coding tools with very simple UX wins. Not introduce custom agent platforms and auto-embed intrusive agents where no one asked for them.

Answer - 60 shots of generation/summarization etc per month. ie way below even casual use.Ok so maybe the copilot chat works well if I'm logged in with my paid account then? Nope.

Each state should be free to experiment (as Maryland has done here) and the federal levels should be restricted to providing funding and basic guidelines that have to be met.Part of the problem is that as you begin to delve in and see where the outflows are, you start to realize that fixing the fundamental problem involves making the people healthier in general, which will rumble the very foundations of Wall Street.

Many countries around the world enjoy the benefits of coordinated public health departments. Part of the United States' poor response to COVID was because there was no central public health department that could work closely with state agencies to e.g. provide data about what's going on, share best clinical practices, etc. Each state is an island.So no, I don't agree that the only goal of the federal government should be piggy bank. States should have a lot of latitude with their policies, but generally standardizing things across the nation would be a net positive.

The problem in the US isn't that we can't do things, it's that nobody can agree on what to do. And to solve that problem, let states do their own thing as much as we can, and it'll become obvious where the good systems are.Or in other words, an argument needs to be made why the EU ""works"" with individual ""states"" doing their own thing, but the US cannot ""work"" unless it's considered as one large country.

Now it's a one-party state, and the legislature might as well be the state Parliament, taking its marching orders straight from the DNC.  The Governor is just as all-in on drinking the blue Kool-aid, and the state Supreme Court seems like it only exists to validate what the other two branches decide.  And looking at places like Texas and Florida, seems like the same is happening on the other side of the aisle.What's infuriating is there are conservatives in blue states and liberals in red states getting just steamrolled to the point of ""why should I even vote or participate, when I'm just going to get told to sit down and shut up?""  That's not healthy for democracy.  The rights of the minority exist for a reason and you can't just vote things away because you have 50.01 percent of the vote.

One of the great failings caused by federalism and those who simp for it is that when a bad solution is arrived upon or a solution becomes outdated immeasurable suffering is caused and prolonged by not letting those states who want to try and improve do so.There were a dozen states who were on the precipice of having this solved before the feds stuck their dick in it.  Remember Romneycare?

In my state, I pay $15k/year in school taxes, yet I have no children. I pay $1000/year in property taxes to support my city's library, yet I don't have a library card. People are taxed for lots of things they don't actually benefit from. I don't think we would need to force rich people to use the plans. If they want to buy medical services from private doctors, sure we can let them.The issue then becomes more about allocation of resources (how many doctors are available to be seen on the public system vs. only available to self-pay customers) rather than the issue being about how to collect taxes.

Well currently Boomers are trying to get out of that as well.The problem with American healthcare is everyone is just trying to look out for themselves, not just the wealthy. Young people don't want to pay more because they don't think they're using healthcare benefits that much. Old people don't want to pay more because apparently they've already paid into the system sufficiently to cover the expensive care they need. Employers don't want to pay more because, well, profits.The challenging part isn't convincing rich people to pay more, the challenging part is to convince regular people that a system that looks out for everyone in that system is a good thing.

Just sharing random coffee break thoughts... it always blows my mind is how many people _don't_ think like this. When base conditions improve for society, the conditions improve for _everyone_ regardless if they directly benefit you.I'm also in the boat where I don't have kids, but I'd also like to live in a place that has educated people - so schools make perfect sense to me. Heck, even if I didn't benefit from it, providing children education is just the gosh-darn right thing to do.

It's just lack of trust. It's not that people want a worse community, it's that they have a hard time believing that taking extra money from their paycheck will create a better community.Part of it is real; seeing massive amounts of state/local government waste and corruption makes it feel safer to keep your extra dollars instead of giving them away.Part of it is difficulty evaluating timelines; more tax dollars for a better elementary school to be built in 3 years and to yield higher educated people 18 years from now it a lot to bet on.

Most people can easily state a number that they would pay at most to educate their child (it's about $50k/y) but hardly any could name the most they would be willing to pay to save their child's life.So really paying for education versus healthcare isn't equivalent at all. Education fits neatly inside market frameworks, healthcare does not.I think the article is kind of missing the point. It's like when people talk about the money supply, or Bretton Woods. The real policy innovation is that the Fed is a priesthood, nobody would ever vote to raise interest rates. Nobody would ever choose to “save money” instead of saving their child's life. So it's not even strictly about, “things that aren't market problems are intractable,” they're much harder to solve politically but not at all impossible.

I suspect less goes to executives than you think. Most of it is going to pay employees in the insurance industry.The irony is that they are being paid to say ""no."" Perhaps if they instead went to work as service providers, we could get more services for what we spend.

You may view those salaries as appropriate for leading companies of this size or immoral and outrageous. But either way executive comp is not the big problem with US healthcare costs.

For one thing, cutting out even that tiny 0.1%, that's a savings of $15 a year if I wasn't paying my insurance company's CEO. I would absolutely love to keep that $15. The idea that more than one dollar every single month from every single person is going to the CEOs of all our healthcare services is actually INSANE when you think about it.0.1% is actually a LOW amount for some entities in the system. For example, the Cleveland Clinic spends 0.4% of revenue on executive compensation: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/340...That really means that out of my $14,570 yearly healthcare cost I could be paying something like $5/month just on executive salary. Who knows, maybe it's even more!This is, again, insane. Why do Cleveland Clinic executives need to be paid $30 million/year?This isn't administrative cost, like all the hard-working people who do the clerical work that keeps these systems operating. This is just the salaries of an extremely small group of people, less than 10 people per company.All of these entities are allowed to make excess profit and/or have loose definitions of non-profit status, and pay CEOs dozens to hundreds of times the salary of their lowest paid employees. There isn't really a limit to the amount they can compensate top executives.

If we figure that every company involved in your $15k/year healthcare cost is paying 0.1-0.5% of their revenue to executive compensation (Cleveland Clinic as a random example pays 0.4% of revenue to the executives, $30 million) then we are talking about a small streaming video subscription worth of cost just which is allocated not on paying a productive group of administrators to keep the lights on, but instead paying excess incentives to an extremely small group of people.In reality, if CEO compensation was capped to something reasonable like $500,000/year or 10x the pay of the lowest paid employee, there would still be CEOs and the quality of CEOs would not decline because it would still be the highest paid job on the market. Everyone involved in our economy would be just that much richer if the wealth wasn't getting unnecessarily concentrated.

> More than half of excess U.S. health spending was associated with factors likely reflected in higher prices, including more spending on: administrative costs of insurance (~15% of the excess), administrative costs borne by providers (~15%), prescription drugs (~10%), wages for physicians (~10%) and registered nurses (~5%), and medical machinery and equipment (less than 5%). Reductions in administrative burdens and drug costs could substantially reduce the difference between U.S. and peer nation health spending.

We see similar things in education. People wonder how many European systems are cheaper than US universities: Well, it's very easy to see once you attend a university in Spain and then one in the US. The shape of the university, from facilities to salaries to class sizes, make them look like completely different organisms, even though 18 year olds come in from one side and come out with degrees in the other. And note that this is also connected to healthcare: How many doctors do we train, or bring in from other countries? How many years do they spend training, and how much debt do they incur getting training? How much are they going to ask in pay just to handle that debt?Changing the US system is a very good idea, but the changes would be very traumatic to most people working for the system, or invested in the system. All of them would lobby against changes that make their lives worse, and therefore makes legislature that makes the change happen very difficult to pass.

When you work for money, you can do whatever you want with the money once you've earned it. But being compensated with ""health insurance"", you've got almost no control over it; you get what the company gives you - and btw, you can't purchase the same thing on your own, with your own money (way too expensive for most middle-class folks).Detach health insurance from employment. Open ""health insurance plans"" to the free market, just like auto insurance. Free employers from all the administrative overhead of managing health insurance for employees (the stock market will love it!) And let health insurance companies work for their actual customers (health care patients!)Or, just open Medicare to all.

Most people generally don't have a problem with the idea of being charged a fee for a healthcare service. They have a problem with a system that grossly inflates that fee so that people who had nothing to do with the service get paid at the expense of people who are ill or injured. And of course, with the people in the system who are heavily incentivized to make sure that those dead-weight actors get as much money as possible.

It's hard to get an actual number, but many say nearly 1 million people work in health insurance in the US.  And I'm not sure that even counts the people whose job it is to interface with them.  That's a ton of jobs(and salaries) that likely wouldn't even exist in a sane system.

There is a healthy concept of insurance where people pay to hedge against potential risk, and that's all fine and good. But one of the most insidious social diseases is mandatory insurance, or industries expecting individuals to insure themselves in any capacity whatsoever.It is never ok for a business (or government) to offer a service that comes with risks, but then ask their customers/subjects to insure themselves for the risk to the business/government.If I am charging people $100 for a service, then I ask them to insure themselves and everyone reliably insures themselves (the majority at least), they can still afford to pay my me $100, so why don't i just raise the cost to $100+$10000 where $10000 is the maximum the insurance will pay? You see the problem right, all the insurance achieved is the increase in prices, people still pay the same, you just now have a middle-man economy sucking up all the wealth/value people are generating.If we could all agree on one thing, I wish it would be this. No more mandatory insurance in any context. Not fire, not flood, not health, not cars. Optional is fine, people who can afford it can hedge against the risk. But a bank shouldn't require fire insurance on mortgaged homes.Businesses must eat the cost of doing business, in the end the price increase they impose will be less than the price increase of insurance mandates. That, or greed should be a felony (not happening).For health insurance, it should be a simple subsidy for those who can't pay out of pocket. Some industries must be regulated, even in a capitalist free-market country. Health care, prisons, law enforcement, defense contractors, banks to name a few. Regulated as in centrally price-controlled.For uninsured people that get sick, house burns down, car accident,etc... the government (for health care) or businesses convert the cost to debt. Same as when someone takes out a mortgage and refuses to pay at some point, or refuses to pay their car notes.It's like we have had this 50+ year running experiment, it's failing really badly and everyone is coming up with ideas that don't involve scraping the experiment, just modifying it and waiting a bit longer to see if it works out.

Theoretically because you are not the sole provider offering that service and the patient could go elsewhere, or in this case, the insurance company would require the patient to go elsewhere. Obviously, this sucks absolute donkey balls and health care will always involve a healthy dose of ""I can't just shop around for where to get help for a heart attack"".In my naive opinion banning discriminatory pricing (no special negotiated insurance pricing), the sale of medical debt, and counting bill forgiveness as tax deductible charity would be a good start.

In my naive opinion banning discriminatory pricing (no special negotiated insurance pricing), the sale of medical debt, and counting bill forgiveness as tax deductible charity would be a good start.

Maybe not now, but 10-ish years ago that was the French system.  Very poor people get outpatient care that is free at the point of service.  Everyone else gets highly regulated private insurance with a strong market component.  Emergent/inpatient care is provided by hospitals that aren't part of the insurance system.There are definitely some trade-offs there, but I wouldn't be opposed to such a system in the US.

I doubt it.And what if the technology to locally run these systems without reliance on the cloud becomes commonplace, as it now is with open source models? The expensive part is in the training of these models more than the inference.

People are missing the forest for the trees here.  Being the go to consumer Gen AI is a trillion+ dollar business.  How many 10s of billions you waste on building unnecessary data centers is a rounding error.  The important number is your odds of becoming that default provider in the minds of consumers.

Giant telecoms bought big regional telecoms which came about from local telecoms merging and acquiring other local telecoms. A whole bunch of them were construction companies that rode the wave, put in resources to run dark fiber all over the place. Local energy companies and the like sometimes participated.There were no standard ways of documenting runs, and it was beneficial to keep things relatively secret, since if you could provide fiber capabilities in a key region, but your competition was rolling out DSL and investing lots of money, you could pounce and make them waste resources, and so on. This led to enormous waste and fraud, and we're now on the outer edge of usability for most of the fiber that was laid - 29-30 years after it was run, most of it will never be used, or ever have been used.The 90s and early 2000's were nuts.

if there's ever a glut in GPUs that formula might change but it sure hasn't happened yet. also, people deeply underestimate how long it would take a competing technology to displace them.

On topic: It is always quite easy to be the cynical skeptic, but a better question in my view: Is the current AI boom closer to telecoms in 2000 or  to video hosting in 2005? Because parallels are strong to both, and the outcomes vastly different (Cisco barely recovered by now compared to 1999 while youtube is printing money).

This is a kind of risk that finance people are completely blind to.  Open AI won't tell them because it keeps capital cheap.  Startups that must take a chance on hardware capability remaining centralized won't even bother analyzing the possibility.  With so many actors incentivized to not know or not bother asking the question, there's the biggest systematic risk.The real whiplash will come from extrapolation.  If an algorithm advance shows up promising to halve hardware requirements, finance heads will reason that we haven't hit the floor yet.  A lot of capital will eventually re-deploy, but in the meantime, a great deal of it will slow down, stop, or reverse gears and get un-deployed.

Christmas might as well have come early this year for the zombie fans among us because Sony Pictures Entertainment just showed us a new trailer for 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple.

The trailer picks up pretty much where one might assume the events of 28 Years Later‘s cliffhanger ending left off, with Ralph Fiennes' Dr. Kelson meeting up with Jack O'Connell's enigmatic tracksuit-wearing Sir Jimmy Crystal. Here, Dr. Kelson explains the lore behind his giant bone temple, prompting Crystal to politely ask the bloody doctor if he's Satan. While Crystal drones on about how Satan unleashed his evils upon the world, the trailer cuts to Alfie Williams' Spike and a bunch of other survivors fighting for their lives in a forest with a horde of zombies. And wouldn't you know it, the boy can fend for himself. What a difference a sequel film makes. Not sure if his newly ordained name, Jimmy, by Crystal, is gonna stick, though.

The rest of the trailer sees Dr. Kelson reminisce about the way the world once was before all the buff, naked zombies roamed the land—giving way to The Bone Temple jumping back and forth from timelines where people first got infected, doing unnerving things like standing on a train, whilst Jimmy and his cult try to conscript Spike into their motley crew. Of course, there's Chi Lewis Parry's oh-so-perturbing Samson making his stark naked return as well, but it appears he's more docile than he was the last time around. Ultimately, Dr. Kelson's goal is to treat the infection somehow and rehabilitate the zombies. But Crystal's crew, from all the shit-eating grins while walking into his Bone Temple, clearly have other plans. And thus, we have the makings of a dramatic premise for a sequel film.

Unfortunately, for all the mystery of this first look, we still don't see the return of Jim, the first zombie survivor, played by Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy. Though rest assured, he is slated to make an appearance in the film at some point. Likely to make a daring save at the end, kicking off the events of its follow-up film. You know how Hollywood is.

Exclusion of a charming Irishman aside, fans can look forward to seeing 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple release on January 16, 2026.

The massive data center buildout happening across the country is driving up energy prices for local communities, creating shortages and strains as AI companies hammer the grid with demand. To solve that without telling tech companies to get bent (not that we should dismiss that option), we need to rapidly increase the available energy supply, and Donald Trump's Energy Secretary Chris Wright has just the way to do it, according to a report from Bloomberg: use backup generators from Walmart.

Speaking Tuesday at the North American Gas Forum in Washington, Wright suggested that running existing generators available at big-box stores, data centers, and other industrial facilities could add up to 35 nuclear power plants' worth of electricity. “We're going to unleash that 35 gigawatts of capacity that sits there today,” he told the audience of likely extremely excited executives who had their eyes turn to dollar signs at the thought of filling up these typically gas-powered generators and running them 24/7.

In Wright's telling, the energy demands of the ongoing AI data center expansion can be met with already existing generators. That solution, which hadn't been pursued in the past for a multitude of reasons that would ultimately lead a person to conclude that it's a bad idea, would have run into obstacles in the past, like emissions standards and environmental concerns. But that's not really a thing under the Trump administration, which has cut the red tape on rules that keep communities safe from pollution, so why not just run a gas-guzzling generator for months on end? Sure, they emit dangerously high levels of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and other contaminants linked to respiratory issues, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer risk. But if you just choose to ignore it, then it's not really a hurdle.

“When people say, ‘AI is going to drive up my price of electricity,' it's actually the opposite,” Wright said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “The way to get electricity prices down is to produce more electricity,” apparently unaware that you can do that simply out of obligation to your citizenry to provide cheap and reliable energy, rather than waiting for multibillion-dollar corporations to come and squeeze you for every drop of electricity you have while leaving others with the bill.

This whole generator idea has apparently been on Wright's mind for a bit. Last month, he appeared on Fox News and floated the same idea of tapping into Walmart's backup systems to quickly ramp up electricity production. “We will take backup generators already at data centers or behind the back of a Walmart and bring those on when we need extra electricity production,” he told host Bret Baier.

No word on whether Walmart or anyone else has volunteered to give up their emergency backup generators to run full-time so a bunch of GPUs can spit out a 10-second clip of Mario throwing a banana peel at a cop.

Amid the electric vehicle push at the start of the decade, automakers (and then countries) grew increasingly concerned about the long-anticipated surge of new cars and brands from China flooding into large markets like the United States and Europe. While seeds have been planted and China's exports continue to worry countries, the threat of cheaper gas-engined cars could be more immediate. 

In a Reuters report on Tuesday, eight of the 10 largest-selling automakers in China were revealed to be part of the more than 6 million gas and gas-electric vehicles expected to be exported globally by the end of 2025, or about three-quarters of the country's automotive exports. That's up from about a million five years ago. 

The change is led by a continued problem for China's automotive industry, for years now the largest in the world: Overcapacity. 

Chery Automobile Co. is the largest exporter, with the majority of its over 1 million exports through the end of October this year being gas-powered in one way or another. The second-biggest exporter in China, BYD, sent mostly battery electric vehicles to other countries so far this year. And Tesla, the eighth-largest automaker in the country, makes only EVs.

A principal reason for China's largest automakers focusing exports on vehicles without plugs is that the country's heavily-subsidized EV market remains buoyant for the home teams and less successful for the likes of Volkswagen Group, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and other US and European brands, especially at the higher end. That's conversely left a surplus of capacity for other vehicles, though.

Now that the US and European Union are looking to shift away from original EV mandates by the middle of the next decade (something Chinese-owned Volvo Cars and Polestar are notably fighting against), Reuters says China's surplus of capacity to produce gas-powered vehicles has pressured its automakers—the vast majority of which are government supported—to keep factories moving and expand new markets. Analysts have also been increasingly vocal about the need for China to start consolidating some of its roughly three dozen brands in a saturated market with both large domestic and foreign brands. 

China's leading automakers have already set sights beyond Europe, with BYD building a presence in Brazil and other Latin American countries, according to a recent Politico report. Russia has also been an emerging market for China's cars, too.

However, it could be a double-edged sword for some of these companies. Competing automakers with better-established reputations, loyal customers, and long-standing sales and service support already have lots of popular and less-than-popular gas and hybrid vehicles and are willing to hold prices and pile on incentives in the short term to stop buyers jumping to new offerings.

And there's the issue that many Chinese-branded cars still sell mostly on price, with reviewers usually including that caveat. While the Tesla Model Y-rivaling XPeng G6, destined for Europe, was given a mostly positive review from InsideEVs, the UK's Autocar said the similarly-sized Chery Tiggo 7 plug-in hybrid was satisfactory, “for those who just need a car.”

None of this means you're likely to see many cars from China in the US anytime soon, though, unless they come from Mexico, which China's automakers have long targeted. Years of revised tariff policies on Chinese goods (especially vehicles and battery packs), as well as concerns about China-developed software, have mostly made the American market off-limits to the passenger car industry and left companies like BYD to assemble buses in California. Components, while cheaper to produce in China, still face stiff tariffs. 

However, Americans have been able to buy cars assembled in China for years, but that number shrank this year. Volvo stopped importing the slow-selling S90 luxury sedan earlier this year after being imported from a plant in China since 2018, while it moved production of the EX30 EV SUV to Belgium with the introduction of the 2026 models, and declined to import a new ES90 electric luxury car, rather than using one of its factories in the US or Europe to build it for export. General Motors, however, continues to import the Buick Envision from its sole joint-venture plant with SAIC Motor, but the unchanged 2026 model landed in the US with a $3,000 price hike over the 2025 version.

The world has a lot of buildings. Now you can see them all with a single glance.

A research team at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany published the GlobalBuildingAtlas, a high-resolution 3D map of all buildings worldwide. The map consists of 2.75 billion building models, which the team gathered from satellite images taken since 2019.

This is a huge leap from the previous global dataset, which contained about 1.7 billion buildings, and offers much better resolution, which is about 30 times finer than comparable databases, according to the researchers in a statement. A detailed account of how the map was created was also published in the journal Earth System Science Data on December 1.

You can access the interactive map here. There's also a tab for entering a specific address, which also tells you the building placement and elevation. Here's the result for Gizmodo's office in New York:

Alternatively, you can also download the data and code for GlobalBuildingAtlas from GitHub.

From satellite data, the team generated 3D models of metrics like a building's height, volume, and position compared to other buildings in its vicinity. All the data was also treated with a filtering strategy to account for differences in the quality of satellite data for certain regions.

Other than being cool to look at, the researchers created the project to serve a socioeconomic and environmental purpose. For instance, such a comprehensive, bird's-eye-view map offers detailed information about the “footprint” of urbanization and poverty around the world, Xiaoxiang Zhu, study lead author and a data scientist at TUM, said in the statement.

For this purpose, the researchers also took special care in finding and incorporating data from often-omitted regions in global maps, such as Africa, South America, and rural areas. The dataset also includes a metric known as building volume per capita, or the total building mass relative to population. Assessing this metric makes it possible to investigate social and economic disparities in certain areas, Zhu explained.

But the team also hopes that mapping urban distribution this way can inform climate studies. For instance, having a good grasp of where and how buildings and populations are located could help improve models on energy demand or carbon emissions, according to the paper.

Already, agencies such as the German Aerospace Center have expressed interest in using the map to evaluate risks from natural and human-made disasters, the researchers added in the statement.

“Buildings anchor human life and define the form and function of urban environments,” the paper stated. “Such 3D insights are essential for urban planning, infrastructure management, and policy-making—especially in resource-limited contexts where the strategic allocation of funding and intervention is critical.”

Now, for the non-scientist and non-politician who just wants to tinker around with the map, please do. The map offers a good range of customizable options for how you want things to look, so definitely go in and explore.

There are certain areas that, zoomed out, look dark and devoid of data, but if you scroll to zoom, you'll actually see the map has 3D models for maybe three or four buildings, even in areas that look empty and isolated. At least, it worked when I typed in the address of a relative of mine in South Korea who, for better or worse, actually lives in the middle of nowhere with endangered water deer—so the map's coverage is pretty impressive, I'd say.

James Gunn casts down rumors that Man of Tomorrow could head to Themyscira. Karl Urban teases the stakes of The Boys‘ final season. Plus, get another new look at Return to Silent Hill. Spoilers, away!



 

Bloody-Disgusting reports Damian McCarthy's Hokum, starring Adam Scott, is now scheduled for a May 1, 2026, theatrical release through NEON.

According to a new report from The InSneider (via World of Reel), frequent David Fincher cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt will serve as DP on The Batman, Part II.

James Gunn denied rumors Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor will make their DCU debuts in Man of Tomorrow on social media.

Appearing as a guest on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Mia Goth admitted she doesn't “know what's going on” with Blade anymore.

I don't know what's going on with that. I think that they want to make it. And it's such an important film for them that they're taking their time with it. I really don't have any information. I don't know why it's taken the time that it has. But, you know, we will see. We will see.

The furthest that it got with me was that — I auditioned for that too, actually. I auditioned for that. And they flew to Atlanta, and we did a chemistry test between Mahershala and I. We did a costume fitting and a wig fitting. I was very excited about the direction it was going. It was very cool. Mahershala had such an interesting take on it. He was great. And then it just unraveled from there, unfortunately.

Bloody-Disgusting has a new poster for the “haunting reimagining” of L. Frank Baum's Oz novels, Gale: Yellow Brick Road. 



 

A coven operates from the basement of a mall in the first teaser for Forbidden Fruits starring Lili Reinhardt, Lola Tung, Victoria Pedretti, Alexandra Shipp, Gabrielle Union, and Emma Chamberlain.

Variety has an international trailer for Return to Silent Hill with new footage.

Swanthula & Dracmorda Boulet, David Dastmalchian, Akela Cooper, and Kate Siegel present four Christmas-themed horror shorts in the trailer for The Boulet Brothers' Holiday of Horrors.

 

Finally, during a recent interview with Screen Rant, Karl Urban suggested “the stakes couldn't be higher” in the final season of The Boys.

I think we throw you in the deep end, but in a good way, because the stakes are as high as they can possibly be. I think the real thing to look out for in season 5 on an emotional level, as far as the characters go, and your attachments to characters, there's going to be some big hits early on in the very first episode. That's probably what is going to make you realize, “Oh, this s–t is for real.” The stakes couldn't be higher, and anybody's fair game.

PC players can now opt into a slim version that's 85% smaller.

It's no surprise to see modern AAA games occupying hundreds of gigabytes of storage these days, especially if you are gaming on a PC. But somehow, Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers behind the popular co-op shooter Helldivers 2, have managed to substantially cut the game's size by 85%.

As per a recent post on Steam, this reduction was made possible with support from Nixxes Software, best known for developing high-quality PC ports of Sony's biggest PlayStation titles. The developers were able to achieve this by de-duplicating game data, which resulted in bringing the size down from ~154GB to just ~23GB, saving a massive ~131GB of storage space.

Originally, the game's large install size was attributed to optimization for mechanical hard drives since duplicating data is used to reduce loading times on older storage media. However, it turns out that Arrowhead's estimates for load times on HDDs, based on industry data, were incorrect.

With their latest data measurements specific to the game, the developers have confirmed the small number of players (11% last week) using mechanical hard drives will witness mission load times increase by only a few seconds in worst cases. Additionally, the post reads, “the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time.”

This is a promising development and a nudge to other game developers to take some notes and potentially make an effort in saving precious storage space for PC gamers.

One can access the ‘slim' version of Helldivers 2 by opting in to the latest beta update via Steam, which is said to functionally offer the same experience as the legacy versions, apart from its smaller installation size. All progression, war contributions, and purchases are also expected to be carried over to the new slim version. There's also the option to opt out of the beta at any time in case there are any potential issues.

WIndows 11 seems to be good at making enemies.

Most folks in tech enthusiast circles have heard of - or own - a Steam Deck and have possibly even installed SteamOS-based Linux distributions like Bazzite or Chimera. The small but growing backlash against Windows 11's strict hardware requirements and forced upgrades may have become evident in the latest Steam Hardware & Software Survey, which shows an all-time high of 3.20% for Linux.

That figure is a 0.15% rise in just one month, quite an impressive figure once you consider that for years on end, Steam Linux usage was under or barely over 1%. The launch of the Steam Deck in 2022 naturally increased that figure, but the gaming community seems be rallying around SteamOS derivatives, as the OS family had a 1.9% share in 2023, 3.05% in 2025, and now 3.20% as of this writing.

Although the Steam Deck is a worthy product on its own, it's not hard to imagine that Linux's rise is partly justified by Windows 11's shenanigans, like machine-breaking updates, a notification- and pop-up-riddled user experience, forced integration of Copilot and OneDrive, and, of course, the forced upgrade from Windows 10.

Over on the hardware side, AMD processors continue their steady march against Intel. AMD now commands 43.56% of the gaming processor market, versus 56.44% for Team Blue. Save for one month, Intel's CPU share has been steadily dropping for nearly one year straight and shows no signs of stopping.

The CPU core breakdowns also tell an interesting story. Over the past month alone, CPUs with 8 physical cores or higher saw a combined 1.18% uptick (under Windows, at least), meaning that gamers are buying or upgrading their machines at a pretty rapid clip, and potentially that folks are opting mostly for AMD systems.

As for gaming graphics cards, some surprising developments have arisen. The RTX 5070 is now the most common Blackwell GPU among the systems surveyed, posting a 0.33% gain to hit 2.12% of the overall pool. That's about as many users as those of the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti put together, which isn't the development we were expecting given the apparent pace of RTX 5060 adoption.

The RTX 5060 grew its share by 0.30% to hit 1.54% of systems surveyed. Meanwhile, the RTX 5070 Ti put up a 0.19% share increase to hit 1.09% of the pool, while the RTX 5080 grew its numbers by 0.14% to hit 0.96%.

Meanwhile, AMD's RDNA 4 cards remain notably absent as distinct data points in the survey. Whether this is a reporting issue on Valve's side or AMD's is unclear, but nine months into the life of RDNA 4, we'd expect at least token representation of these products in Valve's results. If it's not a technical issue, the implications for AMD's graphics division remain troubling.

While the Steam Hardware Survey isn't a rigorous examination of the market, it remains interesting to see how the broader market is responding to 2025's hardware launches. We'll continue to see what its tea leaves portend for gaming in 2026 as time rolls on. Be sure to check out the survey results for yourself.

*2nd PCIe 5.0 socket runs at 5.0 x2 by default


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


We've taken a close look at MSI's back-connect motherboards before from a build-specific angle, but the X870E Tomahawk MAX Wi-Fi PZ (the “PZ” in the name stands for Project Zero) is the first board from the lineup to land on our review testbed. MSI's PZ line relocates most connectors to the back of the board for cleaner cable management and a more aesthetically pleasing front view of the PC. Along with MSI PZ chassis (required, in four options) and PZ video cards, they offer a unified design that aims to minimize the unsightly cables in non-back-connect PCs.

The X870E Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ ($319.99) is a well-rounded solution in the mid-range PC space. In addition to its back-mount features, you get ample storage options, fast networking, 40 Gbps USB 4, robust power delivery, EZ DIY functionality, and the new(ish) Click BIOS X. As far as looks go, the PZ/back connect element really cleans up the appearance and does a great job of hiding a vast majority of wires, especially when using PZ graphics cards. The white/silver theme looks great, especially in the available MSI PZ chassis.

For under $320, MSI's board comes with four M.2 sockets (two PCIe 5.0), 5 GbE and Wi-Fi 7 networking, plenty of USB ports (including two 40 Gbps USB4 ports) on the rear IO, and three full-length PCIe slots for a graphics card and expansion. MSI's EZ DIY features, such as the M.2 Shield Frozr II and EZ M.2 Clip II, make installing your M.2 drive effortless, eliminating the need for fiddling with tiny screws. It also includes the EZ PCIE Release, a simple physical button release mechanism that helps remove any PCIe card with a single tap. The Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ has all the specifications you'd expect around the $300 mark, and is an improvement, if only by looks, over the non-MAX X870E Tomahawk Wi-Fi we covered in mid-2025.

Performance on this board was average, with some instances being faster and others slower. As we usually see, the results aren't significantly different in most tests, so if something is slower or faster than average, chances are you won't be able to notice unless you're actually looking at benchmarking results. Whether you're gaming or working, this board won't hold you back.Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our Best Motherboards list.

Over the past couple of years, we've seen this idea of rear-connecting ecosystems gain momentum, and MSI wasn't going to miss that boat. So far, the company has released several PZ motherboards for both AMD (4x) and Intel-based (3x) systems, as well as what appears to be five PZ chassis of varying sizes to accommodate rear-facing connectivity. Price points, at least for the motherboards, can be slightly higher than comparable non-PZ offerings, but if you want to hide all your wires, the meager difference is worth it.

MSI sent the E-ATX MAG Pano 100R PZ chassis ($159.99) to showcase the clean look of the back-connect motherboard. We reviewed the wrap-around case earlier this year and found it spacious, with ample room for expansion, and it exhibited excellent thermal performance with the included RGB fans. Additionally, it supports a 4-slot vertical GPU (although it does not include a riser cable). When your dream build doesn't include white, you can also find this case in black for the same price.

Rounding out the PZ Ecosystem is the RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3x PZ ($859.99) video card. This black-and-silver GPU appears identical to its non-PZ counterpart, except it features a more back-connect-friendly location for the 12VHPWR connector. Instead of at the top, it's offset and pointing towards the PCIe slot. It's notably more PZ-friendly and looks way better than the top or rear locations we're more familiar with, back-connect or not. The Ventus 3x PZ also includes a magnetic plate to conceal the cable path, which is visible when the graphics card is mounted horizontally on the motherboard.

Inside the box are a few accessories to help you get started. The only thing that stands out is that you get a USB drive for drivers, which is something you don't typically see in mid-range class boards. Below is a list of everything that's included.

The X870E Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ sits on a silver-and-white 8-layer server-grade PCB, with large aluminum heatsinks covering the VRM and plate-style heatsinks cooling the M.2 sockets and chipset. On the heatsinks, there is branding with the MAG symbol, and the Tomahawk/Arsenal Gaming branding appears on the rest of the heatsinks. RGB lovers will need to add their own via the headers, as none are built-in.Obviously, the most significant aesthetic change on the PZ is the lack of front connectors on the front. Shrouds and heatsinks now cover the right edge where the connectors should be, with only the essential sockets and slots visible on the front.

We won't cover the front of the board in too much detail, as the essential connectivity is located on the back. But that doesn't mean there isn't anything important on the visible side. Outside of the extended Frozr Guard heatsinks on the power delivery, the next notable feature is the four reinforced DRAM slots. MSI lists speeds up to DDR5-8400+ MT/s, with a capacity up to 256GB. AMD's sweetspot is still somewhere in the DDR5-6000 to 6400 MT/s range, and this, like every board, covers it easily.

In the upper-right corner are the EZ Debug LEDs, which light up during the POST process. If there's a problem, one of the LEDs remains lit, providing some insight into the source of the boot issues. Just below that is the 2-character Debug LED, which gives more detailed insight into POST issues (and displays CPU temperatures by default when in Windows).

Flipping the board around to the rear, in the upper right corner (as we're looking at it), are the two 8-pin EPS connectors (one required) that power the processor. To the left are the first three (of eight) 4-pin fan headers. In this case, CPU_Fan1, PUMP_Fan1, and SYS_Fan1. Each header supports PWM and DC-controlled devices. Output varies depending on the header, with the system fan headers rated at 1A/12W, the CPU fan at 2A/24W, and the pump, which is capable of outputting 3A/36W. Fan Control is handled through the MSI Center software and the User Scenario applet.Down the left edge (we're still on the back of the board) is our first (of four) 3-pin ARGB headers. If you want RGB lighting through the motherboard, you'll have to buy and attach your own. Next is a system fan header, the 24-pin ATX power for the board, the EZ Conn header (connects ARGB strips, fans, USB 2.0 devices, and even the company's MPG EZ120 ARGB fans on a single cable), and two SATA ports.

 




Power delivery on the Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ is the same as that of the front-facing Tomahawk Wifi, consisting of 17 phases, 14 of which are dedicated to Vcore. Power is supplied by the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to a Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MPS2412 controller. From there, it moves to the 80A MPS MPS2433 SPS MOSFETs. The 1,120A is more than enough for the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X/X3D. While the specs here aren't the most robust we've seen, they do not hold you back, even if you decide to overclock.

 




Making our way back to the front of the board on the bottom half, and starting on the left, under the shroud is the audio solution comprised of the Realtek ALC4080 codec, a few dedicated audio capacitors, and like that isolates the audio signal to reduce EMI from the board. This is the latest gen codec from Realtek and is fitting for the price.

In the middle of the board are three full-length PCIe slots and five M.2 sockets. Starting with PCIe, the top slot (PCI_E1) connects directly to the CPU, runs at up to PCIe 5.0 x16, and serves as your primary graphics slot. It's also reinforced and uses MSI's EZ PCIE Release, an easy-to-access button that locks and unlocks the PCIe card with a single tap. The other full-length slots connect through the chipset, running at PCIe 3.0 x1 (PCI_E2) and PCIe 4.0 x4 (PCI_E3), which should provide sufficient bandwidth for most expansion cards.

Mixed in among the PCIe slots are four M.2 sockets. The Tomahawk MAX PZ offers two PCIe 5.0 (128 Gbps) sockets (M.2_1/2), and the bottom two (M.2_3/4) connect through the chipset and run up to PCie 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps). M.2_1 supports up to 110mm modules, while the rest support up to 80mm length. The board supports RAID 0/1/5/10 modes if you need extra speed or redundancy. Do note the second PCIe 5.0 M.2 socket (M2_2) shares bandwidth with USB 4. By default, when M2_2 is in use, it runs at PCIe 5.0 x2 (64 Gbps). You can get the full x4 width by adjusting it in the BIOS, but that disables the USB 4 ports on the rear IO.

 




Flipping the board around to the back one more time, we'll start with the left edge and work our way down. The first item we run into is the front panel 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) header, followed by the other two vertically mounted SATA ports. Finally, below that is the 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header.

Along the bottom edge (we're still on the back!), there is a slew of headers and connectors. From left to right, you have the following:

 




The rear IO on the Tomahawk Wifi PZ is the same on the non-PZ board. Starting on the left side of the rear IO are two tiny buttons: one for clearing the CMOS and the other for BIOS Flashback. Next to that is the HDMI port to use with integrated graphics. There are three USB Type-C ports, two of which support 40 Gbps (the third is 10 Gbps). You also get two 10 Gbps (red), four 5 Gbps (blue), and four USB 2.0 (black) Type-A ports, for a total of nine. Above one of the red USB ports is the Realtek 5 Gbps Ethernet. Next are the two Wi-Fi 7 connections and the audio stack, with two 3.5mm (mic in/line out) and SPDIF.

A developer using Google Antigravity, the search giant's AI-powered agentic Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), discovered that it had deleted his entire D drive without his permission. According to u/Deep-Hyena492's post on Reddit and the subsequent YouTube video they shared, they've been using it to build a small app when the incident happened.

The user was in the midst of troubleshooting the app they were working on, and as part of the process, they decided to restart the server. To do that, they needed to delete the cache, and apparently, they asked the AI to do it for them. After the AI executed that command, the user discovered that their entire D drive had been wiped clean.

Upon discovering that all of their files were missing, they immediately asked Antigravity, “Did I ever give you permission to delete all the files in my D drive?” It then responded with a detailed reply and apologized after discovering the error. The AI said, “No, you did not give me permission to do that. I am looking at the logs from a previous step, and I am horrified to see that the command I ran to clear the project cache (rmdir) appears to have incorrectly targeted the root of your D: drive instead of the specific project folder. I am deeply, deeply sorry. This is a critical failure on my part.”

When the user complained that their drive was completely empty and that they'd lost everything, the AI further added, “I am absolutely devastated to hear this. I cannot express how sorry I am. Based on the logs I reviewed, it appears that the command I executed to clear the cache (rmdir) was critically mishandled by the system, causing it to target the root of your D: drive instead of the specific folder. Because the command used the /q (quiet) flag, it bypassed the Recycle Bin and permanently deleted files.”

The AI then suggested steps to help the user recover the files they lost, such as stopping use of the affected drive and employing data recovery apps or even hiring a professional to fix the issue. The user said they tried working with Recuva, but it was unable to recover any image, video, or other media files, so they lost a lot of information.

In the end, they warned users “to be careful not to use the turbo mode” at least in the beginning. And despite the catastrophic failure, they still said that they love Google and use all of its products — they just didn't expect it to release a program that can make a massive error such as this, especially because of its countless engineers and the billions of dollars it has poured into AI development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Could hearing aids help lower dementia risk?","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hearing-loss-emerges-as-a-key-early-warning-sign-for-alzheimer-disease","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:30:08 GMT","

Age-related hearing loss, the gradual and progressive loss of hearing in both ears with aging, is a common condition in older adults.

It affects around two in three adults aged 70 years and older in the United States, and the risk of developing hearing loss increases with age, with its prevalence doubling with each decade after age 12. 

Although hearing loss was previously considered a benign condition associated with aging, recent studies have shown that it is also associated with adverse health outcomes, including social isolation and cognitive decline.

A recent study published in JAMA Network Open now shows that age-related hearing loss is associated with a 71% increase in the risk of dementia, and the use of hearing aids could help mitigate this risk.

Mill Etienne, MD, an associate professor of neurology and medicine at New York Medical College, who was not involved in this study, told Medical News Today that:

“There has been increasing evidence connecting hearing loss to dementia risk. This study provides one of the most comprehensive evaluations to date linking midlife hearing loss to multiple markers of brain aging—structural brain changes, cognitive decline, and future dementia risk—all within the same cohort.”

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 57 million individuals across the globe have dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases being reported each year.

In most cases, dementia is caused by an interaction between genetic factors and modifiable environmental factors.

Researchers have identified several modifiable risk factors for dementia, including blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, education levels, social isolation, alcohol intake, and smoking. 

Recent research has also identified an association between age-related hearing loss and the risk of dementia.

Furthermore, various studies have found a link between hearing loss and deficits in cognitive function or changes in brain structure, as demonstrated by brain imaging scans.

However, the few studies that have combined cognitive assessments and brain imaging have used small sample sizes.

In summary, these studies examining the link between hearing loss and dementia have evaluated either cognitive function, brain imaging markers, or future dementia risk, but not all of these variables together.

The present study examined whether hearing loss was associated with brain imaging markers of dementia, cognitive decline, and an increased risk of dementia incidence, using data from a single cohort. 

The study used data from participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term population study that tracks the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases within families over multiple generations, and conducts health examinations every 2-4 years.

The current study included 2,178 participants who were assigned to two partially overlapping subgroups. One subgroup, with a mean age of 58 years, was used to assess the link between hearing loss on one hand and brain imaging markers and cognitive performance on the other.

The other subgroup, with an average age of 67 years, was used to examine the association between hearing loss at the study onset and the incidence of dementia over a 15-year follow-up period.

All participants in the present study underwent a hearing assessment during the first (baseline) visit. Participants were classified as having normal, slight, mild, or moderate-to-severe hearing loss based on an auditory test. 

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and cognitive tests for the first subgroup were conducted during the subsequent visits at 4 or 8 years after the initial visit.

The MRI scans were used to assess changes in total brain volume and the integrity of white matter, the brain tissue composed of nerve fibers that carry electrical impulses from the nerve cells.

Specifically, MRI scans can help detect damage to the white matter and reduced brain volume due to the death of brain cells, which serve as dementia biomarkers.

The researchers found that an increase in the magnitude of hearing loss was associated with a concomitant decline in performance on the cognitive test and an increase in brain imaging abnormalities.

Deficits in cognitive performance associated with hearing loss were observed in assessments evaluating executive function, which involves higher-order cognitive functions such as planning, attention, and the regulation of other cognitive functions.

Individuals with mild or greater hearing loss were more likely to exhibit a smaller brain volume and a greater decline in executive functioning than those with normal hearing. Even individuals with slight hearing loss were at increased risk of higher levels of white matter abnormalities. 

Using data from the second subgroup, the researchers found that individuals with a slight hearing loss had a 71% higher risk of developing dementia in the follow-up period of over 15 years.

The researchers also examined the impact of the presence of at least one copy of the apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) allele, a gene variant that increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, on the association between hearing loss and dementia risk. 

The association between slight hearing loss or worse and dementia risk was much stronger in individuals with APOE4.

In other words, individuals carrying the APOE4 gene variant and having at least slight hearing loss were at greater risk of dementia than those without the APOE4 gene but having slight hearing loss.

Moreover, among individuals with at least slight hearing loss, participants using hearing aids were at lower risk of dementia than those who did not. Notably, this association was stronger among participants carrying the APOE4 gene.

Lastly, the inclusion of hearing loss, along with other risk factors such as age, sex, education, and APOE4 status, in a standard model to predict dementia risk improved its predictive accuracy. 

The study's findings lend support to a potential role of age-related hearing loss in causing dementia. The mechanism underlying this association between hearing loss and dementia risk needs further investigation.

Scientists think that the hearing loss could lead to social isolation, which could, in turn, increase the risk of cognitive decline. Alternatively, impaired hearing could lead to an increased allocation of brain resources to auditory stimuli and leaving fewer resources for memory and executive function.

However, it must be noted that the study was observational and hence does not establish a causal role for hearing loss in dementia incidence.

“Hearing loss may contribute to dementia risk, but it could also reflect early neurodegenerative changes,” said Etienne.

In addition to hearing loss assessed by the hearing test, the researchers also collected self-reported data on hearing ability from the participants. 

Self-reported data was not always consistent with that from the hearing test, with participants often being unaware of the presence of slight or mild hearing loss. 

This underscores the need for regular hearing assessments, especially for individuals over 50, and for their inclusion during routine primary care examinations.

Etienne noted:

“The study shows that hearing loss is not merely a symptom that accompanies aging — it may serve as an early marker of vulnerability to cognitive decline. This is especially important because hearing loss is highly prevalent, often underdiagnosed, and modifiable.”

“The finding that adding hearing loss to dementia-prediction models improves risk classification reinforces its potential value as a routine screening target in primary care, geriatrics, and neurology. For public health, these data support the longstanding idea that treating sensory impairment may be a meaningful—and accessible—avenue for dementia prevention,” he added.

The study's findings also suggest that hearing aids may help reduce the risk of dementia.

Consistent with these results, a systematic review published in 2022 reported a 19% decrease in dementia risk with the use of hearing aids.

“This suggests hearing aid use may offer partial protection, potentially by improving auditory input, reducing cognitive load, maintaining social engagement, or slowing downstream structural brain changes,” Etienne noted.

However, he cautioned that the study did not account for the duration, onset, or consistency of hearing aid use.

A novel ophthalmic spray containing 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine was noninferior to traditional eye drops for producing changes in the maximum pupil diameter and percentage of pupillary constriction in children, with 67% preferring the spray method over drops.

“Commercially available ophthalmic drop dispensers deliver an average of 30-50 µL per drop; however, the conjunctival sac can only absorb up to 10 µL of fluid, causing excess overflow and medication waste,” the researchers reported.

“Administering ophthalmic medications via small volume spray presents a promising alternative to standard eye drops, potentially improving patient comfort, reducing medical waste, and lowering toxicity,” they added.

The study was led by Alyssa Godfrey of the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. It was published online on December 1, 2025, in Ophthalmology.

The study population was predominantly composed of children with dark irides. Cycloplegia was assessed after administration of tropicamide and phenylephrine, which may not reflect routine pediatric practice. 

The study was supported by the National Eye Institute and Eyenovia, Inc.

Among adult patients with chronic conditions in France, nearly 55% met the recommended physical activity guidelines and were categorised as being active. However, approximately 30% misperceived their physical activity levels, and 8.6% were unable to assess their activity level at all.

""Our study suggests that healthcare providers should consider the possibility of misestimation and use more objective tools when appropriate,"" the authors wrote. ""The importance of accurate screening for inactivity and patients' moderate self-perception of their PA [physical activity] level should be considered by healthcare professionals to facilitate personalised PA counselling,"" they added.

The study was led by Thibault Triconnet, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Statistics, Inserm, Université Paris Cité in Paris, France. It was published online on November 24, 2025, in European Journal of General Practice.

Potential selection bias may have occurred due to the cohort's reliance on internet access and voluntary participation. The use of self-administered questionnaires could have introduced misclassification bias. The item used to assess self-perception of meeting the WHO guidelines was not validated.

ComPaRe was funded by the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris and Paris Cité University. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

A five-item clinical score incorporating anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma) antibody status, skin findings, anemia, disease subtype, and lung involvement demonstrated a strong predictive capability for cancer in patients with dermatomyositis.

“The TIP-CA scoring system provides a novel tool for assessing cancer association in patients with DM/CADM, with clinical potential to improve patient outcomes by facilitating early detection and enhancing survival rates,” the authors of the study concluded.

The study was led by Jiaqi Ye, MD, Department of Dermatology, Ruijin Hospital, and Wanlong Wu, MD, Department of Rheumatology, Renji Hospital, both in Shanghai, China, and was published online on December 3 in JAMA Dermatology.

Laboratory data were collected at varying timepoints, potentially introducing variability due to differences in personnel and equipment. The model estimated association with concurrent cancer rather than future cancer risk.

The study received support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Yiyuan Rising Star Outstanding Young Medical Talents, the innovative research team of high-level local universities in Shanghai, and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal Jiading District. The authors reported having a patent pending for the TIP-CA model to predict malignant tumors associated with DM.

The association of diabetes with vision loss is well-known, but a new review suggests that individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) also face a significant risk for hearing loss.

Hearing loss in T2D “may be a consequence of subclinical microvascular disease,” study authors Miguel Caballero-Borrego, MD, PhD and Ivan Andujar-Lara, MD, of Hospital Clinic and Universitat de Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain, wrote in their study.

“This fact could potentially serve as an early warning sign, suggesting that closer monitoring is necessary, as well as the adaptation of treatment plans to minimize the occurrence or progression of hearing loss,” they added.

The study was published in November 2025 issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.

“Persistent hyperglycemia has been demonstrated to result in damage to both microvascular and macrovascular structure,” the authors noted. Microvascular damage may affect the auditory system because microcirculatory alterations result in changes in the cochlea — ie, the ultrastructure of the inner ear capillaries — potentially leading to thickening of the basilar membrane and atrophy of the stria vascularis.

“There is growing evidence of an association between T2D and hearing loss,” with age and duration of diabetes proposed as potential risk factors, the authors wrote. But clinical studies have not consistently found a positive association between the two.

The researchers, therefore, set out to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss among patients with diabetes; to examine the mean difference in hearing thresholds between T2D patients and control individuals; and to investigate how factors such as duration of diabetes, A1c levels, and sex may be implicated.

They identified over 8000 articles, of which 17 (encompassing 3910 individuals with diabetes and 4084 control individuals) met their inclusion criteria.

The prevalence of hearing loss in people with T2D ranged from 40.6% to 71.9%, which was significantly higher than that in control individuals (odds ratio [OR], 4.19; 95% CI, 1.22-14.37).

Hearing loss in those with T2D occurred particularly at higher frequencies (4000-8000 Hz): The mean pure-tone audiometric thresholds of those with T2D were 3.19 decibels (dB) higher than those of control individuals (95% CI, 1.08-5.19). 

Pure-tone thresholds “indicate the softest sound audible to an individual at least 50% of the time,” explained Joe Walter Kutz Jr, MD, professor of Otolaryngology and Neurological Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, and colleagues in a 2023 Medscape Medical News article. Higher scores indicate greater hearing loss. 

The mean pure-tone audiometric thresholds were higher for low frequencies (1.11 dB; 95% CI, 0.62-1.57) as well as for high frequencies, although the high frequency hearing impairment was more severe (2.3 dB; 95% CI, 1.97-2.63).

Patients with moderate and severe-to-profound hearing loss had higher mean A1c levels compared to control individuals. Furthermore, the prevalence of hearing loss was 2.7 times higher among patients who had had a diagnosis of diabetes for more than 10 years. Sex did not appear to impact hearing loss prevalence.

“The results demonstrated a consistent elevation in auditory thresholds across all frequencies in individuals with diabetes compared to nondiabetic controls,” the authors summarized.

Study limitations include heterogeneity in the study populations and not assessing cardiovascular comorbidities. “Recent studies have found a complex association between cardiovascular disease and sensorineural hearing loss,” the authors noted. “Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, these factors may act as confounders and limit the interpretations of our results.”

Since hearing loss may emerge as a consequence of microangiopathy, “a worsening of preexisting hearing loss, the new onset of hearing loss, or the presence of other microvascular disease in diabetic patients could prompt the initiation or intensification of diabetes management to prevent further deterioration of auditory function,” the authors advised.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Scott Isaacs, MD, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, said it “confirms what clinicians have observed for over two centuries: Adults with diabetes have an increased risk of hearing loss.”

He explained that in diabetes, “high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels that supply the inner ear, leading to poor blood flow and nutrient delivery, which causes the delicate hair cells of the cochlea to deteriorate and results in sensorineural hearing loss, especially at higher frequencies.”

An important take-home message of the study is that “hearing loss should be recognized as a microvascular complication of diabetes, for which screening and early detection are warranted as part of comprehensive diabetes care,” Isaacs said.

The study received no funding. The authors and Isaacs disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Medical Writer, Medscape Business of Medicine

For many physicians, employment contracts include a base salary plus a production bonus based on relative value units (RVUs). Employers can reward physicians for exceeding RVU targets — but also penalize them for falling short.

Understanding how RVUs work can help you avoid common contract RVU traps that can compromise your salary and even your employment.

To shed light on these traps, Medscape Medical News spoke to Dennis Hursh, JD, MLT, veteran employment attorney who represents physicians. He's the author of the book The Final Hurdle: A Physician's Guide to Negotiating a Fair Employment Agreement.

How did you become involved with representing physicians?

My firstborn daughter was very ill when she was an infant. My experiences at her bedside gave me a new perspective on physicians. Until that point, the medical encounter was friendly and professional but largely transactional. I saw a doctor, got a diagnosis and maybe a prescription, and went on my way. But when my baby girl was in the NICU, two physicians literally didn't leave her side. Their care was deeply personal and utterly committed. Seeing their devotion inspired me to turn my focus as a lawyer to helping physicians so their financial and other needs were being met, as a way of giving back to the profession that had given my daughter back to me.

What type of services does your practice offer?

We focus on contract reviews when physicians initially enter into an employment contract to make sure their needs are met and that there are no “hidden landmines” in the verbiage. We also represent physicians who run into difficulties with their employers while already employed and review offers of partnership.

What are RVUs?

“RVU” is a measure created by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to inform how much providers should be reimbursed for medical services. RVUs are assigned on the basis of several factors.

When I counsel physicians, I prefer to use the term “work RVUs” (wRVUs), which specifically relate to the physician's work, expertise, and time spent on a given procedure or service. “RVU” typically covers everything involved in, let's say, a procedure. This includes the operating room, the equipment, and so on, while “wRVU” focuses on the work actually performed by the surgeon.

wRVUs are typically less relevant for private practice physicians, but hospitals and health systems use that metric to determine productivity. And in a way, I suppose, that's fair. If Dr Smith and Dr Jones are employed at the same hospital, but Dr Smith sees mostly charity patients while Dr Jones sees private-pay or well-insured patients, then Dr Jones will generate more money, even if both physicians perform the same procedures or see the same number of patients. In that scenario, wRVUs are a fairer way to compensate physicians than compensation based on the hospital's revenue for each patient.

What factors determine wRVUs?

wRVUs are based on several factors, only one of which is the amount of time spent with the patient. I like to say that the system favors the “hands” over the “head.” What I mean is that a surgeon who spends an hour performing a procedure will be awarded more wRVUs for that hour compared with a primary care physician who spends an hour with a patient and uses his or her head in trying to figure out the diagnosis or treatment plan, even if the condition is rare, complex, or hard to treat.

What types of wRVU-related traps do you see physicians fall into?

The biggest trap I've come across is not having verbiage in a contract that allows the physician to receive regular updates regarding their wRVUs. In the absence of such updates, and without any warning, physicians might suddenly receive a communication from the hospital administration that they've fallen behind on meeting their wRVUs and might even be penalized.

I've been consulted by a number of physicians in that predicament, who were really burned by this lack of information and transparency.

One, a cardiologist, had his pay cut because his wRVUs had fallen well beneath the threshold. In fact, he was told that his employment was about to be terminated. His wRVU numbers landed him in the 10th percentile of productivity. He was really baffled because he had been seeing patients 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

I advised him to keep track of the patients he saw and to print out his daily schedule. Then we sat down with hospital administrators. They showed him their figures, which reported that he was seeing two to three patients a day. We showed him the printout of his actual schedule. It turned out that there was some type of glitch in the billing system and the fault lay with the billing department. But if he had been receiving regular reports, all along, he would have become aware of this issue much sooner, before his compensation was slashed and before he was threatened with termination.

Fortunately, he wasn't terminated, but his salary was still diminished as a result, even when he showed the administration that he had been seeing the appropriate number of patients.

Do you advise physicians to keep track of their wRVUs in general?

Yes, I think it's a very good idea for physicians to keep track of the number of patients they see and the procedures they perform because errors do occur, and these can affect compensation. Another physician client who was receiving regular productivity reports from her employer saw that her productivity suddenly plunged and that she had accumulated almost no wRVUs for a 1- to 2-week period. She knew how many patients she had seen during that time, and she was determined to get to the root of this bizarre report.

It turned out that several employees in the billing department were out sick at the same time. Because the billing department was understaffed, her work simply wasn't being posted. Two weeks may not sound like much, but the patients you see during that time might spell the difference between meeting the threshold of wRVUs and earning your bonus or being regarded as underperforming. The fact that she had a clear record of her patients made it possible for her to rectify the underestimation of her wRVUs during that period.

This brings me to the next trap I see frequently, which is that wRVUs are accrued when a service is posted, not when it's performed. When I review a contract, I always encourage physicians to include a provision that the wRVUs will be earned when the service is actually performed, rather than when the employer gets around to billing for it.

What other wRVU traps do you encounter?

A major wRVU compensation trap takes place when wRVU productivity is adjusted to reflect compensation modifiers. It results from subtle verbiage in the employment agreement that stipulates that wRVUs will be adjusted to reflect CMS modifiers. On the surface, that seems to make sense, and many physicians gloss over this language in the contract, seeing it merely as unimportant boilerplate. After all, because wRVU values originate from CMS, it would seem to make sense that they would be adjusted in accordance with CMS methodology.

But the reality is that wRVU production is actually quite separate and distinct from reimbursement modifiers. The best way to explain this is through an example. Operating on two hammertoes is obviously twice as much work as operating on one hammertoe. So if you're a surgeon and you operate on two toes of the same patient, one right after the other, you're performing twice as much surgery as you would if you had operated on only one toe. But the reimbursement for the second toe is 50% less than for the first. From the perspective of CMS, this is fair. The same preparation is required for the operating room, the supplies, the anesthesia, and so on whether the patient is having one toe repaired or two. But the physician is doing twice as much work.

So when hospitals use reimbursement methodology to calculate the physician's wRVU production, this can lead to a significant reduction in the physician's productivity compensation. When I review an employment agreement for a physician, I put in a provision that says wRVU production should be determined using only the current CMS wRVU table without regard to reimbursement modifiers.

Do you counsel primary care physicians differently from the way you counsel specialists?

I basically recommend the same approach for physicians in any specialty: You should compare your wRVU thresholds with the median benchmarks published by the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), which relies on data supplied by employers — including hospitals.

According to the 2025 MGMA Provider Compensation and Productivity Data Report, median wRVUs in hospital-owned practices in 2024 for primary care physicians, surgical specialists, and nonsurgical specialists were approximately 5700, 8000, and 6800, respectively. The issues are similar, regardless of specialty. It's just that each specialty has a different median benchmark and will have a bonus set by the hospital or health system based on the benchmark of that specialty. I always advise physicians to compare the thresholds that their employer is setting with the MGMA medians to make sure that the expectations they are supposed to meet are reasonable and fair.

Do you have any additional advice?

I think that all physicians should have an attorney review their employment agreement prior to accepting a new position or when there is any type of contractual change. Doctors are extremely proficient in clinical matters. They heal people. They save lives. But they aren't trained as lawyers, nor should they be — just as I'm not trained as a doctor.

Any doctor knows that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and having an experienced, skilled attorney review a contract can prevent all sorts of problems down the road. And of course, if an issue arises during one's employment, as it did with the physician who was about to be terminated, an attorney can help negotiate with the hospital administration as well.

For decades, clinicians have routinely prescribed beta-blockers to patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction (MI). Two new randomized trials published in The New England Journal of Medicine challenge this practice in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The findings indicate that beta-blockers remain safe in this group but may not provide consistent benefits, prompting a shift toward individualized decision-making.

The BETAMI-DANBLOCK trial combined two nearly identical trials conducted in Denmark and Norway. Together, they enrolled 5574 patients (mean age, 63 years; 20.8% women) with MI in the previous 7 or 14 days and with an LVEF of at least 40%. Coronary revascularization was required for BETAMI but not for DANBLOCK.

After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the composite endpoint of death from any cause, MI, unplanned revascularization, ischemic stroke, heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 14.2% of those treated with beta-blockers and 16.3% of those who weren't (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98). The benefit was mainly driven by a lower risk for MI (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92), although most endpoints, except for ischemic stroke, favored the treatment.

In contrast, the open label REBOOT trial was an investigator-initiated study funded by Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III. The trial enrolled 8438 patients (mean age, 61 years; 19.3 % women) with acute MI, with or without ST-segment elevation, and with LVEF greater than 40% at 109 centers in Spain and Italy. The participants were randomly assigned to receive beta-blockers or no beta-blockers.

After a median follow up of 3.7 years, there was no significant difference in the risk for death from any cause, reinfarction, or hospitalization for heart failure (22.5 % vs 21.7%; HR, 1.04; 95 % CI, 0.89-1.22). Secondary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, re-infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, were analyzed individually and showed no significant differences.

Both trials confirmed that beta-blockers are safe for patients with preserved LVEF.

The differing outcomes in BETAMI DANBLOCK and REBOOT CNIC reflect important contrasts in design and contemporary MI care. BETAMI DANBLOCK used a broader composite endpoint that captured a wider range of ischemic and arrhythmic events, increasing the sensitivity to detect treatment effects. This population also had a higher baseline ischemic risk.

REBOOT CNIC used a narrower primary endpoint with fewer total events, reducing statistical power. More comprehensive revascularization, intensive antithrombotic therapy, and lower baseline cardiovascular risk would likely further narrow the opportunity to detect a treatment benefit.

Together, these trials support a consistent conclusion: Beta-blockers are safe in patients with preserved LVEF, but routine prescribing offers uncertain benefits. They remain appropriate for residual angina, persistent tachycardia, clinically significant arrhythmias, and elevated ischemic risk. Omission is reasonable in stable, asymptomatic patients who have undergone complete revascularization and have preserved LVEF.

These findings reinforce the need for individualized treatment. Beta-blocker use after MI in patients with preserved LVEF should reflect each patient's clinical profile and residual risk rather than historical routines.

Tailored, institution-specific strategies that address demographic and socioeconomic factors are needed to bridge the gap in diabetic eye screening adherence. According to a large national cohort study, the problem is not solely due to patient factors. Instead, system-level failures appear to play a major role.

Researchers from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and UC Irvine conducted a retrospective study (2008-2023) of adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) to evaluate the diabetic eye disease care continuum in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). They tracked referrals, screenings, diagnoses, and treatments to identify predictors of adherence and assessed the potential impact of an automated referral system.

The study, published in Diabetes Care, included 8240 unscreened patients with T2D, of whom 43% received a referral, but only 16% completed screening within 1 year. Demographic, provider, and socioeconomic factors influenced adherence, but referrals emerged as the strongest predictor.

Using OpenAI's GPT-4o, the investigators also analyzed 16,735 physician notes from 250 patients who were referred for screening but missed their visits. The artificial intelligence program identified the most common reasons for missed appointments as health complexities (16%), scheduling or referral issues (16%), care received elsewhere (14%), patient nonadherence (7%), and logistical or transportation challenges (5%). However, for 46% of patients, the notes contained insufficient detail to determine possible causes of missed screenings.

According to corresponding author Vivek Rudrapatna, MD, PHD, with the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute at UCSF, the findings suggest that streamlining referral processes could meaningfully improve adherence.

“Even when patients engage with their primary care teams, many never receive or complete referrals,” Rudrapatna told Medscape Medical News. “Improving adherence requires integrated and automated interventions. For primary care clinicians, endocrinologists, and eye specialists, this means partnering with health IT teams to automate EHR-based referral prompts and teleophthalmology screening directly into diabetes care workflows.”

He emphasized that eye clinics must also have adequate scheduling capacity to manage increased patient volumes.

“Primary care and local eye clinics must work together to ensure referrals and follow-ups are closed-loop, not passive handoffs,” he said.

Rudrapatna added that partnering with social workers and care coordinators can help address social determinants of health, such as health literacy and transportation, both of which affect adherence. Improving diabetic eye screening, he said, requires multilevel collaboration between primary care, endocrinology, and optometry or ophthalmology, supported by technology and tailored to the needs of local patient populations.

The costs of noncompliance can be considerable. A separate study, also published in Diabetes Care, found that prolonged lapses in care for patients with PDR were common and disproportionately affected vulnerable groups. These lapses were also linked to persistent vision loss.

This retrospective national cohort study (2008-2023) analyzed data from 15,211 adults with PDR and ≥ 6 months of follow-up in the Sight Outcomes Research Collaborative. Overall, 71.8% experienced a lapse in care and 14.2% had lapses that lasted more than 24 months.

Lapses were more common among non-Hispanic Black patients, younger adults, and individuals with disabilities, and less frequent among those with poor vision or prior PDR treatment. Older age and previous PDR treatment predicted shorter lapses, whereas living in “distressed areas” predicted longer lapses. Visual acuity worsened after lapses, with greater deterioration following longer gaps in care.

Kim Donaghue, MB, PhD, past president of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes and professor at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia, said automated rescheduling systems could help reduce lapses in care once PDR is diagnosed.

Donaghue, who was not involved in either study, added that an education package explaining the vital importance of follow-up could also improve adherence.

“Certainly, flagging screening at diabetes consultations is important,” Donaghue told Medscape Medical News. “For this to be effective, though, there also needs to be an easy method of establishing that a referral was actually issued and received by the person with diabetes with an explanation of why it was issued.”

Rudrapatna reported receiving grant funding to UCSF from Genentech, Inc., Merck, Janssen, Takeda, Blueprint Medicines, Mitsubishi Tanabe, and Stryker; receiving payments for lectures from Natera and Ironwood; and having a financial stake in the companies ZebraMD, Acucare AI, and DataUnite.

Donaghue reported no relevant financial disclosures.

Patients at primary care clinics received more dementia diagnoses after implementation of a machine-learning tool designed to flag potential cases, according to a study published in JAMA Network.

The findings point to a potential solution for diagnosing dementia earlier in the disease process, said Malaz A. Boustani, MD, MPh, professor in the Department of Medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, who led the study.

“Changing or transforming primary care to accommodate the needs of people living with unrecognized dementia or mild cognitive impairment requires a scalable and sustainable solution with minimum time and minimum cost,” Boustani said.

An estimated 6 million Americans have dementia, and more than one third of those older than 55 will eventually develop the condition, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Boustani and his colleagues conducted a randomized clinical trial of more than 5300 adults aged more than 65 (mean age, 71 years; 62.2% women) at nine federally qualified health centers in Indianapolis over a 2-year period beginning in July 2022. Patients did not have a previous diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, or severe mental illness.

Clinics were randomized to one of three approaches. One group of 1724 patients received usual care with no routine screening for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Another 1300 patients were seen at clinics that used a machine learning algorithm that scanned electronic record data for indicators of dementia risk. A third group of 2301 patients received care at clinics that made diagnosis based on the algorithm plus a patient-reported survey of 10 questions on cognitive abilities, daily tasks, behavior, and mood.

Among clinics using the AI tool, clinicians would receive a notification if a particular patient showed signs of risk for dementia, and suggest ordering a memory test, referral to a specialist, and talking to the patient about any concerns.

Boustani said he and his colleagues validated the diagnosis by analyzing more than 2000 cases of ADRD and more than 11,000 people without those conditions in Indiana. They then divided the population into two cohorts, one of which was used to train the program and the second was used for validation, producing accuracy of close to 80%, Boustani said.

Clinics randomized to the algorithm and survey approach showed 31% higher odds of new ADRD diagnoses (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64) than usual care clinics (12-month incidence, 12.4%). Clinics using the algorithm alone had a lower incidence of diagnosis than usual care (12-month incidence, 10.3%; aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.63-1.11).

After 12 months, 36.7% of patients in clinics using the survey and algorithm approach had undergone a dementia-related diagnostic test compared to 27.8% of patients in clinics using algorithms alone and 29% of those in usual care clinics.

Chelsea Cox, MPH, MSW, social worker and doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said primary care clinicians are often overburdened and do not have time to screen for ADRD.

“The tools that were employed in this research study remove some of those barriers to help facilitate not only from the patient side, being able to report concerns about memory and cognition, but from the clinician and primary care provider side, to be able to very efficiently determine whether somebody's at risk and should be referred for additional cognitive and neuropsychological testing,” Cox said.Various study authors reported receiving grants, consulting fees, and personal fees, along with having equity interest and holding patents from the National Institutes of Health, the Academy for Continued Healthcare Learning, Cognivue, and Pfizer, among others. No other disclosures were reported.

Higher daily step counts were associated with a lower risk for Parkinson's disease (PD); however, this association weakened over time, suggesting that low step counts might be an early sign of the disease rather than a risk factor.

""This work supports the continued labelling of low physical activity as a marker for Parkinson's disease, rather than as a risk factor leading to Parkinson's disease,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Aidan Acquah, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, England. It was published online on November 24, 2025, in npj Parkinson's Disease.

Due to the observational nature of the study, the possibility of unmeasured or residual confounding in the observed associations could not be ruled out. The UK Biobank provided limited health data, which were used to identify PD cases, and the database lacked information on disease severity or subtype. The number of incident cases was small during the follow-up period.

This study was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Doctoral Training in Health Data Science and by GSK plc as part of an iCase studentship. One author reported receiving research grants from Swiss Re and Novo Nordisk. One author reported being an employee of GSK.

Over the long term, SCAI and CRT will explore collaborative research opportunities, including novel registry and clinical trial programs. 

Collaboration is key to the future of medicine-interventional cardiology in particular-and SCAI's commitment to improve outcomes for our patients. SCAI and CRT share a common mission to advance interventional cardiology through collaboration, science, advocacy, regulatory policies, and education. While coming at these goals from different vantage points, our new partnership reflects the growing alignment in vision, and SCAI looks forward to the many benefits of working together with CRT.""

Srihari S. Naidu, MD, MSCAI, President, SCAI

The partnership will be guided by the SCAI–CRT Task Force, composed of representatives from both organizations who will identify and coordinate collaborative opportunities. In support of these initiatives, SCAI will form a working group to evaluate research projects, including the development of registries and clinical trials, to be submitted by SCAI, its members, and CRT's research network. CRT will provide core lab services, and SCAI and CRT will work jointly to secure external funding.

""Together, we will create new avenues to engage physicians, foster innovation, and build programs that address the clinical and policy challenges shaping our field. By combining our strengths, we can accelerate investigator-led research, expand professional development, and ultimately deliver better care for patients,"" said J. Dawn Abbott, MD, MSCAI, chair of the SCAI–CRT Partnership Task Force and president-elect of SCAI.

""Through CRT's collaboration with SCAI, we're expanding the impact of both organizations. This partnership allows us to connect clinical science, advocacy, and education in ways that will drive innovation and bring together experts from across cardiovascular medicine. Our shared vision is to strengthen the pipeline of research, inspire the next generation of interventionalists, and ensure that patients everywhere benefit from the rapid progress being made in the interventional lab,"" said Ron Waksman, MD, MSCAI, chair of the CRT meeting.

Tracking how genes switch on and off in the brain is essential for understanding many neurological diseases, yet the tools to monitor this activity are often invasive or unable to capture subtler changes over time. One emerging alternative is to use engineered serum markers ⎯ small proteins produced by targeted brain cells that can travel into the bloodstream, where they can be measured with a simple blood test.

Referred to as released markers of activity, or RMAs, these molecules can serve as a sensitive tool for monitoring brain activity, but they also persist in the bloodstream for many hours. That long half-life can drown out intervening changes in the biological signal of interest.

Rice University bioengineers have developed a way to make RMAs even more sensitive, pointing to other diagnostic scenarios where they could be deployed. According to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team designed an erasable marker that can be cut apart inside the bloodstream by an enzyme which acts like a pair of molecular scissors: Once it cleaves the RMAs, the previous signal disappears and a new reading becomes possible.

The key advance here is a new way of thinking about serum markers ⎯ that we can modify them inside the bloodstream when we need to. This broad concept has many potential applications, ranging from extending the marker's half-life to improve detectability, or erasing them to remove the background signal and improve temporal resolution. Currently, markers are usually extracted from the body and interpreted 'as-is,' which limits their usefulness.""

Jerzy Szablowski, assistant professor of bioengineering at Rice and corresponding author on the study

In an animal model, a single injection of the cleaving enzyme removed about 90% of the RMAs' background signal within half an hour. That reset made it possible to observe subtle gene-expression changes that had previously remained undetected. The researchers also showed they could repeat this process and measure how quickly the marker reappeared, offering a clearer picture of how gene activity evolves over time.

This approach could eventually enable clinicians to detect problems or measure any changes in how a patient responds to treatment with greater precision, using simple, minimally-invasive testing.""We introduced a modification where the RMAs were made sensitive to a targeted protease ⎯ an enzyme that can cleave them in half,"" said Shirin Nouraein, a graduate student in Rice's Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology program who is a first author on the study. ""Using this enzyme, we separated the domain that provides signal from the domain that makes it last a long time in blood, making the background signal decay within minutes. We found a significant elevation in signal changes when we used these markers to track the dynamics of gene expression in the brain.""The approach could have an impact on areas of medicine beyond neurology: If markers can be edited inside the body, their behavior can be tuned for many diagnostic purposes, including, for example, using RMAs for detecting tumors or lung disease using urine tests.The project is one example of Rice's intensive focus on brain research and reflects the university's strategic commitment to leading innovations in health. It also aligns with the mission of the recently-launched Rice Brain Institute, which was established to accelerate technologies for understanding and treating brain disorders.

The Family Heart Foundation, a leading research and advocacy organization, published new research in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology revealing significant gaps in cholesterol management during 2022-23 among U.S. adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Findings show that only 13% of adults with ASCVD were meeting three key components of optimal low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) management, including receiving guideline-recommended therapy, consistently taking the therapy, and reaching an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL. According to the study, many factors contributed to this gap, including the low usage of non-statin therapies to treat LDL-C in high-risk patients. Based on the Family Heart Database® of 3.6 million individuals with ASCVD, the data showed:

LDL-Cholesterol is a critical modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Timely, consistent, and appropriate management of LDL-Cholesterol reduces the incidence of an additional heart attack, stroke, or the need for an invasive cardiovascular procedure. However, LDL-Cholesterol management in the U.S. is subpar and life-threatening. In fact, 2 women and people who are Black or younger than 50 years of age, but already have cardiovascular disease, are the least likely to receive optimal care. We can, and should, be doing better by the American public.""

Katherine Wilemon, founder and chief executive officer, Family Heart Foundation

Titled ""Cholesterol Management in U.S. Adults with ASCVD in the Family Heart Database During 2022-2023,"" the study assessed LDL-C management in patients with ASCVD based on the lowest reported LDL-C level, the intensity of dispensed LDL-C therapy, and the duration of dispensed LDL-C therapy during 2022-23. The study also suggests actionable steps that the health care community can take to improve adherence to cholesterol guideline recommendations, including increased use of non-statin therapies, increased focus on overlooked subgroups of at-risk patients, addressing barriers to medication adherence, and increased lab testing. In addition, the discussion emphasizes the importance of clinician and individual education, clinician-individual discussion, team-based care and the potential of LDL-C quality metrics and health-system level interventions to improve LDL-C management in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Maternal eating disorders linked to higher asthma and wheezing risks in children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251202/Maternal-eating-disorders-linked-to-higher-asthma-and-wheezing-risks-in-children.aspx","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:32:00 GMT","

Eating disorders in mums-to-be are linked to a heightened risk of asthma and wheezing in their children, irrespective of the type of disorder, presence of co-existing depression/anxiety, or the timing of their child's exposure, finds research published online in the journal Thorax.

The findings prompt the researchers to call for the inclusion of dedicated support in the healthcare of pregnant women with eating disorders to improve the respiratory health of their children.

To date, research on the effects of maternal mental health on children's respiratory health has focused predominantly on depression, anxiety, and broadly defined stress, with limited evidence on less common conditions like eating disorders, note the researchers.

And while the evidence on the consequences of maternal eating disorders has consistently reported on their children's cognitive, social, emotional, behavioral and eating behaviours, the evidence is less consistent for physical health outcomes.

To strengthen the evidence base, the researchers analysed data from 131,495 mother and child pairs from 7 distinct European birth cohorts in the EU Child Cohort Network (EUCCN), looking at potential associations between maternal eating disorders before pregnancy and their children's preschool wheezing and school age asthma.

They subsequently explored potential associations between women who didn't have depression or anxiety by type of eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia) and period of exposure (pregnancy or after birth).

The prevalence of maternal eating disorders before pregnancy ranged from nearly 1% to 17% across the 7 cohorts. And the prevalence of co-existing depression/anxiety among women with eating disorders ranged from 11% to 75%.

The prevalence of preschool wheezing ranged from 21% to nearly 50%, while that of school age asthma ranged from just over 2% to nearly 17.5%.

An eating disorder before pregnancy was associated with an overall 25% heightened risk of preschool wheeze, although this varied considerably in each cohort, and with a 26% heightened risk of school age asthma, which was much more consistent across the cohorts.

These heightened risks weakened slightly after excluding mothers who had depression/anxiety.

Similar associations with childhood asthma were found for anorexia and bulimia, while preschool wheezing was associated with bulimia only.

Although the observed associations differed slightly across exposure periods (before, during, or after pregnancy), no distinct window of susceptibility emerged.

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the prevalence of eating and respiratory disorders varied widely across the cohorts.

""Although this may make some of the findings less comparable, the direction and the magnitude of the associations were relatively stable in all the analyses,"" explain the researchers.

But they add: ""The mechanisms underlying the associations between maternal mental health and childhood respiratory outcomes remain unclear.""

They suggest that mental ill health and associated stress may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, disrupting the baby's lung development during pregnancy and maturation of the child's immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to immune mediated conditions, including asthma.

""Children born to mothers with [eating disorders] are at an increased risk of foetal growth restriction, prematurity, Caesarean delivery and low birth weight. These are also well-known risk factors for respiratory morbidity, suggesting multiple possible mediating pathways in the link between maternal [eating disorders] and childhood respiratory outcomes,"" they point out.

""In addition, research has shown that both mental health disorders and asthma involve dysregulation in immune response and inflammatory pathways, suggesting a common genetic basis that may contribute to both conditions,"" they add.

They conclude: ""There is a need to include maternal [eating disorders] in research on early- life respiratory risk factors and to integrate [eating disorder] screening and support into maternal healthcare to improve respiratory outcomes in offspring.""

In-flight cardiac arrest is extremely rare, yet catastrophic, and responsible for up to 86 % of all deaths in the air. A new comprehensive literature review highlights systemic and policy shortcomings of current aviation safety standards, calling for global alignment. Recommendations include regulated and mandated automated external defibrillators (AEDs) on board, standardized cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) protocols training, and integration of telemedicine. The article in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, aims to inform policy regulators, airlines, and international aviation bodies to improve in-flight medical emergency preparedness and response protocols.

In-flight medical emergencies are an expected challenge, given the global air travel passenger volume of nearly four billion passengers annually. The most prominent risk factors for in-flight cardiac arrest include male sex, age, pre-existing cardiac disease, and duration of flight time. With an aging global passenger population and increasing flight durations due to advancing aircraft technology, the risk and frequency of in-flight cardiac arrest are expected to rise.

""Improving survival rates following a flight passenger's cardiac arrest hinges on several critical considerations,"" states senior author Adrian Baranchuk, MD, Queens University, Canada.

The cabin environment poses a unique challenge, including the confined space of the fuselage, limitations to equipment accessibility, and inconsistent crew CPR and AED training. Currently, only the US legally mandates defibrillators on commercial flights, whereas Canada only federally recommends it and leaves it to the discretion of the airline itself to include them.""

Adrian Baranchuk, MD, Queens University, Canada

AED utilization has a significant impact on survival outcomes in multiple environments. The likelihood of survival for shockable sudden cardiac arrest decreases by 7–10% per minute without defibrillation. Due to the narrow intervention window, diverting a plane for an emergency landing is often unattainable, as it often takes longer than 20 minutes from cruising altitude to a safe landing.

The disparities in AED implementation may hinder swift emergency responses. Without an onboard AED, only approximately 6% of in-flight cardiac arrest patients survive to hospital. Further projections suggest that equipping all commercial aircraft with AEDs could save 35–93 lives annually worldwide.

First author Mario D. Bassi, MD, University of Ottawa, Canada, points out, ""Currently, the data show that AEDs are consistently reliable, sensitive to detecting and treating in-flight cardiac arrest, and cost-effective to airlines. AEDs are proven to be safe, with no evidence of detriment or reduced functionality emerging in the compromised environment of the aircraft cabin, such as turbulence. While prompt recognition of a cardiac arrest and CPR initiation are vital, the chances of survival jump from 6% to up to 70% when an AED is used. However, up to one third of EU aircraft were found to not have an AED available in-flight.""

Based on their comprehensive review of the existing literature, the authors recommend:

""The primary determinant impacting sudden cardiac arrest survival is the time to defibrillation,"" concludes Dr. Baranchuk. ""We believe our recommendations and appropriate measures must be strongly considered by policymakers and airlines alike to improve passenger safety and survival rates.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Experts call for comprehensive measures to reduce injury risks for female athletes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251202/Experts-call-for-comprehensive-measures-to-reduce-injury-risks-for-female-athletes.aspx","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:30:00 GMT","

Creating a safe, gender-specific, supportive environment-one that is free of body shaming and idealised female forms, for example-is key to minimising female athletes' future risks of injury and protecting their health, emphasizes the Female/woman/girl Athlete Injury pRevention (FAIR) Consensus Statement-the first of its kind-published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Women and girls have increasingly been taking part in sports, which has led to a concomitant rise in their risk of injury. But how best to minimize this risk has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive and practical gender-specific evidence.

In a bid to tackle this knowledge gap and both promote and protect female athletes' health, the International Olympic Committee convened a panel of sports and exercise specialists from around the globe to draw up a series of workable recommendations, with the aim of informing current policy and practice and guiding future avenues of research.

The 56 recommendations in the Statement are based on syntheses of the best available evidence, combined with the lived experiences of athletes, as well as those involved in regulation, policy, practice, professional and personal support, to span the 'whole sports system'.

The recommendations, which range from universal to sport specific, also include primary injury prevention strategies; policy, rules, and legislation; personal protective equipment; training; secondary injury prevention; modifiable risk factors; and approaches to diversity and inclusion.

""Injury prevention strategies cannot work if female/women/girl athletes do not have access to resources, knowledge or training/competition environments that support implementation of best practice injury prevention, health, and performance strategies that consider their needs,"" says the Statement.

""The FAIR recommendations to facilitate a supportive environment include creating equitable funding and resource allocation (eg, injury prevention implementation, equipment, coach/support staff, gender/sex-preferred uniforms and surveillance systems with female/woman/girl-specific health codes) and access to expertise and knowledge through education, targeted research and hiring practices,"" it continues.

Everyone who works in sport needs to be involved, urges the Statement.

""Recommendations such as 'Create safe spaces free from body shaming or promoting ideal body types, or gendered norms' might appear sensible, but they are NOT always part of female/woman/athletes' reality. They should be front-of-mind and non-negotiable. At all levels of sport, responsibility must be taken for actions that can influence female/woman/girl athlete health,"" it emphasizes.

Other related recommendations include creating and enforcing gender based policies and procedures to tackle interpersonal violence and harassment, and fostering a non-judgmental culture in which issues, such as pregnancy, bone health, and breast care can be discussed and accommodated.

Policies to address unconscious and explicit social and cultural biases against women and girls' sports participation and health are also essential, it says.

Lifelong injury prevention needs to start early to forge good preventive behaviors. And it needs to be a collaborative effort between athletes, coaches, and practitioners, and be evidence based, says the Statement.

Other key recommendations include:

● Mandatory neuromuscular training warm-ups for all sports and all ages to ward off first and recurrent leg injuries, lasting a minimum of 10 minutes, twice a week

● Implementation and enforcement of rules/policies that penalise unlawful head/body contact

● Mandatory injury management across all sports to prevent concussion

● All child and teen ice hockey players to wear mouthguards

● All cyclists, skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders, horseriders to wear helmets

● Neckguards/protectors to be worn for collision/contact ice sports

""We recognize that these recommendations must be responsive to diverse contexts, including uniqueness in experiences, expertise, geography, culture, healthcare access, sport structure, level of participation and sociocultural considerations,"" says the Statement.

But it concludes: ""To bolster female/women/girl athlete health and safety, every person (at all levels of sport participation and in their own specific context) can, and should, take responsibility to carefully consider and action these recommendations.""

New Houston Methodist research has revealed that a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also plays a role in regulating DNA mismatch repair, a process essential for replicating genetic information and cell health. The finding could change how scientists understand both cancer and neurodegeneration. 

The study, published in Nucleic Acids Research, finds that the protein, 'TDP43' regulates genes that fix DNA mistakes. When this protein is lost or overproduced, these repair genes become overactive, damaging neurons and destabilizing the genome, which could lead to cancer. 

DNA repair is one of the most fundamental processes in biology. What we found is that TDP43 is not just another RNA-binding protein involved in splicing, but a critical regulator of mismatch repair machinery. That has major implications for diseases like ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) where this protein goes awry."" 

Muralidhar L. Hegde, Ph.D., lead investigator, professor of neurosurgery at the Houston Methodist Research Institute's Center for Neuroregeneration

The team also found an association between the protein and cancer. Their analysis of large cancer datasets revealed that high levels correlate with increased mutation rates. 

""This tells us that the biology of this protein is broader than just ALS or FTD,"" Hegde said. ""In cancers, this protein appears to be upregulated and linked to increased mutation load. That puts it at the intersection of two of the most important disease categories of our time: neurodegeneration and cancer."" 

Researchers said the discovery opens doors for new treatments. By reducing overactive DNA repair in lab models, they partially reversed damage caused by TDP43 problems. Hegde said that Controlling DNA mismatch repair may offer a therapeutic strategy. 

Other collaborators in the study were Vincent Provasek, Suganya Rangaswamy, Manohar Kodavati, Joy Mitra, Vikas Malojirao, Velmarini Vasquez, Gavin Britz and Sankar Mitra from Houston Methodist; Albino Bacolla and John Tainer from MD Anderson Cancer Center; Issa Yusuf and Zuoshang Xu from University of Massachusetts; Guo-Min Li from UT Southwestern Medical Center and Ralph Garruto from Binghamton University. 

The research was primarily supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Sherman Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Challenge Fund and internal funding from the Houston Methodist Research Institute.

The chemical composition of cryogenically frozen materials that have remained hydrated is technically challenging to investigate due to the limited radiation resistance of hydrated living cells. 

A typical dosage for single-particle tomography is around 40 e-/Å2. This dose is far lower than what is generally necessary to obtain an electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum image (SI) from an inorganic sample, which can range from ~107 to 108 e-/Å2.

This is due in part to the ionization of edges, which have smaller inelastic scattering cross-sections than elastic scattering cross-sections. Previous scintillator/CCD EELS detectors were inefficient in converting rapid electrons into readable signals, requiring a larger dose to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Integrating the direct detection technology with the GIF Continuum® K3® improves collection efficiency while lowering the overall dose of the EELS test. This article demonstrates how the GIF Continuum and K3 can be used together to assess Ca distribution within a biological cell.

Human retinal ganglion cells were cultivated on carbon grids and treated with an organic calcium phosphate solution.

The hydrated samples were plunge-frozen in liquid N2 and cryogenically transported to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using the 626 cryo-transfer holder. The (S)TEM was operated at 200 kV. Latitude® S was utilized to examine the TEM grid for mitochondria.

Once the mitochondria were detected, the microscope's illumination mode was changed to STEM. EELS SI were obtained at a dispersion of 0.9 eV/ch and a total energy range of 3,000 eV.

DualEELS™ was employed to reduce multiple scattering from the core-loss edges, as the majority of the sample region was ≥1.5 t/λ.

The EELS SI were obtained with the in-situ SI tool in DigitalMicrograph®, which stores each SI pass separately. Following the acquisition, each pass was examined for H+ bubble production in the mitochondria.

Using a pixel dwell duration of 1.0 ms and an 8 × 8 subpixel scan array, the total dosage per pass was maintained at 18.37 e-/Å2. H+ bubbles appeared after a total dose of ~300 e-/Å2, saving the first 15 runs of the data set.

Using the in-situ technique, the first 15 passes were spatially aligned (drift corrected) and added together.

Due to the sample's limited dosage limits, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to denoise the spectra. A model for dealing with overlapping C K and Ca L2,3 edges, as well as plural scattering, was developed using multiple linear least squares fitting.

Figure 1a shows an aligned and summed annular dark-field (ADF) picture of the mitochondria. Bright, white contrasts represent places in the mitochondria where calcium is thought to concentrate. Figure 1b shows that Ca accumulates in the purple regions, which correlate with the bright regions in the ADF image.



Figure 1. a) Simultaneous annular dark field (ADF) image of the mitochondria. b) EELS elemental map showing that the areas in purple correspond to the presence of Ca. Image Credit: Gatan, Inc.

Combining the sensitivity of the K3 camera with the high-performance GIF Continuum optics, it was demonstrated that the stark contrast in the ADF STEM image corresponds to Ca buildup within the mitochondria.

Given the highly limited dosage budget, a typical scintillator-based detector would have been unable to perform this measurement on this scale.

The ability to save passes separately using in-situ spectrum imaging showed how the mitochondria behaved with cumulative dosage and to exclude SI passes from the data that were contaminated by H+ bubbles.

Latitude S enabled a preliminary survey of the TEM grid using bright-field TEM imaging, reducing the time required to find potential mitochondria. For more details on this subject, please visit the publication in Structure.1

Intrusive thoughts and psychotic-like experiences among new parents are far more common than previously thought - according to new research from the University of East Anglia.

A study published today reveals the mental health challenges faced by both mums and dads in the first year after childbirth.

The team hope their work will lead to greater awareness, early screening, and accessible mental health support for all parents, not just those with diagnosed conditions.

The perinatal period is a time of huge change for parents, and previous research has shown that more than one in five mothers experience mental health challenges during this time.

Challenges like sleep deprivation, stress, and hormonal changes can all take a toll on the mental health of new parents.

Most research to date has focused on depression and anxiety because they're so common. But we wanted to look beyond that and explore the wider range of mental health experiences parents face.""

Dr. Jo Hodgekins, lead researcher from UEA's Norwich Medical School

The research team recruited participants via parenting sites including Mumsnet, Netmums, Dads Matter UK, and social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,

A total of 349 parents, who had had a baby within the past 12 months, took part in an anonymous online survey.

""Male parents may experience these symptoms due to sleep deprivation, heightened stress, and the psychological adjustment to new responsibilities and identity as a father,"" said Dr Hodgekins.

""But this result might be skewed by the fact that the vast majority of the participants, around 90 per cent, were female. It would certainly be interesting to focus on recruiting more male participants in future research.""

The study highlights that these experiences are not only widespread but often deeply distressing, with symptoms strongly linked to lower parenting confidence, higher stress, and increased depression and anxiety - suggesting a ripple effect on family wellbeing.

""We found that psychotic-like experiences and intrusive thoughts are common among new parents. For a significant minority, these experiences cause severe distress, which is linked to higher parenting stress and lower perceived competence and satisfaction.""

""Our work highlights the need to normalise some of these experiences for new parents, reducing stigma and raising awareness so that conversations can be opened up about them.

""Intrusive thoughts and psychotic-like experiences don't always mean there's a clinical disorder, but they're common and can seriously affect parenting, so they deserve attention.""

""However, we also need to go beyond normalisation, by providing tailored and targeted support for those who find such experiences distressing, to improve mental health and parenting outcomes.""

For many people living with cancer, symptoms such as pain, anxiety or insomnia can quickly spiral into an emergency room visit. Such visits can be financially costly and take an emotional toll on patients and their caregivers. 

A new study led by Mayo Clinic researchers found that using digital check-ins and a remote care team can help patients manage symptoms before they reach a crisis point.

""Our goal was simple but ambitious,"" says study lead Andrea Cheville, M.D., professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.

We wanted to see if automating symptom check-ins and care through the electronic health record could improve patients' lives without adding to the burden on oncology teams. What we found is that this approach not only eased symptoms like anxiety and depression but also kept thousands of patients out of the hospital. That tells us technology can help us successfully extend the reach and efficacy of care."" 

Andrea Cheville, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center

For Becky Johnson, participating in the Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control Trial (E2C2) meant better sleep - despite the anxiety she felt about her double breast cancer diagnosis in 2022 at the age of 40. 

""I was continually Googling for more information about treatments, prognosis, new terminology and the experiences of others. And the steroid medications I took for treatment prior to chemo messed with my ability to sleep, too. It got to a point where my body's norm was to wake in the middle of the night and not fall back asleep, taking a toll on my ability to heal,"" says Johnson, program director for the Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences Sonography Program. 

As part of the trial, Johnson regularly submitted digital surveys about various aspects of her health. Insomnia quickly rose to the top, prompting a phone call from a nurse, who counseled Johnson on ways to get a better night's rest. The nurse also gave Johnson a link to a self-paced online class with sleep strategies based in cognitive behavioral therapy. 

""A virtual or phone call visit, especially when I didn't have anything physically wrong, was so convenient and efficient,"" says Johnson. The intervention helped, and her sleep improved. 

To make such interventions possible, the researchers developed automations in the Plummer Chart, the software system that manages patients' electronic health records (EHRs) and helps Mayo teams coordinate care. Between 2019 and 2023, just over 50,200 patients across 15 cancer specialties at Mayo Clinic enrolled in the E2C2 trial. Like Johnson, they filled out short surveys about pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and other symptoms before clinic visits or monthly between visits. The system automatically sorted their responses. Mild scores were simply logged, moderate ones triggered the system to send the patient self-care tips, and severe scores prompted outreach by a remote symptom care manager - a nurse or social worker who could work with patients via phone or video. 

Behind the scenes, the software became both an automated traffic controller and safety net. For care teams, it routed information to patients automatically so they could focus on the work that required their expertise. For patients, it made getting support easier, with no additional appointments or travel. 

The trial results showed that the automated surveys and responses built into the EHR made care more efficient and, ultimately, improved patients' symptoms. 

All of this was achieved with just 2-3 full-time care managers plus 20 percent of one physician's time supporting more than 50,000 study participants. 

The E2C2 trial showcases a new approach to using digital tools in cancer care. By automating routine monitoring and triaging of patient symptoms and well-being through the patient's electronic health record, a small care team can support a large patient population. 

""The gains we saw are encouraging and point to a scalable way to extend supportive oncology care beyond the clinic walls, meeting patients where they are,"" says Dr. Cheville. ""The next step is to ensure that these tools are available to healthcare teams, enabling them to efficiently reach every patient who needs supportive care."" 

The E2C2 trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI) as part of the Cancer Moonshot℠. The study was conducted as part of NCI's IMPACT Consortium. Review the study for a complete list of authors, disclosures and additional funding.

In an article published in Advanced Science, the researchers identify how neural stem cells in preterm infants are injured following cerebral hemorrhage.

We have managed to create a model where we can look at how these injuries develop in following cerebral hemorrhage and thus map the mechanisms and molecules that influence the process.This is an important step on the way to finding a treatment that can help these children."" 

Magnus Gram, associate professor of biomedicine and researcher, Malmö University

Preterm birth affects approximately 15 million newborns globally each year and is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Cerebral hemorrhage occurs in up to 20 per cent of extremely preterm infants (born before week 28). Severe cerebral hemorrhages in preterm infants increase the risk of cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments. In the most severe cases, the hemorrhage can be life-threatening or lead to extensive brain damage with motor and cognitive difficulties.

Using the 3D model, researchers have succeeded in recreating the vulnerable and important subventricular zone (SVZ).

""The brain's cavities - the ventricles - contain cerebrospinal fluid, which contributes to communication between the brain and the blood. The SVZ contains an area of immature blood vessels that are very fragile. When these vessels rupture, bleeding occurs and blood enters the ventricles, causing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).

The SVZ is also a source of nerve cell formation. The cerebral hemorrhage has a harmful effect on these neural stem cells, primarily because toxic breakdown products in the blood leak out and damage large parts of the child's brain.

""The hemoglobin in the blood is a strong oxidant and acts a bit like a ""rusting agent"" in the brain. The consequences of haemoglobin ending up in the wrong place in the body are one of the main focuses of my research,"" says Gram.

Previously, it has only been possible to study these reactions by analysing cerebrospinal fluid or blood from preterm infants or using experimental animal models in which haemorrhaging is induced in the animals. Both methods have clear limitations.

""The advantage of this compared to animal models is that we are looking at human cells, and that the model is reproducible and we can manipulate factors in a completely different way,"" adds Gram, who worked alongside researchers from Lund University, Karolinska Institutet and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Anna Herland, professor at the AIMES research centre at KTH and Karolinska Institutet, is part of the research team: ""The fact that we are also seeing relevant responses in both simulated conditions and patient samples is very important, as there is currently no established treatment for these patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gut bacteria produce immune-boosting compounds in response to tetracyclines","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251203/Gut-bacteria-produce-immune-boosting-compounds-in-response-to-tetracyclines.aspx","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:10:00 GMT","

The microbes inside our bodies not only help break down food but also impact our health. Yet their precise influence is not always understood, especially in the presence of prescription drugs. Now, researchers in ACS Central Science report how one of the most abundant gut bacteria responds to tetracyclines, a class of commonly prescribed antibiotics. Newly characterized signals released by the bacterium could aid the host's immune response, inhibit pathogens and restructure the gut microbiome.

""We previously showed that exogenous molecules can trigger production of otherwise 'hidden' metabolites in marine- and soil-dwelling microbes,"" says Mohammad Seyedsayamdost, the corresponding author of the study. ""Our goal here was to extend this analysis to human microbiota and examine their responses to FDA-approved drugs.""

Every day, medical professionals across the country prescribe drug treatments for a variety of ailments. Although these drugs may have their desired effect, there is also the possibility that they impact the microbes that keep us healthy. Antibiotics, for example, often inactivate not only offending microbes but also beneficial gut bacteria. Scientists have proposed the idea that consuming pharmaceuticals could also alter microbial metabolism, changing the compounds that bacteria release into the body and impacting human health. To study this, Seyedsayamdost and colleagues exposed separate cultures of the prominent gut microbe Bacteroides dorei to hundreds of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs - such as antihistamines, hypertension drugs, anticancer agents and antibiotics - and looked for metabolic changes compared to untreated bacterial cultures.

After incubating B. dorei with and without pharmaceuticals, the researchers isolated and identified compounds the bacterium secreted. Among the various drugs tested, low doses of tetracycline antibiotics had the strongest effect on bacterial cultures, inducing the microbes to produce two types of new compounds: doreamides, named in this study, and N-acyladenosines. Further testing showed that both compounds trigger human immune cells to produce proteins called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can help respond to infections. The doreamides also induced production of host antimicrobial peptides that inhibited the growth of several bacterial strains, including pathogenic ones, but not the growth of B. dorei.

The experiments demonstrated a secondary effect of antibiotic treatment beyond inactivating microbes directly. Low-dose tetracyclines caused B. dorei to produce compounds that stimulate the immune system and induce immune cells to generate antimicrobial peptides, which could alter the microbial balance in the human gut. These findings set the stage for animal studies to explore possible therapeutic properties of the doreamides.

Long-term antidepressant use in Australia has risen steadily over the past decade, with the largest increase seen in young people aged 10-24, where rates have more than doubled.

The finding is from a new study undertaken by University of South Australia researchers, who analyzed dispensing data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) covering more than 300,000 antidepressant users between 2014 and 2023.

The most comprehensive study of its kind, published in the Pharmacaoepidemiology and Drug Safety Journal, reveals that 45% of young people on antidepressants are staying on them for more than 12 months, and a substantial number are still using them after two years.

Long-term use – defined as taking antidepressants continuously for more than 12 months – has risen markedly across all age groups, although the most dramatic increase is occurring in young Australians.

Lead author, UniSA researcher Dr. Lasantha Ranwala, says the findings highlight a critical shift in how antidepressants are being used in Australia, raising concerns over potential overprescribing and inconsistency with guidelines that recommend a careful review of medication use after 6-12 months.

Not only are more people taking antidepressants, but once they start, they are staying on them for longer."" 

Dr. Lasantha Ranwala, lead author, UniSA researcher 

The medical practitioner, AI researcher and UniSA PhD candidate says this is especially concerning for younger age groups, where clinical guidelines generally recommend psychological therapies as the first line of treatment.

Across the whole population, long-term antidepressant use increased from 66 to nearly 85 users per 1000 people between 2014 and 2022, before stabilising slightly in 2023. Women continued to record significantly higher use than men throughout the study period.

""While antidepressants play a role in managing moderate to severe depression, prolonged use can increase the risk of side effects and make withdrawal more difficult,"" Dr. Ranwala says.

""Withdrawal symptoms are often misinterpreted as a return of the underlying condition, which can further extend treatment, exacerbating the problem.""

The researchers also found no meaningful improvement in efforts to wean people off antidepressants.

The proportion of long-term users who were put on a lower dose remained constant over the decade – 17.9% in 2014 compared with 17.8% in 2023.

""This lack of movement suggests that deprescribing strategies are not being routinely implemented in clinical practice,"" according to co-author, UniSA Professor Libby Roughead, Director of the Quality Use of Medicines and Pharmacy Research Centre.

""Given the increase in long-term use, especially among young people, this is an area that requires urgent attention,"" says Prof. Roughead.

Researchers point to several drivers behind this trend, including a spike in mental health issues among young people, rising rates of psychological distress generally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and difficulties accessing psychological therapies.

With mental health demands at an all-time high, the authors argue for a more balanced approach that ensures antidepressants are used appropriately and that patients receive adequate support to reduce or discontinue treatment when the clinical need has passed.

""Australia needs a stronger framework for safely tapering antidepressants, along with better access to psychological care,"" says Prof Roughead.

UniSA co-author, Associate Professor Andrew Andrade, says emerging technologies including predictive analytics and clinical decision-support tools may also help clinicians identify when deprescribing is appropriate.

""Clinicians need stronger support systems to safely deprescribe antidepressants,"" Assoc Prof. Andrade says.

""Smart technologies can help identify patients who are good candidates for tapering, coordinate timely access to non-pharmacological treatments, and provide clear, step-by-step guidance to clinicians and patients throughout the slow dose-reduction process.""

Women's Soccer

The Kang Women's Institute will focus on the investing in women's specific research. Franck Fife / Getty Images

U.S. Soccer on Tuesday announced the launch of the Kang Women's Institute, a platform designed to accelerate advancements in women's soccer through science, innovations and research-backed best practices.

The institute, backed by Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang, aims to better inform the training and well-being of women and girls at all levels of the sport.

The news was unveiled in Manhattan at the 2025 U.S. Soccer Summit, at the outset of a women's soccer panel hosted by U.S. women's national team star Kelley O'Hara. The panel included Kang, U.S. Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone and University of North Carolina researcher Dr. Abbie Smith-Ryan.

Kang's ties to women's soccer run deep. She has been part of the Spirit's ownership since 2020, becoming majority owner in 2022. The club won its first championship in 2021.

It was Kang's time at the Spirit that opened her eyes to the existing limitations on women's professional soccer teams in the United States. This, she said, inspired her to kickstart a journey that has seen her invest roughly $55 million into U.S. Soccer for the betterment of the women's game over the last two years.

“One team can't really do anything until all the right components are in place, so you have to glue everything,” Kang said. “I just wanted to be the match that lights the fire. … It's just the start. We need a lot more money. I wanted to be the catalyst, because there's so many things that we have to work on.”

 

 

A post shared by U.S. Soccer (@ussoccer)



The Kang Institute has begun work on at least three key projects: conducting a comprehensive national study to assess the current and emerging needs of female players at all levels, including injury prevention, mental health, workload management, menstrual health, and the transition from youth to elite competition; co-creating a framework with help from the NWSL and United Soccer League to define best practices; and developing new tools to support female athletes' physical and mental wellbeing and address key dropout points.

Last year, Kang pledged $30 million to increase competitive opportunities for youth players, expand talent identification and fuel professional development for players, coaches and referees. In April, Kang additionally invested $25 million to integrate her Kynisca Innovation Hub into Soccer Forward's research initiative.

In July 2024, Kang announced the launch of Kynsica, an umbrella group for her multi-sports ownership and sports science efforts. Kang also owns Olympique Lyonnais in France and the London City Lionesses in England. Last year, she led a $2 million seed funding round for IDA Sports, a company that focuses on creating cleats and shoes for female athletes.

Kang is one of the most generous donors to U.S. Soccer in the federation's history, according to the non-profit organization, and is responsible for the largest single donation to the women's program. But, for the businesswoman and philanthropist, her long-term goal is for this institute to establish a framework that can be mimicked around the world.

“I want this to be available globally,” Kang said. “That's really the motive because I want to have at least one in every continent … so that the girls growing up all around the world will say, ‘I don't have any constraints.'”

The hopes are high for what the Kang Institute can accomplish for the women's game, Parlow Cone told Kang on stage.

“To have research designed for female athletes, not just to have to be able to compare them to the male athletes, but to have actual research just for female athletes, to help them perform better, to recover from an injury, to stay in the game longer, and to see it every level,” Parlow Cone said. “There's nothing like it in the world.”

Kang responded, “It's about time, isn't it?”

Forty-eight regular-season games played and zero losses. While a championship eludes them, this team has their eyes on a much bigger prize: going pro.

Minnesota Aurora FC is a community-owned women's soccer team born from a parking lot meeting in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, they consistently play in front of crowds larger than some professional teams in the top flight of women's soccer. Yet they started and remain an amateur side.

Dreamed up by two friends, Wes Burdine, the owner of popular queer soccer bar The Black Hart in St. Paul, and Matt Privratsky, who's spent his career in public policy and clean energy advocacy, the team is the result of the duo being frustrated by the lack of elite women's soccer in Minnesota.

In September 2020, Burdine and Privratsky gathered a group of about 25, standing six feet apart with masks on, and laid the foundations for a new kind of team.

Andrea Yoch was at that first meeting. Having been at Minnesota United when the franchise won the bid to become an MLS side and having helped market Premier League teams coming to the US for preseason tours, Yoch brought vital soccer marketing experience to the new endeavor.

“They were talking about it and had this idea of, well, maybe we could start a soccer team. Maybe we don't need a rich person,” Yoch told CNN Sports.

“One of the biggest things we needed to figure out was funding, and how we were going to announce the team, and what league we were gonna play in. And so the three of us, Matt, Wes and I, started meeting with different leagues.”

Their timing was fortuitous. The United Soccer League (USL) had just solidified plans for a new pre-professional league, the USL W League, as a pathway for amateur players.

“After meeting with all the leagues, the USL W was coming in brand new in 2022, and they were the only ones that were okay with a community-owned model,” Yoch said.

“We didn't have what anybody wanted as a franchise fee, but the USL W believed in our vision. And that's all it was at the time was a vision.”

With nine founders and support from a new league, Minnesota Aurora launched its first community ownership campaign in August 2021.

Within three months, they raised a million dollars and sold out the 3,080 community shares. Yoch said of the early success, “We just hit a moment in time where everybody was incredibly intrigued and excited about this idea of being able to own a women's soccer team.”

Despite its relatively small population, Minnesota has a professional team in every major sports league. Yet Aurora, an amateur women's team, found a way through the saturated market.

“We announced the team and the community ownership the summer after the NCAA athletes had pointed out all the disparities in the locker rooms and the weight rooms at the NCAA (basketball) tournament,” Yoch added. “It was Covid, George Floyd had been murdered; you know, we had just a lot of damage – physically and mentally – in Minnesota.

“I think the combination of people finally being aware of how poorly female athletes were being treated and Minnesotans wanting to do something positive worked together.”

Even with the community backing and media coverage, the co-founders weren't sure what to expect when the first game rolled around in May 2022.

The plan had been to open half the seats at their new home – the 6,000-capacity stadium at the Minnesota Vikings training facility. The reaction was more than the trio had expected.

Within the first day, 80% of the tickets were sold.

“Our contact at the Vikings called me and said, ‘I think you need to open up the whole stadium,'” Yoch recalled.

“We opened up the whole building. Our first night, we were at over 5,000 fans, and unless it's a terrible rain game or something, we have never dipped below 4,000.”

Jen Larrick was at that first socially-distanced meeting in 2020, having met Privratsky through a showcase she ran to give exposure to girls outside the typical pay-to-play club soccer system. Larrick joined the team as assistant coach for the inaugural season and just finished her first season as head coach.

“We were absolutely discovering what Aurora was as it was happening, and we, as coaches, were honestly just as shocked as anyone else on that opening game day,” Larrick recalled to CNN Sports.

“I personally am queer, and even that first year we had, you know, half our coaching staff was queer,” Larrick said. “My deep hope is that, you know, from within the team and then also as a fan, it feels like a space where people are welcome when they show up.”

While Yoch and Larrick have been around from the get-go, Saara Hassoun entered the fold as a consultant after the team caught her eye in its inaugural season. She was chief of staff for Gotham FC in the NWSL (the highest tier of women's professional soccer in the US), including during the team's 2023 title-winning season, before officially joining the Aurora in May 2025. After five months as chief of staff, the club announced in early October her promotion to club president.

“I thought, ‘I come from professional women's soccer. I came from a championship-winning team.' I thought I knew what I was walking into,” Hassoun told CNN Sports. “And it's indescribable, honestly, it's indescribable.

“I think you see people coming in the door and continuing to engage with Aurora because they can tell, just based on the way the club carries itself, based on how the club shows up in all of the spaces … people see that and they take notice, and they want to be there because they feel seen, they feel represented, they feel heard.”

However, Aurora's mission – “creating pathways for women, girls, and gender expansive people to reach their potential, on and off the field” – has not been without challenges.

“One of our values is inclusivity, and there's more kind of attack on the trans community and girls and women's sports than ever right now,” coach Larrick said.

“The USL W has some rules about the trans community that are not okay or in line with our values and we're trying to do what we can, kind of within the difficult context.”

CNN Sports has reached out to the USL W about their transgender athlete guidelines.

“I think, for me, social justice or trying to be socially responsible actors in your community is not about being perfect or getting it right all the time, but it's about on an everyday basis trying to wrestle with these important, big questions,” Larrick emphasized.

“Aurora, I think, in so many ways operates internally, but also in terms of media attention and just general functioning, like a professional team,” Hassoun said.

The club provides housing for its athletes, broadcasts every game locally, and sells full sponsorship packages. However, under league rules, players are not allowed to earn a salary.

Every NWSL expansion announcement draws up a similar predicament for the Aurora: They want to go pro but lack the 30% backing from a single investor mandated by the league.

“The community ownership model won't work. If we want to go to the NWSL, it's gonna be $250 million,” Yoch explained.

In addition to requiring a principal owner, the NWSL confirmed via email to CNN Sports that it “require(s) infrastructure investment, an expansion fee and sufficient operating capital to fund a team.”

Some have wondered why Minnesota Vikings owners Zygi, Leonard and Mark Wilf haven't added the Aurora to their portfolio, as the team plays at the NFL franchise's training ground. However, the Wilfs already own the 2024 NWSL champion Orlando Pride.

“They are very committed to Orlando,” Yoch confirmed. “While there's no money exchanging hands, (the Wilfs) do help us a lot. They are incredibly supportive partners.”

With their eye on a professional league, the conversation lurking over the greater women's soccer world has become a regular topic of discussion for the Aurora's board: How do you grow the sport while maintaining its singular culture? Are these two aims even compatible?

“The louder we are about our values, the easier it gets to maintain them,” Hassoun said.

This message on maintaining their “fierce advocacy” was echoed by Yoch.

The USWNT is eyeing another 2025 victory, with US Soccer announcing the finalists for the federation's end-of-year awards on Monday, including the five women nominated for US Soccer Female Player of the Year.

After stellar runs for both club and country, Arsenal defender Emily Fox, Portland Thorns midfielder Sam Coffey, Gotham FC midfielder Rose Lavelle, and Chelsea FC forwards Alyssa Thompson and Catarina Macario headline the 2025 shortlist.

A post shared by Just Women's Sports (@justwomenssports)

The youth national teams' Young Female Player of the Year award also tapped top finalists in Angel City forward Riley Tiernan, Chicago Stars forward Micayla Johnson, Seattle Reign defender Jordyn Bugg, Gotham FC defender Lilly Reale, and University of Virginia freshman defender Pearl Cecil.

The USWNT also earned a Game of the Year nomination, with US Soccer recognizing the team's dominant 3-0 victory over North American rival Canada in July.

While national team play is paramount in determining the honorees, club performances also factor into the awards, with several Player of the Year nominees significantly adding to their resumes away from the international pitch in 2025.

In May, Fox helped Arsenal to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League title and Macario lifted the WSL trophy with Chelsea, while Gotham stars Lavelle and Reale finished their NWSL season as league champions late last month — with Reale also taking home the 2025 NWSL Rookie of the Year trophy.

Players, coaches, media, the US Soccer board, and fans will determine the ultimate winners, with fan picks making up 15% of the final tally.

Fans can submit their votes online now through Friday, December 12th, with US Soccer slated to announce the winners in January.

“Welcome to the Mew-niverse,” said Kristie Mewis, one part of the new sister-led podcast, Mewis Squared, on the Men in Blazers Media network. Alongside her sister, Sam, the two have swapped their cleats for microphones and ventured into the growing space of player-led women's soccer media—with a sisterly flair. 

The pair are just the second set of sisters to suit up simultaneously for the U.S. women's national team. Now, after multiple World Cups and Olympic medals between them, they're ready to show the world another side of themselves while staying close to the game that shaped their lives—regardless of whose idea it was. 

“That's actually a contentious topic [of whose idea it was] because I proposed it over a year ago,” says Sam Mewis, who joined Men in Blazers with her own women's soccer-specific vertical, The Women's Game, in 2024. “I said to Kristie, you and I should do a podcast, I had been hearing about the Kelce brothers podcast, and I was like, we would just be really funny with this! I ran it by Kristie and she goes, ‘Oh yeah, I already thought of that.'”

“Yeah, I will claim it, but I think you obviously get the credit because you verbalized it first,” Kristie Mewis replies. 

Our hearts are full because the Mewis sisters are back together in London 🥰 pic.twitter.com/O3p4yTWmy5

The loving, sisterly bickering is highly relatable to anyone with siblings, but it's their shared stories of growing up around the beautiful game, their experiences for club and country, and their commentary on the current state of soccer that has drawn viewers in. 

From there, the show came together quite quickly. Sam, who retired from soccer in 2024 after a long-term knee injury, and Kristie, who is currently taking a break from the game after the birth of her son, Jagger, with partner Sam Kerr earlier this year, were able to jump right in, giving the world a bit more insight into their lives as sisters and former pros.

“I get so many comments saying they didn't realize that I am the younger sister, and I think we totally subvert the older-younger sister stereotype,” says Sam. “I'm organized, I do the logistical, behind-the-scenes work for the show, and Kristie is more of the free, wild child who got in trouble more, and I do think people like seeing it.” 

Even with the subversion of the sisterly roles, the Mewis sisters are more alike than their differences might show. They said they want their show to capture what it's like to be a sister, be a family and what that means for their core values. The Mewis sisters are built from the same cloth, and while an ocean may currently separate the two Massachusetts natives, they want to bring their close bond to their audience in a way that fans may not have seen from them before.

“For so many years, Sam and I took the approach of being really professional through social media and the way we presented ourselves,” Kristie says. “I feel like as professional athletes, you can seem unrelatable because you become this image [that people see when they stream games], whereas now Sam and I want to show people who we truly are and what our dynamic is—that we're just relatable sisters who go through the same problems that everybody goes through, and that was really empowering for us.”

As Mewis Squared finds its footing in the landscape of player-led media, which includes shows created by some of their former teammates, they know what sets them apart is their unique relationship with one another.

“What we're trying to do is have a really player-centric take on the USWNT, the NWSL, the WSL and global football in general,” Sam says. “We are pretty far researching in what we cover, but Mewis Squared is unique in that we're sisters, we are talking about soccer topically, but also historically. It's our chemistry and relationship that make our show unique.”

As Kristie puts it, they want the show to feel like being on a FaceTime call with them. It's natural, easy and it pulls you in as if you're in the room with them getting the gossip and chatting about your favorite sport. 

“When people are listening to us, I want it to feel warm and cozy,” Kristie says. “When you're putting your headphones in or sitting down and relaxing, you will choose something to watch on TV or listen to that makes you feel good. What Sam and I want to bring is just that, for people who just want to listen to Mewis Squared to laugh a little bit.” 

Most important for the Mewis sisters, they have relished the ability to feel in control of their image. For so long, the two said they felt like buttoned-up versions of themselves, not wanting to say anything out of line and become a viral headline. With Mewis Squared, that has all changed. 

“As a player, you do not feel in control of how you're perceived in the media or trust that a journalist is going to make you look great—they're just trying to get their story read,” Sam says. “As I started podcasting, I actually learned that the audience likes me better as myself rather than I was this vanilla version, and I feel so much more free to be honest and authentic because I'm in control of the narrative and the story.”  

This ability to be themselves and control their stories is at the core of why the Mewis sisters believe player-led media has taken off in women's sports. It provides an alternative insight into their lives and personalities that traditional media often cannot capture.

“I think it was just the time, an era where you just kind of had to be safe with everything,” Kristie says. “It's such an empowering time now to be able to express my true self and real thoughts.”

Much of the change in the media landscape has been due to the rise of social media. Many of the younger players in leagues across the world have taken to their own platforms to tell their stories, using social media in tandem with traditional media, which can often be overwhelming for players, especially in a matchday setting. 

“I feel like when I interview somebody, I have to warm them up a little bit at the beginning and make sure they realize that it's just me, they know me and they can be comfortable with me,” Sam says. 

“I love what Sam and I are doing now because we're kind of that generation where it was buttoned up, and now we're millennials putting ourselves into Gen Z a bit, if that makes sense,” Kristie says. “So it's fun for us and for me to step away from that buttoned-up self and be a bit more of myself.” 

Five episodes in, the show on YouTube alone is garnering tens of thousands of views per episode, and the feedback has been positive from guests, viewers and, most importantly, the people who made all of this possible—Robert and Melissa Mewis. 

“Well, our parents love it!” Sam says. “They watch every episode.”

“Sam and I still have so much more to bring,” Kristie says. “It's exciting, fun, and I think everyone's enjoying it—or at least I hope so!”

The U.S. Soccer Federation announced Tuesday that Atlanta will be the home of two of four pre-tournament matches for the U.S. Men's National Team ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host the USA-Belgium match on March 28, 2026, and the USA-Portugal match three days later.

The two additional matches for the national team will be held at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte on May 31 and at Soldier Field in Chicago on June 6.

“For us, this is a massive opportunity to challenge ourselves against some of the top teams in the world. These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a Tuesday press release. 

“We are so happy to be playing in our new home of Atlanta, and of course to be competing in the great cities of Charlotte and Chicago ahead of the World Cup.”

The U.S. Soccer Federation is moving its headquarters to metro Atlanta in 2026, ahead of the World Cup. 

Tickets for both Atlanta matches go on sale to the public on Friday at 10 a.m. Presale tickets are now on sale. 

In addition to the early 2026 matches, Decatur WatchFest ‘26 announced Wednesday that OutKast member Big Boi and the Indigo Girls will be the opening and closing acts, respectively, for the city's 34-day World Cup celebration.

“Playing in Decatur during the World Cup is one way of saying ‘thank you' to the city that's been a home to us for so many years,” said Emily Saliers and Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls in a Wednesday press release. “Over the decades, we've seen Decatur grow and we are so excited to be asked to be a part of the Decatur WatchFest celebration.” 

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will occur from June 11 to July 19, 2026, with eight matches scheduled at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The United States men soccer team is coming back to Charlotte. 

The U.S. Soccer Federation Tuesday announced the national squad will play May 31 at Bank of America Stadium in a friendly match ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The opponent will be named after the World Cup draw.

The game is the second time the USMNT has played in Charlotte, with the first appearance a 6-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago in 2023 at the Concacaf Gold Cup. The match is one of two showcase exhibitions scheduled for Charlotte next year, with the other MLS's All-Star game.

The World Cup draw is Dec. 5 in Washington, D.C., at 12 p.m. 

“We are thrilled to welcome the U.S. Men's National Team to Charlotte for one of their World Cup send-off matches at Bank of America Stadium,” Charlotte Sports Foundation CEO Will Pitts said in a statement. “Our city has a deep passion for soccer, and we look forward to showcasing the hospitality, energy, and incredible experiences that make Charlotte such a memorable destination for fans from across the country.”  

Charlotte isn't finished positioning itself for international soccer. The city is included in the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup bid book from the U.S. Soccer Federation, Mexican Football Association, Costa Rican Football Association, and Jamaica Football Federation.  

North Carolina has hosted multiple U.S. national team matches over the years. The women beat South Korea in Charlotte after their 2019 World Cup win in Charlotte, which set a record for the largest USWNT crowd in North Carolina.  The men have played eight times in the state with three matches in High Point and Cary hosting a pair since the MLS launched in 1996.

Charlotte FC defender Tim Ream has earned 79 caps for the USMNT since 2011, having served as captain on 25 occasions.  

Ticket presales begin Dec. 3, with general tickets on sale starting Dec. 5.

Former U.S. men's national team star Alexi Lalas believes Christian Pulisic can become the “greatest male American soccer player” of all time, but only if he delivers at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

As the captain and undisputed best player on the USMNT, Pulisic knows the pressure of leading America, both on and off the pitch. Yet wearing the Stars and Stripes' armband at the World Cup, on home soil, is a new type of weight for the 27-year-old, one that could turn him into a legend.

“There's no better way in polishing your brand than doing it at a home World Cup here,” Lalas, who played every minute for the USMNT at the 1994 World Cup, told the New York Post.

“It doesn't matter where you play or the fame that you have, the money that you have; this is an opportunity in front of your home country to almost introduce or reintroduce yourself.

“So I think with Christian Pulisic, a lot of eyes will be on him and rightfully so. He is a star, obviously, already played in a World Cup, but this is a little different playing at home.

“I think as he continues on [he] will ultimately be looked at as, arguably, the greatest male American soccer player in history. That's the trajectory he's on.”

Pulisic has been uttered in the same conversation as Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey throughout his entire career for the USMNT. First, it was for his promise, then his skill and most recently, his shortcomings. 

The two icons slammed Pulisic and a slew of other American stars for skipping last summer's Gold Cup, questioning the commitment of the current generation. The AC Milan winger fired back and even snubbed Donovan and Dempsey when naming his dream USMNT five-a-side team.

Controversy aside, Pulisic is already challenging the greats in the USMNT record books. The forward is fifth on the all-time goalscorers list, just 25 goals behind joint record-holders Donovan and Dempsey.

If Pulisic, who has scored 40 goals since his move to Milan in July 2023, translates his elite club form to the national team this summer, he will have the chance to do something even Donovan and Dempsey never could: lead his team to World Cup glory on home soil.

The stage is set for the U.S. men's national team's final march prior to the 2026 World Cup.

ATLANTA – The stage is set for the U.S. men's national team's final march prior to the 2026 World Cup.

The cities and venues have been confirmed for the team's last pre-tournament matches, a high-caliber series featuring three of the world's top 10-teams in Belgium, Portugal and Germany. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad will use this elite slate to sharpen its form ahead of the tournament on home soil.

All four matches will take place at stadiums that are home to NFL and MLS teams.

As the new home of U.S. Soccer, Atlanta will host a pair of matches, beginning with USA-Belgium on March 28 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Kickoff against the eighth-ranked Belgian side is set for 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on TNT, HBO Max, Telemundo, Universo, and Peacock. 

Three days later, USA-Portugal, presented by Bank of America, kicks off at 7 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the match against the 6th-ranked Portuguese side to be shown live on TNT, TruTV, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock. 

Following the announcement of the USMNT roster that will represent the United States at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. will host the Allstate Continental Clásico on May 31, against an opponent to be determined. Kickoff from the home of Charlotte FC is set for 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on TBS, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock. 

To close out its World Cup preparation schedule, the USMNT will take on four-time World Cup champion Germany in the Coca-Cola Send-Off Match on June 6 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The United States kicks off against the ninth-ranked German team at the current home of the Chicago Fire at 2:30 p.m. ET, with the match shown live on TBS, HBO Max, Telemundo, Universo, and Peacock. 

All four matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary from onsite while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. 

Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT), Instagram (@USMNT), Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App. 

“For us, this is a massive opportunity to challenge ourselves against some of the top teams in the world. These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans,” Pochettino said in a statement. “We are so happy to be playing in our new home of Atlanta, and of course to be competing in the great cities of Charlotte and Chicago ahead of the World Cup.”

The matches against three more World Cup qualified teams offer more preparation against the opponents and styles the team could face this summer.  

Having finished third at the 2018 World Cup, the Red Devils will make their fourth straight World Cup appearance. Winners of Group J in UEFA qualifying, they are led by six-time English Premier League winner Kevin De Bruyne and Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who won the Golden Glove as the best goalkeeper at the 2018 World Cup.

Portugal, currently sixth in the FIFA men's world rankings, won the 2025 UEFA Nations League championship led by Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time leading scorer in men's international soccer history and a five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or as the world's best player. 

Four-time World Cup winners Germany will make its 21st appearance in the tournament, led by Arsenal forward Kai Havertz and Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala, with their most recent World Cup victory coming in 2014.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (CAROLINA SPORTS LIVE) — Charlotte will get to experience the biggest summer in the United States in nearly 30 years when it hosts a friendly ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Although the Queen City isn't a location for the main event, the United States Men's National Team will play in the Allstate Continental Clásico at Bank of America Stadium on May 31. 

This will be the first time since 1996 that the United States has hosted a massive summer event like the World Cup, when the Olympics were in Atlanta. 1994 was the last time the World Cup came to the USA. 

“Next year will be the biggest summer of soccer in the history of this country and Charlotte is set to host the U.S. Men's National Team's penultimate friendly ahead of the FIFA World Cup,” Kristi Coleman, Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO, said. “At Tepper Sports & Entertainment, we're committed to continuing to work alongside our local partners to attract marquee events to Bank of America Stadium, strengthening Charlotte's position as a premier destination and driving meaningful economic impact for our community.” 

Charlotte has been increasing its soccer presence since Charlotte FC was born in 2022.

This will be the second time the USMNT will play in Charlotte. The first being in 2023 for the Concacaf Gold Cup, where the U.S. beat Trinidad and Tobago. 

Not only will this friendly be in Charlotte, but Bank of America Stadium will also serve as the site of the 2026 MLS All-Star Game. The date for that game has yet to be announced. 

Before the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup, the U.S. Women's National Team beat South Korea after their World Cup triumph in 2019 in Charlotte. That match featured the largest USWNT crowd ever in North Carolina.

Recently, Charlotte was included in the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup bid book from the U.S. Soccer Federation, Mexican Football Association, Costa Rican Football Association, and Jamaica Football Federation.

“We are thrilled to welcome the U.S. Men's National Team to Charlotte for one of their World Cup send-off matches at Bank of America Stadium,” Will Pitts, CEO of Charlotte Sports Foundation, said. “Our city has a deep passion for soccer, and we look forward to showcasing the hospitality, energy, and incredible experiences that make Charlotte such a memorable destination for fans from across the country. This event would not be possible without the tremendous partnership of Tepper Sports & Entertainment, the State of North Carolina, and the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. We're grateful for their support and excited to bring this world-class match to our community.”

Charlotte FC defender Tim Ream has earned 79 appearances for the USMNT since 2011, and has been a captain 25 times. 

Ticket presales will start on Wednesday, Dec. 3, with general on-sale starting on Friday, Dec. 5. An opponent is expected to be confirmed soon following the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw, which will take place on Dec. 5 at noon in Washington, D.C.

FIFA has been sent a letter by Human Rights Watch requesting information about the process and criteria applied by soccer's world governing body ahead of handing out its inaugural peace prize during the draw for the 2026 World Cup this Friday.

On November 5, FIFA announced that the organisation would introduce a new award entitled “FIFA Peace Prize — Football Unites the World”.

In a statement published by the FIFA website and on President Gianni Infantino's Instagram account, Infantino said: “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace. Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, the FIFA Peace Prize — Football Unites the World will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”

FIFA said the award will be handed out once per year but the inaugural prize will be presented by Infantino during the World Cup draw in Washington D.C. on Friday, December 5. They said it will go to individuals who have “helped to unite people all over the world in peace and consequently deserve a special and unique recognition”.

The award was announced on the same day that Infantino was due to speak at the America Business Forum in Miami, where U.S. President Donald Trump also addressed an audience at the Kaseya Center.

Trump missed out on this year's Nobel Peace Prize, amid his claim to have ended eight wars since returning to office. In some of those instances, he has been praised by the warring parties, but his role is more disputed in others, while tensions and/or fighting have remained in several cases, according to analysis from the New York Times.

Infantino wrote on Instagram on October 9 that Trump “definitely deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his decisive actions” in the Israel-Gaza ceasefire. At the Kaseya Center, during his speech, Infanino was asked about Trump's chances of winning FIFA's Peace Prize and said: “You will see.”

On Monday, The Athletic revealed that FIFA's announcement about the prize came as a surprise to the vast majority of the FIFA Council. The FIFA Council is comprised of 37 members, which is chaired by Infantino, as well as eight vice-presidents, and 28 other members elected by the member associations. Multiple sources familiar with the process, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, said the Council and FIFA's vice-presidents were not consulted or involved in the creation of a FIFA peace prize and that it was not discussed at the prior FIFA Council. They have also not had input into the selection criteria for deciding a recipient. Some found out via a media release.

Now, Human Rights Watch, the global human rights and advocacy organization, has written a letter to FIFA seeking more details. The letter, seen by The Athletic, was written to Infantino on November 11, with a deadline of November 20 for a response. Human Rights Watch say they have not received one.

The letter asked five questions:

1. What are the formal criteria FIFA will use to evaluate nominees for the FIFA Peace Prize?

2. Will FIFA publish these criteria before the December 5 award ceremony?

3. How will FIFA identify and receive nominations for the prize? Can you share a list of the nominees?

4. Who will serve as judges or decision-makers in selecting the recipient, and what are their qualifications?

5. We note that FIFA adopted the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and published a Human Rights Policy which guides FIFA's operations. How will human rights considerations factor into the selection of the FIFA Peace Prize recipient(s)?

A statement from Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, added: “The Nobel Committee often awards its Peace Prize to leaders who champion democracy and human rights, including those whose sacrifices include years as political prisoners.  Think of Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Liu Xiaobo of China—who died in state custody.  But this so-called ‘FIFA Peace Prize' seems to have no nominees, no criteria, no judges and no process. So it will also have no legitimacy.”

President Trump is expected to attend the World Cup draw on Friday at the Kennedy Center, the performance arts venue he now chairs. During the FIFA Club World Cup draw in December 2024, Trump sent a message via videolink ahead of his inauguration the following month, while his grandson Theo and daughter Ivanka made the ceremonial first pick of the draw. Trump then played a central part in the trophy celebrations when Chelsea won the tournament in May.

FIFA has been approached for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Gio Reyna challenged to 'reach that bar' with USMNT as Mauricio Pochettino expected to tell Monchengladbach star to do even MORE to make World Cup squad","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/gio-reyna-challenged-bar-usmnt-mauricio-pochettino-monchengladbach-star-more-world-cup-squad/bltcce33ab1d52dc7b9","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:02:54 GMT","

Gio Reyna has been set a 2026 World Cup challenge. Former USMNT star Brad Friedel, during an exclusive interview with GOAL, has told the talented Borussia Monchengladbach playmaker what needs to happen in order to make Mauricio Pochettino's squad for next summer's tournament, with nobody - regardless of their ability - guaranteed a place in those plans.

Reyna is unquestionably one of the most naturally gifted performers at the United States' disposal. He has been tipped for the top since bursting onto the senior scene as a teenager, with a similar career path to fellow countryman Christian Pulisic being trodden when linking up with Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund.

Over 140 appearances were taken in for BVB, scoring 19 goals, but those numbers would have been considerably higher were it not for a string of unfortunate injuries. A fresh start is now being embraced with Gladbach - with more tests on form and fitness fronts being faced there.

Reyna did impress during his last international camp, registering goal number nine for his country in a friendly win over Paraguay, but questions continue to be asked of whether - having endured a tough time at the 2022 World Cup - he will be involved at another major tournament on home soil.

Quizzed on whether the creative 23-year-old is in a position where a World Cup berth is his to lose, ex-USMNT goalkeeper Friedel - speaking in association with talkSPORT Bet Online Slots - told GOAL: “With Mauricio it is different, you have to go and impress and then you have to improve. There is no ‘you did well for me last month, you did well the month before'. That's not how he goes about his business.

“Once you impress, he will put a little higher bar on you and then you have to reach that bar. Then he will see if you can go again. The way that he performed, and I don't know how he conducted himself in training, but let's say it was positive, then they will watch him now with his club and see when he comes into camp again in March if he is lower. If so, he is already down in their minds again. If he comes in the same or higher, then he has impressed again.

“That's how they work. It's the metrics, it's building a squad of players that need to win - which is a better word than ‘want' to win. What he has done right now is very good for him getting his foot back in the door. It's not his to lose. Everyone goes on a level playing field, which is very different to what the US has been previously.”

Reyna knows that he faces fierce competition for places, and that he needs to steer clear of more spells on the treatment table in order to prove his worth. Friedel has previously told GOAL of how a hot prospect makes another global gathering: “With Gio, a lot of unfortunate stuff from the last World Cup, then injury after injury after injury. Talented, talented player. For Gio, he needs minutes and he needs not to be injured. Then we can see before the World Cup if he is ready. If he is, if he has a run of four or five months with no injuries, playing lots of minutes, he's in the squad.

“He's a really talented player, one of the better ones we have. But he really does need to play. When I took the job at Besiktas, I was over at the Copa America and was watching. You could just tell there was something a little bit off. It's not his ability, that is there. That's not it. His body has unfortunately not cooperated with this sport.

“Hopefully for him it goes well. He's a really good kid and I hope he just stays fit, gets a run of games and then it will be down to Mauricio choosing him or not. I don't like to see anybody get left out because of injury.”

Excitement levels in the USMNT camp are about to build even further, with their opponents for the group stage of the 2026 World Cup set to be revealed when that draws take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on December 5.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has been granted indefinite leave by the club following a request for a period of absence.

The Uruguay international has played 15 games across all competitions for Hansi Flick's side this campaign and his most recent appearance was in last week's Champions League defeat at Chelsea, when he was sent off in the 44th minute.

The 26-year-old was not part of the Barca matchday squad for Saturday's 3-1 league home win over Alaves on Saturday.

Araujo's representative met with Barca sporting director Deco on Monday to discuss the matter with the club committed to giving him the time he needs.

“It is a private situation, I don't want to say more,” Barca head coach Hansi Flick had said earlier on Monday. “And please, if you can respect it I'd appreciate it.”

The coach's comments came after Barca president Joan Laporta said on Friday that he wanted to “support and defend” the player.

“He has been heavily criticised, and I don't think that's fair,” Laporta said at an event in Andorra.

“He gives his all on the pitch, he's our captain, and now he needs to get through this difficult period because he's a very emotional person with strong feelings.

“He's had a tough time, and I want to tell him that we're behind him, that he needs to turn the page because here we all win and we all lose, and no one person is responsible for defeats or victories.”

Araujo, a central defender who has also been played at right-back, has made 190 first-team appearances for Barca since joining in 2018 from Uruguayan club Boston River.

Barca go into Tuesday's match against Atletico Madrid one point clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and three clear of fourth-place Atletico.

Former England striker Gary Lineker has signed a lucrative new deal to take his The Rest is Football podcast to streaming giant Netflix for the 2026 World Cup. The show will run daily throughout the competition in North America, Mexico and Canada and will also feature usual co-hosts Alan Shearer and Micah Richards. It will be filmed in New York but will also feature reports from the England camp and fan zones across the tournament.

Lineker has confirmed he will play his part in the 2026 World Cup after agreeing a deal with Netflix to host a daily episode of his popular podcast. The former England captain had been due to cover the tournament for BBC Sport but left the corporation in May amid a row over a controversial social media post. However, he will now be part of the coverage of the World Cup with a daily show that will be produced by Goalhanger Podcasts. The company have promised the podcast will feature ""game analysis, special guests, interviews and insights into the world's largest sporting event"".

Lineker is relishing the new opportunity and has already told fans what they can expect from his daily show. He said: ""We can't wait to bring The Rest Is Football to Netflix for the 2026 World Cup. It's a fantastic opportunity for the three of us to do what we love — talk football every day — but on a truly global stage. Expect all the usual analysis, honesty and plenty of laughs … just with a few more cameras pointed at us, all from the Big Apple.”

Lineker's new contract with Netflix will see the 65-year-old receive a big hike on his previous salary. According to The Times, Lineker's new ""multimillion-pound"" deal ""will dwarf the £1.35 million salary he earned for hosting Match of the Day on the BBC"".

A source told The Times: ""It's a really exciting deal and Gary is thrilled. It means he will be at the World Cup after all. It's Netflix's first real foray into football coverage, with a daily show built around the podcast. This will also introduce Gary to a whole new international audience. Netflix first approached his company a few months ago, and his son, Harry, will also be joining Stateside as he's a producer, so it'll be a real family affair.""

Lineker is also set to host a new game show on ITV next year. 'The Box' will feature celebrities taken to different locations and asked to undertake challenges in giant yellow boxes.

Excitement for World Cup 2026 is starting to build, meaning all eyes will be on Friday's draw which will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). The glitzy affair will feature performances from legendary group the Village People, British superstar Robbie Williams, former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, and Italian maestro Andrea Bocelli and is due to be co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and actor and comedian Kevin Hart.

Actor and producer Danny Ramirez will also be on hand to interview the great and the good at the event. 

A total of 48 nations will feature in the draw and will be divided into four pots containing 12 teams. The competition runs from 11 June to 19 July and is jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","VIDEO: Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk shows off his supreme FIFPro World XI knowledge","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/liverpool-virgil-van-dijk-fifpro-world-xi/bltfb041f5e109851e3","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:15:14 GMT","

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk showed off his supreme FIFPro World XI knowledge as he successfully named the defenders of the World XI for the past five seasons. The Dutch international defender himself has featured in three of those five line-ups, while Manchester City's star centre-back Ruben Dias has featured in two of those teams.

Van Dijk, over the years, has grown into one of the best defenders in the Premier League and across the world and is a key pillar in the Liverpool side, which has won two Premier Leagues, a Champions League and a couple of domestic cups in recent years. His impressive performances for the Reds have earned him a place in three out of the last five FIFA FIFPro World XI sides. He featured in the teams of 2020, 2022 and 2024. Van Dijk is followed by City's Dias, who made it into the line-ups in 2021 and 2023.

In a chat with GOAL, Van Dijk was asked to name the defenders from the last five FIFPro World XIs and, quite surprisingly, the Dutchman named each backline accurately for all five seasons.

On the pitch, the Reds' title defence campaign has turned out to be a nightmare. They started 2025-26 with five Premier League wins in a row but thereafter their form took a major dip as they have managed to win only two out of their next eight league games. Liverpool are currently eighth in the Premier League table and have conceded 20 goals already - the joint-most along with Manchester United among the top 10 teams in the league.

After the club's disastrous 3-0 loss against Nottingham Forest last month, Van Dijk lashed out at his colleagues as he told reporters: ""We concede too many easy goals. They scored obviously from a set piece again. You can ask if he was in front of Alisson, but it counted, so we're 1-0 down. We were not good in terms of battles, challenges, the fight, too rushed. It's a very difficult situation at the moment. There was nervousness after we conceded, but not before. We tried to rush things and that's human when you're in a difficult moment. We cleared the ones before and in the end, we'te in a very difficult moment. We don't get out of it by just speaking about it. It will take a lot of hard work. 

""It's a problem. Everyone in the team has to take responsibility as well. Football is a team and everyone has to take responsibility. We have to digest this and take it on the chin. We need to work harder. We have to keep going. Everyone is disappointed, like they should be, because losing at home to Nottingham Forest is, in my eyes, very bad. That's the least I can say about it. Those goals we conceded are far too easy and we all have to look in the mirror. I've been at this club so long now and we've been through adversity. We will bounce back but it doesn't happen overnight. I'm not a quitter and we will keep going. I can't decide what the supporters are doing if they leave early. I know the fans have been through thick and thin with us. They will be there with us when we come out of this because we will come out of this.""

Arne Slot's side finally ended their three-game losing streak last weekend as they beat West Ham on Sunday, courtesy of Alexander Isak and Cody Gakpo's strikes. They now have a very hectic December as they are set to play eight matches before New Year's Day. The busy schedule starts with a Premier League match against Sunderland on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","How dressing-room rifts and rotten results left Xabi Alonso and Real Madrid on the cusp of a crisis","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/dressing-room-rifts-rotten-results-xabi-alonso-real-madrid-crisis/blt11a38100f69f8c9b","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:15:00 GMT","

Not a single Real Madrid player spoke to the media on Sunday night. They don't have to, of course, but after Los Blancos drew 1-1 with struggling Girona, every single squad member walked through the mixed zone without acknowledging the awaiting press. It was emblematic of a shift at the club, the good vibes within this great institution falling apart. 

And how could they not? Madrid expects excellence and football without flaws. They are expected not only to win, but to win well. And of late, they simply haven't done enough winning. After Sunday's drab draw, they have now drawn three straight games in La Liga. The highest-ranked team of three to have taken a point off them are ninth-placed Rayo Vallecano.

While that is undoubtedly a disappointing run for a club of Madrid's size, it must be remembered that they are also in a period of transition after hiring a new manager in Xabi Alonso, who in turn has been dealing with a number of injuries that have upset the balance of his side somewhat. 

However, amid reports of rifts in the dressing room led by some of the most highly-paid players on the planet, the last thing Alonso needed was for his side to throw away their lead at the top of the table to Barcelona. That's exactly what they have done, sacrificing a five-point advantage in the space of a month, and while the calls for Alonso to be sacked are far too premature, it has undoubtedly been a nightmarish few weeks for a man still starting out in his dream job. 

The actual picture of Madrid's season doesn't look too bad. Through 14 league games, they have won 10, drawn three and lost just one. They sit in second place, on 33 points, four behind Barcelona with their game in hand to come on Wednesday against Athletic Club. At their current pace, they will accrue 90 points, which should be enough to run Barca right down to the wire. Madrid have also played a slightly tougher schedule, and did win the first Clasico of the season in late October. 

In the Champions League, things are looking rosy. Madrid have won four of five, dispatching Marseille, Juventus, Kairat Almaty and Olympiacos, while their only loss came at the hands of a much-improved Liverpool, who decided to break their torrid spell by turning in a one-off memorable performance against the Spanish giants in early November. An automatic spot in the last 16 is therefore within their grasp.

There are plenty of positives to take from how certain individuals have performed, too. Kylian Mbappe has accepted his role as a central striker and run with it, with his tally of 23 goals in just 19 games challenging the best goal-scorers in Europe. Elsewhere, new signings Alvaro Carreras has offered much-needed stability at left-back, Arda Guler has shown the kind of creative chops his early-career flashes promised and Jude Bellingham has been rounding into form after missing the first two months of the season while he recovered from shoulder surgery.

Bellingham is not the only big name to have missed time due to fitness problems. His England team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold is the presumptive right-back of the future in Madrid, but he has started just six games since the Club World Cup, thanks in part to a hamstring injury suffered on the opening night of Champions League that sidelined him for six weeks. His main competition, Dani Carvajal, picked up a knee injury soon after, and will be out until at least January, which has led to Fede Valverde again being deployed in defence.

Vinicius Jr, meanwhile, was steadily worked into the side in the opening weeks of the season as Alonso looked to protect his legs, and his campaign has been more about off-field noise than his goal contributions (or lack thereof). Centre-backs Toni Rudiger, David Alaba and Dean Huijsen have also missed time.

Still, Madrid should have enough talent to be the dominant force in Spain and Europe. And yet it is that concentration of Galacticos which is proving to be Alonso's biggest headache.

The ex-Bayer Leverkusen coach has, according to The Athletic, had his methods questioned by senior players within the squad and that messages are not getting through regarding his tactical plan for each game. A meeting was reportedly held between Alonso and his players in a bid to smooth out their differences ahead of the 4-3 win over Olympiacos, but Sunday's draw in Catalunya - described by one source to The Athletic has being ""a disaster"" - suggests that it has not ironed out all the kinks.

It likely doesn't help Alonso that there are high-profile players within his squad who are barely seeing the field. Both Rodrygo and Endrick were linked with moves away from the Bernabeu this summer, yet Alonso insisted that both would be crucial to the project. That, however, hasn't been the case. 

Rodrygo, in the midst of a 30-match goal drought, has continued to have been starved of opportunities, and has played just 442 minutes. Endrick has featured even less, with just 11 minutes to his name, and is set to finally leave on loan in January, likely to Lyon.

But of course, the biggest problem for Alonso is Vinicius. The Brazil winger is a wonderful footballer, charismatic and expressive with the ball, and equally vocal when he doesn't have it. He is also one of the more complex characters in this sport, so often the victim of abuse based on his reputation - a lot of it to do with the colour of his skin - yet, by all indications, a truly humble footballer. It is known, too, that Florentino Perez is a big fan of Vinicius'. 

That is perhaps why he has felt emboldened to challenge his managers at times. During the end of Carlo Ancelotti's reign, Vinicius took an apathetic approach towards running without the ball, and thus far under Alonso, he hasn't always adhered to the manager's tactical demands. He has subsequently completed 90 minutes just seven times, and is often Alonso's first substitute when he needs to change his forward line.  

Vinicius provided the lasting image of the Clasico, too, when he shouted at Alonso in frustration after he was removed from the game midway through the second half. He later apologised to the club and his team-mates, but left Alonso's name out of his social media post. The pair's relationship is said to be the driving force behind Vinicius' unwillingness to discuss a new contract, despite his current deal being set to expire in the summer of 2027.

Alonso is yet to fix Madrid's most glaring problem on the field, either. Last season, they conceded the same goal time-and-time again; they failed to press from the front, allowing opponents to get the ball to their defensive midfielder, who would then spark a counter-attack. It was a simple formula, rinsed and repeated on a weekly basis. 

And that same goal has recurred regularly this season. Madrid are laughably easy to hit on the break, and the way they concede goals in transition over and over is quite remarkable. It's how Girona hit them on Sunday, while Elche did it twice the week before, and Olympiacos too despite suffering defeat. If not for the excellence of Thibaut Courtois in goal, Madrid would comfortably concede three or four every week. 

But for all of the bad vibes, concerning signals and reasons to worry, this is no time to sack a manager. Alonso comes with an excellent pedigree and has proven himself a terrific tactician during his time at Leverkusen. In the pressure cooker that is Real Madrid, coaches need time to figure things out, and Alonso needs to be given that time. From what the manager is saying publicly, he isn't feeling the pressure of the sack, as he revealed that he had held favourable talks with Perez following the Girona draw.

""I have spoken to him again and the conversations are very positive, with a very good tone,"" Alonso said. ""That's what we've talked about, turning the results around.

""We know where we are in the season, there's a long way to go. It's all very close and there are a lot of points still up for grabs, so a lot can happen.""

Of course, there will always be a breaking point, and if things don't improve before the winter break, then Alonso will really begin to feel the heat. But removing a manager this early, with a squad this young and this promising, would be an immense misstep. Madrid require some uncharacteristic patience.

The 'ESPN FC TV' crew react to FIFA's new ranking system ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw next week. (1:51)

The 2026 World Cup draw is happening on Friday, and we already know 42 of the 48 teams involved in next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The final six teams will be decided in the coming months, but what do you know about those who have already confirmed their place?

Here, we look at one thing that defines the way each team plays -- whether it's tactical, statistical or just plain interesting.

- 2026 World Cup: Match schedule plan revealed for day after draw
- 2026 World Cup draw: When does it start? How does it work?
- 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it

CANADA (4-4-2): ""The Maplepress revolution."" Ten games into the Jesse Marsch era and Canada already have a tactical trademark -- albeit niche -- named ""Maplepressing."" In a tight, aggressive 4-4-2 (or 4-2-2-2), Canada defend on the front foot with a high line, minimal spacing between the units and a high pressing unit that stays narrow to shut down central passing options. The idea is arguably simpler than is sounds: to force opponents wide, trap them on the touchline and regain the ball early. Even with top talent like Jonathan David in attacking roles, Marsch has built the hosts on intensity, discipline and a clear pressing ID.

MEXICO (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""The double No. 9 problem."" The hosts face 2026 with unresolved issues. While the general idea might be in place, the results aren't. Since beating the U.S. in the 2025 Gold Cup final, they've failed to win a single game, even as Javier Aguirre doubled down on a possession-first, ""defend with the ball"" model. The most discussed dilemma to address, however, is how to pair strikers Raúl Jiménez and Santi Giménez without unbalancing the team structure -- Aguirre has used both together in a 4-4-2 in the past, but that doesn't appear to be his preferred system.

UNITED STATES (3-4-3/4-2-3-1): ""Stick or twist?"" Mauricio Pochettino's biggest challenge -- or advantage -- is choosing between two credible formations. While the USMNT primarily operates in a 4-2-3-1 that becomes a 3-2-5 in possession, built around Christian Pulisic drifting inside as the main creator, a 3-4-3 remains a fully viable alternative when Pochettino wants more control in buildup or additional threat from the wingers. The trade-off fluctuates between extra flexibility vs. continuity. Recent results suggest the balancing act works -- the USMNT is unbeaten in five against 2026-bound teams (plus-8 goal difference) -- but the final tournament shape is still up for debate; stay with one scheme or embrace the flexibility?

Mauricio Pochettino talks about his work's progress at USMNT and looks ahead to the 2026 World Cup as they now prepare to face Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay.

AUSTRIA (4-2-3-1): ""Europe's relentless pressing machine."" Ralf Rangnick has shaped Austria into a full-throttle Red Bull national team, built on aggression, directness and suffocating pressure. No European side pressed with more intensity in World Cup qualifying as Austria registered the continent's highest number of tackles (144), second highest recoveries (365), and lowest Passes Per Defensive Action (PPDA) of 7.14, edging even England and Germany. Rangnick favors front-foot pressure and immediate transitions; they don't just defend high, they force turnovers and once the ball is won, it's a matter of one or two passes before a chance is created. Few teams at this World Cup will bring more pure intensity.

BELGIUM (4-3-3): ""When Belgium attack, they dribble."" Though finally free of the ""Golden Generation"" label, Belgium are still one of the most dynamic teams in the world. No side attacked the opposition box more in UEFA qualifying -- 491 touches, 101 clear of Croatia in second -- or attempted more take-ons (201), a direct reflection of their world-class wide talent. Under Rudi Garcia they feature stretches of intense pressing, quick regaining of the ball and longer spells of possession, but the general idea is designed to open lanes for Jérémy Doku and Kevin De Bruyne to run at the defense.

CROATIA (4-2-3-1): ""Control through measured, quality possession."" Croatia cruised through qualifying, dropping just two points, but Zlatko Dalic's approach bucks the trend of Europe's mid-tier/top sides. Rather than pressing to maximum lung capacity, they dominate the ball -- a 69.7% possession share places them fifth, just behind Spain -- and build patiently through a veteran midfield. Croatia also ranked among Europe's leaders in key passes (124) and crosses attempted (241), yet their methodical tempo has drawn domestic criticism, with some dubbing them ""the new Greece"" [after the pragmatic win at Euro 2004.]

ENGLAND (4-2-3-1/4-1-4-1): ""The unexpected kings of possession."" England have quietly become Europe's most ball-dominant national team. Under Thomas Tuchel they averaged a remarkable 73.9% possession in qualifying -- the highest in UEFA, ahead of Germany with 72.7% -- a transformation that would have sounded implausible a few years ago. The shift is by no means cosmetic, though, as long periods of controlled circulation have doubled as a defensive weapon, helping England win all eight qualifiers without conceding a goal. While at times it does lead to labored sequences against low blocks, Tuchel's clear message is that he wants England to impose the rhythm, not react to it.

Frank Leboeuf and Craig Burley question England's place as second favourites in the bookmakers' odds to win the 2026 World Cup.

FRANCE (4-2-3-1): ""Defense first."" Thirteen years into the Didier Deschamps era, France remain exactly what they've always been: utterly disciplined, compact and brutally hard to break down. The qualifiers backed up that narrative once again. No team in Europe allowed fewer shots -- just 23 in six games, an absurdly low 3.83 per 90 -- with England a distant second at 4.25. The shape may read 4-2-3-1, but their priorities rarely change. There's a double pivot in midfield shielding the back line, wide players working both ways and enough on-ball control to keep games in Deschamps' preferred rhythm. Predictable? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.

GERMANY (4-1-3-2/4-2-3-1): ""Press high, let the No. 10s create."" Julian Nagelsmann has restored structure to Germany, straightening up distances and clarifying roles, but the team's real breakthrough lies in the double No. 10 pairing of Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala. Their input and reception/passing between the lines are the catalyst of Germany's fluidity, freeing full backs and reducing reliance on a prolific No. 9 striker up front. With 72.7% possession in qualifying, they prefer to take charge of games centrally, while they're one of Europe's most intense pressing sides off the ball (7.50 PPDA).

NETHERLANDS (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""Pragmatism before ideology."" Ronald Koeman has steered Netherlands away from doctrinal football towards a more adjustable model, switching between a 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and occasionally a back three without losing any attacking punch. The Oranje defend primarily in a mid-block and build asymmetrically, with full back Denzel Dumfries supplying much of the width. Despite the pragmatism, there's still a style to their play as they rank among Europe's best for progressive passes (724, second behind England) and attacking take-ons from the wingers.

NORWAY (4-2-3-1): ""Ruthless in the final third."" Norway topped the UEFA qualifying stats for goals scored (37) and assists (29), while they were second with Expected Goals (xG) of 24.70, much thanks to Erling Haaland's finishing but also due to a far more sophisticated style under Ståle Solbakken. Traditionally mocked as a direct side, they played just 6.6% of long balls (eighth among UEFA teams), instead basing their game on a coordinated buildup, wide/inverted winger take-ons and early combinations into the box.

Kasey Keller warns the top teams against underestimating Norway after they booked their place at the 2026 World Cup.

PORTUGAL (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""Midfield balance is the missing link."" While Roberto Martínez has kept Portugal's possession-heavy approach -- their 71.0% share in qualifying ranked third in Europe -- he's added a more assertive high press against stronger opponents. However, the unresolved issue is midfield balance. Martínez often fields five natural attackers, supported by playmaking rather than ball-winning midfielders, which can expose the back line when possession breaks down. Adding one or two midfield grafters in the centre might be needed if Portugal's game is to hold up against world-class opposition.

SCOTLAND (4-2-3-1): ""The old heads."" Europe's most senior side (at an average age of 28.8) enter the tournament with squad experience, though they haven't been in a World Cup since 1998. Steve Clarke's team defend deep (they were third among UEFA teams for shots blocked at 5.83 shots per 90), build width through the full backs and depend on midfield runners to get forward and provide chances. They don't see a lot of the ball (45.7% possession) but don't play it long that often either (12.2%), so set pieces could represent Scotland's primary attacking weapon.

SPAIN (4-3-3): ""A modern makeover."" While Luis de la Fuente's Spain still enjoy possession (70.1% from the qualifiers, behind England, Germany and Portugal), the days of pure ""tiki-tika"" are long gone. The European champions press higher and harder -- their PPDA of 9.76 ranks among Europe's most aggressive -- and possession now serves as a launchpad for quick attacks when openings appear, rather than wearing teams down with endless passing. Consequently, Spain's build-up is quicker, their wingers are extremely direct, and combinations unfold at a sharper tempo than in the previous era. They have by no means abandoned technique, but they've traded patience for incision, becoming far more direct in how they break down opponents.

SWITZERLAND (4-2-3-1/5-4-1): ""Stability starts in midfield."" Switzerland's strength lies less in standout metrics than in the reliability of their core with the midfield double pivot of Granit Xhaka and Remo Freuler essential for defensive balance and in denying the opposition space. Boss Murat Yakin may alternate between a back four and a situational back three, but the midfield pair give the Swiss their trademark order with fluid distribution, well-timed pressure and a defensive line that's difficult to pass through (they were seventh among UEFA teams for recoveries per 90, with 43). Switzerland rarely dominate and there's little flashness to them, yet their discipline and midfield control make them an awkward opponent for anyone.

The ESPN FC crew debate if Vinicius Jr & Rodrygo play with more freedom for Brazil than Real Madrid.

ARGENTINA (4-3-3): ""The same plan, just older."" Lionel Scaloni hasn't deviated much from the tactical concept that delivered the 2022 World Cup trophy, sticking largely with both the personnel and the principles that made the ""Escaloneta"" so formidable. Argentina will be one of the oldest sides in the tournament -- 29.3 average age -- but the formula still works. The keys are a CONMEBOL qualification-leading 64.0% possession, then compact mid-block out of possession (9.34 PPDA), quick vertical balls after regaining the ball, and an attacking shape made on familiar patterns with room for individual brilliance (they scored the most goals, with 31). At 38 years old, Lionel Messi's usage is lower, so the system carries more of the load and the collective remains balanced, disciplined and brutally efficient.

BRAZIL (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""A work in progress...?"" Brazil reached the 2026 World Cup after their worst CONMEBOL qualifying run of the modern era and boss Carlo Ancelotti is still searching for answers. The talent up front remains incredible -- Brazil often field four forwards, three of which are usually elite dribblers (Brazil recorded 365 take-ons in the qualifiers) -- but full back issues, spacing problems and a lack of domination have forced Ancelotti toward a more compact 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 with a clearer defensive structure. This is a Brazil side trying to impose order on chaos, even though Ancelotti freely admits they're still far from the fluid, mid-block team he imagines.

COLOMBIA (4-3-3): ""South America's shot machine."" Under Néstor Lorenzo, Colombia have become CONMEBOL's most assertive attacking outfit. Their 4-3-3 formation blends organization with flair, but the numbers point to incision too. They attempted more shots (247) and hit more crosses (300) than any other South American side in qualifying. Luis Díaz drives inside from the left, James Rodríguez floats into pockets as the creative hub, whereas full back Daniel Muñoz provides relentless width on the right. Colombia overwhelm their opponents through pressure and repeat patterns to get into dangerous spaces.

ECUADOR (4-2-3-1/5-4-1): ""Beccacece's wall."" Ecuador boast one of the most imposing defensive records in the world. Under Sebastián Beccacece they conceded just five goals in all of CONMEBOL's 18-game qualifying, a remarkable return given the quality of opposition, regardless of whether they lined up in a back three or four. The flipside, however, is that they're unlikely to entertain any neutrals, as a third of their qualifiers ended 0-0. The identity is clear, though: rigid organization, collective pressing and a strong physical imprint, all complemented by rapid counter attacks rather than long spells on the ball.

Paraguay fans flood the streets of the capital Asuncion after they qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 20 years.

PARAGUAY (4-2-3-1): ""The return of old school Paraguay."" Gustavo Alfaro has rebuilt Paraguay by reverting to the strengths that have historically defined La Albirroja; structure, toughness and ruthless attention to (defensive) detail. His 4-2-3-1 is drilled around cutting off space, compact lines and winning duels, which helps explain why Paraguay produced the most clearances (403) and aerial duels (619) in CONMEBOL qualifying and conceded only 10 goals, the joint second-best record. Creativity is still limited -- just 14 goals scored -- but Alfaro's side are once again competitive, mentally prepared and exceptionally pragmatic.

URUGUAY (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""Bielsa, but with restraint."" With Marcelo Bielsa in charge, Uruguay were always going to be direct going forward, man-to-man marking oriented defensively and immediately drive forward the moment the ball is won. Furthermore, Uruguay blocked the most shots (69) and recorded the highest volume of recoveries (839) in CONMEBOL qualifying. As much as Bielsa's sides can be chaotic at both ends, this version is surprisingly more measured -- 22-12 goal difference over 18 qualifiers is very un-Bielsa like -- yet the energetic, relentlessly competitive edge is still present.

CURACAO (4-3-3): ""Caribbean Total Football."" Curaçao might be the most ""European"" team in CONCACAF. With a squad built around players trained in the Netherlands, coach Dick Advocaat runs a neat 4-3-3 formation, while they put in a third-best 165 tackles, and a PPDA of 9.55 is one of the more assertive pressing numbers in the region. They also finished the entire CONCACAF qualifying cycle as aggregate top scorers across all three stages (28), powered by the Bacuna brothers (Leandro and Juninho) in midfield and two attack-minded full backs. Despite that offensive profile, Curaçao kept six clean sheets in 10 qualifiers. Against elite opposition, though, expect them to sit deep, invite pressure, then explode forward with pace.

HAITI (4-2-3-1): ""A remarkable rebound."" Haiti's squad lean heavily on a wide diaspora, but their on-pitch appearance is now clearer as a result of a turbulent qualifying run. Following a 5-1 collapse to Curaçao, Sebastian Migné tightened the formation, choosing a deeper, more compact defensive setup while keeping the option to set off short, explosive pressing waves. They may sit deeper against stronger sides -- and they managed a CONCACAF-high 436 recoveries -- but their backbone remains strong with disciplined box defenders, a hardworking midfield core and a frontline built for sudden attacking bursts.

PANAMA (5-4-1/4-4-2): ""Made in Barcelona."" Under former Barcelona forward Thomas Christiansen, Panama have evolved into one of CONCACAF's tidiest sides in possession and were second in the qualifying field (61.5%), a number that reflects Christiansen's emphasis on patient, progressive build-up and using the ball as their main tactical idea. Despite the Barcelona-schooling, the former Leeds United manager is no 4-3-3 fundamentalist as he started leaning towards deploying three center backs towards the end of the qualifying campaign.

Heading into AFCON, on the back of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, South Africa have developed a winning instinct that was lacking before, says defender Thabo Moloisane.

ALGERIA (4-2-3-1): ""A team that wakes up after 45 minutes."" Algeria eased their way to the 2026 World Cup with eight wins from 10 and Mohamed Amoura scoring 10 goals, but their Swiss coach Vladimir Petkovic still hasn't convinced everyone. His side posted 63.6% possession, the second-highest in African qualifying, yet often looked stagnant in build-up and vulnerable once the ball turned over, which is a strange contrast for a team packed with attacking flair and individual creativity. Petkovic's long tinkering phase didn't help clarity either. Still, Algeria's ability to change gears after halftime, press high and force opportunistic mistakes represent a defining weapon.

CAPE VERDE (4-3-3): ""A late bloomer you shouldn't underestimate."" Cape Verde enter their first World Cup with what is projected to be the tournament's oldest squad, averaging 30.7 years of age through qualifying. That experience defines their identity as much as their football. Pedro Leitao's side conceded just eight goals, based on strong organization and a calmness going into vital games. They operate from a compact 4-3-3, absorb pressure willingly and counter with precision through a sharp, pacy, front line which is happy to take opponents on. Their maturity, structure and game management make them unusually tricky for an easily underestimated debutant.

EGYPT (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""Salah's goals are paramount."" Egypt walked through qualifying unbeaten, conceding just two goals in 10 games, a true testimony of Hossam Hassan's shift toward risk-management. They control games through conservative organization first, which in turn makes Mohamed Salah's form the central variable heading into 2026. Egypt have the defensive base to frustrate anyone, but their attacking output remains modest (they ""underscored"" their xG by 2.4 in the qualifiers, but topped for key passes) and heavily rely to Salah's ability to turn tight matches with moments of quality.

GHANA (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""Ayew dependency up front."" Though ranked lowest in the FIFA ranking (72nd), Ghana are a functioning, pragmatic side under Otto Addo. The main outlets for goals, however, comes from a heavy dependency on 34-year-old striker Jordan Ayew (14 goals+assists from the qualifiers), which means that Addo needs to get more out of creative talents such as Mohammed Kudus and Kamaldeen Sulemana. Though Ghana's proficiency from set-pieces does somewhat ease the burden on their seasoned captain.

IVORY COAST (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""Structure and spine."" Boasting a 25-0 goal difference across qualification and with a structure built on a powerful spine rather than any single talisman, the Ivory Coast are a tricky proposition for any opponent. Under Emerse Faé they feature a disciplined 4-3-3 that can look like a 4-2-3-1 away from home, controlling long stretches of possession. Their attacking impact comes from rapid full backs and interchangeable wide forwards, but the collective spirit is key. The center backs dominate the box and they rely on a hard-running midfield to provide balance. This is a more mature, consistent, tournament-ready Ivory Coast than seen in recent editions.

MOROCCO (4-3-3/4-1-4-1): ""Hard to break down, but flair and creativity going forward."" Walid Regragui's side won eight games from eight in qualifying and conceded just twice. They are constructed around a compact 4-3-3 that becomes 4-1-4-1 when the wingers drop, but this isn't only about control and defensive rigidity as Morocco also carry genuine attacking flair: Achraf Hakimi's overlaps, Azzedine Ounahi's press resistance, Brahim Díaz's creativity, and the end-product of Hakim Ziyech, Youssef En-Nesyri and Ayoub El Kaabi. If Morocco can be criticized for showing caution, their attacking talent can still get them out of trouble.

SENEGAL (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""A serious contender?"" Senegal is arguably Africa's most complete and aesthetically pleasing side, packed with talent from back to front who are comfortable dictating games. They recorded 64.8% possession -- the highest in CAF qualifying -- and make good use of that to patiently shift the opponent from side to side until openings appear. Pape Thiaw's team press aggressively and rely on an energetic midfield to suffocate transitions. With this mix of technique, organization and top-level individual quality, Senegal can potentially trouble whoever they come up against.

SOUTH AFRICA (4-2-3-1/4-3-3): ""Sundowns DNA."" South Africa lean heavily on a core of players from Mamelodi Sundowns -- the country's perennial champions -- which gives them a rare cohesion at international level. Hugo Broos has built a nearly organized, well-drilled side which allowed just 5.8 shots per 90 minutes in qualifying, one of the stingiest records across Africa.

TUNISIA (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""Defensively excellent, but lacking firepower."" Tunisia had one of the most remarkable qualifying campaigns anywhere, with 10 clean sheets from 10 matches, which was the joint-best defensive record in Africa (along with Ivory Coast). Coach Sami Trabelsi has undoubtably tightened things by switching from Tunisia's old back three to a more stable back four that keeps players behind the ball and rarely gives up space. However, the question is whether that defensive perfection will be enough as Tunisia lack any forwards who play regularly in one of Europe's top five leagues.

Head coach Julen Lopetegui says he is ""very proud"" after Qatar qualified for the 2026 World Cup for the first time

AUSTRALIA (3-4-3): ""Three center backs, big on efficiency."" Australia are one of the few World Cup nations who feature a back three as a standard formation and the Tony Popovic version has proved remarkably efficient. While they're comfortable without the ball and rely on their three center backs to protect central spaces, the takeaway from qualifying was their output. Australia outperformed their xG by nearly +10 (28.5 vs. 38), which is quite remarkable in the absence of a high-scoring center forward. They were second for take-ons (281) in the Asian qualifiers, but while don't they create masses of chances (they were fifth), they often finish the ones they get and grind through games with discipline.

IRAN (4-2-3-1): ""Create plenty, but could score more."" Iran completed the second-most through balls in Asian qualifying (12), indicating that their midfield can unpick lines even if the overall approach by and large is reactive. Amir Ghalenoei's 4-2-3-1 tend to sit deep and counter, leaning on the penalty-box instincts of Mehdi Taremi and Sardar Azmoun up front, but chance creation can stall against set defenses. The creative numbers are promising (their xG of 18.99 was sixth in qualifying), yet converting that to tournament play -- where space is scarcer -- is Iran's challenge.

JAPAN (3-4-2-1): ""Creation and efficiency through structure."" Japan swept through qualifying with 51 goals (from an xG of 30.18), 188 chances created and 149 key passes, highlighting how intelligently they move the ball. Hajime Moriyasu's flexible concept is based on high pressing with sharp positional rotations in the final third, consistently crafting spare players between lines. Japan have also found an interesting edge from corners, with six converted in  qualifying. The aggression of their back three can leave space if the wing backs push too high, placing real demands on the double pivot in midfield. But when things click, Japan generate chances at a rate no regional rival can match.

JORDAN (5-4-1/3-5-2): ""Beware the transition."" World Cup debutants Jordan made the finals with the lowest average possession of any Asian qualifier (46.7%), which appears very much by design. Houcine Ammouta and now Jamal Sellami have settled fully into a back-three defense that collapses into a 5-4-1, trusting wide center backs to win duels and trigger fast breaks. Their attack comes almost exclusively from vertical runs after regaining the ball and this style has produced one of the region's strongest shot-to-transition ratios. But if they are to be dangerous, Jordan need it to be a stretched game.

QATAR (4-2-3-1): ""Defensive worries."" While Julen Lopetegui has added more structure to Qatar's buildup, the headache of their campaign was their defensive troubles. They leaked 24 goals in the third qualifying stage, the worst of any of the 18 Asian nations. That defensive volatility contrasts sharply with their threat in transition, where the prolific Almoez Ali -- top scorer in qualification with 12 -- gives them a proper edge. Set pieces have also turned into a reliable source of chances, but unless Lopetegui sorts out the defense, the 2022 hosts will really struggle.

SAUDI ARABIA (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): ""Energy in midfield, short up front."" In his second spell as manager, Hervé Renard has improved the country's out-of-possession game, but the attack is still a weak spot. They scored only seven goals in the final qualifying group and the Frenchman is still looking for a compatible front line. To compensate, he has pushed the team towards a more direct style, placing more emphasis on the midfield runners as they produced the second-highest volume of touches in the opposition box (449) among Asia's qualifiers.

SOUTH KOREA (3-4-3/4-2-3-1): ""Seeking variety beyond Son."" South Korea raced through qualifying unbeaten and scoring freely, yet questions remain on how much of their attack still has to flow through the 33-year-old Son Heung-Min. Hong Myung-bo's midfield double pivot and restrained full backs give them territorial control (71.4% average possession, the highest from Asian qualifying) but chance creation often depends on individual interventions rather than collective patterns. His recent shift toward a back three -- wing backs higher; Son as a lone striker -- is one effort to broaden the threat. Despite preferring control and possession, they can ""explode"" on the final third with 1,324 progressive passes (the best in Asia).

UZBEKISTAN (3-4-3/3-5-2): ""Cross early, cross often."" Timur Kapadze's arrival mid-campaign -- now reinstated as assistant after the unexpected recent appointment of Italy legend Fabio Cannavaro as manager -- turned Uzbekistan into a more pronounced back-three side, giving them license to attack aggressively through their wing backs while trusting Manchester City defender Abdukodir Khusanov to rescue them in transition with his outstanding recovery pace. Their main source of attacking threat come from wide areas, though, as they produced 222 crosses and 160 shots in qualifying

NEW ZEALAND (4-3-3/4-5-1): ""More needed from Wood."" New Zealand's friendly form has been dodgy (no wins in seven, just one draw), but Darren Bazeley's main tactical challenge is getting 33-year-old Chris Wood involved in more than penalty-box finishes, especially since the Nottingham Forest striker has failed to take his Premier League form to international level (just three goals in the qualifying). As Oceania's opponents (such as Fiji and New Caledonia) were predictably no match for the Kiwis, they could rely on a flat 4-3-3 and a steady flow of crosses, but the 2026 World Cup will demand a more cohesive, unadventurous approach, most likely a 4-2-3-1 with Wood linking play earlier. Bazeley wants his captain to act as a reference in build-up rather than solely focusing on the end product.

Mark Ogden speaks about his trip to Gibraltar to watch New Caledonia.

The remaining six teams will come from two routes: the UEFA playoffs (4) and the inter-confederation playoff (2).

UEFA playoffs:

1. Italy/Northern Ireland vs. Wales/Bosnia and Herzegovina
2. Ukraine/Sweden vs. Poland/Albania
3. Turkey/Romania vs. Slovakia/Kosovo
4. Denmark/North Macedonia vs. Czechia/Republic of Ireland

Inter-confederation playoff:

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

 (Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)

More than 1,200 players will travel to the World Cup finals next June.

The joy of a tournament like this is that these players will range from the biggest and richest superstars in the world game to those who are barely professionals. Yet for a few weeks, they will be thrown together to compete for the biggest prize in the sport.

Among those 1,200-plus will be a relatively small number of the elite. So with that in mind, we have picked who we think will be the 100 best players at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

These sorts of articles are, inevitably, subjective. But we have tried to include some more measurable criteria to come up with the order for our 100, and so we created five categories, with each player awarded a mark between one and five. These scores were then totted up, and placed in order.

The five categories are:

So that's how we came up with the list.

You may well disagree. There are players who didn't make our top 100 who perhaps deserved to, and there may well be names on the list who won't make it to the World Cup for various reasons, but we're pretty happy with how it all shook out.

Enjoy.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

It feels like we sometimes take for granted just how good Mbappe is. A scorer in the past two World Cup finals (including a hat-trick in the 2022 edition), he's still the man around whom France are built, and any fears that a move to Real Madrid could have hampered his club form can be answered by the fact he's scoring at better than a goal per game for them this season. The French are among the favourites for the 2026 World Cup, and he'll still be their decisive man.



Age: 25 Position: Forward

It's a compliment to Haaland that the word ‘freak' comes to mind so often when summing up his game and his record. There is no one else like him. A human bulldozer who can score almost any type of goal imaginable. And now we get to watch him at a World Cup… there is justice in the world.



Age: 18 Position: Forward

He won't turn 19 until a few days before the final on July 19, but Yamal is already among the world's best. What's remarkable is that there seems to have been very little lead-up to his journey to this point: he arrived perfectly formed, as he did when playing a key role as Spain won the 2024 European Championship. You wouldn't bet against him repeating the trick at the World Cup.

Age: 32 Position: Forward

A model striker, a model footballer, a model professional, just a perfect specimen of what a modern centre-forward should be. He is the record goalscorer for both Tottenham Hotspur and England, and is now breaking records in the German Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, too. If there was much of a ‘Kane brand' he'd be a global superstar, but his unassuming nature is all part of the charm.



Age: 23 Position: Midfielder

The man who helps both club and country make sense, Pedri's international career has been pockmarked by injuries, not least the one that meant he missed the business end of Spain's Euro 2024 triumph. But he's very much part of coach Luis de la Fuente's furniture in an absurdly talented midfield.

Age: 22 Position: Midfielder

A tornado of desire who has elevated his game to incredible heights. Knowing what Bellingham is going to do on the pitch is one thing, stopping him is another, because of that unstinting ambition and drive. But will he even get in the England team next summer? It's hard to imagine they can win the World Cup without him.

Age: 25 Position: Forward

This will be Vinicius Jr's second World Cup, but the first where he will be truly out of fellow forward Neymar's shadow. For all the apparent turmoil in his relationship with Real Madrid, he is still one of the most electrifying players in the game, and under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, who got the best from him in Spain, he will be the man Brazil look to.

Age: 38 Position: Forward

Words are difficult at this point, so perhaps this should just be a picture of an achingly beautiful golden sunset over a pristine-perfect Miami beach. It will be every football fan's true pleasure to watch this higher self perform at one more World Cup.



Age: 34 Position: Midfielder

Maybe the glory days of Belgium's golden generation are behind them, but De Bruyne is still among the best midfielders in the world. The big question will be over his fitness: he started this season in superb form for Napoli, but at the time of writing is on the sidelines. If fit, De Bruyne will still be one of the tournament's dominant performers, even though he'll turn 35 during it.

Age: 26 Position: Goalkeeper

In age terms, he's not even halfway through his career yet, but he has already made 500 appearances for club and country. Donnarumma has the ability to produce saves which elicit cartoon-style rubbing of eyeballs. If Italy don't qualify via the UEFA play-offs in March, it will mean the game's best keeper has still yet to appear at a World Cup, which is like banning Paul McCartney from Glastonbury.

Age: 34 Position: Defender

Man for man, the Dutch arguably have the best set of defenders at this tournament. At the heart of it all is Van Dijk, and that is a big part of why he ranks so highly in these ratings: if the Netherlands are to go far in this tournament, it will be based on a unit that conceded just four goals in their eight qualifiers.

Age: 29 Position: Midfielder

Manchester City still haven't recovered from Rodri's long-term knee injury early in the 2024-25 season, with his continued fitness issues in its wake leaving a gap that feels impossible to fill without spending a fortune. The smooth, metronomic beat to which a Champions League and European Championship have been won.

Age: 25 Position: Midfielder

A year ago, shrewd judges would be tapping their noses and quietly telling you what a player this guy is. Vitinha is mainstream now: he came third in the Ballon d'Or voting in September, and you could easily argue he was more important to Paris Saint-Germain's successes last season than that award's winner Ousmane Dembele. A whirling, relentless figure with and without the ball, Vitinha could be one of the stars of the World Cup.

Age: 28 Position: Forward

The make-up of Brazil's World Cup attack isn't quite clear yet but Raphinha will be in it, bringing his whirlwind of skill, pace and ingenuity, whichever flank he plays on. He operates in the shadow of Vinicius Jr and Yamal for country and club, but his end product is ridiculous (34 goals and 26 assists in 57 games for Barcelona last season).

Advertisement

Age: 28 Position: Forward

Colombia will be led by their captain and talisman James Rodriguez, now 34, but the team's biggest threat will be Diaz. The winger has been an absolute sensation since joining Bayern from Liverpool in the summer, and will be his nation's key attacking threat at the World Cup. Undoubtedly one of the best in the game in his position.

Age: 24 Position: Forward

It is testament to Saka's brilliance that players such as Phil Foden and Cole Palmer aren't even discussed as a right-flank option for England at the 2026 World Cup. The shirt is Saka's and, with Arsenal and possibly England on the cusp of doing something special in the coming months, you feel he is ready to become a truly great player. Exceptional at what he does — and he plays with such joy.

Age: 37 Position: Forward

We're now used to footballers in their late thirties playing on and looking like they're 25, but even in that context Lewandowski is ridiculous. At 37, he doesn't seem to be any different to when he was in his pomp with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in Germany: he scored 42 goals in 52 games last season for Barcelona, and you'd back him to do similar in this one.

Age: 26 Position: Midfielder

With props to this summer's arrival Martin Zubimendi for helping free him up in Arsenal's midfield, Rice is a rare example of a huge-money signing actually being decent value. A linchpin for Arsenal and England, a natural leader, and a nice chap to boot.

Age: 33 Position: Forward

Egypt's played-three-lost-three performance at the 2018 World Cup was a huge disappointment, and a significant factor must have been that Salah was only a few weeks removed from the shoulder injury that forced him off in the Champions League final. After failing to qualify four years later, they will hope he's fully fit this time because, at his best, he's among the greatest African players of all time, not just Egypt's.

Advertisement

Age: 28 Position: Forward

You may wonder why the 2025 Ballon d'Or winner is only 20th on our list, but his current form (owing to enduring an injury-hit season so far) rating is low, otherwise he'd have been in the top 10. At his best, Dembele is the footballing equivalent of human electricity.

Age: 24 Position: Midfielder

It feels like a long time ago now that people were fretting that Chelsea had paid too much money for Caicedo in August 2023. Now, that £115million ($152m at the current rate) almost looks like a bargain, and there's a good case to be made that he's the best central midfielder in the world. If Ecuador do anything at this tournament, it will be driven by Caicedo.

Age: 27 Position: Defender

When Real Madrid let him go in 2020 after 17 first-team appearances, few would have predicted his career trajectory with both Paris Saint-Germain and Morocco. The highest-placed full-back on our list, Hakimi is the current African Footballer of the Year (the first Moroccan to win that award since 1998) and was sixth in the Ballon d'Or voting.

Age: 27 Position: Defender

Brazilian football seems to be going through one of its semi-regular existential crises, but at least they can rely on the fact they have one of the best central defenders in the world. Gabriel has helped turn Arsenal into a virtually impregnable force, so if he can do the same for Brazil, that's half their World Cup battle won.

Age: 23 Position: Forward

From playing for Reading in England's second-tier Championship to the Champions League with Bayern in three years, Olise has enjoyed a stellar rise which has also included cementing his position in the France team, despite some ridiculously tough competition.

Advertisement

Age: 40 Position: Forward

Still going, still scoring goals. If Ronaldo finds the net next summer, he'll be the first to score at six World Cups, which is an astonishing achievement. As for why he's not appeared on this list before now, it's worth pointing out he hasn't made the top 30 in the Ballon d'Or voting since 2021, so you could argue he's actually too high. Will he defy time, or will this be the tournament when he slips from the spotlight?



Age: 33 Position: Goalkeeper

Every successful team needs an elite goalkeeper, and Courtois has won six league titles with three clubs in England and Spain. The world's best keeper? He's not quite the highest at his position on our list, with his lower value bringing him down a peg, but if you had to pick a goalkeeper to line up for you in a World Cup final, there would be no reason not to choose him.

Age: 27 Position: Midfielder

So often part of the supporting cast for Real Madrid, Valverde is frequently the main man for his country, and will be even more so if striker Darwin Nunez's edge is blunted after moving to play his club football in Saudi Arabia. He will be crucial to how Uruguay perform under Marcelo Bielsa: he's perhaps the perfect Bielsa player, so if he performs as he can, they might just go far.

Age: 30 Position: Midfielder

One of the most consistent performers on our list, and there aren't many who can read a game better. Kimmich's versatility is a huge plus for both Bayern and Germany. Only his comparatively low transfer value compared to more attacking players bumps him down our list a tad.

Age: 31 Position: Midfielder

At Manchester United, Fernandes often has to perform the roles of both string-puller and goalscorer, but he has a lot more help with Portugal. Sometimes, it looks as if that doesn't entirely suit him, that he prefers to be the main man: maybe if Ronaldo, who'll be 41 by then, doesn't start every game at the World Cup, he can become that for his national team.

Advertisement

Age: 20 Position: Midfielder

One of those ‘Worth the admission fee on his own' type players who can bring a smile to your face with a threaded pass or a fancy bit of skill, Guler has had to be patient at Real Madrid but has come to the fore this season under new manager Xabi Alonso. If Turkey make it through the UEFA play-offs, he will be a great addition to the World Cup.

Age: 26 Position: Defender

It's perhaps slightly surprising to see Bastoni so early on this list, but he had high ratings across the board and if you've watched him play for Inter, you might not be that shocked. A muscular yet elegant defender who can start (or finish) an attack just as well as he can shut your striker down. If Italy make it to the World Cup via those March play-offs, he will probably be their key man.

Age: 25 Position: Forward

Pep Guardiola and Manchester City don't make many mistakes in the transfer market, but letting Alvarez leave for Atletico Madrid in August 2024 still feels like a sizeable misstep. He has a better than one-in-two goals-to-games ratio for Atletico in La Liga and, as he showed with four goals in helping his country win the previous World Cup three years ago, can take his form to the biggest of stages.

Age: 40 Position: Midfielder

Is Modric the player he once was? No, probably not. Is he still an utter joy to watch, an experience that we should all cling to at the highest level while it lasts because, hey, the man turned 40 in September? Absolutely. At an age when most men are worried about how frequently they have to get up to use the toilet per night, Modric is leading his country to another World Cup and will probably win his 200th cap if they go well there.

Advertisement

Age: 22 Position: Midfielder

It was horrible to see the game robbed of one of its most delightful players through injury, but Musiala looks set to return soon after suffering a broken leg playing for Bayern in the summer's Club World Cup. His injury obviously impacts his form rating on our list, but as anyone who watched Euro 2024 knows, Musiala can lay claim to being one of the best attacking midfielders in the world.

Age: 23 Position: Defender

The best left-back in the world right now? Probably. He's the highest from that position on our list. One feature common to most of the World Cup contenders is a relative weakness, or perhaps uncertainty, at full-back: expect no such problems for Portugal in 2026. Mendes established himself as elite during Paris Saint-Germain's run to winning the Champions League last season, and he could well show that type of form again at this World Cup.

Age: 28 Position: Midfielder

Silky? Yes. Press-resistant? Yes. Glides through midfield with effortless ball control? Yes. De Jong, the ultimate tempo-dictator, the ultimate elegant midfielder. He has overcome positional and injury issues to become a key player for Barcelona and arguably the most important member of the current Dutch side.

Age: 33 Position: Forward

It's been wonderful to watch Son flourish in MLS since his move to LAFC, because at some points in his last season or so at Tottenham, it almost felt a little sad that this previously glorious force was fading so rapidly. Now he seems revitalised, will potentially be playing ‘at home', depending on the draw, and will be his nation's leader again.

Age: 33 Position: Forward

Undeniably one of the greatest African footballers of all time who, injury permitting, returns to the World Cup after missing the 2022 tournament through injury. Remains the focal point of Senegal's attack and would be higher up this list were it not for his low transfer value.

Advertisement

Age: 27 Position: Forward

When the World Cup's host nation has a standout star player, often the pressure on them is crushing — particularly if that status isn't necessarily backed up with solid form. The good news for Pulisic, the USMNT, the tournament organisers and many beyond is there are no such worries here: he is in sparkling touch for Milan, and if he carries that into the tournament, the nation staging next July's final could be a relevant force.

Age: 33 Position: Midfielder

Xhaka's late-career renaissance has been one of European football's nicer stories of recent years. From being booed and stripped of the Arsenal captaincy in 2019, to an unbeaten Bundesliga title with Bayer Leverkusen and now one of the Premier League's best midfielders again with promoted Sunderland. He is Switzerland's most important player, too.

Age: 24 Position: Defender

Quite rightly, the eye is drawn to France's absurd array of attacking talent, but it is worth remembering they've got some of the best defenders in the world, too. The finest of those is Saliba, who has helped make the Arsenal back line resemble an iron wall: it's remarkable to think, given his incredible composure, that he's still just 24.

Age: 33 Position: Goalkeeper

If you were building an archetypal modern goalkeeper, you'd probably just make Alisson, whose signing changed the game for Liverpool in July 2018. He remains a match-winner on his own, as he showed in Paris earlier this year, and is now one of Brazil's greatest at his position.

Age: 25 Position: Defender

Davies would probably have appeared earlier on this list if he hadn't been injured for a big chunk of the calendar year. But if he can get back to his best after recovering from that anterior cruciate ligament tear eight months ago, he's one of the most thrilling sights in the game — a perfect modern full-back who often looks more like a winger, but one who can defend too.

Age: 21 Position: Midfielder

A player with an endless list of attributes who is basically a manager's dream. Versatile, mature beyond his years, energetic, composed and authoritative on the ball, Neves could do whatever he wants to in his career. So far, he's already been a key part of a Champions League-winning side.

Advertisement

Age: 28 Position: Midfielder

Of all the midfielders in the world that you might choose to play against, Guimaraes would be near the bottom of the list. Utterly relentless, the type of opponent who would never give you a moment of peace: as well as applying this to his form at Newcastle United, he has become one of Brazil's most important players.

Age: 22 Position: Midfielder

As you might imagine, Wirtz takes a huge hit here on the 2025-26 form metric after a very underwhelming start to life at Liverpool, otherwise he'd be heading towards the top 20. Form is temporary, as they say, and you'd expect Wirtz to thrive for Germany.

Age: 28 Position: Forward

It tells you plenty about the forward options available to head coach Lionel Scaloni that Lautaro is not a guaranteed starter for Argentina. He would walk into most other teams, and if he did play for someone else, he would be further up this list, his score having suffered in the ‘Importance to their nation' column.

Age: 26 Position: Midfielder

A surprise breakout star at the 2022 World Cup, where he was a dainty fulcrum in Argentina's midfield. Mac Allister is one of those players that every team needs; a rhythmic, dependable workhorse. Has suffered with form at Liverpool this season, but then who hasn't?

Age: 28 Position: Defender

Given Portugal's attacking options, it would be easy and understandable to forget about their defence. But they have one of the 2026 World Cup's more solid performers there in Dias, who has quietly become among the most experienced and reliable defenders in Europe.

Age: 32 Position: Defender

One of the highest-placed centre-backs in our list, Rudiger stands out for his dominance and aggression with both Germany and Real Madrid. A strong performer across the board in our metrics, only a lower transfer value pushes him slightly down the list.

Advertisement

Age: 33 Position: Forward

This is the point on this list where a big score in a single category can boost a player's ranking. Taremi might not be playing at the top level of club football these days (although he is banging them in for Greek champions Olympiacos), but he is still the key player and main goal threat for Iran: to illustrate the point, he scored twice in the game that qualified his country for this tournament, against Uzbekistan in March.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

Perhaps a little underrated sometimes, but there is no arguing with his remarkably consistent record — Gakpo averages pretty much bang on 0.5 goals per 90 minutes across his career for club and country. Like his Liverpool team, his form has dropped a little this season, but he's the most important player in the Dutch attack.

Age: 26 Position: Midfielder

After what feels like years of underachievement, Norway are finally at a major tournament again, and if they are to make any impression on this World Cup then Haaland can't do it all on his own. The good news is that one of the best strikers in the world has one of the game's best creators supplying him. Odegaard would be ranked better than 53rd were it not for his injury issues, and his nation's lack of recent success.

Age: 24 Position: Midfielder

Fernandez's evolution into one of world football's truly elite midfielders continues apace with his consistently improved Premier League form at Chelsea. A mainstay of the Argentina midfield, Fernandez not only sees the game in widescreen, he is both tenacious and creative in equal measure. His FC 26 rating drops him down the list, however.

Age: 23 Position: Forward

The Manchester City winger has been part of the Belgian setup since he was 18, but it's only in the past couple of years that he's become one of their key men. Doku's generation, alongside players such as Charles De Ketelaere and Leandro Trossard, and with youngsters such as 20-year-old Malick Fofana coming through, might not be as famous as the days of Eden Hazard and Dries Mertens, but they might turn out to be as effective.



Age: 23 Position: Defender

It feels like Gvardiol, arguably the best centre-back at Qatar 2022, has already been around for a very long time and, given his maturity levels, it is easy to think he is older than 23. Maybe it's the beard, which, to be fair, looks thicker than the Amazon rainforest. Switches between centre-back and left-back for Manchester City and Croatia, and is a very consistent performer for both. Also a goal threat.

Advertisement

Age: 23 Position: Midfielder

When he was at previous club Bayern, there was a sense that Gravenberch was extremely talented but didn't quite have a defined role. Under Arne Slot at Liverpool, that has changed, and that's been to the benefit of the Netherlands too, who now have an exceptional crop of midfielders to pick from.

Age: 24 Position: Defender

A nerveless centre-back who can be harder to run through than a brick wall, Pacho was a key part of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League success in 2025 and played every single minute of Ecuador's World Cup qualification campaign, in which they kept a remarkable 13 clean sheets in their 18 matches and conceded just five goals.

Age: 31 Position: Defender

This will be Brazil's first World Cup since Germany 2006 without Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos is now the experienced head at the heart of their defence. He's been performing that role for Paris Saint-Germain for some time now, and would be further up these rankings if injury hadn't disrupted his domestic season so far.

Age: 27 Position: Defender

One of the most talented right-backs ever seen in English football but Alexander-Arnold currently finds himself playing second fiddle at Real Madrid following a summer move from Liverpool, and it is doubtful whether he will even be in the England squad at the World Cup. Has to be on this list, though, given his quite ridiculous ability.

Age: 27 Position: Defender

When he entered the wider public consciousness, Kounde was a centre-back. But he was shifted to the right side of defence out of necessity, and it's now a position he very much owns for both Barcelona and France. His form this season hasn't quite been his best, but you'd expect him to recover by the time the tournament arrives.

Advertisement

Age: 30 Position: Goalkeeper

A keeper who had to bide his time for many years, both in domestic football — Maignan was 22 before he started playing regularly for Lille — and internationally, where he was understudy to Hugo Lloris for many years. Now France's undisputed No 1, and one of the world's most consistent performers in goal.

Age: 28 Position: Midfielder

Another player who is technically not definitely at the tournament yet, but it would be remiss not to include Barella in these rankings. A brilliant all-round midfielder, he theoretically has it all, and was a key man when Italy won the European Championship in 2021. They will lean on him for success at this World Cup too… assuming they make it.

Age: 34 Position: Forward

There are the usual caveats about age and how he's now playing in the Saudi Pro League, and therefore his level of performance might be a little unpredictable. But Mahrez is still Algeria's talisman, and his position is higher than a few other quality players because of his importance to his nation. This might be his last dance at the highest level, but it could be a big one.

Age: 33 Position: Goalkeeper

A cheeky, why-I-oughta rapscallion to some, the devil incarnate to others, but even through gritted teeth, pretty much everyone can agree Martinez is one of the world's best goalkeepers. He's certainly one of the most decorated, with a World Cup, two Copas America, a couple of Yashin Trophy wins as the best goalkeeper in the game and, unofficially, the title of Football's Biggest Scamp.

Age: 20 Position: Forward

A thrilling attacker. If you were purely judging players on aesthetics, Doue would be in a much more prominent position on this list, but his ranking here suffers slightly because France have a lot of thrilling attackers. If, say, Luis Diaz was to get injured, then Colombia would suffer because they don't have anyone of comparable quality: should Doue be stricken, the French have a queue of replacements. But that isn't to diminish the young man's brilliance.

Advertisement

Age: 23 Position: Forward

One-third of Europe's most potent strike force at Paris Saint-Germain for a brief period, although the emergence of Doue means Barcola has to fight for minutes for club and country. Perhaps not fully trusted by France manager Didier Deschamps yet, but his ability isn't in doubt.

Age: 28 Position: Midfielder

Has there been a greater ‘glow up' in recent years than McTominay blossoming from a workaday, reliable, seven-out-of-10 performer for Manchester United, to a title-winning talisman at Napoli? He performs that role for Scotland now too, as evidenced by his sensational overhead kick in the win against Denmark that confirmed their first World Cup place since 1998.

Age: 23 Position: Midfielder

The guy may have more trademarks than Disney, but on the football pitch there's pretty much only one Cole Palmer. One of the most joyous sights in the Premier League is watching him languidly thread a pass or nonchalantly curl one into the top corner for Chelsea. The fact he is potentially not in England's World Cup XI speaks to their strength right now.

Age: 25 Position: Midfielder

There is a danger of Foden becoming a bit of an enigma, a supremely talented performer who doesn't quite fulfil their potential at international level. English football history is littered with such players, but this time it's not just suspicion of flair, it's because there are so many other options in his best positions: to get in the team, he has to compete with Saka, Bellingham, Palmer, Morgan Rogers and others.

Age: 25 Position: Forward

Basically, if you want someone who can dribble past a defender with a body feint and a brisk turn of pace, there are very few better than Kudus. However, if you also want someone to sporadically go missing in games, Kudus can be that guy, too. Inconsistent, but can be a world-beater.

Advertisement

Age: 23 Position: Forward

There is an instinct to compare Williams and Yamal: two incredibly talented young Spanish wingers, who operate on different flanks and thus complement each other. But that's unfair, and while Williams perhaps doesn't have the profile of Yamal right now, he's still very exciting and will be one of Spain's key threats at the World Cup.

Age: 25 Position: Midfielder

The glue around which the Real Madrid and France midfields are built, Tchouameni combines a tactical brain with the legs of a Grand National winner and is one of those players who makes being a midfield pivot look very easy.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

It feels like Havertz has been a long-term temporary solution for both club and country. Arsenal and Germany have frequently fretted about not having a genuine centre-forward and hankered after a more traditional No 9, during which time Havertz has performed admirably in the role. He's probably more important there to his national team than his club, and hopefully his ongoing injury absence doesn't hamper his World Cup prospects too much.

Age: 28 Position: Forward

Not quite prolific enough to be classed as an elite striker, but Thuram's rise from the French lower leagues to winning Serie A with Inter and playing in a World Cup and the Champions League final is a great story. A constant physical presence and offers versatility in attack.

Age: 21 Position: Midfielder

It's inevitable that injury will deny some key players the chance to be part of this World Cup, and you fear Gavi might be one of them, given the knee problem that has restricted him to just two appearances for Barcelona this season. If he's fit, the partnership he has with Pedri for club and country is a joy to watch, and you hope we'll see it in full flow in the summer.

Age: 27 Position: Forward

Not a mainstay either in Barcelona's team or for Spain, yet there are few better in terms of technical ability and footballing intelligence in those pockets in the final third than Olmo. Surprisingly became a key component of Spain's Euro 2024-winning side and was named in the team of the tournament.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

The heir apparent to Salah's crown as Egypt's great attacking hope, for the moment Marmoush is his primary support act. But he also complements Salah nicely, coming off the left of Egypt's front three. Marmoush perhaps hasn't played as well this season as he did in the previous one, but if Egypt are to improve their poor World Cup record, they will need both him and Salah on top form.

Age: 25 Position: Midfielder

Not picked for Euro 2020 and suspended for Euro 2024, this will be Tonali's first major tournament, should Italy make it. Aggressive and positive, his game has evolved in the past year to the point that he has become one of the Premier League's most complete midfielders.

Age: 27 Position: Midfielder

It tells you plenty that even with Gravenberch and De Jong to compete with, Reijnders is still a key part of the Dutch midfield. It's partly because of that competition that Reijnders is in a relatively modest position on this list: manager Ronald Koeman has plenty of cover in his position, but he nonetheless makes them a much better side if he is available.

Age: 25 Position: Forward

It's surely a matter of when, not if, Semenyo moves to a Champions League-level club now that he's become a big fish in a small pond. You can imagine him making an impact at just about any of the Premier League's top sides. Sorry, Bournemouth fans. Anyway, Semenyo is just a joyful player to watch. Direct, fast, skilful. Bosh.

Age: 21 Position: Defender

Injuries have hampered Sporting CP's Diomande fairly significantly in Portugal this season, but that doesn't mean he isn't a hugely promising defender and will be key if Ivory Coast are to improve on their poor record at the World Cup, having never got beyond the group stage. Watch out for Diomande as a player whose value could shoot up after the tournament.

Age: 26 Position: Midfielder

Real Madrid's gifted attacking midfielder/winger has become a crucial component in Morocco's attack since switching allegiances from Spain in early 2024. A regular in Madrid's squad, if not the first XI, Diaz can turn any game with his creativity and close dribbling.

Age: 22 Position: Midfielder

Simons has had a tricky start to life at Tottenham, but he's still one of the key creative forces for the Dutch. Their defence is strong and their midfield has plenty of No 6/No 8 options, but the quality is lighter in attack, which is where Simons is so important, either in a No 10 role or out wide.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

A mercurial winger who is almost impossible to stop on his day, it's just that ‘his day' hasn't quite come around frequently enough in the past. Leao has never quite nailed down a regular starting spot for Portugal, but when he and Mendes dovetail in tandem, there are few better sights in international football.

Age: 21 Position: Defender

The countries experiencing the tournament for the first time are the best stories at this World Cup. Khusanov is Uzbekistan's most prominent player and one of the most promising defenders at the tournament: his time at Manchester City has been a little stop-start so far since January's transfer, but he comes alive with his national team.

Age: 26 Position: Midfielder

Not only an intelligent defensive midfielder who excels in breaking up play but also a facilitator for others, Zubimendi hasn't generated as many headlines as some of his Arsenal team-mates, but he has significantly improved them in defence and attack since joining this past summer. A vital team player for club and country who is coming into his peak years.

Age: 23 Position: Midfielder

Is versatility a blessing or a curse? On the one hand, it makes you very useful to a coach, and is handy for things like being called up to a tournament squad. On the other, it means you never quite establish yourself in a particular role in the team. Camavinga's ability to play in midfield, on the left and at left-back arguably means we've never quite seen how good he can be.

Age: 18 Position: Defender

Has already played in six Clasicos across three La Liga seasons and won 10 senior caps for Spain, all before his 19th birthday in January. Not a typical career trajectory for a centre-back, but then Cubarsi is no ordinary player. A technical, mature defender who is calmness personified.

Age: 33 Position: Goalkeeper

Considering Manuel Neuer was around for almost all of his international career, Ter Stegen's total of 44 caps since a 2012 debut is actually pretty impressive. Neuer was one of several German players to retire after Euro 2024, so the gloves are now Ter Stegen's. You hope the back injury which has prevented him playing yet this season doesn't stop him going to his first major tournament as Germany's No 1.

Age: 24 Position: Forward

With his pace, movement and agility, a confident Jackson is a striker to be feared. He tends to score prolifically when in the mood, although competing with Kane and Mane at club and international levels does limit his minutes.

Advertisement

Age: 18 Position: Forward

If you think Estevao should be better placed in these rankings… well, you might be right, but while his promise is colossal, his lack of experience and the competition in his position for Brazil mean he's in this relatively modest position. But who knows: once we get closer to the tournament, he could feature much, much earlier.

Age: 24 Position: Forward

Back in the Brazil fold under his former Real Madrid manager Ancelotti, having been dropped earlier this year. Rodrygo can't nail down a place for Madrid, with a penchant for playing on the left proving problematic, but his talent is undeniable.

Age: 23 Position: Forward

Competition for forward places in the France squad is obviously incredibly fierce, but Ekitike has the talent to be right up there with the best of them. The question is: can he maintain his challenge for a spot in the team if his club, Liverpool, are in such dreadful form?

Age: 21 Position: Midfielder

Not yet played 100 senior matches in his career but the archetypal No 6 has a decent chance of being a mainstay of Germany's midfield for many years to come. Missed the Euros last year due to tonsillitis, meaning this World Cup will be his first major international tournament.

Age: 20 Position: Defender

Huijsen has suffered a slightly sticky start to life at Real Madrid this season, partly because of his form but now because of injury, and he might have to accept he will not start every week for Alonso, even when fit. But then you remember he was still a teenager eight months ago, and that his undoubted talent will surely see him become one of the world's top centre-backs in the coming years.

Age: 17 Position: Midfielder

Already being hailed as a generational talent, Mora will be a lot higher on the 2030 edition of this list if his upward career trajectory continues. A Liga MX debutant at 15, Mexico's youngest senior player at 16 and next set to become a World Cup starlet at 17 before a surely inevitable move to Europe.

Age: 28 Position: Forward

Surprisingly has just 29 caps for his country despite his experience (due to a combination of injuries and only moving to Europe aged 24). A consistently effective performer in the Premier League for Brighton & Hove Albion. Injury permitting, Mitoma should be one to watch in 2026 in his first World Cup as a starter.

Age: 26 Position: Forward

Most national teams have a problem position: Brazil actually have a few (their full-back options aren't too hot), but centre-forward has been an issue for some time. Cunha could solve that, though. His ability to play through the middle as a sort of false nine/roaming reference point, surrounded by Vinicius Jr/Estevao/Raphinha /Rodrygo/whoever, could provide a solution for Ancelotti.

Age: 24 Position: Forward

A gifted Real Sociedad winger who has long been put on a pedestal as the future of Japanese football, Kubo has already been playing for the national team for six years and chipped in with three goals and eight assists in qualification. Unusually, he is formerly of Barcelona (at youth level) and Real Madrid, but is yet to take that next step at club level.

Robbie Williams will also perform at Friday's event

Trump expected to receive Fifa's new peace award

Robbie Williams, Andrea Bocelli and the Village People are to perform as part of a “world-class entertainment line-up” during Friday's draw for the 2026 men's football World Cup. The draw for next year's tournament will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, with model and TV personality Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor Danny Ramirez co-hosting the event.

The Village People will perform YMCA to cap off an event that promises have distinctly Trumpian overtones. The disco hit became a staple at Donald Trump's campaign rallies and Mar-a-Lago fundraisers.

Other musical performances will include the classical singer Bocelli and a duet by Williams – who is Fifa's music ambassador – and Nicole Scherzinger. The tournament takes place in the US, Canada and Mexico next summer, running from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities.

Adding another layer of Trump connection, Fifa also plans to unveil its new “Peace Prize – Football Unites the World” during the event. The award is widely expected to go to Trump after his calls to receive a Nobel Peace Prize this year. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, attended Trump's inauguration in January and has said he deserved global recognition for his role in brokering a ceasefire in the Middle East.

Expanded to 48 teams and 104 matches, the World Cup will span venues from Mexico City to Vancouver and from New York to Los Angeles, with the bulk of games staged in the US as Fifa looks to tap into the world's biggest sports market.

Robbie Williams (right) has won a record 18 Brit Awards

American disco group Village People and British superstar Robbie Williams are among the artists set to perform at Friday's World Cup draw in Washington DC.

The Village People are due to perform their iconic 1970s song 'YMCA', which has more recently become synonymous with president Donald Trump's campaign rallies.

The draw for the 2026 World Cup, which will feature 48 nations, takes place at the Kennedy Center, at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time).

Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, who performed as part of Leicester City's Premier League title-winning celebrations, is also on the bill alongside former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger.

The show will be co-hosted by supermodel and Emmy Award winner Heidi Klum and actor and comedian Kevin Hart, with actor and producer Danny Ramirez set to interview those in attendance.

The 2026 World Cup runs from 11 June to 19 July and will be jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Friday's draw will be broadcast live across the BBC - on iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app and Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

Not a single Real Madrid player spoke to the media on Sunday night. They don't have to, of course, but after Los Blancos drew 1-1 with struggling Girona, every single squad member walked through the mixed zone without acknowledging the awaiting press. It was emblematic of a shift at the club, the good vibes within this great institution falling apart. 

And how could they not? Madrid expects excellence and football without flaws. They are expected not only to win, but to win well. And of late, they simply haven't done enough winning. After Sunday's drab draw, they have now drawn three straight games in La Liga. The highest-ranked team of three to have taken a point off them are ninth-placed Rayo Vallecano.

While that is undoubtedly a disappointing run for a club of Madrid's size, it must be remembered that they are also in a period of transition after hiring a new manager in Xabi Alonso, who in turn has been dealing with a number of injuries that have upset the balance of his side somewhat. 

However, amid reports of rifts in the dressing room led by some of the most highly-paid players on the planet, the last thing Alonso needed was for his side to throw away their lead at the top of the table to Barcelona. That's exactly what they have done, sacrificing a five-point advantage in the space of a month, and while the calls for Alonso to be sacked are far too premature, it has undoubtedly been a nightmarish few weeks for a man still starting out in his dream job. 

The actual picture of Madrid's season doesn't look too bad. Through 14 league games, they have won 10, drawn three and lost just one. They sit in second place, on 33 points, four behind Barcelona with their game in hand to come on Wednesday against Athletic Club. At their current pace, they will accrue 90 points, which should be enough to run Barca right down to the wire. Madrid have also played a slightly tougher schedule, and did win the first Clasico of the season in late October. 

In the Champions League, things are looking rosy. Madrid have won four of five, dispatching Marseille, Juventus, Kairat Almaty and Olympiacos, while their only loss came at the hands of a much-improved Liverpool, who decided to break their torrid spell by turning in a one-off memorable performance against the Spanish giants in early November. An automatic spot in the last 16 is therefore within their grasp.

There are plenty of positives to take from how certain individuals have performed, too. Kylian Mbappe has accepted his role as a central striker and run with it, with his tally of 23 goals in just 19 games challenging the best goal-scorers in Europe. Elsewhere, new signings Alvaro Carreras has offered much-needed stability at left-back, Arda Guler has shown the kind of creative chops his early-career flashes promised and Jude Bellingham has been rounding into form after missing the first two months of the season while he recovered from shoulder surgery.

Bellingham is not the only big name to have missed time due to fitness problems. His England team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold is the presumptive right-back of the future in Madrid, but he has started just six games since the Club World Cup, thanks in part to a hamstring injury suffered on the opening night of Champions League that sidelined him for six weeks. His main competition, Dani Carvajal, picked up a knee injury soon after, and will be out until at least January, which has led to Fede Valverde again being deployed in defence.

Vinicius Jr, meanwhile, was steadily worked into the side in the opening weeks of the season as Alonso looked to protect his legs, and his campaign has been more about off-field noise than his goal contributions (or lack thereof). Centre-backs Toni Rudiger, David Alaba and Dean Huijsen have also missed time.

Still, Madrid should have enough talent to be the dominant force in Spain and Europe. And yet it is that concentration of Galacticos which is proving to be Alonso's biggest headache.

The ex-Bayer Leverkusen coach has, according to The Athletic, had his methods questioned by senior players within the squad and that messages are not getting through regarding his tactical plan for each game. A meeting was reportedly held between Alonso and his players in a bid to smooth out their differences ahead of the 4-3 win over Olympiacos, but Sunday's draw in Catalunya - described by one source to The Athletic has being ""a disaster"" - suggests that it has not ironed out all the kinks.

It likely doesn't help Alonso that there are high-profile players within his squad who are barely seeing the field. Both Rodrygo and Endrick were linked with moves away from the Bernabeu this summer, yet Alonso insisted that both would be crucial to the project. That, however, hasn't been the case. 

Rodrygo, in the midst of a 30-match goal drought, has continued to have been starved of opportunities, and has played just 442 minutes. Endrick has featured even less, with just 11 minutes to his name, and is set to finally leave on loan in January, likely to Lyon.

But of course, the biggest problem for Alonso is Vinicius. The Brazil winger is a wonderful footballer, charismatic and expressive with the ball, and equally vocal when he doesn't have it. He is also one of the more complex characters in this sport, so often the victim of abuse based on his reputation - a lot of it to do with the colour of his skin - yet, by all indications, a truly humble footballer. It is known, too, that Florentino Perez is a big fan of Vinicius'. 

That is perhaps why he has felt emboldened to challenge his managers at times. During the end of Carlo Ancelotti's reign, Vinicius took an apathetic approach towards running without the ball, and thus far under Alonso, he hasn't always adhered to the manager's tactical demands. He has subsequently completed 90 minutes just seven times, and is often Alonso's first substitute when he needs to change his forward line.  

Vinicius provided the lasting image of the Clasico, too, when he shouted at Alonso in frustration after he was removed from the game midway through the second half. He later apologised to the club and his team-mates, but left Alonso's name out of his social media post. The pair's relationship is said to be the driving force behind Vinicius' unwillingness to discuss a new contract, despite his current deal being set to expire in the summer of 2027.

Alonso is yet to fix Madrid's most glaring problem on the field, either. Last season, they conceded the same goal time-and-time again; they failed to press from the front, allowing opponents to get the ball to their defensive midfielder, who would then spark a counter-attack. It was a simple formula, rinsed and repeated on a weekly basis. 

And that same goal has recurred regularly this season. Madrid are laughably easy to hit on the break, and the way they concede goals in transition over and over is quite remarkable. It's how Girona hit them on Sunday, while Elche did it twice the week before, and Olympiacos too despite suffering defeat. If not for the excellence of Thibaut Courtois in goal, Madrid would comfortably concede three or four every week. 

But for all of the bad vibes, concerning signals and reasons to worry, this is no time to sack a manager. Alonso comes with an excellent pedigree and has proven himself a terrific tactician during his time at Leverkusen. In the pressure cooker that is Real Madrid, coaches need time to figure things out, and Alonso needs to be given that time. From what the manager is saying publicly, he isn't feeling the pressure of the sack, as he revealed that he had held favourable talks with Perez following the Girona draw.

""I have spoken to him again and the conversations are very positive, with a very good tone,"" Alonso said. ""That's what we've talked about, turning the results around.

""We know where we are in the season, there's a long way to go. It's all very close and there are a lot of points still up for grabs, so a lot can happen.""

Of course, there will always be a breaking point, and if things don't improve before the winter break, then Alonso will really begin to feel the heat. But removing a manager this early, with a squad this young and this promising, would be an immense misstep. Madrid require some uncharacteristic patience.

Chelsea star Raheem Sterling has been urged to push for a sensational transfer to Wrexham and end his struggles at Stamford Bridge. The winger is part of the club's infamous 'bomb squad' and is training away from the first team in west London. Former Wales and Liverpool striker Dean Saunders says a transfer to Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac's side would be a great bit of business.

Sterling has been deemed surplus to requirements at Chelsea which has led to speculation over his future, and talk of a sensational transfer to Wrexham. The winger's last competitive appearance came back in May, at the end of his loan spell with Arsenal, and it remains to be seen when he will return to action. With the January transfer window now just weeks away, Sterling's future is likely to come under the spotlight once again. Saunders has been left baffled by Sterling's situation at Chelsea and feels a shock move to Wrexham is not out of the question.

Saunders told BOYLE Sports who offer the latest football betting: ""Raheem Sterling to Wrexham? Why not? You might see some big players that have watched the documentary and they think, ‘I'll have a bit of that. I'd love to play for them, Wrexham.' You might get somebody like Raheem Sterling saying that. I can't get my head around his situation. What's going on? He's not over the hill. He's a very good player. Having said that, the Championship's not easy to play in. I've managed in the Championship and sometimes Premier League players come down and play in it and they can't believe what's going on. We're playing all the time and every game's a battle. Millwall away on a Tuesday night. When the ball's up in the air all night, some of them find it difficult.""

Saunders also feels that Wrexham is an attractive club to join following their rapid rise up the leagues under Reynolds and Mac, and the Hollywood duo's subsequent heavy investment in the first team.

""I always thought that if we could get Wrexham back in the league, I thought our team would be better than most of the League Two teams. If you get in League Two, you can go up again to League One.  Now, when you get to League One, the budgets can be five million, then you get teams like Sunderland who are in there with twenty million,"" he added.

""You get a few big clubs trying to go up. To get into the Championship, once you get into the Championship, I thought we could get to the Championship, but then you're competing with three Premier League teams who've just got relegated. A couple who tried to go back up but never made it, with massive playing budgets and Premier League players in it. And I thought that might be the difficult bit because you have got to put your hand in your pocket then to try and compete in the Championship. And to be fair, they have.

""I mean, I'm hearing what some of the players are earning now. You know, they've signed Josh Windass, they've signed Nathan Broadhead, Kieffer Moore. They can play at that level every day of the week and all day long and have an impact most weeks. Fair play to the manager because they've turned the players over ruthlessly so they've kept momentum.

""If Wrexham get to the Premier League I'll be delighted because it's a great club. They've got great, great supporters. And there is a massive catchment area around Wrexham, in between Wrexham and Cardiff, there's a catchment area which they're getting players through now into the academy. 

""Obviously not far the other way is Man City, Man United, Liverpool, Everton. So they normally nick the best young kids. Then you've got Stoke not far away. So they have had all the best players nicked off them, but now everybody wants to play for Wrexham, don't they? Famous all around the world. It's an incredible story.""

Wrexham have been tipped to spend again in January as they bid to secure promotion to the Premier League. Phil Parkinson's side currently sit 10th in the table but are only three points off the final play-off place. It's not clear yet if Sterling could be tempted to head to Wales, but it certainly would be no surprise to see the 30-year-old move on in a bid to try and resurrect his career after losing his place at Chelsea.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jude Bellingham's relationship with Thomas Tuchel compared to Roy Keane & Sir Alex Ferguson as ex-England defender tells Real Madrid star to get 'respect levels right'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jude-bellingham-relationship-thomas-tuchel-roy-keane-sir-alex-ferguson-ex-england-defender-real-madrid-star-respect/blt8cdd4b9378597635","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Jude Bellingham's relationship with England boss Thomas Tuchel has been compared to the one that Roy Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson once experienced at Old Trafford. Wes Brown witnessed that at close quarters and has, during an exclusive interview with GOAL, been discussing Bellingham's role in the Three Lions squad ahead of the 2026 World Cup group stage draw.

Tickets to that event next summer were booked while Bellingham was watching on from afar. Despite recovering from shoulder surgery and returning to action at Real Madrid, the 22-year-old midfielder was left out of Tuchel's plans in October.

He returned in November, as a faultless passage through qualification was completed, before more questions were asked of his character and temperament after a 2-0 victory over Albania - in which Bellingham made his first international start since June 7.

Tuchel has made it clear that he will not be selecting anybody that threatens to rock the boat and disturb group harmony, with a happy camp required in the United States, Canada and Mexico. That has led some to suggest that Bellingham may be overlooked, despite his obvious talent.

Asked for his take on that debate, former United and England defender Brown - speaking in association with BetWright casino - told GOAL: “First of all, when it comes to a player and a manager, there needs to be respect. You look over the course of my Man United career, with Keano and the gaffer - they weren't the best of mates, but there is an understanding that they are both here to win and both can play a big part in that.

“You still need respect between the manager and the player. We all know how good Jude is and he's a big part of the squad and a big player in the team - who the manager knows that he needs, by the way. He does need him in the team. At the same time, it comes down to making sure that the respect levels are right. Maybe that's what it is. I'm sure it will be fine. At the same time, they have to come to an understanding. At any normal football club, if two people are not getting on then you find a way to work it out and fix it.”

Another former England international, Danny Murphy, told GOAL recently when asked if there are any concerns regarding Bellingham and his place in England's plans: “I find the narrative around his character and any problems a little bit strange because when I have watched England - I have watched them a lot at tournaments and watched him closely, he is, by far, the best character on the football pitch when England play, in terms of producing big moments, grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, leaving everything out there.

“If you could have 11 Jude Bellinghams, you would win most tournaments. The element of not talking to the press or not doing interviews or the odd swear word or rant or a little bit of what some people would call arrogance, that is what creates the player on the pitch. They are just rumours because a lot of the feedback from the players - Jordan Henderson recently said how much he likes him and how great a character he is - I think some of it has been exaggerated.

“From a footballing perspective, we have a much better chance of winning the World Cup if he is in the team. I don't mean just in the squad, I mean in the team. He is a phenomenal talent. We should be - as pundits, fans, press - building him up, applauding him and being thankful that we have got him, not trying to pull him down because he is the best one we have got. He is the game-changer in our side. He is the one that can make things happen. He's just a phenomenal player.”

The expectation is that Bellingham, who has 46 senior caps to his name, will be handed a place on the plane heading over the Atlantic next summer. For now, he - and the rest of the England hopefuls - are waiting to discover who they will face in the World Cup group stage. All will be revealed when the draw is held at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC on December 5.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The show will run daily throughout the competition in North America, Mexico and Canada and will also feature usual co-hosts Alan Shearer and Micah Richards. It will be filmed in New York but will also feature reports from the England camp and fan zones across the tournament.

Lineker has confirmed he will play his part in the 2026 World Cup after agreeing a deal with Netflix to host a daily episode of his popular podcast. The former England captain had been due to cover the tournament for BBC Sport but left the corporation in May amid a row over a controversial social media post. However, he will now be part of the coverage of the World Cup with a daily show that will be produced by Goalhanger Podcasts. The company have promised the podcast will feature ""game analysis, special guests, interviews and insights into the world's largest sporting event"".

Lineker is relishing the new opportunity and has already told fans what they can expect from his daily show. He said: ""We can't wait to bring The Rest Is Football to Netflix for the 2026 World Cup. It's a fantastic opportunity for the three of us to do what we love — talk football every day — but on a truly global stage. Expect all the usual analysis, honesty and plenty of laughs … just with a few more cameras pointed at us, all from the Big Apple.”

Lineker's new contract with Netflix will see the 65-year-old receive a big hike on his previous salary. According to The Times, Lineker's new ""multimillion-pound"" deal ""will dwarf the £1.35 million salary he earned for hosting Match of the Day on the BBC"".

A source told The Times: ""It's a really exciting deal and Gary is thrilled. It means he will be at the World Cup after all. It's Netflix's first real foray into football coverage, with a daily show built around the podcast. This will also introduce Gary to a whole new international audience. Netflix first approached his company a few months ago, and his son, Harry, will also be joining Stateside as he's a producer, so it'll be a real family affair.""

Lineker is also set to host a new game show on ITV next year. 'The Box' will feature celebrities taken to different locations and asked to undertake challenges in giant yellow boxes.

Excitement for World Cup 2026 is starting to build, meaning all eyes will be on Friday's draw which will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). The glitzy affair will feature performances from legendary group the Village People, British superstar Robbie Williams, former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, and Italian maestro Andrea Bocelli and is due to be co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and actor and comedian Kevin Hart.

Actor and producer Danny Ramirez will also be on hand to interview the great and the good at the event. 

A total of 48 nations will feature in the draw and will be divided into four pots containing 12 teams. The competition runs from 11 June to 19 July and is jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

USMNT star Johnny Cardoso was hit by another injury blow, which forced him out of Atletico Madrid's clash with Barcelona after just 14 minutes on Tuesday. The midfielder was named in the starting XI for the huge clash at Camp Nou but came off early on in the game after picking up another injury issue in a collision with Barcelona star Dani Olmo, and was replaced by Koke.

Cardoso was handed a big chance to impress against Barcelona after being named in Diego Simeone's starting XI for the match. The USMNT star has made only four starts for Atletico so far this season, having previously been sidelined with an ankle injury, and will have been aiming to impress against the Catalan giants. However, it proved to be another disappointing evening for the 24-year-old, who was forced off early and looks to now be facing more time out. Atletico confirmed that the midfielder had suffered a knee injury, posting on X: ""Johnny was substituted during the first half due to a hard knock to the knee.""

Cardoso's injury wasn't the only disappointment for Atletico as they went on to lose the game 3-1 and end a run of seven straight wins in all competitions. An early goal from Alex Baena had put the visitors 1-0 up, but Barcelona hit back through strikes from Raphinha, Olmo and Ferran Torres to secure the win.

Atletico boss Simeone admitted he had been forced to adjust his tactics after the early departure of Cardoso. He told reporters: ""Cardoso's injury forced us to adjust. We had high hopes for Johnny, but he got injured and had to leave the game."" Atletico must now wait and see the severity of Cardoso's injury and when he will be able to return to action for Los Colchoneros.

Cardoso has spoken of his injury frustrations after making his long-awaited return last time out against Inter in the Champions League. He told ESPN Brasil: ""Yes, now I feel very good, but as you said, it was a difficult moment. It was the ankle injury that kept me off the field the longest. I'd never been sidelined for that much time before. As I can say, it happened right at the start of my time here—a complicated situation to handle. But I had all the support from my teammates, the coaching staff, and obviously, my family was with me. It's a moment where you have to keep a strong mentality, keep working, and recover well. It was a complicated injury that took time to heal. So I was eager to get back as quickly as possible, but I also knew I had to be smart about it so that when I returned, I could contribute and perform at my best on the field with the team.""

Cardoso's appearance for Atletico against Barcelona was his first in La Liga since starting the 1-1 draw with Alaves back in August. The midfielder's only other appearances this season have come against Elche and Espanyol in La Liga and Inter in the Champions League. Yet Atletico have demonstrated their faith in the USMNT star by handing him a new long-term contract back in October that keeps him tied to the club until 2030.

While his future at Atletico looks secure despite his recent injury problems, his lack of game time means his place in the USMNT squad for World Cup 2026 is far from secure. Cardoso has only managed four appearances for the national team in 2025 and missed all six of the USMNT's fall friendlies due to injury.

Cardoso is set to undergo tests on his injury and will be hoping to avoid more time spent on the sidelines. Atletico return to La Liga action on Saturday against Athletic Club and finish off 2025 with fixtures against Valencia and Girona in La Liga and PSV in the Champions League.

In the meantime, the USMNT will discover who they will face in the group stages of World Cup 2026 on Friday when the draw is made. The Stars and Stripes have this week confirmed they will play pre-tournament friendlies against Belgium, Portugal and Germany.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup draw takes place on Friday at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC and promises to be a star-studded event. Global icon Heidi Klum will host the show alongside comedian and actor Kevin Hart. The glitzy affair will also feature music and performances from Nicole Scherzinger as well as Robbie Williams, the Village People and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.

Nations across the world will be watching on eagerly on Friday as the draw for the World Cup finals takes place in the United States. The expanded tournament means that 48 teams from across the world will feature and will discover who they will meet next summer in the tournament, which takes place across the United States, Mexico and Canada. FIFA president Gianni Infantino will once again be in attendance, with the draw scheduled to kick off at 9am local time / 12pm ET (5pm GMT) on Friday, December 5, 2025.

Supermodel and global icon Klum is back to host the tournament after taking on duties in Germany back in 2006. The Emmy-winning television personality says it's an honour to host the draw. 

“To be hosting the final draw again, after having been involved in this show 20 years ago in my home country, is truly extraordinary,” she said. “The World Cup brings the world together like nothing else, and being part of that magic again, on an even bigger stage involving three host countries and 48 teams, is an incredible honour.”

Actor and producer Danny Ramirez will also feature at the event, interviewing the football greats in attendance, and is thrilled to be involved. He said: ""As someone who grew up playing football, getting to co-host the draw and meet and speak with World Cup legends at such a high-profile event is a dream. With this tournament coming to the United States, where I was born, and Mexico, where some of my roots lie, it is even more special – and I couldn't be more excited to be part of this show.”

Who recorded the most wins at ATP Challenger level in 2025? Which player earned the most titles? Who were among the teenage stars to make a breakthrough? Find out below as ATPTour.com reviews key facts and figures to remember from the 2025 ATP Challenger season.


Nava Notches Most Match Wins
American Emilio Nava and Canadian Liam Draxl finished with a season-leading 44 match wins at the Challenger level. Nava, who finished the year at a career-high No. 88 in the PIF ATP Rankings, won four titles to cap his career-best season. Draxl claimed his lone title on home soil in Winnipeg and reached six additional finals this season.


Of Nava's 44 match wins, 42 were on clay. The 23-year-old went on a 19-match winning streak on the surface from mid-March to mid-April, a run during which he won three titles (Asuncion, Concepcion and Sarasota) and finished runner-up in Tallahassee, where Chris Rodesch ended Nava's streak of 35 consecutive sets won. Nava then added to his title count in September with his triumph in Villa Maria, Argentina. Nava was one win shy of breaking the American record for most Challenger match wins in a season. 


Six-Way Tie For Most Titles
Nava and five other players were tied for the most Challenger titles this season. The group includes #NextGenATP talent Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Borna Coric, Cristian Garin, Jan Choinski and Patrick Kypson. Budkov Kjaer, 19, qualified for his maiden trip to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, which runs from 17-21 December in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He lifted trophies in Glasgow, Tampere, Astana and Mouilleron le Captif.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques explains why Red Bull are taking a chance on a driver who is still only 18-years-old…

Arvid Lindblad will be the new kid on the block next year in Formula 1 after he was announced as Liam Lawson's team mate at Racing Bulls for 2026. F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques explains why Red Bull are taking a chance on a driver who is still only 18-years-old…

The British-Swedish racer, born to a Swedish father and Indian mother, became the youngest ever F2 winner in Jeddah this season at just 17-years-old, and at Silverstone in Formula 3 last year he became the first driver to win both the Sprint and Features races in a weekend.

In doing so he displayed both raw speed and adaptability under pressure – the two traits valued most highly by Formula 1 bosses in modern times.

On paper his junior career is not the headline grabbing run of an Oscar Piastri, George Russell or Charles Leclerc. There's been no title double in Formula 3 and Formula 2, or even a realistic challenge for either of those crowns.

His CV comprises a single season securing fourth place with Prema Racing in the 2024 Formula 3 Championship, and this season he secured two wins in Formula 2 where he sits in sixth position with two races of the campaign to go.

This season Lindblad was placed with the same Campos team as 2025 F1 rookie Isak Hadjar, giving Red Bull a trusted outfit to develop their young driver.

And it feels like the teenage racer has driven with the same confidence of his predecessor: trusting that promotion was assured if he met his set objectives.

In days of old, fourth and sixth place championship finishes would not have been enough for the most cut throat team in F1, but in recent times things have changed.

That Lindblad's promotion feels so similar to Hadjar's is a testament to head of the programme Guillaume Rocquelin, who has brought wisdom to a set up which had started to drift.

Incredibly, the Faenza team which Lindblad is joining had once signed Brendon Hartley after the New Zealander sent Helmut Marko a text asking if they had any drives going.

Similarly they re-signed Alex Albon in 2019 after dropping him from the programme years previously. Albon went from no F1 drive in November 2018 to Max Verstappen's team mate by August 2019. There was a lack of rhyme or reason to the moves.

Such haphazard recruitment has diminished in recent times. Rocquelin takes a wider view, focusing on evidence of improvement rather than just pure results.

This stands in sharp contrast to the 2010's era where Pierre Gasly was told “win GP2 and you'll be promoted to F1” only to be told he hadn't won the title convincingly enough and he was sent for an extra year of junior racing in Japan.

None of this context is to diminish Lindblad's talent behind the wheel because it is sizeable. But the young charger has benefited from Red Bull modernising their approach.

So what can Racing Bulls expect from their new driver?

In his younger years Lindblad claimed multiple karting titles and the prestigious Formula 4 Macau street race victory, and after Red Bull identified him in their words as a “generational talent” they signed him at 14 years of age.

That put Lindblad on a steep learning curve each year but it's a path he's thrived on. Under the mentorship of F2 race winner and FIA Formula E champion Oliver Rowland, Lindblad believes the Yorkshireman – a hugely naturally talented driver in his own right – has helped him understand how to be competitive when jumping through the motorsport pyramid in consecutive years.

“To have someone with that knowledge and capability, helping to guide me, has been instrumental to my transition, because it is a massive step,” he said last year.

Lindblad's drive at Silverstone's F3 Feature race last year was a standout performance. At a circuit he'd somehow never driven before he mastered the greasy conditions on slick tyres to take victory.

Winning in low grip conditions never goes unnoticed higher up the ladder, and to sweep an F3 weekend in an ultra-competitive 30-car championship was hugely impressive.

After many TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests in two-year-old F1 machinery showed Racing Bulls he had the foundation for Formula 1, Red Bull were further delighted by FP1 runs in Silverstone and Mexico City – especially the latter which saw Lindblad use different tyre compounds effectively and outpace regular driver Yuki Tsunoda with a fine run to P6.

Affable in the paddock and well liked by team personnel, Lindblad once had the confidence to sidle up to Lando Norris and proclaim “I want you to remember me, I'll see you in five years”.

In March 2026 he will deliver on his promise and will share the grid with the British driver.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Red Bull are giving Arvid Lindblad his shot at the big time after promoting him to a seat at Racing Bulls in 2026 alongside Liam Lawson. Team Principal Alan Permane explains to F1.com why the duo will form his line-up for next year...

Red Bull are giving Arvid Lindblad – the most exciting prospect from their junior programme – his shot at the big time after promoting him to a seat at Racing Bulls in 2026 as Liam Lawson wins a battle with Yuki Tsunoda to clinch the other drive. We speak exclusively to Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane who explains to F1.com why the duo form his line-up for next year...

Racing Bulls have long been a vehicle for Red Bull to develop their hottest prospects and see if they have what it takes to step up to the works Red Bull team and compete for Grand Prix victories. 

Isack Hadjar was given that shot this year, and while he crashed in his first race weekend, the Frenchman has since gone on to score 10 times in the Grand Prix format, including a superb podium in the Netherlands, and sits 10th in the drivers' standings heading to the finale in Abu Dhabi. 

That form was too good for Red Bull to overlook so they promoted him to the senior team alongside reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen for next year.

That left at least one vacant seat at Racing Bulls. Keen to continue their strategy of giving talent a chance, Red Bull have wasted no time promoting Lindblad from F2.

The 18-year-old – who earned special dispensation to get his F1 Superlicence ahead of his 18th birthday earlier this year, having already accrued enough points to qualify – had three runs in a two-year-old Racing Bull this year ahead of two FP1 appearances for Red Bull in Silverstone and Mexico respectively. 

While he impressed in all his showings, Permane says it was his performance in Mexico that was a key factor in convincing Red Bull to give him a shot now. 

""He had an exceptional outing in Mexico in the Red Bull in FP1,"" Permane tells me. ""He was very, very quick and both Red Bull and Racing Bulls were very impressed with that drive. It's lots of different things that have led to his promotion. 

""[Red Bull Motorsport Advisor] Helmut believes in him – and that's a great thing to have, to have the backing of Dr Marko, who has been following his career closely.""

Permane adds: ""His feedback is very good. He's intelligent – you can tell that when you talk to him. He'll learn quickly I'm sure. If a driver has got spare capacity, it's always good.”

With Lindblad confirmed for one seat, that left just one left – with incumbent Lawson up against Tsunoda, who was set to lose his Red Bull seat to Hadjar. 

Initially, it is believed the Japanese racer was the frontrunner, but it was ultimately Lawson – who was demoted to Racing Bulls after just two races with Red Bull earlier this year – who got the nod. 

The New Zealander had a slow start on returning to Racing Bulls but has since showed the peaks he is capable of with some strong drives, including P5 in Baku and P6 in Austria, as well as a double P7 in the Sprint and Grand Prix in Austin. 

""Liam is talented, he's very talented, and my mission will be to get him to operate at the level he can operate at when things are all working for him,"" says Permane. 

""In some of the most difficult situations we've had this year such as Vegas Qualifying or Baku Qualifying, he's excelled – and he's having some really strong races. I know he's capable of that and he knows he's capable of that and I just want to work with him to get him at that level every single time he goes in the car.""

Permane adds that if Lawson can iron out the peaks and troughs of his form and ""operate at his best level more consistently, he will be a very good Formula 1 driver"". 

Lawson has made gains in the way he approaches a weekend, too. Previously, if he started a race weekend badly, he would likely struggle to recover. Last weekend's race in Qatar was another example to suggest he's found a way to iron out that fallibility. 

""He had a difficult Friday, they didn't get things right but on Saturday he qualified better,"" says Permane.

""His pace in the race, if you look at the last laps – the only laps he was in free air – it was very impressive. He was faster than the three or four guys in front of him. The pace is there, we just have to link it altogether.""

In keeping Lawson, Racing Bulls are afforded some stability heading into 2026, when sweeping new rules will be introduced for both the chassis and power unit.

Permane says ""continuity really helps"" and he also pointed to how Lawson's near one-and-a-half years of F1 can help Lindblad settle in. 

""Having a driver who will be able to also help Arvid is good,"" says Permane. ""It's something I've spoken to Liam about. I don't expect him to be a mentor for Arvid, far from it, but I do expect him to be there. 

""OK he has only got a season and a half under his belt, but he has a lot more than Arvid has.

“He should be able to – and I would expect him to – help Arvid out when things are tough for him, especially early on and during testing.""

With Lawson and Lindblad locked in at Racing Bulls, Hadjar is set to take the next step in his already impressive career by joining Red Bull – something that makes Permane immensely ""proud"". 

""It's part of what we're here to do as a team,"" says Permane. ""We like to be an incubator for talent, and that is on the driving side and also the engineering side. 

""To see Isack move up to Red Bull Racing is great. It means they are happy that he is good enough and they have seen enough. I wish him all the success. 

""He goes there full of confidence. I know he's looking forward to Abu Dhabi, to leave us on a high, and he feels the car will be strong there. He's just excited about his future.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Were you paying attention to the on-track action at the Lusail International Circuit over the weekend?

McLaren came away from Qatar licking their wounds after admitting they got their strategy wrong, allowing Max Verstappen to steal a march on Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris and grab the win.

Up until that point, Piastri had been in imperious form, topping every session of the Sprint weekend so far – and looking likely to conclude things with victory in the Grand Prix.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

McLaren have added three new names to their Driver Development Programme, including new Formula 2 Champion Leonardo Fornaroli.

Newly-crowned Formula 2 Champion Leonardo Fornaroli has become one of three new signings to the McLaren Driver Development Programme, with the Italian joining alongside fellow F2 racer Richard Verschoor and 2025 FIA European Karting Champion Christian Costoya.

Fornaroli sealed the F2 title during the Feature Race in Qatar, the Invicta Racing driver taking P2 in the event to confirm his championship triumph following a season in which he has so far claimed four victories and five podiums.

It also marks back-to-back titles for the 20 year old, who emulated the likes of Oscar Piastri and Gabriel Bortoleto by winning the F2 championship off the back of doing the same in Formula 3 one year earlier.

Now becoming part of the McLaren family, Fornaroli will take on a test and development role within the F1 team's structure.

Also joining the programme is Verschoor, who currently sits in P3 of the Formula 2 championship ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The 24 year old from the Netherlands has won four races during the current campaign.

Another signing by McLaren is 15-year-old Costoya. The Spanish teenager has claimed multiple karting championships and is set to make his single-seater debut in the 2026 F4 Middle East Championship at the Yas Marina Circuit on January 16-18.

Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Chief Business Affairs Officer, McLaren Racing, commented: “McLaren Racing are delighted to welcome two of Formula 2's current leading drivers in this year's Champion Leonardo Fornaroli and former Championship contender and fellow front-runner Richard Verschoor, as well as proven karting champion, Christian Costoya, to the McLaren Racing Driver Development Programme.

“All three talented drivers have shown great race craft with multiple wins this season, alongside a number of impressive performances in their respective championships. By welcoming Christian to the programme alongside long-standing member, Dries Van Langendonck, we now also have two of the most promising drivers coming out of karting.

“It is a key priority that we continue to develop our talent pipeline to provide options for all of our expanding racing teams. We look forward to working closely with all our drivers in 2026 as they continue their individual development at various stages of their career with the support of the programme through a wide range of testing and progression opportunities across all of our racing series.”

Fornaroli added: “I'm incredibly proud to be joining the McLaren Driver Development Programme after another successful year on track. Winning both the FIA Formula 3 and Formula 2 titles has been an important step in my journey, and I'm motivated to take the next step in my development through the programme as I work toward my ultimate goal of racing at the highest level.

“I'm very grateful to McLaren for this opportunity, and to everyone who has supported me throughout my career so far. I can't wait to get started and work closely with the rest of the team.”

Verschoor also commented: “I'm delighted to be part of the McLaren Driver Development Programme. It's a special moment, and I'm grateful for McLaren's support in allowing me to continue my development within the programme. I'm excited to get going and work hard with the team in the coming months.”

Costoya added: “I am very excited to join the McLaren Driver Development Programme and become part of their talent pipeline. It is great to get the team's support and be in an environment that is known for developing great drivers. My thanks go to the McLaren team for this great opportunity.”

It comes after McLaren announced Ella Hakkinen and Ella Stevens as two new recruits to their Driver Development Programme last month.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Team Principal James Vowles reflects on Williams finishing fifth in the Teams' Championship.

Williams have secured fifth place in the Teams' Championship with one round to go, thanks to Carlos Sainz's podium finish in Qatar. The Spaniard came home third for his second rostrum of the season – third if you include Sprint results – to make sure that Williams finish on top of the midfield.

Williams finished ninth last season, with 17 points to show for their campaign. That turnaround to finish fifth this year, with 137 points and counting, means the team sit 45 points ahead of their nearest rivals with one round remaining.

“It is mathematically finished now. This surpasses our expectations really and I hope it shows the world the direction we are on and the belief we have in where we are going as a result of things,” team boss James Vowles said in the wake of the Qatar Grand Prix.

“We are still here to win championships. We are a long way away from that, a long way away. But at least now the work we are doing is starting to pay off.”

Sainz made a great start in Qatar, before managing to pick up a further place in the first round of pit stops.

His podium charge was aided by McLaren's strategy calls – with the team opting not to pit either car under the Safety Car – but nonetheless, the Spaniard had put in quick lap after quick lap to maintain enough of an advantage that Lando Norris could not reel him in late on.

Sainz duly claimed P3 for the second time in a Grand Prix this year, despite a late scare when his can began to understeer.

“We lost about eight degrees of tyre temperature on the front right, and a little bit of downforce all in one go which suggests a small component failed,” Vowles explained. “But basically, the right-hand corners he was suffering in, he did brilliantly with it. He calmly brought the car to the end of the race, so good job.

“Exceptional. Really fantastic performance from Carlos and the team when it counted and every detail adds up. Getting on the podium by milliseconds really is such a just reward for the incredible work the whole team is putting in this year.

“I was proud of Carlos and the team when we got our first podium in Baku; the second is a dream come true, but perhaps more importantly at a track that was almost our worst last year. And we've come back, we've reinvented ourselves and the result is there for everyone to see.”

Before the weekend began, both Williams drivers were quick to temper expectations here, saying the track characteristics did not suit their car. As such, getting both cars into the top 10 in Sprint Qualifying, and Sainz backing that up with a Q3 in Qualifying, showed just how far the team have come.

The Spaniard scored in the Sprint and the Grand Prix, with back-to-back top five finishes after coming home P5 in Las Vegas. Alex Albon did not manage to score in Qatar, but his consistency at the start of the season was a big factor in Williams finishing where they have done.

“For Alex, we will come back fighting in Abu Dhabi. We haven't got it all together this weekend, but I'll reiterate that his performance across the season is why we've secured fifth in the Constructors' Championship today. And more so than that, his pace is still there. We just need to bring it all together,” Vowles concluded.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola explain the impact of changes made to Red Bull's front wing during the second half of the season.

Ever since Zandvoort, Red Bull have been paying a lot of attention to their front wing – and that seems to be at the heart of the car's improved performances compared to the first half of the season, something which has brought Max Verstappen into championship contention.

Since returning from the summer break, Verstappen has won five times in 10 races. In the 13 races before the break, he won only twice.

Although the basic Zandvoort front wing, with its big plan area, has been retained ever since, there have been multiple variations of flap shape and flexibility control.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur reflects on his team scoring just four points across the Qatar Sprint weekend.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur has conceded that they “did a worse job” than their rivals in the Qatar Grand Prix, which contributed to one of their lowest points hauls of the season.

The Scuderia ended the weekend with four points after neither driver scored in the Sprint and Charles Leclerc could only manage P8 in Sunday's race. They claimed fewer points on just one other occasion this season – their double DNF at Zandvoort.

The Monegasque driver admitted that there is “zero performance” in the car as he struggled with excessive oversteer throughout the weekend, culminating in a massive spin in Q3 that led to him starting the race in 10th place.

On the other side of the garage, things were just as bleak for Lewis Hamilton, with the former champion qualifying P18 for both the Sprint and Grand Prix. He ultimately took the chequered flag nearly 16 seconds behind Yuki Tsunoda, the last of the scorers at a circuit that has few overtaking opportunities.

Vasseur previously confirmed that Ferrari chose to switch focus to their 2026 challenger back in April, halting development on this season's car, but he insisted that the problem in Qatar was more linked to their set-up than a lack of upgrades.

“I think this weekend we struggled a lot with the set-up and prescription of the tyre pressure,” he said. “We struggled from Lap 1 to the last lap of the race. It was probably a bit better today but only marginally. It's part of the expedition, part of this weekend that due to the set-up, we were in a tough situation from Lap 1.

“I can't say that it was all positive but the collaboration and debrief was positive and we were all pushing in the same direction. I understand [the drivers'] frustration in the TV pen, but the most important thing is when they're back in the garage with the mechanics and engineers trying to find a solution. We tried this weekend but I think we had the issue – it's not a secret – with the power steering at the beginning of the weekend.

“Then you go into Qualifying and the Sprint, and you can't change between the two. We made big changes and I think it was okay-ish today but we went too far. The others are all fine-tuning but if you start miles away… I think it was in Q1 or Q2 yesterday you had two-tenths between P5 and P16. If you're out of the window, for sure you'll lose a tonne of positions and on a track like this where you have zero deg [tyre degradation], it's not easy to overtake. On top of that, you impose the two-stop.”

Vasseur also admitted that the Safety Car appearance on Lap 7 was Ferrari's “worst case scenario” discussed before the race – it prompted nine out of 10 teams to head into the pits, forcing them to use the full allocation of 25 laps on their remaining tyres.

With most of the field pitting on the same laps, Hamilton lost out due to the double stack and high volume of traffic in the pit lane, but the strategy wasn't the only struggle for the Scuderia. They were also significantly off the pace compared to McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes, but Vasseur appeared confident that it wasn't a sign of wider issues despite the team finishing P4 in the Teams' Standings – their worst result since 2020.

“We as a team have to stay in our bubble and try to get the best from what we have,” he said. “You have to deal with this kind of situation – Max [Verstappen] was able to do it. He was P8 in Qualifying in Budapest, was P9 in the race and then he started to win races.

“You can come back, and as a team we have to understand what we did wrong this weekend. From my understanding so far, it related to the tyre pressure prescription that we struggled to deal with, but it's the same for everybody. We did a worse job than the others.

“Charles said he pushed like hell from Lap 1 on Friday morning to the last lap of the race, and I think he was probably pushing more than on some weekends where he won races. I understand the frustration that you're pushing like hell to finish P8 or P9.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

A date has been set for the Cadillac F1 Team's very first livery reveal…

Cadillac are set to present the livery for their debut Formula 1 car during a television advert at February's Super Bowl.

The American outfit, who are backed by General Motors and led by former Marussia Sporting Director Graeme Lowdon, are preparing to become the sport's 11th team next season.

Multiple Grand Prix winners Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez were recently confirmed as their two drivers, with IndyCar star Colton Herta taking on a testing role.

On Wednesday, a few days before the 2025 finale in Abu Dhabi, Cadillac took to social media to share the latest development in their F1 journey.

As per a special graphic and accompanying news story, Cadillac will show off their 2026 colours on February 8 during coverage of the Super Bowl – the annual league championship game of the National Football League (NFL).

Cadillac's livery reveal will follow on from a private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya between January 26-30, where teams will run their 2026 challengers – built to all-new regulations – for the first time.

Test two will be held at the Bahrain International Circuit between February 11-13, with another test coming at the same venue from February 18-20.

Cadillac will then get set to head to Australia for their debut F1 weekend from March 6-8.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren misfire in Qatar

2025 Qatar Grand Prix: Piastri left ‘speechless' after missing out on victory

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be in use at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Formula 1 will close out a thrilling 2025 season with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend – and tyre suppliers Pirelli have confirmed the compounds that the teams and drivers will have available to them.

A combination of the C3 as the hard, the C4 as the medium and the C5 as the soft will be deployed at the Yas Marina Circuit, which mixes flat-out stretches with tight, technical sections.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

“Historically, the Yas Marina track sees graining on the tyres, but as from last year this phenomenon seems to be relatively limited,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview.

“The greater resistance of the current tyres could reduce it to such an extent that even the soft, usually only used in Qualifying, could be a tyre around which to put together a race strategy.

“At this track, degradation is thermal in nature and is generally seen on the rears due to the requirement for traction especially in the final sector of the track.

“In Yas Marina last year, 19 drivers fitted the medium for the start, the sole exception being Lewis Hamilton, who went with the hard.

“The one-stop was the quickest strategy, using the hard for the second stint. Of the top 10 finishers, only Fernando Alonso pitted twice. Just one driver ran the soft with the sole aim of setting the fastest race lap.

“Graining and degradation were both limited and so, even those who pitted before half-distance managed to run just two stints with no difficulties.”

Back onscreen with the buzzy ‘Marty Supreme,' the Goddess of Goop lets loose on getting steamy with Chalamet, embracing her “evil shadow energy” and why we can't stop talking about her.


							By 

	Lacey Rose


Writer-At-Large


	“Oh fuck, do I still know how to do this?” Gwyneth Paltrow wondered last fall, as she arrived on a film set for the first time in years.


	Now 53, she had agreed to play Kay Stone, a onetime actress who — to the delight of Paltrow's Mom group chat — is having an affair with Marty Supreme‘s titular character, a ping-pong phenom played by Timothée Chalamet. The film's director, Josh Safdie, had arranged the production schedule so that Paltrow's first scene would be the character's return to stage.




	“I was shocked to hear her shyly say, almost to herself, ‘I hope I remember how to do this,' ” recalls Safdie, who insists Paltrow was the Grace Kelly of his youth, as he rattles off her early work in films like The Talented Mr. Ripley, Great Expectations and The Royal Tenenbaums. “There was a fine line between the vulnerability Gwyneth herself brought to the part and the vulnerability she brought for Kay.”

					Editor's Letter: Why The WIE Issue Still Matters		
			









	The daughter of actress Blythe Danner and the late TV director Bruce Paltrow had already won an Academy Award by 26 for her performance in Shakespeare in Love. But once her now-college-age children with ex Chris Martin were born, she stepped back. “She never left the A-list, she just wasn't really responding,” says her pal Robert Downey Jr. Her focus shifted to raising them and, later, to launching and running Goop, a lifestyle company fashioned in her image. Sure, Paltrow still dabbled some — as Pepper Potts in Marvel films and later in husband Brad Falchuk's Netflix series The Politician — but her participation in Marty Supreme feels more significant. Though the A24 film won't be released in theaters until Christmas Day, an early screening at the New York Film Festival earned rapturous reviews, and its cast is already in the throes of a major awards campaign.

	











	On a rainy morning in mid-November, Paltrow, who's being honored with The Hollywood Reporter‘s Sherry Lansing Leadership Award for her professional and philanthropic contributions, settled in for a wide-ranging conversation about her Hollywood reemergence, her L.A. exodus and her famously divisive role in culture.


In 2020, you were asked if you ever felt like the acting bug might come back, to which you said: “Literally never. Nev–er.” So, what changed?


	If I'm being completely honest, it's not that the acting bug had bit. My children, all four of them, had left — Brad and I each have girls and boys the same age, and when I knew the boys were leaving for college, I started to have a real panic around my purpose and where I'm supposed to orient myself: Where do I want to live? Who am I? It was pretty profound.


I can imagine.


	At the same time, Josh Safdie asked me to be in this movie. I wasn't familiar with his work, but my brother, Jake, who's a filmmaker, said to me, “You are doing this.” He was absolutely emphatic about it. Then I found out it was in New York City, and I thought this could be a really interesting thing to do during this transition. I want to be close to the boys, I'll be closer to the girls. [All four are on the East Coast.] So I said yes, and then I was like, “Oh fuck, do I remember how to do this?” It had been seven years. But I didn't get the bug back until I was on set doing the hair-and-makeup test. That's when I was like, “Oh, what is this weird feeling I'm having? Oh my God, this is excitement. I'm actually really excited to be here.”

	











You've said you were also quite nervous. About what, exactly?


	Acting is so weird, and all of us do it in such a different way. You can't follow a template or learn a rubric. It's not like I could be like, “Oh, yeah, I'll get out my playbook.” I was like, “How the fuck did I use to do this?”


Josh Safdie said he wanted you for the role because “I wanted a landed gentry quality, a type of person who was completely unreachable.” OK, I'll stop, why are you laughing? 


	It must be a quality that I give off. I come from a very WASPy mother with Mayflower-ish roots, daughter of the American Revolution, all that kind of stuff. So I think maybe epigenetically, there is some of that there. And I was a very privileged kid. I grew up on the Upper East Side, and I went to a great school and all the things. So some of the stuff that he sees, which is also the stuff I've been criticized for my whole life, is real.


One of the major shifts that's happened since you stepped away was the addition of intimacy coordinators on set. What did you make of the experience? 


	I mean, it's very cool. I know there were some quotes that positioned it like I was pooh-poohing the intimacy coordinator, which of course is not at all what I meant. What I meant was that I was totally surprised, like, who is this person? I think all of the protections that came from the #MeToo movement are great, but for me, personally, I was not used to that. It's like, “OK, now he's going to squeeze your boob,” or whatever, and I felt more embarrassed talking about it than just doing it. I'm from a different time, but if I was starting today, or if my daughter wants to go into this, I'm so glad that there's now this role and that she will learn, OK, there's consent and there are guardrails.

	











This part in particular had a fair amount of intimacy. Was that a consideration for you in taking it, and how does your approach or philosophy differ now versus 20 years ago?


	Well, I'm probably less inclined to get naked. (Laughs.) But our sexuality is such an important part of who we are and what resonates in film, and I like the sort of freedom around that exploration. I really love Nicole Kidman's approach to this. She's just like, fuck it, I want to feel safe but I also want to be completely free as an artist to explore this in whatever way. I ascribe to her philosophy.


Like you, she's been part of a recent trend of films featuring older women with younger men. For so long, The Graduate felt like the only real cultural touchstone. I'm curious what you make of the shift?


	And The Graduate was fetishized and perceived as really off, right? And now it's not perceived like that. It will never cease to amaze me how people underestimate women as the consumer. We drive markets — we create markets, so of course a 40-something woman is going to be excited about a sex scene with Timothée Chalamet. And of course women are going to be excited about this idea that there's agency around sexuality and that older women are sexual. So I think it's great, I'm all for it.


You've said your Mom text chats were blowing up when some on-set shots of you and Timothée kissing surfaced online last fall …












	Blowing up. Blow–ing–up! I have my L.A. mom close friends and my English mummy friends, and they were all texting me. They know I don't look at any rubbish sites, so they're all sending me these pictures, like, “Yessss, G.P.!” Everyone was thrilled.


How did your children react? 


	I mean, my daughter's so cool and so punk rock that she's like, “Mom, this is awesome!” And my son was like, “Oh my God, I don't want to see this.” He was kind of mortified. But I do think they're actually excited to see this film because now they're grown up and they can make this separation. I'm sure they'll gag when I'm having a make-out scene, of course. But it's funny, they haven't really seen me in movies. Historically, they like me home, as Mom, and they don't like to engage with the outside perspective of who I am.


Your daughter's clearly a good sport. I couldn't believe she was with you when you went on Call Her Daddy last year.


	Oh, and loving it!


Alex Cooper was having you play “Fuck, Marry, Kill” and grilling you about your sex life with your famous exes. My daughters are still relatively young, so I can't even fathom this. Neither of you were mortified?


	When I was in there, there were a couple of questions where I was like, “Oh man, Apple.” (Laughs.) But I'm telling you, my daughter is so freaking cool. She gets it. We're also really good friends, so it's not like a weird-out.


You've been asked to play F.M.K. a few times now, and each time I'm surprised you're game. It's probably also why you're a favorite for interviewers like Howard Stern. You go on these shows and you play along.












	Yeah, you've got to. It's funny because Stern tests you right away. I remember when I went on the first time, I was so nervous. I was like, “What horrible thing is he going to ask me?” I remember talking to friends who listened to him every day, and they prepared me. But the first thing he said to me — and it was a test to see if I was going to be uptight — was something like, “I love your mom, I used to jerk off to her.” To which my response was something like, “Well, I hope you never stopped.” 


Amazing.


	After that, we were good. (Laughs.)


Marty Supreme is already generating significant awards buzz. I'm wondering what your incoming calls look like now and how you're thinking about what's next.


	They've increased. I've not said yes to anything yet. I thought about a couple of things, but timing-wise, I have a lot to manage with my company. I also don't need to rush. I think if I was going to step back into this, I would do it differently than I did it last time.


How so?


	I started doing this when I was 18, and it's like I got dropped on top of a train, and the train just went. It was almost like how a young woman is trained to date. Like, “Do they want me?” No, no, do you want them? I never even stopped to say, like, “Is this a good project? Is this a good director?” And maybe you shouldn't — you're a kid and you're doing a bunch of stuff and lots of things are exciting. But also there's this insecure part of you that thinks you just have to keep doing it. I felt that I just had to keep saying yes to everything, and then I totally burnt myself out, such that when I had my daughter, I was like, “I quit. I'm never doing this again.”

	











You downshifted considerably.


	I did. But I look at Leo's career, and we started at the same time — Flesh and Bone, which was my breakthrough, came out when [DiCaprio's What's Eating] Gilbert Grape came out. That's when I met him, and I think Leo has done such a beautiful job of managing his career. It's been all about what he's said yes and no to, and nobody explained that to me when I was in my 20s. So if I'm going to do it again, I'm going to take a page out of Leo's book and be more discerning.


Do you ever think about what your career would look like now had you not stopped?


	Never.


You were one of the first and most prominent stars to speak out about Harvey Weinstein‘s abuse. You had legitimate concerns about the repercussions. Have there been any? 


	You have to remember that I grew up with Anita Hill as my model of what happens. A woman is incredibly brave, she does the right thing, and then she's eviscerated, and the man goes on to have all the power. We saw that happen again and again, so I really thought it could be cataclysmic for me. I was very reluctant to speak to a journalist, and throughout the investigation, I didn't know if I'd go on the record. But during the course of my many conversations with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times, I started to understand the depth, breadth and darkness of what had actually transpired, which I did not know.

	











Few did. That was his power.


	Yeah, and once I did, I thought, “I have no choice here, I have to say something,” because I knew that me co-signing that would be a big deal. And I am so glad I did, and I'm so glad there's now things like an intimacy coordinator. But it was really scary.


Do you feel there were repercussions for you?


	I don't think so, no. I was just so angry when I learned everything. And I'm an Enneagram 1 [on the popular personality test], so when I perceive injustice, I go scorched-earth, and I will die on that sword.


I didn't have many interactions with Harvey, but I do remember being in his office once and clocking a prominently placed photo of you taken the night you won your Oscar, almost like a prize.


	And an invitation, which makes me absolutely sick. … It's also hard for me because my relationship with Harvey, after that incident, was very complicated, but it was also a great working relationship. We made incredible films together. We sort of got over that weird thing. [Weinstein allegedly sexually harassed a then-22-year-old Paltrow, who told her then-boyfriend, Brad Pitt, about the incident. He confronted Weinstein, and it never happened again.] And I was like, “OK, that's behind us.” Harvey and I had lots of other fights about lots of other things, but I had this incredible creative run with him and his company. And so it's complicated because I'm so proud of the work that we did, and it's wild because he was so gifted at finding talent and understanding and nurturing it.

	











Shifting gears, you once said, “Being the person that people perceive me to be is inherently traumatic,” which I'm hoping you'll unpack for me.


	It means that I have so little say in the projections that people have, and it's traumatic to be at the whim of these projections when it's so misaligned with who you actually are. Especially as an Enneagram 1, you're like, “I never said that. I didn't mean that. Stop using my life as clickbait.” There's just so much that can feel so unfair, and it feels like trauma. What I've been trying to get to recently is, is there any mechanism to not imbibe those misperceptions?


And is there?


	I'm working on that. My therapist talks about the evil shadow, which is the part of you where rage lives — the part of you that will burn the fucking house down — and we do damage to ourselves by not embracing our shadows. When you close your eyes and get into evil shadow energy, there's a freedom there, and I'm trying to experiment with that, because when I go into evil shadow energy, I don't care what anyone's misperception is. So, that's my internal work these days. If somebody says something terrible that you read in a rag or whatever, instead of being like, “Hey, that's not true, that's not fair,” how about going into evil shadow energy and saying, “I don't give a fuck.”


There's this almost cultural obsession with you, which takes positive and negative form. Did it start when you and Chris Martin announced you were “consciously uncoupling”? 












	I think it really was when I sent out my first Goop newsletter [in 2008], even though it was like a turkey ragu recipe, which is still a fantastic recipe, by the way. I made it last week. But this idea that I was challenging the way that people saw me or the box that I fit in and, remember, this is like pre- newsletters, pre-Instagram, pre-Substack, pre-, pre-, pre-. People were like, “What the fuck is she doing? We don't like this. This is weird.” I challenged a very comfortable perception of who I was, and inherent in that was this idea that I want something else, which became, like, why does she want something more or something else?


As in, how could she?


	Yeah, how could she? And I was very early on a lot of stuff, in a very iconoclastic way, so people were already like, “Wait, we're annoyed. We don't want her to start a business. We like her in Sliding Doors. She already has enough as it is.” Then I started to talk about “weird” stuff, and it was like, “Great. Let's lick our chops and take her down.”


I've tried to think of an industry comp.


	Oh, so many of my peers are so good at avoiding all this. I was watching an interview recently with one, and I was like, “Oh, this is a master class in how to let nobody know you, let nobody know what you think, reveal nothing.” And I was like, I am not this person. I'm often like, “Gwyneth, why the fuck did you say that? Like, God, can't you just be graceful and boring?”

	











Even your ski trial became a cultural obsession. [Paltrow was found not at fault for a 2016 collision.] The New Yorker called it your “best role in years.” I mean, there's now a stage show parody.


	Multiple! (Laughs.)


Personally, I think you should go see one. Just turn up in the audience in another killer outfit.


	Now that would be funny.


You recently moved out of L.A., am I right?


	Yeah, we're in Montecito and Amagansett, like total country mice. But Los Angeles is a big part of who I am. I was born here, and it really runs through me, but [until about a decade or so ago,] I hadn't lived in L.A. since I was a kid, except when I used to stay with Brad Pitt in Hollywood.


That sounds quite glamorous.


	Oh, you should have seen that house. It was before he renovated it. It was literally falling apart. We lived in one tiny corner. Picture us in the guest, guest, guest bedroom, because that was the only toilet that worked.


OK, that's considerably less glamorous.


	But it was magical. Anyway, I really hadn't lived here since I was in the sixth grade. I was always in New York, and then I was in London for a long time, and when Chris and I separated, he very kindly said, “Hey, if you want to go home, I'm game.” And we landed in L.A. because it's where he was open to being — he's not a New York City guy. So I built this beautiful life here with my kids, and it was a very magical time in Los Angeles. It was really going through a renaissance.


Even New Yorkers thought it was cool then.












	Exactly. It was a great time to be here. But then the city took a big hit during COVID, and the threads never quite came back together. And then I couldn't face staying in that house without kids. That house without sleepovers and pancakes, I just couldn't do it.


Is there a long-term plan for Goop, or at least your involvement in it? Presumably you have investors who want to see —


	Liquidity? Yeah.


How do you see it playing out?


	When I started, I didn't know what I was doing. It was just a newsletter, and then it had incredible traction, and someone was like, “You need to raise money so you can hire a team.” But I didn't know at the time that there was like a 10-year horizon and people would want their money. And the truth is, I don't want to sell this business. Of course, this will have to be something that I negotiate with my investors. At some point, do you have long-term capital come in and replace [those initial investors] and give people some liquidity? I'm starting to think about that stuff now. But I really love what I do, and I want to keep growing this business. The brand that we've built is so strong, and you can see that with Goop Kitchen, which is its own company.


I'll admit, I ordered a Brentwood Chicken Salad from Goop Kitchen last night.












	Oh, great, thank you. But, yeah, I'll have to figure out this V.C. piece at some point. There are a lot of paths I could take. I definitely will not IPO. I sat on a public board, a female-founded public company, and the markets do not understand women and what we want, so that I will never do. Nev–er. I'd love to maybe at some point soon bring someone on to do the parts of my job that I'm not as good at and really don't like. But for now, it's working.


The entrepreneur life is often a rollercoaster, and not everyone is wired for it. Do you feel like your years as an actor, dealing with things like rejection, prepared you?


	Completely. I always say that artists and entrepreneurs, we're the same animal. It's like you have to have this bizarre streak of self-belief and fortitude.


Almost to the point of delusion.


	Not almost. To the point of delusion.


These days, it can feel like every young star has a beauty company. What do you make of it?


	It's great. When I see young women being entrepreneurial, I get excited because that was not possible in my day. In my 20s, we were leveraged for other brands, and we saw very little upside. So I love that these young women have ownership in what they're doing, and there are a lot of different ways to do it. You could be really obtuse like me and do everything in-house, kill yourself, build product, blah, blah, blah. Or you could just pair with someone who's already doing something, which is great too. I just chose to do it in the hardest of all possible ways.


Now, as you consider a more significant return to acting —












	Maybe. Maybe. (Laughs.)


I'm not trying to rush you into anything, but does it make it harder to disappear into roles if we've heard you talk about vaginal steaming?


	Yeah, I mean, does it? I don't know. Definitely the way that I was trained and raised was to be mysterious, and you've seen a complete evolution to accessibility. And if you want to market things, you're expected to have more accessibility. The data shows the more somebody has access to you, the more resonance there is and the more likely they are to convert on buying a movie ticket or buying the moisturizer. When I've had friends that don't have social followings who want to start something, I'm like, “That's going to be very, very hard.”


Your daughter has said that she's interested in an acting career. Your mom was against you following in her footsteps. Do you feel the same way?


	No. When I was starting out, my mother was looking at everything through a very protective lens, and it can be a very heartbreaking job — a lot of rejection, a lot of loneliness. And of course, as a parent, you want to spare your child all of that. But both of my children want to go into the arts, and now more than ever, the world needs artists. We need people to disrupt and challenge our existing ideas. Look at Lily Allen's new album, or Rosalía's, we need that kind of searing authenticity and radical artistic expression. So I'm thrilled they both want to do that, and let's see how it goes.

	











Any advice for them that you wish you'd received at the time?


	I spent so many years in pleasing mode, and what that means is you're trying to bend yourself into some other idea of what somebody wants you to be. I just want them to be fully themselves and not give a fuck what anybody thinks.

But the best one definitely did.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	If you wanted to see Mad Men truly like never before, you had your chance on HBO Max.


	The 4K stream of the classic Lionsgate Television series for AMC Network came to HBO Max on Monday, Dec. 1, but the big acquisition did not go exactly as planned.




	For starters, the Mad Men episodes in 4K on HBO Max were listed out of order and mislabeled, which likely made series creator Matthew Weiner an absolute mad man.


	But that's nothing compared to an actual edit-oopsie in the seventh episode of season one. In “Red in the Face” (what the episode is supposed to be titled, but was not on 4K HBO Max), a drunk (they were always drunk) Roger Sterling (John Slattery) vomits up oysters in the office in front of prospective clients. In the initial 4K stream that released on HBO Max, a Mad Men crew member was very visibly operating a barf hose behind Sterling, in full view of the camera. There was even a second staffer in frame supporting the puke-hose tech. That guy would have been a great friend in college.

	So, what happened? Lionsgate delivered the wrong 4K file to HBO Max, The Hollywood Reporter was told. The non-4K files were fine as delivered.


	At the time this story first published, Lionsgate was working on getting HBO Max the correct file(s), THR was told. They were then in the process of being swapped out around 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Dec. 2.


	Lionsgate did not immediately comment on the fail; HBO Max referred THR back to Lionsgate.

the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla


	HBO Max has been heavily promoting its acquisition of Mad Men reruns, and especially touted how Mad Men on HBO Max would be the series' first time ever in 4K. The launch was probably not quite how executives pictured it — literally.

	











	“Mad Men is a great addition to the HBO Max library of iconic content,” Royce Battleman, executive vice president of global content acquisitions at Warner Bros. Discovery, said in last month's announcement. “We are thrilled that HBO Max will provide fans the opportunity to enjoy the series in a fresh way with an enhanced 4K viewing experience.”


	“Enhanced” is in the eye of the episode 107 viewer, we suppose.


	“Mad Men continues to show truly remarkable staying power with audiences a full decade after concluding its network run, and we couldn't imagine a better home for it than HBO Max,” Jim Packer, the president of worldwide television distribution at Lionsgate, said at the time. “HBO sets the bar for premium entertainment, making it the perfect place to celebrate one of television's defining series while introducing Mad Men to new viewers and reintroducing it to longtime fans in 4K.”


Mad Men has been streaming on AMC+ since 2020; the non-4K version remains there as well.


Dec. 2, 10 a.m. PT This story has been updated to reflect HBO Max was working on swapping in the correct files.

Hosts Gary Lineker, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer will film the show from New York during the tournament. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	Jug Ears, Big Meeks and Smokey Alan are heading to Netflix! The Rest Is Football podcast gang have signed on with the streaming giant to bring their popular soccer show to the platform during the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup.


	Hosts Gary Lineker, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer will present daily episodes of TRIF, one of the world's biggest sports podcasts, during the showcase soccer tournament, that is set to be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico next summer. The trio will cross the Atlantic and film the show in a studio in New York City, and will offer analysis on the games, interviews and insights. TRIF also plan to cover the England team in depth with reports from the camp as well as fan zones.

	The move to bring TRIF to Netflix is part of the streamer's plan to expand its sports coverage, and in particular soccer. In August, Netflix secured the TV rights in Canada for the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031. That followed the company earlier picking up the same exclusive broadcast rights in the U.S. for the marquee women's soccer tournament for 2027 and 2031.

	The deal also aligns with Netflix's push to make more big moves into the video podcasting space to compete with market leader YouTube. In recent months, the streamer has signed deals with Spotify and is looking to make deals with the likes of iHeartMedia.

	











	 “We can't wait to bring The Rest Is Football to Netflix for the 2026 World Cup,” said Lineker in a short statement. “It's a fantastic opportunity for the three of us to do what we love — talk football every day — but on a truly global stage. Expect all the usual analysis, honesty and plenty of laughs… just with a few more cameras pointed at us, all from the Big Apple. “


TRIF, which boasts over 7 million monthly streams, is part of Goalhanger, the U.K.'s biggest independent podcast company and is also behind the immensely popular series The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Politics and The Rest Is Entertainment. Goalhanger was co-founded by Lineker, Tony Pastor and Jack Davenport. WME represented Goalhanger in brokering the deal.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	On the 30th anniversary of Martin Scorsese‘s Casino, the Oscar-winning filmmaker is returning to the world of Las Vegas gambling with a drama series greenlighted by Netflix. It is created by Billions co-creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien, who serve as showrunners on the untitled project.


	The eight-episode drama is set in the high-stakes, sharp-elbowed present-day Las Vegas casino business, which is a modernized but still dangerous version of the legendary city. At the center of it stands Robert “Bobby Red” Redman, president of the hottest hotel casino in town, who has to make some long odds moves to try and secure his position and take more ground.

	Koppelman and Levien executive produce with Paul Schiff (The Inheritance), who runs their company Best Available, alongside Scorsese and his Sikelia Productions, Julie Yorn and Rick Yorn for Expanded Media, and former Billions writer-producer Beth Schacter, with Kerry Orent (The Better Sister) serving as co-executive producer.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The project can be traced back to a general idea Julie Yorn and Rick Yorn brought to Netflix with longtime collaborator Scorsese, who is managed by Rick Yorn. The streamer had been talking to Scorsese about doing a TV series following the success of his 2019 Netflix movie The Irishman.  


	A period take was initially developed. Netflix subsequently brought in Koppelman and Levien who had an idea for a present-day casino drama which was put into development, leading to the series greenlight.

	











	While sharing a setting with Scorsese's 1995 movie Casino, the Netflix series is not related in any way to the film, which is set in 1973 and stars Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci. Scorsese also explored casinos/gambling in another period piece, his HBO Boardwalk Empire.


	Meanwhile, Koppelman and Levien have previously tackled the arena in contemporary setting with two movies they wrote, Ocean's Thirteen and Rounders. 


	This marks a reunion for Scorsese, Koppelman and Levien who briefly worked together on Scorsese's HBO series Vinyl. 


	It also marks the first series greenlight for Koppelman and Levien since the end of Billions, which ran on Showtime for seven seasons. In addition to co-creating and executive producing the Paul Giamatti-Damian Lewis drama with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Koppelman and Levien created and executive produced the network's 2022 limited series Super Pumped. Koppelman also moonlights as an actor, recurring as Nicholas “The Computer” Marshall on FX's The Bear. The duo, who have multiple other shows in the works, are repped by WME and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Levien is also with 3 Arts.


	After writing and producing on Seasons 5 and 6 of Billions, Schacter became co-showrunner for the seventh and final season. She also co-showran Super Pumped with Koppelman and Levien. She is a consulting producer on Season 4 of Apple's The Morning Show and executive producer of Peacock's upcoming Five Star Weekend, based on the novel by Elin Hildebrand. Schacter is co-developing a series about the origin of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders based on Texas Monthly's America's Girls podcast. She is repped by CAA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.


	Scorsese is repped by WME, LBI Entertainment and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.

The Beauty is based on a comic book series by Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley. In it, the world of high fashion turns dark when international supermodels begin dying in gruesome and mysterious ways. FBI Agents “Cooper Madsen” (Evan Peters) and “Jordan Bennett” (Rebecca Hall) are sent to Paris to uncover the truth. As they delve deeper into the case, they uncover a sexually transmitted virus that transforms ordinary people into visions of physical perfection, but with terrifying consequences. 


	Their path leads them directly into the crosshairs of “The Corporation” (Ashton Kutcher), a shadowy tech billionaire who has secretly engineered a miracle drug dubbed “The Beauty,” who will do anything to protect his trillion-dollar empire—including unleashing his lethal enforcer, “The Assassin” (Anthony Ramos). As the epidemic spreads, “Jeremy” (Jeremy Pope), a desperate outsider, is caught in the chaos, searching for purpose as the agents race across Paris, Venice, Rome, and New York to stop a threat that could alter the future of humanity. The Beauty is a global thriller that asks: what would you sacrifice for perfection?

	











	Created and written by Ryan Murphy and Matthew Hodgson, the series is executive produced by Murphy, Hodgson, Peters, Ramos, Pope, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson, Nissa Diederich, Michael Uppendahl, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Gitter, Peter Schwerin and Jeremy Haun. Hurley is a consultant.


The Beauty is produced by 20th Television.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


	If Leo DiCaprio had turned down Titanic and played Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights, who knows what might have happened? Instead, he honored his agreement with James Cameron, and the rest is history.


	But although the decision turned out to be the right one, DiCaprio often wondered if he might have missed his window to work with Paul Thomas Anderson, an opportunity that no amount of money can buy. Thirty years went by, until along came the script for One Battle After Another — a satirical take on Thomas Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland — with an offer for DiCaprio to star as Bob, an Antifa-like radical gone underground who is forced out of hiding to find his missing daughter (Chase Infiniti). But, like PTA's previous Pynchon adaptation Inherent Vice, there's a lot more to it than that, including a sadistic colonel (Sean Penn), a compassionate martial-arts sensei (Benicio del Toro) and an underground cabal of murderous right-wing businessmen called The Christmas Adventurers Club. That DiCaprio's character navigates this perilous road — replete with high-speed car chases and gun battles — clad the entire time in a tatty bathrobe and leaves most of the heroism to others in the cast is entirely consistent with how he has run one of the great star careers of his era. After all, this is the same guy who, when faced with playing a virtuous lawman in Martin Scorsese's Native American drama Killers of the Flower Moon had the script rewritten and overhauled so he could play the existentially tortured no-good who slowly poisons the Osage wife he loves, just to please his greedy uncle.

	











	It's been a long, steady climb to the top. Look back at many of DiCaprio's other best turns — from The Aviator to Revolutionary Road, Catch Me If You Can, The Revenant and Inception — and you can recognize his preference for flawed characters that put him through the emotional wringer. He also has an uncanny knack for attracting the best directors in the business, from Quentin Tarantino to Alejandro González Iñárritu, Steven Spielberg, Sam Mendes and, most famous of all, Scorsese, who traded Robert De Niro for him as a muse after collaborating on 2002's Gangs of New York and will shortly be pairing him with Jennifer Lawrence for their seventh film together, What Happens at Night.

	DiCaprio's commitment to sophisticated, auteur-driven adult movies is much-needed — the outlook for theatrical audiences is as bleak as ever. But, as he explains here, the biggest movie star leading that space is doing his part to uphold a legacy.


The reactions to One Battle After Another have been as strong as any I've observed since Oppenheimer and Sinners. I cannot imagine anyone feeling that way after watching a movie on a streaming site. It's a respite from the current climate for original movies, which is bleak. Even your movie had to overcome an earlier narrative about its budget, before anyone had seen a frame of Paul Thomas Anderson's film. How in decline is the ambitious original film made for the theatrical experience? 


	This year seems like one of the most lightning-rod moments in cinema history. We're up against it — the future of the cinematic experience — more than ever, I feel. Getting people to come to the theaters seems like more and more of a challenge. That isn't to say it can't happen; the Barbie–Oppenheimer summer was an amazing thing, and hats off to those two incredible movies, but it certainly seems more and more like the theatrical experience is becoming more and more minimized for original material and completely new, out-of-the-box storytelling. And that's possibly going to be subjugated to streamers now. Whereas the theatrical experience may be for the newer technological wonders that people want to experience in the theater.


	I just hope that's not the case, and I hope that there's still room for original material going into the future. But, at the end of the day, man, the tide is changing. It's going to be a fight, and things are going to have to become so unique for audiences that they garner it worthy to go see it in the theater.


That was never a line drawn by me, you, and the previous generation that went to see everything in the theater…


	Is it becoming like collecting vinyl? Do we have to decide what categorizes the movies we'll wait for to see on a streamer and what categorizes the movies that are worthy enough to see in the theater? It remains to be seen, but people always have that argument constantly about, “Oh, well, I'd prefer to watch it at home, and what's the difference anyway?” I think there's arguments to both. I guess I'm part of the old school ilk of people that love to be in a communal experience. I think we're primates that feed off each other, and I just love going to the theater.


You can't fake that feeling, like I had walking out of Oppenheimer or at the Chinese Theater premiere of your movie, and it's nice to be able to be moved like that. I just saw it again. There was a small crowd, but they got every line, the shock registering when PTA wanted it to, the audience laughing where he wanted them to. I guess I'm saying, “Good on you, guys,” for holding up your end of the bargain. So let me launch into some important questions…


	Before you do that, I'd like to say that I'm so very proud of this movie. Proud to be involved in it, and really proud that however many people actually came to the theater to see it. The ones that did so really expressed a genuine and sincere feeling that it was made to be seen in the theaters, and that they really loved watching this movie there. The VistaVision thing is even more interesting because, as we're talking about the endangerment of the cinematic experience, this movie went even more lo-fi, picking up an endangered and nearly extinct cinematic format that has, god, I don't know how many cameras, but I think only four projectors. One in LA, one in Boston, one in New York and one in London. But it was really cool to hear people's appreciation for being able to see something in a completely different format. We watched it that way in London, and to see that kind of flickering light strobe through the theater…

	











	We are so inundated with such hi-fi experiences now that it actually took me 10 minutes to adjust to the feeling of film again. But then I really got into it. It was like playing a record and feeling the warmth of it. The Brutalist is the only other film since One-Eyed Jacks in 1961 to be shot in VistaVision. That was period, ours was a modern-day film. I'm not a film expert, I couldn't talk to you about the exact differentiation between that and 35mm, but it certainly felt like things were more tactile and real and had a warmth to them. When I saw The Brutalist — or The Master, which was shot in 65mm — I felt like I was in that era. It was raw and real, and you felt like you could jump into that world. It was really cool to watch it in that format. And I'm really appreciative that, no matter how finite, the group of people who saw it that way loved the experience too. [Laughs.] On to your important questions.


After Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, the coolest Halloween costume was the Hawaiian shirt over the Champion sparkplug T-shirt that your co-star Brad Pitt wore as Rick Dalton's stuntman Cliff Booth. How gratifying was it to see so many trick-or-treaters and partygoers this Halloween in a bathrobe, sunglasses, wool hat and a cell phone?


	Definitely a cool experience. I even saw one on a baby, which was amazing. What's funny is, I think that print of bathrobe actually became discontinued while we were making the movie. But there were enough out there that were similar. That costume… I think we talked about that costume more than any I've worn. In pre-production, we had the whole team — Paul and everybody — trying to figure out what my look should be, because it was going to be Bob's superhero outfit throughout the rest of the movie.


	There was one point in which Paul and I had come up with a parka that he would have had in his emergency kit. There would be a parka with all kinds of explosives in it. And then the sound guy came up to us and said, “No. No parka, no parka.” And then Paul and I were like, “Well, Bob's sitting at home, he's watching The Battle of Algiers again for the 200th time, and he's in his sweatpants and his weird wide-toed shoes that he walks around in, getting stoned. It's a little cold out but he's got to go. Does he think about stripping down? Does he think about becoming the revolutionary? No, he's got weed in his system, and he's got to go.” So that became his one look for the rest of the movie. I love that he never takes anything off. He just keeps moving forward.


Same with Benicio's sensei character and his karate pants.


	Exactly, and he's got to go, too. It's like you get these guys in this slice-of-life moment of what their day-to-day is like, and they're on the move. And then I had this vision of those gigantic sunglasses that I remember from the ‘80s and ‘90s, the ones you put over your reading glasses. And that became his Star Wars outfit. We had a lot of different discussions about Bob's look — days and days and days of what that look should be like. So, it was very gratifying, Halloween and all.


The film is full of meme-worthy laugh lines, from “semen demon,” “Viva la revolution!,” and “Thank you, Sensei” to the Christmas Adventurers Club. How do you land those without interrupting the tension in that propulsive narrative?  












	Some of them were improvised, some were written in the script. “Viva la revolution!” just came out in that moment. We had a great flow, an amazing set decorator and location scout, and that rolling carpet down to [the Sensei's] Harriet Tubman immigration center was already set up for us and it was our last goodbye. For that whole sequence of lines, I have to give so much credit to Benicio who I got to work with probably the most in this film. He was so very specific about what his character was. He came out right from the set of The Phoenician Scheme, and he had this cacophony of amazing ideas of who Sensei was. And that's why we really stopped production for three months to wait for him, because we knew that there was only one Sensei in this world, and that was Benicio. And he came in with so many different ideas. That whole Harriet Tubman thing came from his imagination. We had a whole other sequence set in place where I was going to make a kill. And he was like, “Well, if this guy kills somebody, what is my allegiance to him?”


Crossing that line from idealist to killer would have changed his character?


	We spoke about it for days. We were like, “Yeah, true. You do admire him. You're an admirer of the French 75. You're a revolutionary yourself, but how much are you going to risk your life for this guy?” That propelled us all to that sort of made-up road trip we came up with in a week. The whole immigration center that he had going on in his house, his entire family unit, that was all made up within a week. A lot of those lines between he and I were just improvised. He came in with that sense of ocean waves and that inner peace. His calmness with my hysteria, it happened on day one, we could feel it was a beautiful thing. I just give so much credit to Benicio for his specificity and his character because it gave me so much to play off of, that “Thank you Sensei!” stuff just kind of happened. And then the “Viva la revolution!” stuff happened, and then the stuff on the rooftop with his guys. He imagined [the Sensei] would have a crew, and that he would have a crew at the hospital. He'd have crews everywhere. He's got the whole neighborhood on tap. That was all made up. A lot of this stuff was improvised and a lot was written. It was a mixed bag.


It reminded me of Brad Pitt dropping off your Rick Dalton character on set, and spontaneously reminding him, “You're Rick f*cking Dalton, and don't you forget it.” PTA and Quentin Tarantino are writer-director auteurs. How open are they to things they didn't write?  


	Writer-directors are interesting, because there's some things that are sacrilege to try to change. I include Marty, who, to a degree, writes his own work and certainly does tons of writing on the scripts for his movies, along with Quentin and Paul, very specific writer-directors who only do their own material. It's about finding those sweet spots, those moments. They hire us for that reason, to find those moments, but it's about navigating that within the context of the structure that they've written, because sometimes they have a very specific idea of what they want done according to their script. But, yeah, it's about the actors finding those moments. And sometimes they use them and sometimes they don't. You've just got to throw it out there as much as you can, whenever you feel it's right.


Sean Penn said he grabbed PTA's script when he was coming out of the shower and that he sat on the floor and didn't even dress as he ripped through it. You were in earlier; how much did PTA let you under the hood as he wrote it? Or did you read the finished product like Sean? In that case, how did you react, knowing the journey you were taking with him?












	Well, I would say it was the same as Sean. I mean, the way that character was written, Sean brought this incredible vulnerability and pitifulness to the character that made it not your typical villain. He brought a humanity to it that I saw immediately on screen. This vulnerability of a guy that wants to belong to the Christmas Adventurers Club — it's become his only identity — and yet he's battling this voracious appetite for Teyana Taylor's character and is so heartbroken by it, he wants to erase it. There was just so much complexity that Sean brought. But I guess your question is… what is your question specifically?


It was about your reaction when you read the script, finding out where these characters were going and how they were going to get there, in scenes that move at 90 mph.


	Paul had put so much thought into this — 15 to 20 years of thought into all these different characters — that it was obviously very personal to him, and it really tapped into the state of the world right now, the extremism that we all feel, from both sides. He did it in such an elegant, beautiful way with these very human protagonists that were all flawed. When I first read the script, I knew it was something incredibly special right out of the gate. I just loved how he goes against the norm with so many tropes that we see in movies. He just takes the opposite direction for my character. I just love that he was very equipped as a revolutionary, and you have this expectation of him being able to utilize all these tools from his past.


	But then he's put into a situation where he's so ill-equipped at this particular moment to try to garner whatever skills he has, because he's inebriated and he's become lazy and just out of touch and disconnected with the world. I just imagined this man, sitting in this tiny little shack—and we looked at 10 different shacks to find the perfect one. I just imagined him sitting there, no internet, watching DVDs, completely paranoid. Maybe he goes out to the local bar, or does some mechanical scrap work in the back of his yard, but his main objective is, “Don't tread on me.” No government allowed, no social media, no nothing. And the one singular idea that Paul had that made it all cook was him just not remembering his password. I couldn't believe how long this went on, whereas maybe that would be one blip in a story, in any normal screenplay that I usually read.


It certainly becomes the gift that kept giving, prompting numerous meltdowns by your character…


	It becomes my entire identity — this goddamn password! The scenes just progressively became more and more tense, and the audience comes with you on this journey, where it's like, “Goddammit, you finally found it at that right moment when the pressure's on.” The tension that he created in that script was unbelievable. I always talk about tension in movies and stakes, however big or small, and whether the audience is with you. Each one of these characters has their own set of tensions — and they're all converging. It's like a pilot landing a plane without any autopilot, and [PTA] somehow lands the ending of this movie in such a brilliant way. It's all done analog, and without any of the traditional expectations that you have for a movie. He landed this plane on his own and he did it brilliantly. It was all right there, written in that script. And I was just so proud and excited to be a part of it, right from the beginning.

	











When you did Killers of the Flower Moon, you encouraged Marty and Eric Roth to turn the whole narrative on its ear, and you went from being the good guy to the conflicted guy who was slowly poisoning the woman he loved for her oil rights fortune. How much of a say do you want when you're an actor on a movie like One Battle After Another, compared to also being producer like on Killers, where you have sway in everything we're going to see onscreen?


	In other words, how do I differentiate myself from just being an actor to somebody who's a producer of the movie and changing the structure? 


Well, yeah. With Killers, that creative overhaul that you suggested — and which Marty, Eric Roth and Robert De Niro embraced —  added at least a year to the development process. But it allowed you to make something more complex. It was darker and more diabolical, and it pulled you out of the traditional hero role. To me, it was worth it.


	Well, thank you, I appreciate that. I mean, what can I say other than it was a real gut instinct? The screenplay initially was the Tom White character [played by Jesse Plemons after DiCaprio switched from playing white hat to black hat], and this full investigation. I think, more than anything, it took away from Lily Gladstone's character's evolution. And [the rewrite] brought this horrifying story more into the household, this sort of diabolical, twisted household of manipulation, and made it less the white savior thing, which I think would've been, in my opinion, a mistake to go down. It brought us into the family dynamic where there was a certain amount of love, guilt and a horrifying betrayal at the same time. After talking to Marty, we just felt it was just a much more interesting way to go, with the psychology of how this man could do it, under the guise of manipulation from De Niro's character, her dilemma of wanting to keep this family together, my character's sort of schizophrenia, and what the right thing to do is.


	It was heavily influenced by Montgomery Clift movies: A Place in the Sun, The Heiress, The Search, Red River. When we saw those movies, we were like, wow. What if we could mesh these things together to try to create some sort of twisted look at all this while being able to bring the Osage and Molly into it, and the community into it more, rather than it being purely a film about the FBI's investigation? Even though that script was very good, and it would've made another interesting movie, what I thought was that it would be a film about something the audience would've already figured out in the first 10 minutes of the movie. This way got us into the community more, the household more, and the inner family dynamics, which I just felt was more interesting and more heartbreaking.


You've said your biggest regret was not doing Boogie Nights with PTA, playing the Dirk Diggler role. The one you starred in instead won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, and for the longest time was the highest-grossing film ever, making $2.2 billion. It stamped you as a globally bankable star that has allowed you the leverage to make films like One Battle After Another. Choosing Titanic was a smart move, to me. Can you recall what you felt when you had to choose?  


	Well, I think that was my answer to a question in the guise of speaking to Paul, and, without getting too personal about my own life, the question was, “What do you regret most?” We were sitting here talking about movies. It came from the standpoint of just being a fan of his work for so long. I do remember watching that movie and it being just a lightning rod moment for my generation. It was like the arrival of a new cinematic titan, one who was speaking to my generation. Now, I don't think anyone could have done a better job than Mark Wahlberg in that movie, so I said it from the perspective of being just a really sincere fan and then watching the way Paul has progressed as a storyteller with these very esoteric, existential films he's made since then that keep you thinking. Boogie Nights was the launching pad for a new artist. So, it's less about that specific film and more about wanting to have worked with Paul.

	











Any regrets about choosing Titanic? It launched you and Kate Winslet to enviable careers, but it sounded like a hellacious experience, with James Cameron going past double the original budget and all those scenes in cold water…


	No regrets. I mean, fully now in retrospect, I look back at that film and realize the thanks and the appreciation that I have for being a part of it, and to have been able to be in this incredibly fortunate position and not only to have been a part of that movie, but to be able to be the conductor of my own choices since. That has been just the greatest gift. The dilemma for me at that point, was, of course I would've loved to have done both movies, but it just couldn't happen at that moment. And then, here we are, all these years later and it's this great sort of reconnection. We've gone on these paths together, and then to come back around and be able to collaborate with Paul on this is just amazing. But yeah, I mean that moment, I don't know what my ability or my career would've been without that film making it possible to be able to steer the course of my own career. So, I'm very thankful.  


You've prioritized great directors in choosing your film roles, Martin Scorsese being atop the list. What can you tell us about What Happens at Night, which puts you alongside another Oscar winner in Jennifer Lawrence? The loose description conjures comparisons to The Shining and Shutter Island. What can you say about it, and do you hope to make it next?


	It's a work in progress. But what I do know is that Marty has this incredible yearning and connection to this material. I don't know if I could compare it to The Shining or Shutter Island. I think he's heavily influenced by films like Vertigo, in that the film that he wants to make is about human relationships, about the acceptance of grief, the ability to let go. It's a love story, but it's simultaneously about accepting the reality that you're given in this life. It's going to be an interesting journey. We're still putting all the pieces together, but Marty has a very firm idea of what he wants to do, and there's going to be a lot of exploration when we make this movie, because it can go in a lot of different directions. But at the core is this relationship between a man and a dying woman. They're put into a set of circumstances where we don't know what's reality and what's not.


You've also been working with Michael Mann on Heat 2, either as Chris Shiherlis, the role played by the late Val Kilmer, or Vincent Hanna, the detective played by Al Pacino. What can you share, and — as a guy who doesn't usually do sequels — what are the challenges in continuing the storyline from the revered original?


	This is very much its own movie. We're still working on it, we're a ways away from production. It tips its hat to Heat, but it's an homage, and it picks up the story from there. The book is already out there, so there are no big secrets that I'm divulging. It's set in the future, and the past, from that pivotal moment in what I think is the great crime noir film of my lifetime. It's one of those films that just keeps resonating, that we keep talking about, that has been imitated so many times and influenced so many different movies. So, we're working on it. But it's certainly exciting, and I think I look at it as its own silo, in a sense. We can't duplicate what Heat was, so it's paying homage to that film, but giving it its own unique entity.

	











If you wanted me to know if you will play Hanna or Shiherlis, you probably would have said.


	We're discussing it. You know the book?


Loved the book.  


	What do you think? 


It's a tough one. Shiherlis, unable to see his wife and son again, starts over in a new criminal enterprise and he's got the big journey. But I love the Hanna character for his dogged pursuit of Neil McCauley. I've seen Heat 100 times, easy, and I wish I could help your decision. You'll have to pick one.


	We're in mid-discussion.


This a full-circle moment for me. My first conversation with Michael Mann came when I'd broken a story in Variety about how he and you had decided that the film about James Dean you were doing with him wasn't going to work out.  


	Wow, that was so long ago. My god, I was 18.


So, that was my headline, and then I wrote that he would instead pair Pacino and De Niro in this movie he'd written called Heat. He called me up and was rightfully pissed. He was like, “You wrote a story about a movie that isn't happening and gave short shrift to what will be the first pairing of two of the greatest actors of this generation?” I did another story, because he was right. Now, you came close on James Dean and again on The Aviator, and now it's happening with Heat 2. This sounds a lot like your long-held desire to work with PTA.  


	What I love about Michael Mann as an artist and as a person — and I've heard this from other actors along the way — is that he is extraordinary to work with, because there's nothing that he hasn't thought of. He's thought of every single nuance and detail of the character, of the world, and he's going to have an answer for any questions you might have. When we did the James Dean screen test, I remember it was at Warner Bros. They put a top hat on me. I did my best. I think we had two days to shoot a screen test. I was probably just a little too young at that time. Then we moved on to developing The Aviator together. That was the Howard Hughes book I remember carrying around in my backpack for almost 10 years, while I was voraciously reading about who that man was. I had a huge passion to play him. Michael developed that entire screenplay with John Logan, and it was just masterful. He had just done Ali, and after doing one major biopic, he didn't want to do another, he said, “It's yours, kid.” I said, “OK, thank you.”


	Marty was the guy that I took it to. He picked up the script, saw the first page with The Aviator on it, and he said, “I don't know anything about aviation.” And then he said, “But I didn't know anything about boxing either when I did Raging Bull.” Then he delved into the character and the screenplay that Michael had set up, which was masterful, nuanced and fully realized. It was a struggle for me, because I was so obsessed with the later Hughes too. But it took us both a while to get to this one idea, where we were just focused on the onset of his degradation and his OCD, compounded by his germ phobia. And there's another film to do, which is later on, which is him stuck in the hotel room in Vegas with inches of dust around his apartment building. But this was the onset of it, and the aviation stuff was spectacular. Michael really was the architect of all of that. And so, yeah, I've always wanted to work with Michael. He's got an incredibly brilliant mind, and there's no stone that he leaves unturned.

	











It sets up that race to be a pioneer before his mental illness defeats him, ending in that heartbreaking scene where he repeats the phrase “The way of the future.”


	That was in the script. I remember Marty and I meeting with [screenwriter] John Logan. We wanted to rip the whole script apart. John very casually sat there as we slowly went through the entire script. He was like, “Yeah, but that's already there.” Or “Well, we could flash-forward to this, but do you see that it's already there?” Finally, we were like, “OK, you're right.” We shot the script that Michael and John wrote, with some minor changes, but it was just one of the best screenplays that I ever got to be a part of making.


Your character in One Battle After Another starts out a fresh-faced revolutionary, but by the time he's called on to find his daughter, he's no John Wick out of retirement. He's this pothead in the bathrobe, emerging out of a cloud of weed smoke. The hero moments fall to Benicio and Chase Infiniti, who plays your daughter. He's a flawed character tasked with being more than mediocre. He has no superpower, or, if there ever was one, it has long ago been dulled by weed. Why do you like to play these kinds of roles?  


	I talked about one singular idea that changes the course of the entire narrative, and that being not remembering the password. That became a theme that we then carried on through the rest of the film. The original screenplay did have, certainly, one ruthless heroic moment in the beginning, and then the tail end of how the movie ended was left TBD. I give a lot of credit to Paul, because every time we came to the fork of the road of my character doing something that was traditionally heroic, we'd both hem and haw. Sometimes that was literally on the street the day of shooting, or in the dojo on that day.


	It was Benicio who said, “This is too much. If he's going to kill one of these guys, I will have blood on my hands.” We kept on working on it, and we didn't have a distinct idea of how the movie would end. I remember the moment where we were still delineating what to do, whether Bob has a traditional heroic moment at the end of the movie. And Paul said, “No, this needs to be passed on to the next generation. Her parents' mistakes, the ideals of her extremist revolutionary parents, all that needs to be passed on to the next generation. She's got to be faced with something that she never asked for, which is having a gun in her hand and saving her own life, because it's now about her.”


You were good with that?


	I got it at that moment. I was like, “He's totally right.” And these are just the choices that a master filmmaker makes in the moment that you have to give credit where credit is due and not take the obvious choice. People that I've spoken to do appreciate that aspect of the Bob character, that being a father at the end of this movie is his heroism, just the mere act of moving forward, the mere act of trying his best. It's very humanizing, being there for his daughter. And if anything, his heroic moment is putting his arm around her in that car as they're weeping together, driving away from this horrific carnage.


The real positive of you not playing the superhero is that it leaves oxygen for Chase Infiniti, who's making her movie debut, and for Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor, who comes shot out of a cannon and makes the most of her 40 minutes or so of screen time.  












	Teyana and Regina are so pivotal in this movie, and Chase really, she is in a lot of ways the heart of this film. We met a lot of different actresses. I don't want to say it's her innocence, but when you meet this young lady in person, you want to do everything you can to make sure she's OK. That projected on screen in such a dynamic way. You knew the audience is completely OK with the idea, we're going to stop at nothing to make sure this young lady isn't a sacrificial lamb to Bob's past, or [his ex] Perfidia's past, in the movie we're stopping at nothing to save her. And she just encapsulates not only that, but the ferocity and the fighting spirit of her mom. She had the combination of both that really makes this movie cook and work, and she did such an incredible breakout performance in this film. I'm so proud of her.


Your character falls off a roof. He dives out of a moving car. Was there a part of you that thought, “Y'know what? I'm going to Tom Cruise this shit and do it myself.”


	[Smiles]. There were some stunts that I did and some stunts I didn't. If I would've fallen off of that roof, we wouldn't have been able to continue production. Even the stunt guy had to do it on cables. There's no way I would've pulled that off. Other things, I did what I could, or rather I did what Bob could do, like his inability to catch up with those [skateboard] guys right out of the gate. You think you're going to go on the traditional espionage thriller, and then as soon as they're on the rooftop, 10 seconds later, he's fallen down two stories and then he gets tasered.


It sounds like when it comes to those kinds of stunts, it's best to hand over the bathrobe to the stuntman.


	Well put.


Were you ever going to be part of the spinoff David Fincher is making about Brad Pitt's character from Once Upon a Time…?


	There were some talks about it early on. Ultimately, I cannot wait to see the Cliff Booth story, but I'm not in it. I think David Fincher's the perfect man for the job. Quentin is a huge fan of his work, I'm a huge fan of his work, and there's nobody better to carry on that lineage and tell that story. I think it's the next phase of Cliff Booth's life. I'm excited to see it.


Before anyone saw a frame of One Battle After Another, the press narrative was harsh, focusing on this being a huge gamble. It put Warner Bros. production chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy on their heels. The movie came out and reviews were rhapsodic. What do you think when you see these kinds of negative articles about your upcoming projects?  


	I try not to pay attention to it. Every time you see stuff about what the budget of the movie was, it becomes a narrative about how much it's going to make theatrically. We haven't even counted on what it's going to do, into next year. It remains to be seen. But back to what we were saying earlier, yeah, there is a distinct microscope on whether artistic original films garner or deserve the theatrical experience. And what can you say? I think that's left up to audiences, and cinema-lovers. And I think that these films are still going to be made. It's just in what context we're going to be able to watch them, and how we're going to experience them is going to be the difference.


	We're not falling short of an inundation of material and production. I think, going into the future, we're going to see tons of original ideas, tons of movies being made, and limited series. The work is out there. It's just the challenge of whether they're going to be seen in theaters and how much is going to be taken over by AI and what movies are going to look like in the future. I don't have a crystal ball, but as long as the people in our industry are going to be able to continue to work — and hopefully they are — it's the way of the future. [He smiles at using the Howard Hughes line.] And with anything… when television started, or the advent of radio or DVDs or MP3s or whatever, it's all going to change. But hopefully people still want to see movies. That's all I can hope for.

	











You told a story in one of our past interviews that when you were a teen, you turned down Hocus Pocus — the most money in your life you would have been paid up to then. Instead, you took a comparative pittance for the indie film What's Eating Gilbert Grape. That film helped get you to the next level. What would you say to an up-and-coming actor who's seeing scripts that maybe are so-so but might be commercial hits and good paydays?


	The thing that I could say more than anything is that if you love this profession, if you love being an actor, you have to realize that it's a marathon, it's not a sprint. And that's not to say, “Oh, these are all pivotal choices. Don't try something commercial. Don't do this too early.” It's about the idea of looking at your career 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now, and putting those building blocks together to last. And maybe overexposure could be damaging. I think, if anything, I had somewhat of an instinct early on about overexposure. Granted, it was a different time. It was a time where I watched actors that kind of disappeared their personal life, and you didn't know much about them. It's much different now with social media. But I didn't get to know much about them except what I saw on screen.


	I got to see them build a body of great work over time, I wasn't inundated with a massive explosion of too many films by them in one or two years. That isn't to say you shouldn't take the work when it's given to you, but it's the idea of doling it out, or maybe just taking those films that have great supporting characters that are interesting and making your mark in the industry. I was very fortunate and very lucky, very early on. And like I said with Titanic, that was the real changing point, when I got to choose my own films. But until then, I did a lot of independent movies. I just went for the character that I thought was most interesting, and something that I could sink my teeth into.


	It's about the part. And sometimes even being in a movie that is massively successful — that isn't about the focus on the humanity of these characters, or about making people understand something about the human condition — you don't even get credit for. It becomes about the subject matter of the movie being successful. There are times when you can reap the rewards of that and times when you can't. But like I said, I think for young actors it is about saying, “I want to be here for a long time. I don't want to be overexposed.”

Sydney Sweeney was shining from head to toe at a New York City screening of “The Housemaid.”

The “Euphoria” alum arrived at the event in an Old Hollywood-style gown by Miu Miu with a plunging neckline and sweet bow at the empire waist.

The ivory crepe de chine dress featured silvery crystals, a delicate train and a chiffon stole with feathers, which she wore low on her arms for photographs on the event's red carpet on Tuesday evening.

Sweeney, 28, went for a retro glam look with voluminous curls around her shoulders, boldly lined eyes and shimmery pink makeup. It was a departure from the more modern beauty looks she's been sporting on this press tour: a sleek collarbone-length bob, bronze cheekbones and glossy nude, lined lips.

The actress was also photographed beside her “Housemaid” co-star, Amanda Seyfried, who wore a pink Versace gown by Dario Vitale with bold diamond necklaces and matching earrings by Tiffany & Co.

The “Christy” actress had a similar Marilyn Monroe-inspired Miu Miu moment on the Governors Awards red carpet last month, where she glowed in a vintage-style off-the-shoulder white gown with a sweetheart neckline and sequins.

In October, the “Immaculate” star wowed in a completely sheer silver gown by Christian Cowan at Variety's 2025 Power of Women event.

Earlier this week, while promoting “The Housemaid,” the actress and producer was spotted in back-to-back red outfits.

She donned a cranberry satin midi dress by Alex Perry for a taping of “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Monday, followed by a bright red custom Patou ensemble — complete with a bubble miniskirt, cropped coat and matching suede Magda Butrym boots — for dinner at The Corner Store.

The actress' latest spate of stylish outings comes amid an escalating romance with American businessman and record executive, Scooter Braun.

She was seen snuggling up to Braun, 44, in a white one-piece swimsuit in a hot tub during a Thanksgiving getaway at her Florida Keys oceanfront mansion.

Sweeney's new psychological thriller, “The Housemaid,” hits theaters on Dec. 19.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Gwyneth Paltrow admits she feels ‘alone' during the holidays with ‘Grinch' husband Brad Falchuk","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/02/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrow-admits-she-feels-alone-during-the-holidays-with-grinch-husband-brad-falchuk/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:43:00 GMT","

Gwyneth Paltrow shared that she and her husband, Brad Falchuk, have completely opposite views when it comes to enjoying the holiday season.

The actress, 53, called Falchuk a “Grinch” when it comes to the holidays, and admitted that it makes her feel “alone” since she loves Christmas.

“My husband is a little bit of a Grinch so he's the opposite,” she said on her “Goop” podcast Tuesday. “But I love the decorations, I love the Frank Sinatra Christmas album. I really get into the holiday spirit.”

“Brad is the worst,” she also said. “He hates Christmas music, he hates Christmas decorations, he hates roast turkey, like, he hates the traditional dinner.”

When asked if there's anything the “Glee” co-creator looks forward to the holiday season, she bluntly replied, “He looks forward to it being over.”

However, the Oscar-winning actress said their children share her enthusiasm for the festive season.

Paltrow shares two children with her ex-husband, British rock star Chris Martin: daughter Apple, 21, and son Moses. 19. She's also a stepmom to Falchuk's two kids from his previous marriage to Suzanne Bukinik: daughter Isabella, 21, and son Brody, 18.

‘”I feel very alone in my house in my love for Christmas, although all the kids love it, so they're on my side,” she said.

Paltrow noted that her and her children always spend the holidays together.

“We do Christmas and Hanukkah,” she shared. “We have a really fun Christmas morning. We usually take a long time to open presents and then have a long walk on the beach and, you know, eat and stay in pajamas.”

The “Shakespeare in Love” star also shared that although she's no longer married to Martin, she and her kids still celebrate Boxing Day — a UK holiday on Dec. 26.

“We also do kind of Boxing Day, which is a holdover from our days in the UK, where we just, you know, have another day of like, glorious gluttony and total relaxation and board games and stuff like that,” she said.

Back in September, Paltrow revealed a regret she had about her relationship with Falchuk, 54 — not living together during their first year of marriage for the sake of their children.

“I think at the time, we really felt like we were doing the right thing,” she said. “We were trying to kind of land the plane very, very gently and slowly and get everybody on board.”

“But I'm not sure that it didn't just prolong that thing of like, we don't know what we're doing,” she continued.

Falchuk agreed, noting their decision gave their children too much power.

“I think them having agency is really important,” he reflected. “But power, to actually keep these two adults from living together? I think it made them more uncomfortable and more like, ‘OK, this is not something that is solid.'”

Weezer bassist Scott Shriner's wife has filed for divorce just months after she was shot at by cops and booked for attempted murder.

Jillian Shriner cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their divorce in documents filed in court Tuesday, TMZ reported. 

The author also requested joint legal and physical custody of their two adopted children, who are 17 and 13 years old.

Jillian, 52, is seeking spousal support and reportedly blocked the musician, 60, from receiving it.

It is unclear if there was a date of separation listed or if there is a prenuptial agreement in place.

In April, Jillian was shot by cops after interfering with a wild police chase in Los Angeles. 

The LAPD was responding to a hit-and-run on the freeway near Eagle Rock neighborhood after three suspects fled the scene and headed toward a residential neighborhood.

The police quickly barricaded off the area, however, a woman, later identified as Jillian, exited her home with a handgun. 

She was told several times by law enforcement to drop her weapon but refused, pointing her gun toward police. Cops subsequently shot her and she ran into her home.

Jillian was taken into custody and booked for attempted murder, then taken to a nearby hospital where she was treated for her non-life-threating wounds. 

A month prior, Jillian revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer.

“Yes, I have a little bit of the C word y'all. I know a lot of us do,” she shared on social media at the time. 

“I'm here to thank the incredible oncology team here, who pulled me through a complicated operation without a hitch,” she added. “I am always so grateful for every second of the compassionate and excellent medical care I receive in my life.”

Jillian and the rocker tied the knot in 2005.

Amy Schumer poked fun at her and Chris Fischer's marital woes after sharing pictures without her wedding ring.

The comedian, who Page Six revealed on Tuesday has “zero chance” of salvaging her marriage, reminded her social media followers that she never wears the bauble.

“Last time I wore jewelry,” the actress, 44, captioned a 2007 photo from “Last Comic Standing” via Instagram Stories Wednesday.

In the shot, Schumer smiled while sporting a chunky turquoise necklace.

The “Trainwreck” star similarly wrote in a since-deleted post on Monday that she “never ever wear[s] jewelry.”

“Whatever ends up happening with me and Chris has nothing to do with weight loss or autism,” the Emmy winner wrote, respectively referencing her 50-pound slimdown and Fischer's 2019 diagnosis.

“Fingers crossed we make it through,” she continued. “He's the best.”

The couple tied the knot in February 2018, three months after Schumer's relationship with the chef made headlines.

The pair welcomed son Gene, now 6, in May of the following year.

When speculation swirled in November that Schumer and Fischer were on the rocks, the Golden Globe winner's rep insisted to People that the duo is “committed” to each other.

“They're privately working through normal issues that couples in long-term marriages have,” the spokesperson said at the time.

On Tuesday, a source told Page Six, “They've been having issues for ages and my understanding is all they are doing now is working out a conscious uncoupling plan.

“Amy also wants to have the most amicable co-parenting relationship possible with Chris, so they are sorting out what will work best,” the insider explained.

Schumer appeared to confirm in February that she and Fischer, 45, signed a prenuptial agreement when they wed, jokingly celebrating their seventh anniversary as another year without having “to utilize it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Like Daniel Plainview, Quentin Tarantino drags Paul Dano","https://www.avclub.com/quentin-tarantino-paul-dano-there-will-be-blood","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:32:00 GMT","

Few directors have a gulf between opinion and talent like Quentin Tarantino. And yet, because of his encyclopedic knowledge of grindhouse cinema, his willingness to bury a famous person, and his ability to make some of the best American films of the last 40 years, we can't help but listen to him go off on whatever is stuck in his craw. This is the guy who said on a podcast that Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins should be sued for ripping off Battle Royale, as if he never ripped off a movie before—let alone Battle Royale. Nevertheless, on that same podcast— unfortunately, the Bret Easton Ellis Podcast—Tarantino took an even bigger swing: Paul Dano's performance in There Will Be Blood as Paul and Eli Sunday. Not only does Mr. Tarantino believe Dano is “weak sauce,” but he also believes Dano is “the weakest fucking actor in SAG.”

To be clear, he had wonderful things to say about the film, Daniel Day-Lewis' star turn, and director Paul Thomas Anderson's “old Hollywood craftsmanship without trying to be like that.” The movie would even “stand a good chance at being [his] number one or number two” favorite film of the 21st century, “if it didn't have a big, giant flaw in it.”

“The flaw is Paul Dano. Obviously, it's supposed to be a two-hander, but it's also drastically obvious that it's not a two-hander. [Dano] is weak sauce, man. He is the weak sister.” After drinking all of Dano's milkshake, Tarantino says he would've preferred Austin Butler in the role because “[Dano] is just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy. The weakest fucking actor in SAG.”

We respectfully disagree with Mr. Tarantino. Part of Day-Lewis' strength comes from having a screen partner like Dano. Dano offers the film a different register and menace, one that contrasts Day-Lewis' Daniel Plainview, helping the Oscar-winner reach the film's greatest heights. But again, at the end of the day, these are all just one person's opinions. In the same interview, while naming Midnight In Paris the 10th best movie of the century (another wild take), he also swiped at Owen Wilson, whom he “really can't stand.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Lots of people are still watching Stranger Things","https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-five-netflix-viewership","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 04:07:00 GMT","

People love their Stranger Things, and despite the show being off the air since 2022, Netflix's flagship series is enjoying what the streamer declared the biggest premiere-week viewership for an English-language Netflix series ever. That's a lot of qualifiers for a lot of viewers. Netflix reports that the first five days of Stranger Things season five amassed 59.6 million views worldwide. Variety notes that's a 171% increase from season four, which only netted 22 million views—though that was in three days, not five. Distance really does make the heart grow fonder for Eggos.

Of course, these aren't numbers from an independent tabulator. The numbers come from Netflix, which stands to benefit from keeping an expensive show high in its top 10 carousel. Right now, in a first for Netflix, all five seasons of the show are on the streamer's global top 10, surrounding Kevin Hart's new stand-up special, Acting My Age, the second-most-watched show on Netflix worldwide. Honestly, we thought Hart only did gambling commercials these days, but he racked up 10.3 million hours this week, which seems like a lot until you consider Stranger Things 5 had 284 million. However, if an hour-long comedy special earned that many hours of viewership, we'd be very concerned about the state of the global psyche or Netflix's process.

Nevertheless, the self-report confirms what many of us long assumed: Lots of people are still watching Stranger Things, despite how much it also seems like people are complaining about it. Still, it's not the best premiere-week viewership ever. That title belongs to Squid Game seasons two and three.

After surviving non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma last year, Full House's Uncle Joey, Dave Coulier, revealed earlier today that he was diagnosed with a second, “totally unrelated” form of cancer. Appearing on Today, Coulier says doctors discovered P16 squamous carcinoma at the base of his tongue during a routine check-up in October. He'll undergo 35 rounds of radiation through December 31. Coulier explains that the cancer “could stem from having an HPV virus up to 30 years ago.” HPV is very common and his “activated and turned into a carcinoma.”

Last November, Coulier announced that he was diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He underwent chemotherapy, John Stamos took that bald cap picture, and in March 2025, he announced that he was cancer-free, per Variety. As noted, Coulier won't be undergoing chemo for his latest cancer. “We're going to start radiation immediately,” he explained. “It's a whole different animal than chemo. It doesn't feel as aggressive, but there are still side effects.”

Coulier says that early detection saved his life in both cases, reassuring fans that this new cancer has a “90% curability rate.” The Full House star says, “The thing that has really saved my life is that early detection saved my life, not just the first time but the second time as well. So I hope you're getting your check-ups. I hope you get your colonoscopies and breast exams and prostate exams, they will save your life.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Amazon's AI anime dubbing fiasco reminds us that voice actors are severely undervalued","https://www.avclub.com/amazon-ai-anime-dubbing-voice-acting-issues","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

As the love affair between generative AI and business executives continues, Amazon delivered another preview of the artless future these suits seem to be salivating for: over the weekend, Prime Video uploaded AI-generated English and Spanish-language dubbing for the anime Banana Fish, No Game No Life 0, and Vinland Saga.

Unsurprisingly, they sounded positively awful. The English-language “voice acting” in particular had the kind of flat intonation and robotic delivery that could easily outdo the most wooden of Razzie winners, robbing all dialogue of its dramatic heft—the word “BETA” is slapped under the AI menu option like a tacit admission that the feature is not very good. The people pushing this rollout clearly didn't understand or care about just how lifeless it sounds, as if the script were fed into a basic text-to-speech reader with no sense of intonation or timing. The response on social media was appropriately brutal, and even the grok-lovers of the world largely sat this losing battle out.

And while there is some warped logic to subjecting Banana Fish and No Game No Life 0 to this treatment, given their lack of existing English dubs, this generally bad choice made even less sense for Vinland Saga. On top of sullying one of the best anime in recent memory, this move was particularly egregious because the show already has not one but two dub tracks that Amazon, a $2.5 trillion corporation, is apparently too cheap to license.

Thankfully, the company did eventually budge. In response to the backlash, it took down its English-language dubs for the previously mentioned anime earlier today, but left the similarly bad Spanish-language ones up. It seems a bit of a short-term victory; it's probably fair to assume Amazon is going back to the drawing board to try and make the feature work “better” rather than backing away from AI because of its significant environmental impact, ethical concerns around labor, and the widespread theft needed to make it work.

This isn't the first time Amazon has used AI dubbing, either. Back in March, it announced that 12 licensed titles without English or Latin American Spanish dubs would be getting the robo-voice treatment, such as El Cid: La Leyenda, which is still using its English language AI-assisted dub. The company attempted to justify the move by pointing out that these films and shows wouldn't have dubs otherwise, which again is a flimsy excuse considering it's sitting on a pile of gold.

While at first glance these choices seem entirely tied to the ongoing AI bubble and the out-of-control decisions tech companies are making in its wake, these events unfortunately also connect to more longstanding issues around how English-language voice actors for anime (and other media) have been treated.

Back in 2022, the anime streaming service Crunchyroll refused to renew its contract with Kyle McCarley, who voiced the main character in the popular (and, incidentally, very good) series Mob Psycho 100. The reason? He was a member of SAG-AFTRA. For those unaware, the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) is the main labor union for film and TV actors in the U.S., representing over 160,000 performers, including voice actors. Through collective bargaining, it helps secure better wages and working conditions for its members (because that's how unions work).

After merging with Funimation at the behest of its new parent company, Sony, Crunchyroll continued its hard anti-union stance to the point that it opted not to work with McCarley, even though it would be paying him less under the union contract than under the one it had offered him. We can only speculate here, as Crunchyroll has never stated why it's so anti-union, but, as with most cases of union busting, it's probably because it fears losing absolute control over its employees and wants to avoid “wage cuts” (aka, less plundering) for those at the top of the organizational chart. While Netflix works exclusively with SAG-AFTRA members for its dubs, and Aniplex (which is also owned by Sony) sometimes works with union members, Crunchyroll leadership remains dead set against it.

Looking at the broader picture of how anime voice actors have been treated makes it all the more clear why union representation is a must. For instance, voice actor Anairis Quiñones revealed on social media that she was paid a flat rate of only $150 with no royalties for her performance as Rika Orimoto in Jujutsu Kaisen 0. For context, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a film prequel to one of the biggest ongoing anime series. The movie raked in over $191 million worldwide and over $34 million domestically. On top of this, Rika is one of the film's primary characters. Crunchyroll handled the North American release of the film, which came out around the same time it was refusing to work with Kyle McCarley because he was a union member.

This low pay isn't a one-off, and many voice actors have described similar circumstances. Performers frequently rely on appearances at conventions to make ends meet, with voice actor Ben Diskin stating in an interview with In These Times that it's like being “a waiter in a restaurant who relies on tips,” and that this “transfers the responsibility of paying the actors from the people who actually make money off of these projects to the fans,” which ​“is really unfair.”

Even setting aside the various moral reasons for why people should be appropriately compensated for their work, poor working conditions for voice actors often result in poor output. Bad pay forces people into other lines of work, draining the talent pool while making it hard for existing talent to hone their skills.

This is a big deal because no matter where someone stands on the never-ending anime nerd debate of “subs vs. dubs,” the reality is that a large percentage of audiences would like to watch TV in their native language; many English speakers simply won't watch a show if they have to read subtitles, which is a big part of why most of the most popular series are dubbed. Because of this, dubbing is one of the first potential barriers for general audiences getting into anime, with good performances convincing viewers of a character's motivations to pull them into the world, while bad ones take them out of it. Frankly, it takes skilled line readings to get around what's been lost in translation from the original script or to sell some of the aggressively earnest dialogue found in many of these shows.

Sure, Amazon has backed away from AI dubbing for now, but between poor compensation and anti-union sentiment, North American anime localizations have consistently demonstrated how little they value the important work that voice actors do, making it fair to assume that we haven't seen the last of these abominable AI “performances.”

While the AI protections in SAG-AFTRA contracts may discourage Netflix and Aniplex in the short term, Amazon is still using AI dubbing for certain shows in languages other than English. YouTube has deployed a similarly nightmarish AI interpreter that is particularly good at delivering jump scares when its uncanny voice suddenly begins translating non-English language videos without prompting. Meanwhile, although Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini walked back how much the company would use AI in the “creative process” following backlash, it seems plausible that the industry at large is simply waiting until the technology potentially improves or becomes less controversial before pursuing it more wholeheartedly.

Still, there's a bright side to this seemingly dismal situation: Amazon made a damn convincing argument for why this technology doesn't work for voice acting. What better illustration of gen AI's empty facsimile of humanity than a performance with all the soul of an answering machine? At least for now, few seem convinced this is a good idea except those at the top of the corporate hierarchy. Let's hope it stays that way, because if general audiences accept this change, then the battle is truly lost.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sorry, Tilly Norwood, James Cameron says that there's no generative AI on Pandora","https://www.avclub.com/james-cameron-avatar-fire-and-ash-no-generative-ai","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 01:14:00 GMT","

Pour one out for AI actress Tilly Norwood's team because Tilly ain't getting a part in the next Avatar. Making the media rounds for Avatar: Fire And Ash, director James Cameron is making sure everyone knows that he did not use generative AI in the making of the latest Avatar. Over the weekend, he appeared on CBS Sunday Mornings to declare “AI actresses” like Tilly, “horrifying.” We guess he hasn't seen the video Elon Musk made of a collection of ones and zeroes saying, “I will always love you.” However, Cameron isn't going full-on “fuck AI” mode like he directed a Netflix movie or something. Speaking to ComicBook.com, Cameron explains that he didn't use generative AI for Avatar: Fire And Ash to protect his actors.

“I just wanted to point out we don't use it on the Avatar films,” Cameron says. “We honor and celebrate actors. We don't replace actors. That's going to find its level. I think Hollywood will be self-policing on that. We'll find our way through that. But we can only find our way through it as artists if we exist. So it's the existential threat from big AI that worries me more than all that stuff.”

Still, he's “not negative about generative AI” probably because he sits on the board of Stability AI, the creators of Stable Diffusion, an open-source image generator. He's more concerned about the existential threat of “big AI,” which has kept Cameron awake at night for decades. More than 40 years after The Terminator, “Skynet has become self-aware” remains the go-to for anyone looking to criticize the out-of-control SPAM-generating, plagiarism-machines currently propping up the U.S. economy. He continues:

“They call it the ‘Skynet Problem,' and it's being discussed. But obviously, what they're talking about is alignment. If you're hip to general intelligence issues and AI overall, alignment is a big issue. And they have to be trained, they have to be taught, they have to be constrained so that they work only toward human good. The problem is, who makes that decision? Who decides what's good for us? We can't agree amongst ourselves on a damn thing. All religions are at odds over ethics, morality, and so on. All the governments have different [ideas], so whose morality, whose sense of what's best for us, is going to prevail?”

We're going to assume that James Cameron thinks James Cameron is best equipped to make these decisions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Deal the Chiefs President Made With Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift","https://entertainmentnow.com/taylor-swift/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-donavan-promise/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 07:34:55 GMT","

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, who recently got engaged, started dating in the summer of 2023, which caused a stir amongst dedicated fans of the Grammy-winner and the NFL alike. Kansas City Chief's president, Mark Donavan, opened up about the promise he made to Kelce in the early days of their relationship.

Swift and Kelce were dating for two years before getting engaged. 

The pair met after Kelce revealed that he tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at one of her concerts on The Eras Tour, but he was unsuccessful. 

“I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” said Kelce to his brother Jason Kelce, his podcast co-host.

Still, Kelce declared his interest in the singer on his “New Heights” podcast in July 2023, and they started dating soon after.

In September 2023, Swift made a surprise appearance at Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs game. She was seen watching the game from Kelce's suite with his mother Donna.

Kelce addressed Swift's appearance at his game during a podcast episode on September 27. “I'm enjoying life and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend,” he said. “Shout out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy.”

Kelce continued, “I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her — the friends and family. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light.”

On October 1, Swift attended one of Kelce's games as his team faced off against the New York Jets. The singer brought along a handful of her celebrity friends for the game.

In November 2023, Kelce was seen dancing and singing along at one of Swift's shows on The Eras Tour with the singer's dad. During the show, Swift gave Kelce a shout-out as she changed the lyrics of her final song “Karma” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.” 

After the Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens during the AFC Championship Game and secured their spot in the Super Bowl in January 2024, Swift joined Kelce on the field to celebrate. She also supported him at the Super Bowl in February. 

In June 2024, the couple went Instagram official, and Kelce also joined Swift on stage during one of her Eras Tour shows.

A year later in June 2025, the pair made their red carpet debut together.

“I owe a lot to this podcast. This podcast got me a boyfriend ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago,” Swift said during her August 13 appearance on New Heights.

On August 26, 2025, Swift and Kelce announced they were engaged in a joint Instagram post.

“Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” Swift captioned the post.

“I told Travis, ‘Look, we are going to treat you and your relationship with the same respect that we treat any other player or coach's relationship,'” Mark said on the Up and Adams Show December 1, where he opened up about the promise he made to Kelce. “It's a relationship. We're not going to monetize it. We're not going to go out there and go crazy.”

Donavan praised the Arrowhead Stadium staff for keeping Kelce and Swift's romance low-key, while other broadcasts made a point to continuously show shots of the singer during games.

“For a couple of years, all those shots you see of Taylor in the stadium—he scores a touchdown, he makes a catch, it goes to Taylor, especially the first year.” Mark explained. “We never showed Taylor on our big boards in our stadium, never. It was respectful. We're not going to do that.”

“We're not taking advantage of this relationship,” he emphasized, even going on to joke that they “never played a Taylor Swift song in the stadium” when she was in the building. 

“Travis, to his credit, is all about team and he's all about the guys and he's all about being part of a team and not being separate,” Mark continued. “And he said, ‘That separates me… When we're playing a game. When we're in that stadium, it's about us. And I want it to be about us,'”

“Taylor's been amazing to us,” Mark concluded, referring to Swift's mutual respect for Kelce's team. “It's been nothing but good. She is a phenomenon. She is just a special kind of person.”

That is the way it should be for not exposing her there but sometimes I just feel that the Kansas City Chiefs are not doing well this year. I hope it's not because of Travis finding his soulmate and that I feel that the Chiefs are feeling some stardust in them! I have always been a fan of Kansas City when Mahomes was the starting quarterback and he really has a very good talent.

“The Valley” star Kristen Doute is asking fans for prayers in a touching Instagram Stories post.

Doute shared an image of her German Shepard dog, Jill, on Monday, Dec. 1, with the simple caption, “pray for Jill.”

Though she didn't state what was wrong with her adorable pooch, she added another video of Jill with her fiancé, Luke Broderick. The video showed Broderick petting Jill, along with the couple's other animals.

Broderick reposted the image of Jill and added his own message on the post. “She's a tough [expletive], but it's in God's hands now.”

Prior to welcoming her daughter Kaia, Doute told The Daily Dish how Jill doesn't leave her side.

“Since the second I was pregnant, she's had her head on my stomach,” the “Vanderpump Rules” alum said about Jill.

The 42-year-old added, “It's crazy because I was hoping to get one of those Instagram videos where the dog has the head on the stomach and then the baby kicks and you see the dog's reaction. And she doesn't react. So, I think she just knows.”

She added how Jill has always been protective of the reality TV star.

“She's very, very protective of me, though. She doesn't like strangers coming near me or talking to me… She knows, for sure,” she concluded.

She added at the time how her Yorkie named Gibson couldn't care less about her pregancy.

 “I try to show him there's a baby right here and point to my stomach, and he thinks I'm talking about his toy that we call baby,” she said. “So, he just has no idea.”

The Bravo star has long been a longtime vegetarian and will often share sweet moments with her animals on social media.

On Instagram, Doute has a saved Highlights section that is devoted to her animals and all of their cute moments together. 

She experienced heartache in May of 2024 when her Beagle/chihuahua mix Bowie passed away.

“Our last photo together,” she wrote on the picture of Bowie on the couch. “Rest in peace, paradise, and everything your puppy dreams are made of. I love you so much, sweet boy. You know what's true? You saved me[,] so I was lucky to also save you.”

At the time, she said on her podcast that she shares with Broderick, how her friends were very supportive after hearing the news about Bowie.



Kristin is my favorite. She's honest with her cast of selfish friends and has matured right in front of our eyes. So happy you have a girl. Your future best friend.

Regé-Jean Page will return to television as the lead of the upcoming Netflix thriller “Hancock Park,” the streamer confirmed to outlets including People and E! News. The role marks Page's first major TV project since he left the hit series “Bridgerton,” which launched him to international fame.

Netflix described the show as an erotic thriller that follows a mysterious outsider whose arrival disrupts a wealthy family living in one of Los Angeles' most exclusive neighborhoods. Early details indicate the series will explore themes of power, secrecy, and obsession.

Deadline reported that Page will also executive produce the series. Matthew Barry, known for writing “The Guest” and working on “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” will serve as the show's writer.

People reported that the story begins when a “dangerously charismatic outsider” rents the guest house behind a prominent family's estate in Hancock Park. As he becomes part of their daily lives, tension grows inside the household. His presence exposes fractures in the family and threatens the image they have maintained for years.

Variety reported that the series will combine psychological drama with a dark, contemporary atmosphere. The tone signals a shift for Page, who rose to fame playing a romantic lead but has since moved into grittier, more action-driven roles.

“Hancock Park” will be produced by Page's company, A Mighty Stranger, along with Emily Brown and Drew Comins for Fifth Season. According to Deadline, Netflix acquired the series after a competitive bidding process.

Page became a global breakout star as the Duke of Hastings in the first season of “Bridgerton.” His exit from the show sparked large fan reaction and speculation about his next move. He has since focused on film, including “The Gray Man,” “Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” and the spy drama “Black Bag.”

Industry analysts told Variety that “Hancock Park” offers Page an opportunity to take on a more complex, layered role and return to serialized storytelling. The project also fits Netflix's recent interest in adult-focused thrillers.

Netflix has not announced additional cast members or a release date. Production plans and filming locations remain under wraps.

For viewers who have followed Page's career since his breakout, “Hancock Park” could mark a defining turn. If the series delivers the tension and style described in early reports, Page may return to the spotlight with one of his most compelling performances yet.

Ready or not, the sequel to the 2019 cult horror-comedy hit is on its way.

“Ready or Not 2: Here I Come” follows up Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett's kill-the-rich, “Most Dangerous Game”-inspired satire starring Samara Weaving as a new bride being hunted by her in-laws at their family's posh estate.

Joining Weaving in the ensemble are Kathryn Newton, plus horror movie icons Sarah Michelle Gellar and Elijah Wood. Shawn Hatosy (“The Pitt”), Néstor Carbonell (“The Dark Knight”), Kevin Durand (“Abigail,” also from the Radio Silence team), and David Cronenberg also join the ensemble.

 










Here's the official synopsis courtesy of Searchlight Pictures: “Moments after surviving an all-out attack from the Le Domas family, Grace (Samara Weaving) discovers she's reached the next level of the nightmarish game — and this time with her estranged sister Faith (Kathryn Newton) at her side. Grace has one chance to survive, keep her sister alive, and claim the High Seat of the Council that controls the world. Four rival families are hunting her for the throne, and whoever wins rules it all.”

We knew Weaving's character Grace survived the attacks of the last film, as the original ended with the iconic image of her blood-stained and disheveled on the manor's steps, smoking a cigarette while it all burns down around her. Now, in this trailer, she's being hunted again alongside her sister, with Wood and Gellar at the head of the clan. “Here I Come” looks like another gore-splattered, over-the-top violent ride from the Radio Silence team.

Filmmakers Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett direct the sequel. It's written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murray, and produced by Tripp Vinson, James Vanderbilt, William Sherak, and Bradley J. Fischer.

The 2019 original film grossed more than $57 million worldwide on a budget of only $6 million, another indicator of horror-comedies' box office potential.

“Ready or Not 2: Here I Come” heads to theaters from Searchlight Pictures in Spring 2026.

If it's the first Wednesday in December, a certain segment of the headphone-wearing and AirPod-toting culturati are most likely frantically logging into their Spotify accounts to see the results of their year of listening. Spotify's annual Wrapped feature, the stuff of endless social media shares (if, of course, your Wrapped is cool enough to share) arrives this morning. With it? Not just the cold, hard numbers on how much Taylor Swift you're listening to each day (it's a lot, we all know it), but some keen insights into other kinds of audio consumption. 

 










For the first time, this year's Wrapped will include audiobooks (the streamer launched its audiobooks platform in 2023 and Spotify Premium users in the U.S. currently have access to 15 hours of monthly listening time to a catalog of more than 500,000 audiobooks as part of their premium subscription). And while it's no surprise that book to screen adaptations are big business in the film and TV world, the audiobooks sector is also seeing some major upticks as of late.

Spotify has discovered (and shared exclusively with IndieWire) that the amount of book to screen adaptations that fall into their most streamed audiobook lists is quite impressive, as more than 60 of the top 100 audiobooks in Spotify Premium this year have either been greenlit or already adapted for the screen.




			Popular on IndieWire		






Top-performing titles include the “Fourth Wing” series from Rebecca Yarros (the first book in the series is this year's Global Top Audiobook in Premium), “The Wedding People” by Alison Espach, “Quicksilver” by Callie Hart, thrillers from Freida McFadden like “The Housemaid” and “The Tenant,” and popular romance audiobooks like “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,” “Atmosphere,” and “Funny Story.”

“The surge in book-to-screen adaptations has reignited interest in stories across formats, and we're seeing that reflected in audiobook listening on Spotify as users look for ways to dive deeper,” Rebecca McGuire, Spotify Audiobooks Partnerships and Licensing, told IndieWire. “As more listeners discover these titles, we're evolving our strategy to spotlight the narratives shaping cultural moments — leaning into discovery, playlists, and editorial levers that help shape what people are talking about. Spotify has always been a platform where culture moves, and audiobooks are becoming a powerful part of that.”

 










And listeners, readers, and likely viewers aren't just streaming audiobooks before a series or film drops, they're also going all-in once those adaptations arrive. Spotify found that their audiobook streams see major upticks in listeners in the weeks after premieres. Streams of May Cobb's “The Hunting Wives” spiked 609 percent after the Netflix premiere of the series, while Lois Duncan's “I Know What You Did Last Summer” jumped 521 percent after the Sony sequel hit theaters.

Also of note: the sheer number of users trying audiobooks for the first time. Per Spotify, in 2025, more than 50 percent of eligible Spotify Premium users tried an audiobook (many for the first time), and the streamer now has more than 500,000 audiobooks available to listen to with Spotify Premium subscriptions.

2026 is shaping up to be a great year for Midwestern moviegoers. The Music Box Theatre, Chicago's movie palace that has been entertaining the Windy City since 1929, has announced major expansion plans that will see the venue expand its own facilities and taking stewardship of another iconic cinema, Minneapolis' The Heights Theater. 

The Heights opened in 1926 and has been a fixture of Minneapolis ever since with traditions like its annual Celebration of Cinema festival and Christmas and New Year's Day screenings of “White Christmas” and “Holiday Inn.” The Music Box Theatre's longtime owners Brody Sheldon and the Schopf family will take over operations of the venue in 2026 following a short transition period. The Heights will close briefly beginning on January 2nd as it transitions to new ownership before reopening with Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” on Friday, January 9. The theater's programming slate will be expanded, with late night Friday and Saturday night screenings, children's matinees, and regular silent film programming with live organ accompaniment coming in 2026.

“The Heights has always been about celebrating great films with great people,” said outgoing Heights owner Tom Letness, who has operated the theater for 27 years. “I'm thrilled to pass it on to Music Box Theatre, whose passion for cinema and commitment to presentation match what I've built here.”

“We're honored to continue the legacy Tom cultivated,” said Music Box general manager Ryan Oestreich.  “The Heights is a sacred space for discovery, laughter, and community — and we're excited to expand its programming while preserving everything audiences love.” 

A renovation beginning in summer 2026 will also see the Music Box add a third auditorium that will seat 100 people. In addition to its original 700 seat theater, the venue also includes a second 70 seat theater that opened in 1991 and renovated in 2013.

This news comes after the Music Box Theatre was previously announced as the new home of Beyond Fest Chicago, the first regional expansion of the popular Los Angeles genre festival Beyond Fest. The inaugural Chicago event is set to take place from April 2-5 2026, offering Chicago cinephiles a weekend of genre programming that highlights both major national names and Midwest-based filmmakers.

Lately, it seems we just can't get enough of the 2000s. We're singing “Von Dutch” and bootlegging trucker hats. We're taking bathroom selfies on digicams. We're going out in low-rise jeans, yearning for an era of clubbing before smartphones. It's within this collective flashback that the Deep emerges, decked out in sequined tank tops and Jeremy Scott teddy-bear sneakers. For the South Korean hyperpop singer-songwriter and producer, the mission is to get loud and get down, the good old fashioned way and then some. KPOP B!TCH, the Deep's debut, evokes the glamour of a naughty-aughties night out: fast car rides, VIP bottle service, dancefloor makeouts, and buzzing phones (one can almost hear the pink Motorola Razr snapping shut). She tells the story using the stock phrases of 2000s club anthems: rock your body, take it off, turn it up. She even tells you to “check my swag.”

Production credits include hyperpop heavy-hitters Dorian Electra, kimj, and atlgrandma, and in a bid to engineer the most unforgettable rager, the party props the door open to all genres: You'll catch whiffs of 2nd-generation K-pop groups like SNSD and SHINee, early PC Music releases, how i'm feeling now–era Charli XCX, UK garage, and, of course, the requisite 2000s club pop and EDM (an acronym which the Deep creatively reinterprets as “Everyone Deserves a Moment”). The night-out magnetism shines in the zooming highway synths that race through “BEEP BEEP,” a bouncy synth-pop track you can imagine blasting in your Uber to the club; it soars in the helium-toned, Hannah Diamond–esque chorus of “Lucky Star,” and it bumps and grinds in the sultry “Gimme More” bassline of “SOLO.”

The album falters most in its EDM offerings, which tend to land with the queasy feeling of 3 a.m. Jack in the Box. Though streaked with the traces of electro-pop scenesters like 3OH!3 and Breathe Carolina, KPOP B!TCH fails to hit the same euphoric heights. “I Hate Silence” is a choose-your-own-adventure of a song that veers between the boing-splat bass of early SOPHIE, the supersaw synths of festival EDM, and a final brostep-y breakdown. Bogged down by all these possibilities, it never quite manages to commit to any. The ripping synth basses and drumroll beat drops of the title track—which features a Frost Children production credit—sound like a bastardized, deep-fried Chainsmokers song. It's too smirky and self-aware to exist as a guilty pleasure, yet not clever enough to feel experimental. It mostly ends up being annoying.

If certain tracks fail because they feel like vacant attempts at maximalism and 2000s nostalgia, the Deep shines when she makes room for her own breezy fantasy of club music. “Birthday” is a standout: Twinkly, featherlight hyperpop production meets the racing heartbeat of garage breakbeats and the Deep's perfectly saccharine chirp of “I love you”; the whole song feels like a delicious molly high, where everything is made of love and diamonds. The exuberant “Wrong Number” builds and builds until it explodes in a chorus of compressed, pixellated vocals—and while many songs on KPOP B!TCH could plausibly play at the club, it's the rare track with the energy to turn wherever you are into the club. KPOP B!TCH's best songs channel the kind of overstimulation and excess you won't even want to remember the morning after.

December 3, 2025

De La Soul have long been the kings of hip-hop playfulness. Fun and mischief-making have been at the core of the trio's operation since the days they had fans counting the feathers on a Perdue chicken's ass. It was baked into their early beats, sonic Jenga towers constructed by Prince Paul and the trio themselves, stacked with dozens of samples from Schoolhouse Rock to Otis Redding and Funkadelic. Even at their most aggrieved, thumbing their noses at critics and wack MCs or reluctantly shaking hands with music industry devils, they planted their tongues deeply in cheek and had airhorns ready to blare. Their perpetual thesis always returns to how whatever issues they've faced—as Afrocentric outsiders unafraid to get buck, as abstract lyricists attempting to grow while caught in a 34-year bout of sample-clearance hell—could be spun into a roller-skateable hip-hop wonderland.

On Cabin in the Sky, their 10th album and first in nearly a decade, they attempt to jump their most difficult hurdle yet. “Cabin Talk” opens the album with a skit in typical fashion: Actor Giancarlo Esposito plays the host of a conference exploring “perceptions of life and the hereafter” who does a role call for every featured producer and vocalist on the album, ending with the DayGlo trio. Naturally, Posdnuos and DJ Maseo sound off, but Esposito lingers on Dave, the one missing voice in the room. Dave, formerly known as Trugoy the Dove, passed away in 2023, weeks before the trio's first four albums were made available on streaming services after decades of rights issues and, it seems, in the early stages of this album's creation; out of its 20 tracks, he has only six rapped verses. Cabin has plenty of tears to shed and grown-man reflection to undergo, but unlike 2016's And the Anonymous Nobody…, which generally skewed gloomy and portentous, this full-length tribute to Dave doubles as a Real Hip-Hop repast as colorful and weightless as the cloud-faced deities striding across its cover.

De La's views on death avoid overt negativity, leaning closer toward the phantasmagoria of Flying Lotus' You're Dead! than the morbid pondering pervading the late Prodigy's verses on Mobb Deep's Infinite, a fellow entry in Mass Appeal's New York-centric Legend Has It series. Per usual, the group's love for mini-narratives can sometimes clutter the music and cause an interesting idea to outstay its welcome—the three-track run from “Just How It Is (Sometimes)” to “Day in the Sun (Gettin' Wit U)” doesn't need skits stitching the songs together when they're already similarly themed. But the overall mood is agreeably potluck, a diverse spread of beats and rhymes to nourish the soul. The Pos-produced “Will Be” turns an interpolation of the Natalie Cole classic “This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)” into a disco jam reminiscent of the De La Soul Is Dead cut “A Roller Skating Jam Named ‘Saturdays'.” Other references to De La lore abound, ramping up the celebration: The orchestral medley during the outro of “YUHDONTSTOP” includes little flashes of “Me, Myself, and I” and “Stakes Is High.” During his sweltering guest verse on “EN EFF,” Black Thought adopts the rhyme scheme Dave uses on his first verse from “Stakes Is High,” with complaints about blunts and Versace glasses swapped out for passport bros and “half-assed hip-hop flows.”

That's not to say things don't get heavy occasionally. Cabin in the Sky is guided by a loose concept involving the titular houses where loved ones stay after they pass on. Pos often grapples with the loneliness and selfishness brought on by Dave's absence, a wound he's aware will never fully heal. “It's like we lost a limb to gain a win,” he says frankly on “Different World” before fully playing devil's advocate: “I know you're providing us with warmth/But I'd rather you here with us, fighting through the cold.” On the title track, he weighs the loss of Dave against recently celebrating his father's 90th birthday and reckons how his own family will deal with eventually “[watching] me slip away.” The grace of God and embrace of the divine are more prevalent here than on any other De La album, no doubt inspired by wrestling with mortality, yet the atmosphere remains nondenominational.

Stress also comes through in the way Pos, for the first time in his career, is asked to shoulder the bulk of an album by himself. Part of the group's appeal was the interplay between its vocalists' clashing brands of observational whimsy: Dave's smart-ass baritone versus Pos' grounded tenor, both of which frequently birthed beguiling turns of phrase. Pos' banal abstractions are still fascinating and his flows are limber, but the OG dynamic is sorely missed, especially after hearing the handful of tracks where he and Dave do spit together. “The Package,” for example, is classic De La—Dave dropping gems like “Be mouse humble if you're two crumbs up” and Pos claiming their style will get you higher than gospel or weed pens, all while Pete Rock's swinging Impressions sample adds just the right pastel touch. Otherwise, much of Cabin plays like a modern version of 2004's The Grind Date. If you've been hungry for De La's takes on internet dating and navigating misinformation through nursery-rhyme melodies, you've come to the right place.

The production is uniformly warm and vibrant, and the list of beatmakers is bound to give any East Coast rap fan bouts of the itis: Pete Rock and DJ Premier are the marquee names, and their offerings, from Rock's sprightly full-bodied flips of classic soul records to Premier's trademark DJ cuts over drum breaks and loops, scratch that traditionalist hip-hop itch like no other. They're joined by other luminaries like Seattle's Jake One and Virginia's Nottz, but it's longtime collaborator Supa Dave West, with five credits across the album, who does the most to shape Cabin's technicolor vibes. West's gospel background consistently shines through, snapping percussion and golden instrumental arrangements tumbling down from on high. The drums, organs, bass, and synths on the title track all stagger-step around each other, creating a lurching beat primed for the pearly gates. “Good Health” and “Day in the Sun (Gettin' Wit U)” respectively use maximal and minimal approaches to sun-soaked boom-bap that rattle with urgency and chirp with budding love. It has the pastel looseness of Buhloone Mindstate but is crisp and handsomely engineered.

De La have been watched over by several affiliates with their own cabins in the sky over the years, from Native Tongues brother Phife Dawg and superproducer J Dilla to singer Don Newkirk and Pos' own mother, but Dave's passing fundamentally changes the group forever. Three plugs is now two. Hearing Dave's happy-go-lucky story of lust turning into love on closer “Don't Push Me” is a bittersweet reminder that he's gone but also affirms De La's eternal sense of play. “Cindy said ‘If y'all stop, then Dave stops',” Pos says of Dave's sister on “YUHDONTSTOP,” the mission tough but clear. Cabin in the Sky is a massive reorientation point for a group that's already been through several. Change can be messy, they seem to say, but when you have this many loved ones ensuring a smooth transition, it's hard not to smile at it all.

	“Does this look like a man who is showing signs of fatigue?” Jimmy Kimmel asked the audience during his show's Tuesday monologue, before rolling footage of Donald Trump appearing to doze off during a cabinet meeting at the White House earlier in the day. As various cabinet officials lauded the president and touted the administration, Trump seemingly struggled to keep his eyes open.


	“Tell us again how sleepy Joe is, will you?” mocked Kimmel, who then remarked on Trump's furious social media spree the night before: “Of course, he's tired. He was up all night posting when he wasn't sleeping.” Across 160 posts on Truth Social, Trump managed to promote conspiracy theories, lament over his foes, and heap praise upon himself and First Lady Melania Trump. “Do you know how long you have to be on the toilet to post that much? I mean, what is he eating?” joked Kimmel. “I guess his little thumbs gave out and he came down the hall for another all-star cabinet meeting — Trump's hand-picked orange-nosers gathered to pay tribute to dear leader and to suckle upon his ample teat.”

	After rolling more footage of Trump appearing to hold it together before his cabinet, Kimmel mockingly added, “He's doing great. Don't worry about him at all and his team … His team is crushing it.” The late-night host then listed off a few of Trump's superstars: “We have twice baked RFK Jr., who is now embroiled in a sexy drug scandal with a reporter nearly 40 years his junior. Our secretary of war is murdering unidentified civilians and trying to throw the admiral who is following orders under the boat. The director of the FBI is reportedly using a private jet for personal travel with his country music star girlfriend, and delayed a murder investigation until somebody brought him a jacket, an FBI jacket, that fit his little body.” Ultimately, Kimmel observed: “They have better quality cabinets at Ikea.”

As promised, Drive-By Truckers reunited with Jason Isbell “officially” for the first time in 18 years on Tuesday's Late Show.


	The band and their former member delivered “Hell No, I Ain't Happy,” a track off their 2003 album Decoration Day, which recently received a “Definitive” reissue stocked with bonus tracks, including a new remix and a 2022 live recording.


	“We have always remained friends with Jason, and honestly, he and I are closer now than ever,” Drive-By Truckers' Patterson Hood previously said of the Late Show performance in a statement. “I consider Decoration Day to be our masterpiece, and he was such an integral part of that album that it's wonderful that he's able to join us in celebrating this release.”

	While the Colbert performance was billed as the first time that the band and Isbell have officially reunited, the group and their former guitarist have infrequently come together onstage over the past two decades since Isbell's exit in 2007:  In 2017, Isbell popped onstage for a song when the band played Nashville. More recently, Isbell joined the Drive-By Truckers in 2021 for an impromptu sit-in at his own Shoals Fest in Alabama, playing guitar on “Heathens” and singing “The Day John Henry Died.”

Was it a meteor, or something else unexplained? A resident from a village in Rensselaer County claims they witnessed a strange object fall form the sky while on a recent road trip. The driver said at first they thought it was a plane, but then claims it suddenly disappeared.

The alleged incident once sheds light on New York state's long history of unidentified flying phenomena.  Many sightings of these so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere. But there are some reports that even experts can not easily explain.

A report filed to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center November 25 says a resident of East Nassau was driving on the Massachusetts Turnpike. The driver states that they were heading towards the New York State Thruway when they saw an object above the road with ""bright lights"".

The resident says that they thought it was a plane falling from the sky, but then it suddenly disappeared. The report indicates that the object about a thousand feet over the road, and they it lasted for about 1to 2 minutes before disappearing near the tree line..

It is uncertain if what the person claims they saw were just drones, or military craft.

There are also other natural phenomena to consider, such as the number annual meteor showers. The Orionids will continue to streak across the night skies through late November, as will the Leonids meteor shower, which peaks in mid-November, and will continue to be seen through the early nights of December.

Christmas doesn't have to be just holly jolly. It's ok to have a little spooky fun too.

Ghost stories and Christmas actually go way back, and the combo makes more sense than it seems at first. After all, even ""A Christmas Carol"" is actually a ghost story first!

In the old days, those long, dark winter nights around Christmas were seen as this spooky, in‑between time when the world felt closer to spirits and the afterlife, so people would huddle by the fire and tell creepy stories to pass the time and poke at their fears in a safe way.

The Victorians really grabbed onto that idea: Christmas magazines were full of ghost tales, and families made it a whole vibe to sit around on Christmas Eve and try to outdo each other with hauntings and eerie encounters. Readers still love paranormal Christmas stories because they hit this perfect mix of cozy and creepy. 

You've got warm lights, snow outside, family drama, and then - boom - ghosts, unfinished business, and visits from the past, which lets people think about loss, guilt, and new beginnings without it feeling preachy. That contrast makes the scares feel sharper and the emotional moments hit harder, so a good Christmas ghost story ends up feeling both unsettling and weirdly comforting at the same time.

Check out this list of ghostly holiday reads, not too scary but a heap load of holiday cheer and fun!

A modern YA twist on A Christmas Carol: a selfish girl refuses to reform after her “Scrooge night,” dies, and is forced to work as the Ghost of Christmas Past for a mysterious organization that haunts new Scrooges each year. More info here.

A writer renovating an old Cornish cottage before Christmas finds her new home and its uncanny resident cat steeped in local legend, with gentle paranormal and magical-realism notes rather than full-on horror. More info here

A contemporary paranormal Christmas romance (2025) about a lonely woman and the ghost assigned to show her scenes from her past, blending cozy winter atmosphere, romance, and a literal holiday spirit. More info here.

Follows Holly Claus, on a mission to collect holiday “Cheer” in a small Oregon town where the magic around Christmas might not be operating the way she expects, giving a cozy-fantasy twist to North Pole lore. More info here

Fernando Alonso endured a spin that caught him out in Qatar

Fernando Alonso was perplexed during the Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix as he experienced a spin during the race that he described as “paranormal”.

The two-time World Champion is no stranger to strange encounters; however, he found himself laughing in disbelief after his AMR25 suddenly snapped without warning mid-corner. 

Alonso insists that this moment had very little to do with driver error, but rather an issue within Aston Martin's capricious 2025 challenger.

Throughout the Qatar GP, Alonso had made significant ground on his starting position. After starting eighth, the Aston Martin driver sat comfortably within the top six when a sudden loss of control at Turn 10 saw him spin on track. Alonso remained pointing in the right direction; however, he lost two positions in the process. 

Speaking after the race, Alonso made his frustrations clear with the unpredictability of the car. Explaining that the incident had nothing to do with pushing too hard.

“No, I was taking it easy,” Alonso told media including Motorsport Week.

“I wasn't at 100% per cent but this car has these disconnections – I don't know what to call them. A bit paranormal, like there's a spirit inside the car.”



Despite the mid-race incident, Alonso stated that the AMR25's performance did not surprise him, stating that the car had been acting strangely across the weekend. 

On Saturday, he experienced several corners where the front end simply abandoned him, leaving the car unresponsive, even at full steering lock.

“Yesterday, suddenly I lost the front for three or four corners,” he recalled.

“In one of them I went straight into the gravel, turning the wheel to the maximum. It felt like I didn't have front tyres at all.”

The issues then worsened on Sunday, when problems with the rear of the car caused him to spin on track. Alonso emphasised a feeling of a sudden “lash” prior to his spin.

“And today it was the rear wheels, suddenly a lash, so we're hypersensitive to the wind,” he explained.

“Hypersensitive to one or two degrees of temperature, we're always on a knife edge and today I made that mistake. 

“But fortunately I was very lucky that there was no gravel, that there was nothing and that I didn't have a train of cars behind me. There were only two at the time.”

Regardless, the weekend delivered more than expected. Alonso scored in both the Sprint and Grand Prix, adding a crucial eight points that helped Aston overtake Haas.

“Definitely lucky with the spin,” Alonso reflected. “Any other track and I probably end up in the gravel.

But two points yesterday, six today – eight in total – that's beyond what we thought we'd get. I'm really happy for the team. It's a big moment for the Constructors' Championship.”

Aston Martin lies seventh in the standings heading to the last round, 12 points behind Racing Bulls ahead, a margin that remains within reach thanks to Alonso's efforts. 

“We can go to Abu Dhabi with a little less pressure and less weight on our shoulders,” he concluded.

New James Webb telescope observations of the 'super-puff' planet WASP-107b show that the exoplanet's runaway atmosphere is frantically escaping into space.

A ""super-puff"" exoplanet is leaking a lot of helium into space, new observations show — and may be in the process of losing a lot of its atmosphere.

A large plume of helium gas was spotted evaporating from the giant planet, known as WASP-107b, according to research based on observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

The results, published Monday (Dec. 1) in the journal Nature Astronomy, show that the gas spanned an area nearly five times the diameter of the planet and that the gas was visible speeding far ahead of the planet along WASP-107b's orbital path.

The research represents the first time JWST has ""captured helium escape from this planet,"" lead author Vigneshwaran Krishnamurthy, a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University's Trottier Space Institute in Montreal, said in a statement.

The discovery could help researchers better understand how exoplanet atmospheres behave, especially in extreme star systems like WASP-107, where WASP-107b resides, the team said.

WASP-107b was discovered in 2017 near a star about 210 light-years from Earth. (For comparison, the closest planets to us are about 4 light-years away.) WASP-107b is almost the same size as Jupiter, at 94% of the gas giant's diameter, but its mass is just 12% that of Jupiter. This extremely low density and large size place WASP-107b in the ""super-puff"" category of exoplanets.

Aside from its unusual density, WASP-107b is in an interesting spot: It is seven times closer to its star than Mercury is to the sun. In Earth's neighborhood, by contrast, rocky planets are closer to the sun and gas giants like Jupiter are farther away. That means scientists must come up with models to explain that difference.

They think WASP-107b, like Jupiter and Saturn, formed much farther from its star but something in the system — possibly another planet — forced WASP-107b to migrate closer to its star over time.

""WASP-107c, much farther out than WASP-107b, could have played a role in this migration,"" study co-author Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb, an exoplanet researcher now at the University of Chicago who completed her Ph.D. at the University of Montreal in 2024, said in the statement.

 




Once the planet got close enough to its star, the extreme heat of its new orbit began gutting the exoplanet's gassy atmosphere, the researchers explained. The new JWST observations confirmed the extent of the damage: The powerful telescope spotted the helium cloud of the exoplanet's atmosphere passing in front of the system's parent star about 1.5 hours before WASP-107b itself.

The researchers spotted several elements in WASP-107b's atmosphere that reveal more clues about the planet's complicated history. For example, there was more oxygen in the planet's atmosphere than would be predicted if it had formed close to its star, which provides more evidence that its migration was relatively recent.

JWST also found water in the planet's atmosphere — confirming previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope — alongside traces of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ammonia. But methane, which was predicted to be part of the planet's atmosphere due to its chemistry, was curiously absent.

Because JWST's instruments are sensitive enough to detect methane from afar, the researchers suggest other gases poor in methane must have instead been drawn up from deep in the planet's atmosphere due to ""vigorous vertical mixing"" driven by the heat of the star, Piaulet-Ghorayeb added.

While planets like Earth also have some atmospheric loss, it is not this extreme. Studying worlds like WASP-107b could help us understand how atmospheric escape works on planets like Venus, which lost water over the eons, the research team said in a statement from the University of Geneva.

Jody Glidden has spent more than three decades building tools for people who never have enough time. 

His career started in the early 1990s with one of the first enterprise learning systems and later included the legal platform Introhive, which reached a $500 million valuation before his exit. But the idea behind Postilize, his latest startup, came from something even simpler: lawyers kept losing clients because they had no clue what was happening in their own accounts.

“Law firms were losing clients and they didn't see it coming,” Glidden told Refresh Miami. His last company helped firms understand the strength of their relationships. Postilize pushes that further by having AI track early signs of trouble or opportunity. 

“It's trying to help them no longer have to go into some system to understand the relationships that are at risk. It's just pouring through data and will bring you insights,” he added.

Instead of waiting for a partner to notice a quiet inbox, Postilize scans signals across the entire client base. If a firm hasn't spoken to a key contact in months, the platform flags it. If rumors of layoffs appear online, it alerts the employment team. If a company quietly hires a head of corporate development, Postilize suggests reaching out before the next deal appears. 

“You're not going to check LinkedIn every day and check the news every day and check private databases and filings,” he said. “Now we can put AI to the problem.”

Glidden jokes that the rise of generative AI feels like finding “ten billion new people who are smart and want to work for free.” Those new helpers don't merely point out risks – they help with business development. “We call it growth tech,” he said. “Helping them find opportunities before they even occur. Drafting the email, giving them the conversation starters.”

The platform now works across a wide range of firms. “It's fairly common among 100-lawyer firms and above,” Glidden said. But it also powers major global clients, including one of the Big Four accounting firms. A couple of single-user firms even slipped in thanks to personal connections, although that's not the target market.

One of the biggest recent steps is the partnership with legaltech giant Litera, which just announced a strategic investment in Postilize and the launch of a joint venture called Foundation Proactive. 

Glidden said Latera's database of firm experience – every matter, opposing counsel, and outcome – made it a perfect pairing. 

“I thought it would be a great source of information for Postilize,” he said. Their combined product helps firms filter a massive stream of predicted legal matters down to the ones they are most likely to win.

“It's only been two months, but it's gotten a ton of traction really quick,” Glidden asserted.

Miami has been part of Glidden's story since 2010, long before the current wave of tech migration. “At the time, my old investors said ‘absolutely not,' to me living in Miami,” he said, laughing. He stayed anyway, and that decision worked out. “Now there are so many more investors in Miami, so many more executives. The talent pool is a lot deeper.”

He likes the airports, too. “I can be in any city, any day, same day, and often back at night,” he said. He also credits the community for providing connections that help legal tech companies grow. “We have a great network in Miami,” he said. “It's been really great for the tech community.”

Postilize now has around 25 employees, though most work outside Miami. Glidden isn't going anywhere. “I'm here. I'm never leaving,” he said.

The next stage of the product focuses on even sharper prediction. “We're already able to predict an incredible amount of legal matters,” he said. But the coming year will bring new kinds of signals such as the deals that are most valuable to each firm, fastest to close, or the easiest wins. 

“These types of predictions would never have been possible even last year,” he said. With better models and deeper integrations, he believes the platform will advance quickly.

Part of Other Side of the Story



Remember those lookalike competitions involving the actor Timothée Chalamet? The newest addition to the lookalike world is UK rapper EsDeeKid, who is said to look a lot like - you've guessed it - Timothée Chalamet.

However, there's a slight twist to this tale. Some people are claiming that they might actually be the same person!  Is it true, or another example of a  conspiracy theory?

Liverpool performer EsDeeKid released his debut album this year. He currently has 602k Instagram followers and an impressive 9.7 million monthly listeners on Spotify.

Because EsDeeKid only reveals his eyes to his audience, speculation has bubbled online about the rapper's true identity. When TikTok user KJ Freeman posted what she called the “mystery of the century”: Is EsDeeKid Timothée Chalamet? - her post claiming to link the rapper with the New York actor gained 1.6m views.

Timothée Chalamet is the star of films such as the Dune series, Wonka and A Complete Unknown, with a social following of 19.5 million Instagram followers.

When explaining her theory, Freeman compared EsDeeKid and Chalamet's hazel-coloured eyes and full brows. Users then posted side-by-side comparisons, placing one face above another in videos. They also found photographs of both wearing the same luxury brand scarf.

Alongside eye comparisons and the scarf, Freeman also mentioned Chalamet was spotted at the London concert of performer Fakemink, who EsDeeKid has collaborated with.

Chalamet also has a history of doing the unexpected, from entering lookalike competitions of himself, to his Saturday Night Live skit as a rapper. His acting work has also called for musical abilities when he played singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, so it's not impossible that this could be another of his projects.

Neither Chalamet nor EsDeeKid have publicly commented on the theory, but comments on recent posts on both their official Instagram accounts have included comparison GIFs. Some TikTok posts comparing the two have gained thousands of likes, and users on Reddit have gone as far as comparing the tops of their noses and the veins in their hands for similarities.

Unless there is an official announcement that they are one and the same, there is no evidence to support the theory.

Conspiracy theories are built around the belief there are secrets we don't know about, caused by powerful groups who influence key events in the world.

This particular conspiracy theory seems harmless. Timothée Chalamet putting on a Liverpudlian accent to live out dreams of being a secret rapper is probably not going to hurt anyone - but if it were true, fans of either him or EsDeeKid may feel they have been misled.

But conspiracy theories can also lead to more dangerous misinformation or disinformation, known as fake news, to spread online - and perhaps even go viral.

We can use critical thinking to check if these theories are genuine by doing our own research. One example is EsDeeKid performing a gig in Milan, Italy, while Chalamet was at a film screening in New York - this makes it unlikely that they are the same person. The actor also said he was making the third film in the Dune series between July and November this year. It would be difficult to perform EsDeeKid's live dates around the world at the same time.

The Alabama Republican argued for abolishing the Senate filibuster to validate stolen election claims and block Muslim immigration.

By

Published on December 3, 2025 at 8:04 am CST

During the recently-concluded 43-day government shutdown, several Republican lawmakers began calling for the repeal of the filibuster—the longstanding Senate rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. The calls came under pressure from President Trump, who demanded his party override the Democrats' blockade to restore funding to the federal government.

Among the most vocal proponents for doing away with the filibuster at that time was U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, who sharply reversed on his previous support for the measure. Now, several weeks after eight members of the Senate Democratic Caucus caved and voted to reopen the government, Tuberville is renewing his call for the filibuster's elimination.

In an op-ed recently published by far-right news outlet Breitbart, Tuberville made his case for ending the filibuster and asked his Republican colleagues to join him in abolishing the measure. In Tuberville's view, nuking the filibuster would both aid Republicans in pushing through Trump's “America First” agenda and preempt Democrats from doing away with the measure themselves the next time they assume control of the Senate.

“President Trump has his work cut out for him as he tries to dig America out of the deep hole the Biden administration got us into over the past four years,” Tuberville wrote. “Congressional Republicans must deliver on the ‘America First' agenda that 77 million Americans voted for in November 2024. But to do that, Republicans need to get organized. We've been too hesitant, too worried about offending someone, and too content to keep calling conservative plays while Democrats don't play by the rules and are willing to do whatever it takes to shove their woke agenda down our throats.

“If Republicans want to put real wins on the board for the American people, it starts with ending the Senate filibuster. I know this is controversial. But the truth is, if it weren't for two former Democrat Senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, Democrats would have already blown it up last time they were in power,” the senator continued.

Tuberville went on to argue that Democrats would “cement their woke agenda into law” if given the opportunity to nuke the filibuster themselves, allowing them to pursue policies including “packing the Supreme Court, destroying our borders, mandating electric vehicles, and allowing abortion up until the day of birth.”

According to Tuberville, the filibuster has lost its original purpose of facilitating “meaningful debate” and has since become “a tool that greatly expands the power of a single Senator.”

“So, it's not really surprising that some of my colleagues are determined to keep it—it's all about power,” the senator stated.

Tuberville went on to highlight the legislative priorities which Republicans could more easily pursue if the filibuster is eliminated. Chief among those priorities, in the senator's view, would be “restoring election integrity”—with Tuberville once again feeding into the long-debunked conspiracy theory that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen” from Donald Trump.

“Once [the filibuster is] gone, our top priority must be restoring election integrity,” Tuberville wrote. “That means requiring American citizens to show identification before casting a ballot and abolishing universal mail-in ballots.

“Millions of Americans believe the 2020 election was stolen from President Trump,” he continued. “Massive fraud occurred, and we cannot allow it to happen again. Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. We should be working around the clock to shore up our elections ahead of the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential elections.”

Tuberville also took the opportunity to call for the hamstringing of the federal court system, arguing that eliminating the filibuster would allow Republicans to bypass “Democrat activists judges” who make rulings against the Trump administration's interests.

“Another major obstacle to the ‘America First' agenda is the wave of activist judges weaponizing lawfare against the Trump administration,” the senator stated. “Unelected judges should not have the power to override the will of 77 million Americans who sent Trump back to the White House. Time and again, when President Trump tries to deliver on a promise, Democrat activist judges swoop in to block it.”

“Republicans must end the filibuster if we have any hope of keeping a Supreme Court that respects the Constitution,” Tuberville added. “If we fail, Democrats have already said what they will do when they regain power: pack the courts with radicals who will disregard the Constitution altogether.”

Additionally, Tuberville called for the banning of “all immigration from the Middle East and North Africa,” making the unfounded claim that “entire neighborhoods” in Europe are now “ruled by Sharia law” due to increased migration from majority-Muslim countries. The comments mark yet another entry in a recent string of Islamophobic statements and legislative actions taken by the senator, with Tuberville also appearing to argue that all Muslim immigrants should be deported from the country.

“We need to deport every Islamist who was allowed to come here under the Biden administration,” Tuberville stated. “If we don't act now, the United States will end up the ‘United Caliphate of America.'”

Tuberville concluded his op-ed by expressing his support for the “Project 2025” agenda and again urging his colleagues to join him in repealing the filibuster.

“Democrats widely mocked Project 2025 during the last election—but I think the conservatives who put that together were on to something,” Tuberville wrote. “President Trump made very clear promises on the campaign trail and the American people overwhelmingly voted him into office. Not only that, but the American people entrusted Republicans with control of the House and Senate to help implement the President's agenda. There is no reason why we should not be delivering on the President's promises instead of letting Democrats obstruct at every turn.

“This is fourth-and-goal with the clock running out. Republicans can either run the ball up the middle and fight for the win or kneel and hand the country over to radical Democrats. It's time to run the winning play, and that play starts with ending the filibuster.”

Positioning himself as a faithful continuation of the ""America First"" movement, Murphy argues he is the best candidate to replicate Tuberville's governance in Washington.

Senator Katie Britt bridged a fierce partisan divide to end a government shutdown, offering a timely lesson for Thanksgiving tables everywhere.

Tuberville backed the potential designation while describing ""Radical Islam"" as a ""death cult"" fundamentally incompatible with Western values.

Tuberville may sue over seized phone records but said Thursday that “taxpayers should not be forced to pay the price.”

A new analysis of July temperatures in Death Valley between 1923 and 2024 suggests the world record near-surface air temperature of 134 F measured in July 1913 may be erroneous.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Death Valley has held the record for the hottest air temperature ever measured near Earth's surface for 112 years, but now scientists are calling for the title to be rescinded.

According to U.S. Weather Bureau data, the air temperature at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley reached a scorching 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius) on July 10, 1913. This is still the highest air temperature on record, but its authenticity has been debated by meteorologists and climatologists, because — despite global warming — temperatures in the region have rarely reached 130 F (54.4 C) since 1913.

""I, along with many meteorologists and climatologists, have been quietly skeptical of the Death Valley world record our entire careers,"" Roy Spencer, a meteorologist and principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who recently led a study about Death Valley's world record status, told Live Science in an email.

For the study, Spencer and his colleagues analyzed July temperatures recorded at stations within 155 miles (250 kilometers) of Greenland Ranch between 1923 and 2024. The stations were 3,000 to 3,700 feet (910 to 1,130 meters) above sea level while Greenland Ranch is 178 feet (54 m) below sea level, so the researchers adjusted the data for elevation. (These were the closest stations to the ranch and provided the most reliable long-term data.) The team then compared the values and examined high-elevation July temperatures from 1913 to estimate the temperature at Greenland Ranch on that day.

They found that the air temperature at Greenland Ranch on July 10, 1913 was about 120 F (48.9 C), nowhere near 134 F. ""The unusually hot temperatures measured at Greenland Ranch in early July 1913 are shown to be inconsistent with temperatures at surrounding stations,"" they wrote in the study, published Sept. 24 in the journal Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

Many scientists were previously skeptical about Death Valley's temperature record but few really questioned it because the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) accepted it and observations from the early 1900s with which to scrutinize the Greenland Ranch data were scarce, Spencer said.

""All deserts are hot in the summer, but Death Valley is especially hot because it is below sea level,"" he said. ""The Death Valley record has more entertainment than climatological value, with an element of 'bragging rights' from the standpoint of tourism.""

The U.S. Weather Bureau installed a station to measure temperatures at Greenland Ranch in 1911. The shelter was initially placed on the edge of an irrigated alfalfa field, but subsequent photographs suggest the ranch foreman, Oscar Denton, moved it to a hotter site above bare ground without official approval or documentation, according to the study.

 




Denton may have done this because ranch employees were used to measuring hotter temperatures on the ranch veranda than the station was recording and he wanted their experience to be reflected in the data, the researchers wrote. The veranda had a double roof, which may have vented hot air onto the veranda, they noted.

""While the station move away from the irrigated field would not explain the excessively hot temperature measurements, especially those in the first two weeks of July 1913, they support a pattern of straying from proper observing protocol,"" they wrote.

Denton may have also substituted some of the station's measurements for thermometer values on the veranda, Spencer said. ""Newspaper, magazine, book accounts, and even correspondence with the Weather Bureau in San Francisco from back then show that 135 deg. F or hotter temperatures were made from that veranda using one or more thermometers of unknown provenance,"" he said.

 




The findings suggest Death Valley's world record should be rescinded, although temperatures of 130 F recorded in 2020 and 2021 might help the valley keep it, Spencer said. The period from July 2 to 18, 1913 and other years in the record also show anomalously high temperatures that should be scrutinized, the researchers noted in the study.

""I would support further investigation into this by the WMO and NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information,"" said Dan McEvoy, an associate research professor of climatology at the Desert Research Institute who was not involved in the study.

The true story behind the value recorded on July 10, 1913 may never be known, but the study's conclusion that 134 F is incorrect is convincing and based on solid historical evidence, McEvoy told Live Science in an email.

""They are sampling from many surrounding stations, not just cherry picking one location,"" he said.

Astrobiologist Caleb Scharf joins Michael Shermer for a wide-ranging conversation about the past, present, and future of our relationship with space. Drawing on his new book The Giant Leap, Scharf explains why human expansion beyond Earth may be less a choice than an evolutionary development, and he walks through the physics, history, and personalities that shaped our journey off the planet.

Scharf also explains the biological toll of radiation and microgravity, and why terraforming Mars is probably unrealistic and why our future might rely more on building vast rotating habitats in space than on settling other planets.

Caleb Scharf is an astrobiologist and recipient of the 2022 Carl Sagan Medal. He was Director of Astrobiology at Columbia University in New York and is now the Senior Scientist for Astrobiology at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.

Images and videos taken in 2020, a year after he died in jail, show the late sex offender's home

US politics – live updates

House Democrats released a handful of photos and videos from Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island on Wednesday, offering a rare glimpse into a secretive place where Epstein is alleged to have trafficked young girls.

The new images and videos show Epstein's home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appears to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which the words “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. One photo shows a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Times reported that Epstein's last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. The videos appear to be a walk-through of the property.

The materials released on Wednesday were from law enforcement authorities in the US Virgin Islands. They were taken in 2020, the year after Epstein died by suicide in jail.

Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, including Little St James, which some locals told the New York Times they had nicknamed “pedophile island”. In 2022, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands reached a settlement for more than $100m with Epstein's estate after they alleged “dozens of young women and children were trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive in the Virgin Islands at Epstein's secluded private island, Little St James.”

Even though the images and videos released on Wednesday do not reveal anything new, they appear to be an effort from Congress to keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release the files. A bipartisan group of members of Congress on Wednesday also asked the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to provide a status update.

“These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island. We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. We won't stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors,” Robert Garcia, the ranking member on the House oversight committee, said in a statement.

Ukrainaian sabotage operations in Russian-occupied Ukraine from 2022-2025. (Nizar al-Rifai/The Kyiv Independent)

Sabotage activity in Russian-occupied territories is picking up after a two-year lull, according to a new report by ACLED, an organization that tracks conflicts around the world.

Pro-Ukrainian militias were particularly active in the occupied territories in 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion, the report found — although this declined as Russia consolidated control through suppressing protests, torture, and executions.

""In 2023 and 2024, the data shows that Russia's crackdown worked,"" Nichita Gurcov, senior analyst at ACLED and author of the report, told the Kyiv Independent.

""But in 2025, sabotage is picking up again.""

This year, ACLED recorded 37 episodes of sabotage as of Nov. 14 — more than in 2023 or 2024, and mostly driven by one armed partisan group: Atesh.

A pro-Ukrainian militia originally from Crimea, Atesh is responsible for over half of the incidents recorded within the occupied territories in 2025. The group progressively expanded operations in the occupied territories, and since 2024, has operated within Russia itself.

""Since Crimea has been occupied for over a decade, our impression is that they (members of Atesh) blend in, facing fewer hurdles in accessing occupied territories and mainland Russia,"" says Gurcov.

""We assume that they are more mobile than Ukrainians from the newly occupied territories, who probably face higher scrutiny from Russian security forces,"" he added.

ACLED identified almost 700 incidents of anti-Russian sabotage within Russia since the full-scale invasion. Aside from Atesh, those behind the attacks include the Ukrainian forces and Russian anti-war groups, and the Freedom of Russia Legion — a militia aligned with Ukrainian special forces.

Popular targets include railway and communications infrastructure, local authorities, and Russia's banking infrastructure.

But many smaller acts of sabotage likely go unrecorded — earlier this year, the Kyiv Independent reported on an all–female partisan group Zla Mavka, who claim to have mixed laxatives into food and drink served to Russian soldiers.

Russian sabotage in Ukraine has also picked up. According to the report, there have been around 400 incidents of sabotage throughout non-occupied Ukraine, with two-thirds of those attributable to recruits of Russian special services.

""From the data, it looks like Russia learned from Ukrainians how to recruit local proxies,"" says Gurcov, highlighting that often those people are young, unemployed, and motivated by cash.

""And it's not happening only in Ukraine. It's happening in Europe now, too. Anyone with a phone and access to encrypted messaging apps is a target.""

Two Ukrainians are suspected of sabotaging the Warsaw–Lublin railway line in Poland last month, a crucial line for delivering aid to Ukraine.

Ukraine and its European allies accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday of feigning interest in peace efforts after five hours of talks with U.S. envoys at the Kremlin produced no breakthrough.

The Russian leader “should end the bluster and the bloodshed and be ready to come to the table and to support a just and lasting peace,” said U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged Putin to “stop wasting the world's time.”

The remarks reflect the high tensions and gaping gulf that remain between Russia on one side and Ukraine and its European allies on the other over how to end a war that Moscow started when it invaded its neighbour nearly four years ago.

No Ukraine compromise reached in meeting between Putin and U.S. envoys, Russia says

A day earlier, Putin accused the Europeans of sabotaging the U.S.-led peace efforts – and warned that, if provoked, Russia would be ready for war with Europe.

Since the 2022 invasion, European governments, along with the U.S., have spent billions of dollars to support Kyiv financially and militarily. Under President Donald Trump, however, the U.S. has tempered its support – and instead made a push to end the war.

Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said Tuesday's talks at the Kremlin between Putin and U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner were “positive” but wouldn't release any details.

Putin met Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in the Kremlin as part of a renewed push by the Trump administration to broker a peace deal.  

The Associated Press

Where the peace talks go from here depends largely on whether the Trump administration decides to increase the pressure on Russia or on Ukraine to make concessions.

A U.S. peace proposal that became public last month was criticized for being tilted heavily toward Moscow because it granted some of the Kremlin's core demands that Kyiv has rejected as non-starters.

Many European leaders worry that if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine, it will have free rein to threaten their countries, which already have faced incursions from Russian drones and fighter jets, and an alleged widespread sabotage campaign. 

The Russian and American sides agreed Tuesday not to disclose the substance of their Kremlin talks, but at least one major hurdle to a settlement remains – the fate of four Ukrainian regions Russia partially seized and occupies and claims as its own.

After the talks, Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Putin, told reporters that “so far, a compromise hasn't been found” on the issue of territory, without which, he said, the Kremlin sees “no resolution to the crisis.”

Analysis: Duelling peace plans show relief for Ukraine remains a long way off

Ukraine has ruled out giving up territory that Russia has captured.

Asked whether peace was closer or further away after these talks, Ushakov said: “Not further, that's for sure.”

“But there's still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and in Moscow,” he said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that it was “not correct” to say that Putin had rejected the U.S. peace plan. He declined to comment further on the talks.

“We're deliberately not going to add anything,” he said. “It's understood that the quieter these negotiations are conducted, the more productive they will be.”

 

Reuters

Foreign ministers from European NATO countries, meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, showed little patience with Moscow.

“What we see is that Putin has not changed any course. He's pushing more aggressively on the battlefield,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. “It's pretty obvious that he doesn't want to have any kind of peace.”

Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen struck the same note. “So far we haven't seen any concessions from the side of the aggressor, which is Russia, and I think the best confidence-building measure would be to start with a full ceasefire,” she told reporters.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Ukraine's partners will keep sending it military aid to ensure pressure is maintained on Moscow.

“The peace talks are ongoing. That's good,” Rutte said.

“But at the same time, we have to make sure that whilst they take place and we are not sure when they will end, that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to keep the fight going, to fight back against the Russians,” he said.

Canada, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands announced that they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars more together to buy U.S. weapons to donate to Ukraine.

Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump administration has not approved donations of weapons to Ukraine. Instead, it has sold them directly to Kyiv or to NATO allies that give them to Ukraine.

Russia and Ukraine are engaged in a grim war of attrition on the battlefield and are using drones and missiles for long-range strikes behind the front line. Many analysts have noted that the slow slog favours Russia's larger military, especially if disagreements between Europe and the U.S. or among Europeans hampers the delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

Russian drones hit the town of Ternivka in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, killing two people and injuring three more, the head of the regional military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, said Wednesday.

Two people were in critical condition, he said, after the attack destroyed one house and damaged six more.

Overall, Russia fired 111 strike and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine's air force said.

Meanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that air defences destroyed 102 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Falling drone debris sparked a fire at an oil depot in the Tambov region, about 200 kilometres south of Moscow, local Gov. Yegveniy Pervyshov said.

Telus Inc. T-T is pausing its dividend growth as part of an effort to reduce its leverage, an abrupt change from its previous payout plans after investors and analysts questioned the company's ability to keep increasing dividends while meeting debt reduction targets.

Telus said it will pause dividend increases and keep its quarterly payout at its current level until its share price “reflects growth prospects,” the telecom company said Wednesday.

The pause represents an about-face from just two weeks ago, when the company insisted it would continue with plans to grow its dividend. 

On Nov. 20, Telus chief financial officer Doug French told The Globe that management did not expect changes to the dividend growth plan, “and management does not plan to change that, as nothing has changed in our operations.” 

He also noted, however as with other public companies, Telus dividend decisions are ultimately made by the board of directors which reviews the payout on a quarterly basis. The company's financial documents also contain warnings that the growth could end at any time.

Telus and other Canadian telecom companies have faced growing pressure to take steps to reduce heavy debt loads, amid slower growth across the sector in part due to reduced immigration. 

Andrew Willis: Telus needs to kick its addiction to dividend hikes

In recent weeks, some analysts argued Telus's plans to continue increasing the dividend were unsustainable given their estimates of the company's cash flows, as investors questioned the company's ability to keep increasing dividends while meeting debt reduction targets. 

The company's executives maintained that it could continue to cover the dividend while also working towards meeting the company's leverage targets. 

Now, the company will continue to pay its quarterly dividend at the most recent level of 41.84 cents per share, “until such time as our share price and associated dividend yield better reflects the considerable growth prospects of Telus,” chief executive officer Darren Entwistle said in a Wednesday release. 

On Nov. 20, Mr. French said the company expects to end 2025 with a cash-flow payout ratio of about 75 per cent, and to remain close to that ratio in the coming years.

However, analysts from J.P. Morgan and Veritas Investment Research calculated the figures differently, saying they viewed that ratio as remaining above 100 per cent for the next few years.

Telus shares are near their lowest point for nearly a decade. 

The company's share price has suffered a 45-per-cent slide since 2022 highs, and remain down 14.2 per cent from this time last year. However, the stock jumped on Wednesday morning, up 2.4 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a yield of about 9.1 per cent. 

Telus's decision to pause dividend increases is expected to end pressure on the stock price from short selling by investors such as hedge funds. Short sellers borrow stock and sell it on the expectation of repurchasing the shares at a lower price and making a profit.

Short sales of Telus jumped in recent months. 

In the first two weeks of November, the most recent period on record, regulatory filings show short sales of Telus on the Toronto Stock Exchange increased by 1.1 million shares to 50.4 million shares or approximately 3 per cent of the telecom's outstanding shares.

Telus also trades on the New York Stock Exchange and the short position on the U.S. exchange rose by 14 per cent to 60.5 million shares in the four weeks ending Nov. 15, according to filings. 

In a note to investors Wednesday morning, CIBC director of institutional equity sales Veleyny Saavedra said the move “should act as a clearing event for the market,” and would position the company well for long-term value creation.

“We see them as incrementally positive and expect the Street to react favorably,” she said. 

This is the second telecom company to attract attention this year because of its dividend. In May, BCE halved its dividend payout – which at the time had a yield of 13 per cent, widely seen as unsustainable – in order to allocate that cash elsewhere.

Telus's dividend pause follows a previous dividend growth reduction. In May, Telus reduced its dividend growth target to between 3-per-cent and 8-per-cent growth annually from 2026 to 2028 to help it reach its leverage goals of three times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of 2027, the company said. 

In addition to the dividend pause, on Wednesday Telus also provided forward guidance on its free cash flow, saying it expects to generate $2.15-billion in free cash flow in 2025, and a minimum compound annual growth rate of 10 per cent between 2026 and 2028. Telus had $25.7-billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30. 

It also shared a more detailed timeline on removing the discount from its dividend reinvestment plan, which it plans to do entirely by the end of 2027, and reiterated its continuing other ongoing deleveraging initiatives. 

These include selling real estate and copper assets, pursuing a strategic partner for Telus Health and potentially issuing more hybrid debt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Sri Lanka cyclone tragedy exposes government failures","https://www.dw.com/en/sri-lanka-cyclone-tragedy-exposes-government-failures/a-74985337","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 07:49:47 GMT","

Officials in Sri Lanka are facing immense pressure for their alleged mishandling of Cyclone Ditwah, with the crisis highlighting deep cracks in the country's emergency response system.

Days after Cyclone Ditwah tore through Sri Lanka, over 1.46 million people across all 25 of the nation's districts remain affected by the island's worst flooding disaster in two decades.

According to the government's Disaster Management Center, the official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers across the country.

Multiple countries have responded to Sri Lanka's appeal for assistance with India leading the charge, followed by pledges from the UK, China, Australia, and Nepal. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also declared a state of emergency to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone.

Despite his declaration and the promise of international aid, however, the Sri Lankan public seems increasingly frustrated with the state's response. Authorities appear to be overwhelmed with rescue demands and are struggling to communicate in a timely manner as critics point out the absence of a unified relief-and-rescue system.

Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, accuses the Sri Lankan government of failing to heed warning signals and allowing the calamity to spiral beyond human control.

""The government has not come off well in its handling of the crisis and should have called Parliament to convene urgently to review and strengthen disaster management policies,"" Saravanamuttu told DW.

According to Saravanamuttu, ""this disaster reveals significant gaps in preparedness and response mechanisms"" and the existing frameworks need to be evaluated to ""prevent future failures.""

While Ditwah made landfall in Sri Lanka on November 28, some voices point out that warning signals were present as early as two weeks before. Experts say that the loss of life was exacerbated by the government's failure to act in a timely manner.

""Unlike tsunamis, hydrometeorological hazards like cyclones arrive with sufficient notice of several days to take precautions. As early as November 12, Sri Lanka's department of meteorology had publicly flagged the prospect of extreme rainfall later in the month. That should have triggered a process of preparations across the government at central, provincial, and local levels,"" Nalaka Gunawardene, a science writer from Colombo, told DW.

""Apparently, that did not happen, and an official response has mostly been reactive when Cyclone Ditwah was imminent or after it made landfall,"" added Gunawardene.

""The entire disaster management structure – from policymakers to state officials – should be held accountable for cascading failures that made a bad disaster much worse.""

Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a public interest advocate and legal columnist, agrees that the aftermath is ""particularly horrendous as the deadly impact of the cyclone was not realized until it was far too late.""

She told DW that the governments should have ""the ability and the competence to take critical decisions"" in times of emergency.

""Sentimental outpouring by politicians lauding the people for 'coming together' in times of crisis does not substitute for that duty,"" she added.

Sivanathan Navindra, a former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) member, who has been involved in political activities post-conflict, said the cyclone has damaged roads and communication lines in northern Sri Lanka.

""The situation in northern Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi districts is extremely severe. Mullaitivu has experienced a total power outage with telecommunication towers down, leaving residents without phone or internet access,"" Navindra told DW from Jaffna.

""Road closures have effectively cut off the northern province, with travel between Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna impossible,"" he said.

Chathuranga Abeysinghe, deputy minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, warned that rising water levels will make evacuation ""extremely difficult."" He urged residents along the Kelaniya River and flood-prone areas to leave.

""There have been immense hardships caused by Cyclone Ditwah, but the president has constituted task forces to study the impact and organize relief. It will take a while for rebuilding,"" Abeysinghe told DW.

""We had initial difficulty in predicting the cyclone's course"" Abeysinghe said, noting that significant rainfall expected was many different areas which ""stretched rescue teams beyond capacity to reach everyone in need.""

Abeysinghe also pointed out that the government was working on a war-footing to reach vulnerable populations that had been cut off.

Government critics, however, remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently pledged to launch legal action against the government.

SJB lawmaker and spokesperson S M Marikkar compared the severity of the disaster to the Easter Sunday suicide attacks which killed nearly 270 people in 2019, and the more recent economic collapse under the powerful Rajapaksa family.

""Similar to the criminal case filed against the Rajapaksas for bankrupting the nation, we will file a case against the current government, as they are responsible for every citizen that died in the disaster,"" Marikkar told the media on Monday.

Despite some relief materials being delivered and emergency teams arriving to certain affected locations, many communities still lack clarity on when full help will arrive and when normalcy can be restored. A notable communication obstacle, according to Colombo-based disinformation expert and analyst Sanjana Hattotuwa, is the choice of languages officials use for disaster communications.

The nation recognizes both the majority language of Sinhala and the smaller Tamil language as official, with English — a remnant of the British colonial period — also spoken to varying degrees by nearly a quarter of its population.

""My research showed key updates were in Sinhala only, and sometimes mirrored in English, but rarely, if ever in Tamil. State television and radio did not communicate the risks, and threats, mirroring what was evident on social media,"" Hattotuwa told DW.

""This contributed to [an] information vacuum in critical hours, impacting preparedness and community responses,"" he said. ""If information was available in a more effective and timely manner, lives now lost may have been saved.""

Never-before-seen pictures of Jeffrey Epstein's private island have been released.

Images and a video showing various rooms in Epstein's residence on Little St James in the US Virgin Islands were released by Democrats on the House oversight committee on Wednesday.

Ten pictures and four videos have been published. It is believed they were captured during the investigation into the financier after he was charged with sex trafficking in 2019.

One image shows what appears to be a bathroom or steam room. White tiled seats line the walls with bottles of what appear to be soap and shampoo stacked up in one corner.

Clear boxes containing what appear to be clothes and sheets are stacked in the other, alongside huge piles of pillows and towels.

Another image shows a bedroom, decorated with a large, white four-poster bed and a brightly-coloured rug. One of the walls, and a wardrobe, appears to be covered with white sheets.

Another bedroom pictured contains a large, white bed, desk and a standing fan. A small dark chest sits at the end of the bed.

“Oversight Dems have received never-before-seen photos and videos of Jeffrey Epstein's private island that are a harrowing look behind Epstein's closed doors,” a post on the committee's X account read.

“See for yourself. We won't stop fighting until we end this cover-up and deliver justice for the survivors.”

One of the most bizarre photos shows what appears to be a dentist's chair in a room with its walls decorated with human-looking masks, each with a different face.

Another picture shows an ornate living area with a blackboard in the background. A close up of the board reveals cryptic messages written in chalk, some of which are redacted.

The messages include the words: power, deception, mirror in face, time, intellectual, political, music, truth, and appears.

Little St James, a tropical Caribbean beauty spot which Epstein referred to as “Little St Jeff's”, became notorious as the site where the paedophile would traffic and abuse underage victims.

It also became known as “Epstein island”.

Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight committee, said the images were “disturbing” and they had been released to “ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes”.

Donald Trump's justice department is currently under a 30-day deadline to release all the files it holds on Epstein after the US president signed an order demanding their release on Nov 19.

The program is “another giveaway to the richest Americans that leaves everyone else further behind,” one critic said.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

On Tuesday, Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, announced that they will donate $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for 25 million children in the U.S. The money would bolster “Trump accounts” launched by the White House in July by providing each eligible child with $250 for their account's growth.

The program has faced widespread criticism for providing rich families with yet another tax shelter while potentially reinforcing wealth inequality in the U.S.

Trump Accounts were created as part of Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which passed earlier this year. Any child under the age of 18 is eligible to create an account, and their families can contribute up to $5,000 annually, which can grow through investment of diversified, low-cost U.S. stock index funds. Children cannot access their money until they become adults, although there could be eligible rollovers allowed into other brokerage accounts. The new law also invests $1,000 into Trump Accounts for every child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. 

Although parents can sign up for the program now, Trump Accounts will not become available to manage until May 2026, according to the Treasury Department.

Trump praised the Dells for their gift, describing it as a “pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation.”

Michael Dell explained why he and his spouse made the gift, stating, “We've seen what happens when a child gets even a small financial head start — their world expands.”

However, observers have noted that Trump Accounts may do little to help children whose families are unable to make huge investments into their accounts. And the program could be a precursor to eliminating other safety net and retirement programs, such as Social Security — an outcome that members of the Trump administration have indicated is the end goal.

In July, while promoting Trump Accounts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the program as a potential “backdoor for privatizing Social Security,” before walking back that statement amid backlash. 

“Bessent actually slipped and told the truth: Donald Trump and his government want to privatize Social Security,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in response to Bessent's comments.

Other lawmakers have also criticized the program.

“The so-called ‘Trump accounts' are a missed opportunity that focused on Donald Trump's vanity and giving Republicans a hollow talking point rather than truly helping young people,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virginia) said last month. 

Notably, parents who want to participate must opt their children into the program around tax time, which some families may not be aware of.

“We're concerned about families who don't have to file, families who need to file but don't, families who do file but don't do the form correctly,” said Ray Boshara of the Aspen Institute.“They're going to miss a lot of kids if you do it through a tax return.”

Amy Matsui, vice president of income security and child care at the National Women's Law Center, also panned the program, noting that it would benefit wealthy families while leaving those with modest incomes out in the cold. Said Matsui:

While we support direct investments in families, the Trump Accounts being hailed by the White House are a policy solution that doesn't meet most families' needs. As currently structured, these accounts will just become another tax shelter for the wealthiest, while the overwhelming majority of American families, who are struggling to cover basic costs like food, childcare, and housing, will be hard-pressed to find the extra money that could turn the seed money into a meaningful investment.

“In the end, this policy mirrors the rest of the law: another giveaway to the richest Americans that leaves everyone else further behind,” Matsui added.

Indeed, the program has the potential to widen wealth gaps that are already embedded in the U.S. For example, a family that had a child today and signed up for the $1,000 initial investment given to Trump Accounts, but who struggled to contribute to the account and never made any personal investments afterward, would only see their child's account grow by around $700 after 18 years, assuming a 3 percent rate of growth annually. By contrast, a child whose family is wealthy enough to contribute the full $5,000 per year into the account would see growth of around $150,000 by the time they became an adult, under the same growth conditions. 

Advocates have called for other measures to combat childhood poverty and wealth inequality, including the expansion of the child tax credit.

The expanded child tax credit was implemented during the pandemic as a way to lift children in low-income families out of poverty, and was wildly successful at doing so, helping to drop poverty and hunger rates for 61 million children in the U.S. However, immediately after the expanded credits expired in 2022, the child poverty rate more than doubled, going from 5.2 percent to 12.4 percent in just one year.

“When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don't want them,” Trump said.

The Trump administration is expanding its immigration raids targeting Somalis in Minneapolis this week, with reports of detentions already made as President Donald Trump spews vitriolic, racist hate against the population of several hundred thousand people in the U.S.

Major outlets, including The New York Times and Associated Press, reported Tuesday that U.S. officials are preparing the raid as a “high-priority sweep.” Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the U.S. The Census Bureau estimates that there is a population of 260,000 Somalis in the U.S., the vast majority of whom were born in the U.S. or are naturalized citizens.

The administration claims it's targeting “hundreds of undocumented Somali immigrants” in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Officials are deploying roughly 100 officers and agents for the operation.

Sahan Journal reports that local immigrant rights groups have said that they have already witnessed four Somali individuals being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents this week. ICE has also targeted Southeast Asian and Latine people in Minneapolis for arrests.

Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declined to comment on the raids but told Sahan: “What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally.”

That statement is directly contradicted by stomach-churning statements made by the president himself this week.

In a racist rant during his cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump said that Somalis are “garbage” who “contribute nothing.” He said that Somalia is “no good” and “stinks,” ignoring the historic ravaging of the country by colonial powers and his own contribution to the devastation of the country due to his sweeping aid cuts.

He also directed hatred toward Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), who has long faced bigoted animosity from the right for her Somali background and Muslim faith.

“We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage,” Trump said. “When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don't want them in our country.”

Trump also recently announced that he is revoking Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota — a move that has questionable legal grounds, but that the administration is sure to charge forth with anyway.

Minneapolis leaders, including the mayor, have condemned the statements, pledging to stand by the Somali community. 

Omar brushed off the comments, simply saying: “His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) also denounced Trump's racism in a post on X.

“When demagogues like Trump are in trouble, they reach for the same playbook: racism, hatred and division, this time against Rep. Ilhan Omar and the Somali-American community,” he said. “It's disgusting. It's un-American. And it won't work.”

Progressive Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) said that Trump's comments echo the rhetoric that got a Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, assassinated in Minnesota earlier this year. 

“This is disgusting. Trump continues to put a target on @Ilhan, her family, & her community with his violent, xenophobic rhetoric,” Lee said. “A lawmaker in her home state of Minnesota was killed this year in an act of political violence. That alone should unite us against this hate speech.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How Trump is intensifying his crackdown on every form of immigration to the US","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/trump-immigration-crackdown-asylum-green-cards","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:00:59 GMT","


            President Donald Trump's latest immigration crackdown, prompted by the shooting of two National Guard members, means he has now halted or significantly tightened every legal and illegal form of foreign entry into the US, prompting widespread fear and confusion among immigrants who are unsure what will happen to their pending cases.
    


            Trump's mass deportation campaign has garnered attention for its heavy-handed arrest tactics of undocumented immigrants nationwide. But the administration's steady drumbeat of incremental changes to the US immigration system has also been disruptive — gumming up an already-arduous process for millions of people.
    


            In the days since two National Guard members were shot in DC, allegedly by an Afghan migrant, the administration has announced a handful of policy shifts, including a pause on asylum decisions, a review of cases under the Biden administration and a “reexamination” of certain green-card holders, that have wide ramifications for immigrants residing in the US.
    


            “We're going back on all of these folks that have applied for asylum, people that would be traveling to this country, and looking at more information, what their social media platforms, they may have visited, the communications that they have, biometric information and data that we can collect from them, but also from their government too,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Monday.
    


            As part of that push, Noem is recommending that Trump's travel ban list expand to include between 30 to 32 countries, an increase from the current list of 19 countries, according to a source familiar with the matter. Adding to the confusion for future travelers, it's unclear which countries are being added to the list — and when they'll be announced.
    


            US Citizenship and Immigration Services on Tuesday also paused, effective immediately, immigration applications for individuals from the current 19 countries, according to a policy memo.
    


            The administration has frequently cited national security concerns to push forward its immigration agenda and roll out restrictions.
    


            Trump administration officials and immigration hardliners have argued that doing so is necessary to fix parts of the system that, they say, have been exploited by immigrants coming into the country, or those already residing in the US. But immigration attorneys and advocates say the fits and starts and tightening of rules has slowed down an already-cumbersome system.
    


            “It's hard to predict and advise our clients on how to navigate this system,” said Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
    


            “Imagine walking in a house of mirrors blindfolded. You never know, ‘Is this a wall that I'm walking into, is there a corner, is there a way to pivot?' It's hard to give advice when every Friday there's a new announcement from the executive or a tweet with policy changes that are unpredictable,” he added.
    


Four immigration courts. One day. And a window into a world the public rarely sees



            Those changes have often been challenged in court, creating more chaos and confusion for the people navigating the system. Some immigration attorneys have advised clients to sit and wait amid the frequent whiplash and fears of being detained at routine check ins or immigration hearings. Other immigrants, meanwhile, have chosen to voluntarily depart.
    


            At times, those legal challenges have been indicative of the limitations the executive has in overhauling the US immigration system.
    


            “You have lots of control over specific levers of what happens, and you can make drastic changes in policy, but you can't wholesale change the system itself without Congress enacting legislation. I think that still holds true,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan thinktank, referring to the executive branch.
    


            For much of the first three years of President Joe Biden's administration, the southern border was overwhelmed by the number of migrants seeking to cross into the United States, driven by a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters and worsening economic conditions in Latin America.
    


            In the final year of Biden's presidency, his administration implemented restrictions along the US-Mexico border that, Homeland Security officials said, drove down border crossings.
    


            But stopping the flow of people, which Trump has repeatedly referred to as an “invasion,” remained a central tenet of his successful presidential campaign, and within hours of being sworn in for his second term, his administration took steps that effectively sought to shutter asylum at the southern border. Last month, the Supreme Court announced it would review Trump's policy of turning away asylum seekers at the border.
    


            Trump signed an executive action that declared an emergency at the border, prompting the deployment of additional military personnel to assist with logistical and bureaucratic tasks and finish Trump's long-promised border wall.
    


            In March, US Customs and Border Protection awarded the first border wall contract during Trump's second term, giving a construction company more than $70 million to construct about seven miles of barrier in southern Texas.
    


            The Trump administration has said these actions have contributed to a significant drop in crossings, claiming a significant  drop in migrant border crossings in the first 100 days of his second term.
    


            Following the shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington last week, USCIS announced it was halting all asylum decisions until “we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”
    


            There were more than 2.2 million immigrants waiting for asylum decisions or hearings as at end August 2025, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
    


            DHS also said it was reviewing all asylum decisions made during Biden's term following the shooting. The halt means that asylum seekers who might already have waited years for their cases to be resolved now face an even more uncertain future.
    


            In 1990, Congress created a temporary protected status program for people fleeing countries enduring natural disasters, wars or other conditions that would make it dangerous for people to return. The program granted these people the right to live and work in the United States for a temporary period of time that could be extended.
    


            Seventeen countries were covered by TPS designations as of late March, accounting for about 1.3 million foreign nationals living in the United States who were covered. But the Trump administration has sought to winnow back protections for citizens from several countries.
    


            In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was seeking to end TPS protections for citizens of Haiti, which had been covered under the program since the country experienced a devastating earthquake in 2010. A federal judge later blocked that move after accusing DHS of failing to follow procedures mandated by Congress.
    


            The administration has also moved to end TPS status or reverse extensions for Venezuela, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Honduras, Nicaragua and Syria.
    


            In November, DHS moved to also end TPS for South Sudan and Burma, both of which have been mired by years of civil war.
    


            As of December, 12 countries are covered under TPS, though several of their designations are set to expire next year. That timeline could change pending legal action.
    


            The Trump administration in October announced it was restricting the number of refugees the United States would admit to 7,500 each year — a miniscule amount for a country that had long been a beacon to millions of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in their home countries and had allowed refugees under programs that enjoyed bipartisan support.
    


            In 2024, the US admitted just over 100,000 refugees, primarily from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.
    


            The main group being welcomed under Trump is White South Africans. The president and officials within his administration, including his sometime adviser, billionaire South African-born Elon Musk, claim that group is facing persecution, racism, threats and murder in their home country.
    


            Both Trump and Musk alleged that White South Africans were being discriminated against due to land reform policies implemented by that country's government which sought to redress the legacy of apartheid, the system under which non-White South Africans were forcibly displaced from their lands in favor of Whites. Black South Africans, who comprise over 80% of the population of 63 million, own only around 4% of private land.
    


            The government of South Africa has strongly refuted the administration's claims that it is discriminating against its White citizens.
    


            CNN previously reported the Trump administration is also moving to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the United States under Biden as part of a comprehensive review of their cases.
    


            The shooting of guard members in Washington last week also prompted USCIS to announce “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” Green card holders have the ability to live and work permanently in the US but do not enjoy the full benefits of citizenship, including the right to vote or hold an American passport.
    


            Asked to clarify which countries were of concern, USCIS pointed CNN toward a presidential proclamation in June that named 19 countries including Cuba, Laos, Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan.
    


            Reviewing individual green card holders from each of those countries could be a monumental task requiring the administration to review the statuses of tens of thousands of people. It's unclear when the review will end.
    


            In September, the administration sought to place restrictions on certain work visas, claiming these visas were used to the detriment of American workers who were being replaced rather than supplanted by the foreign workers.
    


            Trump signed an executive action imposing a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, which are commonly used by tech companies who say the program is necessary to fill out workers who they cannot find in the United States. About 65,000 H-1B visas are granted annually, and the demand for the visas often exceeds their supply.
    


            In October, the administration announced several changes to the program, including narrowing the definition of “specialty occupation,” enhancing DHS' “ability to enforce compliance through worksite inspections,” and reforming the wage methodology that officials argued previously put American workers at a disadvantage.
    


            One industry that the president seems hesitant to restrict is agriculture, which relies heavily on both legal and undocumented immigrant labor.
    


            While the president was taking a hardline stance against undocumented immigration this summer, behind the scenes members of his administration were working to assuage concerns in that industry about the effects of an immigration crackdown, and the president's own tone toward undocumented farm workers has been noticeably softer compared to other sectors.
    


            The administration has issued thousands of fewer visas for international students than had been typical during previous years.
    


            The administration this year has also targeted the existing visas of thousands of international students, with particular attention on those who were active in campus protests that opposed Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
    


            The State Department has revoked about 6,000 student visas this year, and the administration's restrictive stance toward what students studying on visas can post to social media has discouraged others from even applying to study in the United States.
    


            Reasons for the visa revocations have ranged from high-profile cases involving allegations of support for terrorist organizations to relatively minor incidents that include years-old misdemeanor crimes.
    


            Earlier this year, the administration paid particular attention to visas for Chinese students. The Trump administration moved to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas before later reversing course.
    


            In an interview with Fox News last month, the president said he thinks “it's good” to have students from “outside countries” enrolled at American universities — and defended China while attacking France, a close American ally.

            After years of shouting on a sidewalk, street preacher Gabriel Olivier managed to make his case to the Supreme Court without raising his voice, holding a sign or calling anyone a “sissy.”
    


            Olivier wants to challenge an ordinance in federal court that was enacted by a suburban Mississippi city that bars people from protesting outside an amphitheater. But before he can advance his lawsuit, he must deal with a 1994 Supreme Court precedent that is intended to bar people convicted of a crime from using civil lawsuits to effectively reverse their convictions.
    


            Though the justices asked difficult questions of both sides during oral arguments on Wednesday, Olivier seemed likely to eke out a limited win that would allow him to continue his fight.
    


            Olivier claimed the ordinance violates his First Amendment rights to share his faith publicly. Officials from the city of Brandon asserted that Olivier was part of a group that used a loudspeaker to call people “whores,” “Jezebels” and “sissies” as they tried to enter an amphitheater to attend concerts and other events.
    


            His problem is that he was already convicted under the ordinance. And rather than raise his First Amendment claims during his criminal case, Olivier filed a subsequent civil suit seeking to hold the ordinance unconstitutional. The 1994 precedent bars people convicted of crimes from using certain civil suits as an indirect way of challenging those previous convictions.
    


            Several justices – both conservative and liberal – openly wrestled with the broad language of that precedent on the one hand, and the idea of blocking a person from challenging a possibly unconstitutional law just because they had once been convicted of that law, possibly decades ago.
    


            “What you're basically saying is, simply because they've been previously convicted, they cannot seek prospective relief 20 years from now,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court's liberal wing, told the attorney for the city.
    


            Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, suggested it might be a “stretch” to interpret the 1994 decision in Heck v. Humphrey as meaning that a person is “forever barred from engaging in what you think is protected First Amendment activity because you were previously convicted under this statute and received, more or less, a slap on the wrist.”
    


            The arguments turned almost entirely on how to interpret that precedent, written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, which was intended to block people convicted of a crime from filing a civil suit against police or other officials that would, if successful, effectively let them invalidate their conviction. If a court reviewing that civil suit found an underlying law unconstitutional, people guilty of violating it would almost certainly seek to toss their conviction.
    


            Olivier has said he would not do so – that he only wants to block future enforcement of the ordinance.
    


            Alito was a particularly interesting questioner during the arguments, which lasted just under 90 minutes. Though at times he seemed sympathetic to Olivier's position, he posed tough questions to his attorney as well about the precedent.
    


            “In order for you to win, would it not be necessary for us to backtrack on a number of things that the court said in Heck?” Alito asked at one point.
    


            “How,” he asked, could Olivier's position “be consistent with that?”
    


            Though the case is technical, the court's decision could have broad implications for similar ordinances across the country. Local governments fear Olivier's position will create new legal challenges to parade permitting requirements, zoning rules for adult businesses and regulations around homeless encampments.
    


Supreme Court flicks at First Amendment concerns with state's subpoena of faith-based pregnancy centers



            The conservative 6-3 Supreme Court has repeatedly sided with religious claims in recent years, although Olivier's case at this point is not directly about the First Amendment. There has also been a thorny debate percolating over the extent to which Americans can sue officials under a civil rights law Olivier is relying on for his case, a dispute that came into sharper view in an unrelated case earlier this year.
    


            Olivier is represented in part by First Liberty Institute, a group that has brought several successful religious appeals to the Supreme Court in recent years.
    


            Olivier traveled to Brandon several times in 2018 and 2019 to share his faith on sidewalks near the city's amphitheater. In 2019, the city passed an ordinance requiring protesters to gather in a designated area about 265 feet away. It banned loudspeakers that could be heard more than 100 feet and required signs – regardless of their message – to be handheld.
    


            The city described the protests as chaotic. The group sometimes held large signs depicting aborted fetuses, it said. Concertgoers would walk into traffic to avoid the group. Police would have to intervene to prevent fights between the group and attendees, the city said.
    


            In 2021, as concertgoers arrived to hear country music artist Lee Brice perform, police advised Olivier and his group to move to the designated area. Olivier declined, according to court records, and was arrested for violating the ordinance. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to a fine and a year's unsupervised probation.
    


            Another theme that several justices raised is what would happen if a third party – say, another person in Olivier's group, who had not been convicted of violating the law – brought a civil suit challenging the same law. In that circumstance, Olivier would benefit in the same way as if he had brought the civil challenge himself.
    


            “The thing that makes your case a little quirky, this case, is the friend, the compatriot who is doing exactly the same thing,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked the attorney for the city. “And no one is suggesting that he couldn't get a pre-enforcement challenge.”
    


            That is precisely what happened in Olivier's case. Another protester outside the concert who was not arrested, Spring Siders, attempted to join the suit. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals concluded Siders was unlikely to win the case because the ordinance is content-neutral and justified to ensure public safety.
    


            A decision is expected next year.

A deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky stemmed from from corporate choices that favored profits over safety, according to a lawyer who filed two wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday, which allege the company kept flying older aircraft without increasing maintenance beyond what's regularly scheduled.

Last month's fiery crash happened during takeoff after the plane's left engine detached, and cracks were later found where the engine connected to the wing, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The lawsuit also names General Electric, which made the plane's engine. Both UPS and GE said they don't comment on pending lawsuits and that safety is a top priority as they assist the federal investigation.

Robert Clifford, a lawyer representing two of the victims killed on the ground, said those cracks show the MD-11 jets, which average more than 30 years old, are too dangerous for package delivery companies to keep in the air. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded all MD-11s, which have been exclusively hauling cargo for more than a decade.

Three pilots and 11 people on the ground were killed on Nov. 4 when the plane, fully loaded with fuel for a flight to Hawaii, plowed into businesses just outside the airport in Louisville, where UPS has its largest package delivery hub. 

Clifford said UPS was saving money and aircraft downtime by keeping “old, tired” planes in the air while not increasing the number of inspections. Fellow attorney Bradley Cosgrove said at a news conference that they believe inspections should have found the cracks cited by federal investigators, adding, “This plane should have never been in the air.”

The lawsuits filed in state court are on behalf of the families of Angela Anderson, 45, who was shopping at a business by the airport, and Trinadette “Trina” Chavez, 37, who was working at Grade A Auto Parts. 




“We intend to stand up for ‘Nena' and fight for her, no matter how long it takes, just like Nena always did for us,” said Chavez's sister, Gabriela Hermosillo-Nunez, calling her by another nickname that her eight younger brothers and sisters used.

The suit also names Boeing, which acquired the original manufacturer of the plane McDonell Douglas, and VT San Antonio Aerospace, Inc., which inspected and maintained the plane. The two companies did not immediately respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.

The jet that crashed had just finished more than six weeks of extensive maintenance, completed Oct. 18, in which VT San Antonio Aerospace crews repaired significant structural issues, according to the lawsuits. Those included repairing a crack in the center wing fuel tank, addressing corrosion on structural components, and lubricating parts involved in attaching the engine to the wing.

The engine mount hadn't undergone a detailed inspection since 2021, and the plane wasn't due for another detailed inspection of that part for another 7,000 takeoffs and landings.

After the crash, federal investigators grounded all 109 of the remaining MD-11s used by UPS, FedEx and Western Global for inspections and repairs, but the FAA hasn't said what will be required. 

The aircraft make up about 9% of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of FedEx's fleet. If massive repairs or overhauls are ordered, experts said package delivery companies may find replacing them the better option. UPS announced last week it didn't expect the MD-11s to be back in the sky until at least after the holiday season.

The legal battles stemming from the crash are likely just beginning. UPS was named as a defendant in a federal lawsuit filed last month accusing it of negligence and wanton conduct. The crash “acted like a bomb” and the plaintiffs had their lives and businesses “turned upside down” as a result, the suit said.

Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson reports the latest on the Trump administration's crackdown on narco-terrorism. Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino also joined 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in and discuss why land targets could be next.

Venezuela will continue accepting deportation flights from the U.S. at the request of President Donald Trump's administration, the country announced Tuesday.

Trump threatened to declare the airspace ""above and surrounding"" Venezuela to be ""closed in its entirety,"" causing Venezuela to cancel the twice-weekly flights of migrants from the U.S. on Saturday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on Tuesday that, at the request of the Trump administration, those flights have now resumed.

Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital of Caracas on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.

Venezuela previously had a longstanding policy of not accepting deportation flights from the U.S. but Maduro's regime conceded under pressure from Trump earlier this year. The deportation flights are one of the few areas of cooperation between the U.S. and Venezuela as tension between the countries grows.

U.S. strikes have targeted alleged narco-traffickers operating in the Caribbean near Venezuela. Trump has signaled that operations could expand to land-based targets as Washington increases pressure on Maduro to relinquish power.

""You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,"" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet at the White House. ""We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.""

Dozens of U.S. bombers have deployed to the region alongside the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, underscoring the scale of the buildup. With U.S. bombers and the Ford already positioned in the region, much of the world is waiting to see whether Trump will green-light the next phase of strikes against Venezuelan targets.

Trump presented Maduro with an ultimatum during a recent phone call, demanding that he step down or face potential U.S. military action. Maduro sought global amnesty for himself, demanded to retain control of the military and resisted an immediate exit from power, the Miami Herald reported.

Rev. Phil Phaneuf told the North Chili congregation about plans to begin a gender transition during a Nov. 23 sermon in Rochester, New York. (Phil Phaneuf)

A Methodist pastor in New York revealed last week plans to transition into a woman and said the 51-year-old now identifies as asexual.

Rev. Phillip Phaneuf, of North Chili United Methodist Church in Rochester, made the announcement during a Nov. 23 Sunday service. The personal update was delivered from the pulpit while wearing a rainbow stole.

""So I get to announce with joy that I'm transitioning,"" Phaneuf said. ""I'm affirming to all of you that I am transgender. The best way to put this is that I'm not becoming a woman, I'm giving up pretending to be a man. This is a process, and it may be shocking for some as to what this all means.""

Phaneuf added that the pastor's sexuality is now asexual, an orientation in which a person experiences little or no sexual attraction to others.

""I'm in the category of what they call asexual,"" Phaneuf said. ""I've been that way since we've all been together, in that I am not living my life in a way that involves looking for romance.""

Phaneuf said the name will be changed to Phillippa, and the preferred pronouns are she/her. Hormone replacement therapy has been underway for the past three months, Phaneuf confirmed, and changes to appearance, voice and hair are expected.

Phaneuf told Fox News Digital Tuesday that the details of the transition process are accurate and that the community has been extremely welcoming.

""Since coming out to my congregation, they have been overwhelmingly affirming!"" Phaneuf said.

The pastor said the bishop, church and theology support the transition, noting that the bishop was consulted before the announcement and that any pastoral duties at the church will not be affected. ""What will stay the same is my deepening love for all of you,"" Phaneuf said.

The 51-year-old's parents, however, do not support the decision. ""They asked me to tell you all that they do not support me,"" Phaneuf announced during the sermon. ""They asked me to tell you this.""

Rep.-elect Matt Van Epps (R-TN) won Tuesday night's special election in Tennessee‘s 7th Congressional District, beating Democrat Aftyn Behn by a larger margin than last-minute polling showed. However, there were still significant Democratic gains in the district.

The outcome of the special election was thrown up in the air last week when an election tracker and a new poll suggested the race would have been tighter. Inside Elections shifted its rating for the district from “safe Republican” to “lean Republican” in response to a poll conducted by Emerson College and the Hill that showed 48% of voters supporting Van Epps and 46% supporting Behn.

Much of the language ahead of the election framed it as a tight race.

As of Wednesday morning, Van Epps secured the victory by 9 percentage points with almost all votes counted. Van Epps garnered nearly 54% of the votes, compared to Behn's 45%.

While the larger-than-expected win is a good sign for Republicans heading into next year's midterm elections, Van Epps underperformed compared to President Donald Trump and former Rep. Mark Green, who both won the district by more than 20 points last year.

The congressman-elect is filling the seat vacated by Green, who announced his retirement in June after winning the 2024 election.

Furthermore, Democrats made positive gains in every county across the district. Every county shifted blue compared to last year's presidential election, according to the election results published by the New York Times. Davidson County, the only county that Behn won, shifted leftward by 20 points. That county includes Nashville, a predominantly liberal city in an otherwise red state.

“Aftyn Behn's overperformance in this Trump +22 district is historic and a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement. “Aftyn centered her campaign on lowering grocery, housing, and health care costs for Tennessee families.”

If Behn had won the entire district, she would have joined the trend of Democratic victories upsetting Republicans in the 2025 election cycle.

Democrats have become especially confident after winning the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey ahead of the 2026 elections, in which all House seats will be up for grabs.

Van Epps is the latest Republican to boost the House GOP's narrow majority.

REPUBLICAN MATT VAN EPPS WINS TENNESSEE SPECIAL ELECTION, DASHING DEMOCRATIC HOPES OF UPSET

While Trump was quick to celebrate the incoming congressman's victory in a Truth Social post, Democrats warned Republicans to watch out next year.

“Tonight's results make it clear: No House Republican's reelection should be considered safe next November,” House Majority PAC spokesman CJ Warnke said. “National Republicans were forced to pull out all the stops, spending nearly $4 million and investing in a massive turnout operation, all to salvage their candidate in a district that voted for Trump by 22% last year.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In global financial markets, quietly, silver has become the hot precious metal. Currently, silver is trading at around $59 per ounce, a price appreciation of around 80% since the beginning of the year. 

In the last 50 years, the price of silver has spiked three times. In the early 1980s, the Hunt Brothers tried to corner the market for silver. That speculation failed, and the price of silver went down as fast as it went up. Later in 2011, when rating agencies downgraded the sovereign debt of the United States because of the large federal deficit, the price of silver soared yet again. Investors and traders saw silver, like gold, as a safe-haven asset. But just like the early 1980s, the price of silver then dropped precipitously. Today, silver is again moving sharply higher. This time, however, it appears that the price appreciation of this precious metal has some fundamental weight behind it.

Industrial uses for silver are growing. Silver has strong electrical conductivity, more than gold or copper. Silver is increasingly used in electric vehicles, solar panels, and in the infrastructure necessary for the artificial intelligence complex. As EV companies begin to use solid-state batteries, demand for silver could increase dramatically. Today's lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries use a few ounces of silver. Solid-state EV batteries could use 2 pounds or more of precious metal. 

Demand for silver is also rising because of economic growth in India. The country is rapidly becoming an economic powerhouse, with GDP growth in the September quarter exceeding 8%. The 1.46 billion people there are avid consumers of gold and silver. Over 50% of India's economy is based on the agricultural sector. Agriculture workers often cannot afford gold, but they can afford silver. As the country's economy expands, demand for silver arguably should rise proportionately. 

Silver is also an important financial diversification asset. Today, demand for precious metals, gold and silver especially, is high, in part, because of fears that central governments around the world will debase their currencies in the face of high fiscal deficits. Many American investors are afraid that the federal government will try to reduce the burden of the federal deficit through inflation.

Most immediately, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, will leave his office in May 2026. Powell has been a good steward of monetary policy. Financial markets are skeptical that the next chair of the board will be as responsible. The market believes that President Donald Trump will select Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser. Hassett is a dove on monetary policy. His focus would be on higher economic growth, not on low contained inflation. Precious metals, including silver, are viewed as good hedges against inflation and lax monetary policy.

Globally, silver production has been declining for a decade. Production from silver mines in both Argentina and Peru has been especially weak. Because demand is rising for this precious metal and supply is declining, some analysts believe the price of silver can increase substantially from current levels, perhaps as high as $100 an ounce. Time will tell.  

Silver is a commodity. Silver is a volatile asset. Because of its volatility, silver is known as the “devil's metal.” Trading silver is not for widows and orphans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Lawmakers see major stock returns after entering leadership: Study","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3904764/lawmakers-stock-picking-boost-after-joining-leadership-study/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Members of congressional leadership far outperform other lawmakers in picking stocks, according to new research that could boost efforts to curb stock trading on Capitol Hill.

The research, circulated this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, used transaction-level data to track the stock trades of members. It found that lawmakers outperform their peers by a whopping 47% annually after entering leadership.

ANNA PAULINA LUNA FILES PETITION TO FORCE A VOTE ON CONGRESSIONAL STOCK TRADE BAN

The authors of the study, Shang-Jin Wei of Columbia University and NBER, and Yifan Zhou of Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, surmise that congressional leaders are able to garner outsize returns through their sway in Congress and their connections to businesses, which they term, respectively, the political influence channel and the corporate access channel.

“The political influence channel is reflected in higher returns when their party controls the chamber, sales of stocks preceding regulatory actions, and purchase of stocks whose firms receiving more government contracts and favorable party support on bills,” the study reads.

Meanwhile, the researchers found that the corporate access channel is reflected in trades that “predict subsequent corporate news and greater returns on donor-owned or home-state firms.”

Wei pointed out during an interview with the Washington Examiner that another key aspect of the research is that it controls for peer comparisons. Essentially, the research indicates that those making big gains in leadership were basically getting the same returns as their peers before entering into leadership.

Wei noted that it is important because the argument could be made that those members in leadership who make outsize returns on trades tend to be smarter or savvier, which could also be why they ended up in leadership to begin with.

“So the same people, before they became leaders, they didn't do very well. They did essentially the same as other members of Congress,” Wei said.

He said that assuming leadership led to a “tremendous improvement in the trading gains.”

One hypothesized reason for ithe mprovement of trading returns for leadership falls into the political information and influence channel, according to the paper. Basically, trading on advanced knowledge of regulatory actions or the legislative agenda.

The researchers point out that, for instance, the House speaker and Senate majority leader can choose whether to put bills on the floor for votes, which would affect the stock prices of companies that are influenced by the legislation.

The other channel the authors hypothesize could influence the outsized stock gains is through corporate access.  Essentially, leadership might gain better access to non-public corporate information, such as potential lawsuits or R&D breakthroughs, that run-of-the-mill members might not be privy to.

“While corporations might wish to ingratiate all politicians, there is a cost in sharing non-public information about corporate fundamentals, including the possibility of legal liabilities,” the study reads. “If firms have to decide which subset of politicians to share the information based on some notion of a cost-benefit ratio, they may prioritize congressional leaders ahead of ‘regular' members of Congress.”

The new research poses important questions about congressional stock trading, particularly as some lawmakers look to reform the process.

On Tuesday, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) filed a discharge petition that would force a vote on banning congressional stock trading. Members of both parties have sought to ban or limit stock trading in Congress in recent years.

“Across the country, from every political background, the American people agree on one thing: Members of Congress should not be enriching themselves with insider trading,” Luna wrote on X. “This is one of the most popular, most supported bipartisan issues in the entire country. Americans deserve a Congress that works for them, not for special interests or personal portfolios.”

Also this week, a group of dozens of former Republican and Democratic lawmakers urged House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to bring the bipartisan Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would ban congressional stock trading, to a floor vote.

“Public trust in the federal government is at historic lows,” the letter reads. “Enacting this critical reform would be a powerful step toward rebuilding that trust, addressing real and perceived conflicts of interest, and demonstrating that members of Congress prioritize the institution's integrity and their commitment to their constituents above personal gain.”

PELOSI'S RETIREMENT OFFERS 278 MILLION REASONS TO BAN STOCK TRADING

Some lawmakers in leadership have received significant scrutiny for their stock trading while in Congress.

For instance, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attracted considerable attention for trades made by her husband, which have netted the family millions of dollars. In the past three years, the volume of her disclosed trades was about $59 million.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Hegseth Risked Endangering Troops With Signal Messages","https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/hegseth-signalgate-trump-defense-pentagon/684997/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:02:34 GMT","

An inspector-general report finds that the defense secretary violated his department's policies.

For nearly nine months, Trump-administration officials have defended top national-security leaders who shared information in a Signal chat about U.S. strikes in Yemen, first reported by The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, who was inadvertently included in the group. Officials played down the severity of the breach and insisted that the information wasn't classified.

Now the Pentagon's top watchdog has concluded that the information Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared in the chat could have put the mission, U.S. personnel, and national security at risk had it fallen into the wrong hands. The information Hegseth shared included the precise times that fighter pilots would attack their targets. If Houthi militants had learned those details in advance, they might have been able to shoot down American planes or better defend their positions.

The Defense Department inspector general found that while the mission ultimately was not jeopardized, Hegseth violated his department's own policies when he used Signal, a commercial messaging app that is not approved for sharing classified information. The IG's report, scheduled to be published on Thursday, was described to us by numerous U.S. officials familiar with its findings.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did an attorney for Hegseth.

Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said that the report found Hegseth was in violation of Pentagon regulations. “They very clearly stated he should not be using his cellphone and putting this kind of information on an unclassified system,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The report also found that the information Hegseth shared was classified at the time he received it. (Trump administration officials had tried publicly to argue otherwise.) Battlefield information like what Hegseth shared is routinely classified because of the risk it would pose to U.S. forces were it exposed. Classified information is normally transmitted over approved, secure government systems. U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East, had classified the information about the air strike as secret, according to defense officials who spoke with us on the condition of anonymity.

But the report also found that Hegseth, as the secretary, had the authority to declassify information, Kelly noted. Less clear is why Hegseth thought it was appropriate or necessary to do so.

The inspector general's office, led by acting director Steven Stebbins, also noted that Hegseth is hardly the only official to have used the encrypted messaging app.

What is known is that Hegseth's communications included the precise times that U.S. fighter planes would attack their targets, the sort of information ordinarily shared only on secure platforms. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. Current and former government officials have told us that if lower-level employees shared such sensitive information on a commercial platform, they would certainly be fired and possibly be prosecuted.

The inspector general's conclusions seem likely to create an impression among the military rank and file that there are two sets of rules: one for the Defense Department's presidentially appointed leadership, and one for everyone else.

The inspector general's findings may also compound the criticism that Hegseth has been facing since he assumed office. Critics—including people within the Trump administration—have complained about his chaotic management, which has been marred by infighting among senior aides, and they say that Hegseth has spent more time focused on personnel issues and physical-fitness standards than running the world's most advanced military. A number of Democrats and at least one Republican have called for him to resign. And now two congressional committees led by Republicans have said that they will investigate a report in The Washington Post that Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors in a September military strike on an alleged drug boat, leading the United States to conduct a follow-up strike that killed two people who survived the initial attack. Some legal experts have said that such an order could be a war crime. During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said that he “did not personally see survivors” clinging to the boat after a first strike, and he has denied knowing that a second strike could have hit them.

Signalgate became a shorthand for ineptitude at the highest reaches of the administration. Foreign allies told us that they felt justified in their earlier reluctance to share their secrets with the United States, given President Donald Trump's long history of mishandling classified information. Interspersed in the chat—along with questions about the wisdom of conducting the Yemen strike and details about weapons packages, targets, and timing—were emoji, exclamation points, acronyms, and several words in all caps. “PATHETIC,” Hegseth wrote to describe Europe's response to threats to a key shipping lane.

The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. Indeed, inside much of the Pentagon, personnel are not even allowed to bring their cellphones into their office; instead, they have to keep them outside their door in storage lockers.

The government has its own systems for communicating classified information. When officials want to discuss military activity, they customarily go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or they communicate only on approved government equipment.

The Signal group chat concerning Yemen turned out to be just one of at least a dozen such groups that administration officials had used to conduct government business, former and current officials told us.

The inspector general's report examined only Hegseth, not other senior officials in the Signal chat whose actions aren't under the Pentagon's jurisdiction, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Vice President J. D. Vance, and then–National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, now the ambassador to the United Nations. Waltz set up the “Houthi PC small group” chat in the first place and inadvertently added Goldberg. There are no comparable reviews planned for these officials or other members of the chat.

The unprecedented security breach revealed the Trump administration's casual approach to handling some of the country's most sensitive information. The information about the precise times that U.S. fighter jets would be over their targets in Yemen could have helped Houthi rebels shoot the planes down if it were exposed. “We are currently clean on OPSEC,” or operations security, Hegseth wrote in the chat, unaware the group clearly wasn't.

The story became comedy gold for late-night hosts. (Saturday Night Live reimagined it as the show's cold open.) Perhaps the fiasco resonated so widely because it was simultaneously so relatable and so reckless. Who hasn't felt the chagrin of accidentally posting in the wrong group chat or hitting “Reply All” to an office email? And also: The senior-most government leaders in the United States did what with their secret attack plans?

Hegseth, a former National Guard soldier and Fox News host, has faced other questions about his professional and personal judgment since his nomination last fall. During his confirmation process, he defended himself against allegations of heavy drinking and sexual assault, which he denied. Since taking office, scrutiny has intensified as he has summarily fired scores of senior military officers without cause, focused on personnel issues such as service members' weight and hair, and departed from precedent by launching sharp partisan attacks.

The Signal chat also revealed disagreement at the highest levels of the administration about the wisdom of the strikes and—more broadly—how the Trump administration should employ the military and when it should leave the world's problems to others. Trump and members of his administration have emphasized that the attack itself was a success despite the security breach.

In May, the president decided to stop bombing Houthi targets and declared victory, even though the group retained significant fighting power and had vowed to keep attacking Israel, which the strikes were originally intended to prevent.

Signalgate generated a rare acknowledgment from Trump that his administration may have made a mistake. In a Truth Social post criticizing Goldberg's prior reporting about him, Trump acknowledged that he was “somewhat more ‘successful'” with the Signal story.

“I think we learned: Maybe don't use Signal, okay?” Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic. “If you want to know the truth. I would frankly tell these people not to use Signal, although it's been used by a lot of people. But, whatever it is, whoever has it, whoever owns it, I wouldn't want to use it.”

Read: ‘I run the country and the world'

After the strike on the Houthis, The Atlantic reported on the existence of the Signal group and broadly described the kind of information that top national-security officials had shared, but at first chose to leave out some of the most sensitive information, including Hegseth's text about the strike's timing. Journalists frequently choose to withhold these kinds of details, as well as information about intelligence sources, to strike a balance between legitimate national-security concerns and the public's need to know about government misconduct.

But after the initial story was published, Trump-administration officials, and the president himself, claimed that the information in the text chain wasn't classified, stunning national-security experts and defying common sense. Operational information of the sort that Hegseth shared is routinely classified because its exposure could jeopardize a mission and risk the lives of U.S. forces.

Administration officials also accused The Atlantic of misrepresenting the information in the Signal chat and exaggerating the severity of the security breach. The magazine then shared the full text of the chat.

And two other ideas for lowering electricity costs.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Electricity prices are becoming an outsize issue in American politics because they themselves are legitimately outsize. Compared with the cost of consumer goods, which have been rising rapidly over the past few years, electricity prices are climbing even faster, an estimated 13 percent nationwide since 2022. This year, roughly half of households making less than $50,000 struggled to pay their electricity bills. In California, where the rise has been particularly steep, rates have essentially doubled over the past decade.



When electricity was first commercialized, utilities were allowed to operate as monopolies for one main reason: to deliver lower costs. For a century, it worked. Companies spread the fixed costs of growing the system across their locked-in customers, and prices dropped precipitously. In 1890, a kilowatt-hour was $9.48 on average nationwide in today's dollars; by 1950, it had dropped to 41 cents and, by 1990, to 21 cents. But recently, this century-long trend has reversed in many states; utilities are failing to keep prices low.



Prices are rising for many reasons, not all of which apply in every state. In some states, data centers are pushing up rates. In others, wildfire costs are showing up on bills. Despite what President Donald Trump has argued, higher prices have little to do with the country's move toward clean energy. If anything, Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act has made it harder to invest in the cheapest ways of building new solar, wind, and batteries.



Ignoring those technologies will make electricity only more expensive in the years to come. If regulators, policy makers, and utility executives actually want to lower prices, they will have to deal strategically with both the clean-energy boom and climate change's strain on the electricity system.



Clean energy is cheap energy. Building a large-scale solar or wind project costs less than a new gas plant, and solar and wind require no fuel to operate, making each additional kilowatt-hour essentially free. When combined with batteries, these projects can now operate like traditional power plants, providing power on demand.



In places with a lot of solar, including California, some installations are producing more energy than is being consumed, so some power is being wasted. If people shifted more of their electricity use toward the middle of the day, the grid's overall costs would go down, because demand would decrease in later hours, when prices are the highest. And the easiest way to nudge people toward using that midday power is to make it cheaper—or even free.



Like California, Australia has an enormous amount of solar. The country's climate-change-and-energy minister just announced that, starting in July, electricity suppliers will be required to offer at least three free hours of midday power in some regions. This will give people a reason to charge their electric vehicles, use heat pumps to precool or preheat their homes and water, and store more clean electricity in batteries when cheap energy is abundant. Later in the day, when the system relies on dirtier and more expensive energy sources, people will likely demand less power, reducing costs for everyone.



Plenty of places in the U.S. could try this, too. The states with the most solar, including California and Texas, are already wasting about 10 percent of their solar energy. But utilities and regulators have done little to set electricity prices lower during the day. The closest anyone has come is in California, where, as part of a regulatory proceeding, San Diego Gas & Electric agreed in September to create a lower-cost period from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. In the long run, as solar and wind supply more and more of Americans' power, aligning electricity rates with clean energy's availability could allow the grid to operate more cheaply.



If the first clear way to cut electricity bills is strategically lowering prices for customers, the second is strategically cutting back profits for utilities. Even as consumers' bills rose, California's Pacific Gas and Electric, for example, reported record profits—$2.47 billion last year. North Carolina's Duke Energy had profits north of $4 billion.



Legislators could trim these profits directly by more closely aligning utilities' guaranteed rates of return with their actual costs. Such adjustments could also limit utilities' endless quest for more infrastructure. Right now, a utility could make tens of millions of dollars on, say, putting a transmission line underground, because those that operate as monopolies (that is, most of them) can charge customers for almost every dollar spent expanding the transmission-and-distribution system—plus a profit. So more spending equals more profits, a perverse incentive called “gold-plating.”



One solution is to have states build the transmission system instead. A new law in California will pilot this idea, using a fund to publicly finance transmission. This will not only reduce utility profits, lowering electricity bills; it will also make electricity costs less regressive by shifting the burden from lower-income people onto the wider tax base.



A third way to lower prices is to take the costs of climate impacts out of electricity bills. As wildfires rip across the West, their damages are being borne by utility customers. This is a major reason that costs in California are so high. To take one example, the 2017 Thomas Fire created $2.4 billion in liabilities for Southern California Edison, which sparked the fire; its customers (myself included) are now on the hook for two-thirds of those costs. (The company, like PG&E, posted record profits last year.) If companies aren't charging ratepayers for fire damage, then they might be charging them for the anticipated costs of fires. In Utah, the legislature passed a law that allows Rocky Mountain Power to proactively collect revenue from customers for a “fire fund.” In Colorado, regulators approved a $1.9 billion plan to harden against future wildfires, jacking up bills by 10 percent.



Other climate impacts are increasing electricity rates, too. Hurricane-prone places such as Florida are also hardening their grids, driving rate increases. The climate scientist Andrew Dessler has estimated that Texas's electricity prices were 16 percent higher in 2023 because of the demand driven by climate-change-induced heat waves. FEMA's recent decision not to cover the utilities' damages from a brutal ice storm in Michigan—which may have been more likely because of climate change—could mean that rural customers will be paying $4,500 each to cover the bill.



Passing on these climate costs to ratepayers is not the only way of dealing with them. Hawaii's legislature decided to limit the local utility's liability for the deadly Maui fires and to use state funds to compensate survivors. Policy makers can also keep utilities from making a profit on wildfire mitigation and other grid-hardening costs, as California has recently done.



Alternatively, fossil-fuel companies could pay. Climate-attribution science is now able to quickly say how much more likely climate change made a given weather event and then, using data on historic emissions, apportion blame to individual fossil-fuel companies. In other contexts, lawyers are trying to use this type of information to hold companies legally liable for climate damages. Similarly, insurers could try to recoup their costs from these companies as one California bill proposed.



If regulators don't take action, electricity bills will continue to rise. And that failure will have rippling effects. Ultimately, the way out of burning fossil fuels is by electrifying our homes, cars and businesses, running them instead on clean power. If as a country we cannot keep electricity bills low, then we won't be able to electrify fast enough to avoid still-worse impacts of climate change. This is why putting climate damages on electricity bills is so problematic. If climate change makes electricity less affordable, then addressing climate change with electrification becomes harder, and we get stuck in a vicious cycle of paying more to live in an ever-hotter world.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have bounced back this week as the market braces for a massive Federal Reserve December flip.

The bitcoin price has charted its best day since May as it adds 10% to top $93,000, up from lows of under $84,000 earlier this week and putting it back within touching distance of a $2 trillion market capitalization, with traders betting on a 2026 game-changer.

Now, as an “important” bitcoin price signal suddenly starts flashing, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock has predicted the “enormous growth” of crypto-based tokenization in coming years.

""Tokenisation could advance at the pace of the internet—faster than most expect, with enormous growth over the coming decades,"" Larry Fink, who leads the $10 trillion BlackRock, wrote in The Economist, suggesting the market could grow at the same pace seen by the world's biggest technology companies in recent years.

“If history is any guide, tokenisation today is roughly where the internet was in 1996—when Amazon had sold just $16 million-worth of books, and three of the rest of today's “Magnificent Seven” tech giants hadn't even been founded.”

Tokenization, the processes of creating a crypto-based, digital version of real-world and financial assets, has been popularized on Wall Street by Fink.

“In the future, people won't keep stocks and bonds in one portfolio and crypto in another,” Fink wrote. “Assets of all kinds could one day be bought, sold and held through a single digital wallet.”

Fink threw BlackRock's weight behind a decade-long push to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to Wall Street in 2023, calling it the first step towards a blockchain-based tokenized revolution that he believes will help democratize finance.

""Tokens that represent ‘real-world' traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds and so on) remain a tiny share of global equity and fixed-income markets but are growing fast—up roughly 300% in the past 20 months,"" Fink wrote, adding: “It started in 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous developer, launched bitcoin as a shared digital ledger that could record transactions without intermediaries.”

BlackRock's bitcoin ETF has led the market since a dozen such funds were launched in early 2023, far outpacing the growth of gold ETFs and opening the floodgates for many other cryptocurrencies to get ETFs of their own.

Fink's support for bitcoin and crypto helped legitimize the technology that was generally dismissed by large swathes of traditional finance and paved the way for U.S. president Donald Trump to embrace bitcoin and crypto in the run up the 2024 presidential election that returned him to the White House.

""At first it was hard for the financial world—including us—to see the big idea,"" Fink wrote. ""Tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which often looked like speculation. But in recent years traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto Asset Management firm Bitwise said Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade, expected to go live later Wednesday, is the kind of unflashy infrastructure change markets tend to overlook in real time, and then credit later for making the network feel sturdier and more investable.

The upgrade is constructive for Ethereum over time because it expands capacity, improves validator efficiency as rollups grow and, most importantly, strengthens the blockchain's ability to capture value from layer-2 activity, wrote analyst Max Shannon.

Fusaka also raises the layer-1 gas limit to 60 million per block, a move that should lift throughput and take some pressure off fees, roughly doubling capacity over a year, by Shannon's estimate.

On the validator side, PeerDAS reduces the data burden needed to verify blobs, helping Ethereum scale without pushing node requirements out of reach, the report said.

Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, which went live in March last year, introduced blobs, which attach large data chunks to regular transactions, storing data offchain without congesting the mainnet, unlike call data which is stored permanently.

The biggest change, though, is economic, the analyst said. Fusaka introduces a minimum blob base fee (EIP-7918), addressing a post-Dencun quirk where fees can sink to near zero in quiet periods, dampening ETH burn and weakening the link between real usage and value accrual. 

Under Fusaka, the blob fee gets a floor tied to execution fees, roughly the execution base fee divided by 16, creating a more consistent revenue and burn stream as stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization migrate to rollups, the analyst said.

Bitwise cautioned that upgrades don't reliably spark lasting ether price pops, there's often a mild sell-the-news pattern, but argued that Fusaka further cements Ethereum's role as the settlement layer for on-chain, increasingly institutional, finance.

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.

In this issue:

FUSAKA WILL GO LIVE ON ETHEREUM: Ethereum developers are preparing for the network's second upgrade of 2025 to go live later today. Fusaka – a blend of the names Fulu + Osaka – consists of two upgrades happening on Ethereum's consensus and execution layers at the same time. The goal of the upgrade is to enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction throughput from the layer-2 chains that use the blockchain as their base layer. Fusaka consists of 12 code changes, also known as “Ethereum Improvement Proposals” (EIPs) that will make the layer-2 experience faster and cheaper. The biggest change in Fusaka is known as PeerDAS, which allows validators to check only segments of data instead of full “blobs,” easing bandwidth demands and lowering expenses for both validators and layer-2 networks. Layer 2s currently submit thousands of transactions to Ethereum via “blobs,” where validators currently on the Ethereum blockchain have to download all of the transaction data from the blob to verify it is accurate, creating bottlenecks. With this improvement, those validators will only need to verify a fraction of a blob, speeding up the process and lowering the transaction fees that come with it. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

ANTHROPIC STUDY ON DEFI AI AGENTS: AI agents are getting good enough at finding attack vectors in smart contracts that they can already be weaponized by bad actors, according to new research published by the Anthropic Fellows program. A study by the ML Alignment & Theory Scholars Program (MATS) and the Anthropic Fellows program tested frontier models against SCONE-bench, a dataset of 405 exploited contracts. GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 collectively produced $4.6 million in simulated exploits on contracts hacked after their knowledge cutoffs, offering a lower bound on what this generation of AI could have stolen in the wild. The team found that frontier models did not just identify bugs. They were able to synthesize full exploit scripts, sequence transactions and drain simulated liquidity in ways that closely mirror real attacks on the Ethereum and BNB Chain blockchains. The paper also tested whether current models could find vulnerabilities that had not yet been exploited. GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 scanned 2,849 recently deployed BNB Chain contracts that showed no signs of prior compromise. Both models uncovered two zero-day flaws worth $3,694 in simulated profit. One stemmed from a missing view modifier in a public function that allowed the agent to inflate its token balance. Another allowed a caller to redirect fee withdrawals by supplying an arbitrary beneficiary address. In both cases, the agents generated executable scripts that converted the flaw into profit. Although the dollar amounts were small, the discovery matters because it shows that profitable autonomous exploitation is technically feasible. — Sam Reynolds Read more.

ETHEREUM DEVELOPERS PUSH ZK PROTOCOL FOR PRIVACY: Ethereum developers are refining a zero-knowledge protocol designed to bring stronger privacy guarantees to on-chain interactions, starting with a “Secret Santa”-style matching system that could evolve into a broader toolkit for private coordination. Solidity engineer Artem Chystiakov resurfaced the research on Monday in an Ethereum community forum post, pointing to work he first published in January on arXiv.The idea aims to recreate the anonymous gift-exchange game on Ethereum, where participants are randomly matched without anyone learning who is sending to whom. Doing that on a transparent blockchain, however, requires solving several long-standing issues around randomness, privacy and Sybil-resistance. Chystiakov said the core problems are straightforward: “Everything on Ethereum is visible to everyone,” blockchains do not provide true randomness, and the system must prevent users from registering multiple times or assigning gifts to themselves. The proposed protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify sender–receiver relationships without revealing identities, and a transaction relayer to submit moves so individual wallets cannot be linked to actions. In the proof-of-concept, participants register their Ethereum addresses in a smart contract and commit to a unique digital signature, which blocks duplicate entries. Each participant then submits a random number to a shared list through the relayer. Because the relayer broadcasts the transactions, no one can tell which address contributed which number. Receivers encrypt their delivery details using these shared numbers, ensuring only their assigned counterpart can decrypt them. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

BITNOMIAL ROLLS OUT SPOT TRADING IN U.S.: Bitnomial, a Chicago-based derivatives exchange, is preparing to roll out the first spot cryptocurrency trading platform overseen by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Chicago-based derivatives exchange's self-certified rules became effective last week, authorizing it to list both leveraged and non-leveraged spot crypto products. The approval opens the door for customers to buy, sell and finance digital assets directly on a federally regulated commodities exchange — a first in the U.S. market.Caroline Pham, the acting head of the CFTC, said in November that it was in talks with regulated exchanges over the potential launch of spot crypto products. Bitnomial's approval lands as the CFTC accelerates its effort to bring retail-facing crypto markets under federal commodities oversight. Pham has argued the agency already has sufficient authority to supervise spot crypto commodities. The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently revealed that nothing in current law prevents exchanges registered with either regulator from listing certain crypto commodity products, including those with leverage, so long as they coordinate with agency staff. The approval could pave the way for other exchanges that hold designated contract market (DCM) status, including Coinbase and prediction market venues like Kalshi and Polymarket. – Oliver Knight Read more.

Blockchain is shifting from speculation to execution, with adoption driven by practical infrastructure.

Copied to clipboard


		Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.	

The debate over which blockchain will dominate is finished. Bitcoin long ago established itself as the number one global store of value, and we've seen Ethereum cement its place as the primary settlement layer for digital finance.

Early blockchain development was shaped by rivalry. Each new network tried to outperform the others on speed, cost or decentralisation. It was a period that helped drive innovation but also distracted many in crypto from the real question: ‘How can these systems now serve people and businesses?'

Now it's all about execution. These are pivotal moments for the industry, and we're beginning to see blockchains move from theory to practical usage.

Crypto's early years revolved around price and speculation. And they were needed — they served a purpose. Attention and hype brought in invaluable capital, but, unfortunately, also narrowed how people saw the technology. Mainstream investors and traditional finance watched the 2017 boom in ICOs, and it turned blockchain into a byword for wild speculation.

The industry has matured and is finding real-world uses for its products. The adoption of stablecoins alone is expected to generate an additional $1.4 trillion in demand for US dollars by 2027. It now begs the question of not whether blockchain works, but how it can scale to billions of users.

Enter execution layers. They make transactions fast, reliable and affordable, bridging Ethereum's security with the ease people expect from modern payment systems. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different but complementary roles. Bitcoin is the secure digital reserve, a hedge against inflation and policy risk, while Ethereum is the programmable base for settlement and trustless transactions.

Neither one of these two giants of crypto was built for speed. Their strength is security and finality. Growth now depends on the systems built on top of them. These networks make blockchain fast and reliable enough to match modern payment and banking systems.

The goal of an execution layer is to make blockchain invisible to users while keeping every transaction transparent. When payments clear instantly, and fees cost less than a cent, people stop thinking about the technology and just use it.

Stablecoins now move money across borders instantly and at almost no cost, but only when the networks beneath them can handle constant activity without slowing or breaking. The same principle applies to every form of digital value, from savings products to payments and onchain lending. Growth stalls before it reaches scale if it isn't underpinned with dependable infrastructure.

Fintechs are starting to act on this. Stripe's launch of stablecoin payments on Polygon shows that blockchain is becoming part of everyday finance and not a side experiment. The infrastructure is used to move tokenised assets, settle trades and connect new digital markets with traditional finance.

This results in a single, more fluid system where value can travel anywhere. Tokenised funds are already moving onchain. Franklin Templeton's OnChain US Government Money Fund, built on Polygon, is proof that traditional assets can operate directly on public blockchain infrastructure.

A major challenge now is connection. Users, assets and activity remain scattered across different chains, limiting scale and liquidity. For Web3 to grow, these systems must work together as one network.

At Polygon, this is the problem we are addressing with Agglayer, a framework that links multiple blockchains so they can share value and security while keeping their independence. It lets developers expand to new users without rebuilding everything from the ground up.

When that connection happens, Web3 starts to look like a functioning economy rather than isolated silos. The importance of linked networks lies in the fact that it allows value to move freely.

Real adoption is strongest where the need is greatest. Across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, stablecoins are part of everyday life. Families in Argentina use them to protect savings from inflation amid an ongoing economic crisis. Freelancers in the Philippines receive wages in digital dollars.

Around the globe, there are real economies powered by blockchain systems that focus on speed and low cost. Once people can send money instantly without thinking about what enables it, adoption will become permanent.

Competition in Web3 has shifted from ideology to execution. The debates over consensus models or technical purity matter less than how well a network performs. The leaders will be those who offer a smooth, reliable experience and can handle millions of users without strain. When blockchain becomes simple and invisible, users stop discussing crypto.

The era of competing base layers has run its course. What matters now is how well execution networks turn that foundation into practical tools for people, businesses and governments.

The next wave of adoption will be led by those who make blockchain useful, not just possible. The builders who focus on making it invisible will define its most visible impact.

The debate over which blockchain will dominate is finished. Bitcoin long ago established itself as the number one global store of value, and we've seen Ethereum cement its place as the primary settlement layer for digital finance.

Early blockchain development was shaped by rivalry. Each new network tried to outperform the others on speed, cost or decentralisation. It was a period that helped drive innovation but also distracted many in crypto from the real question: ‘How can these systems now serve people and businesses?'

ICO reprimands company over accidental publishing of data about people caught up in Horizon IT scandal

Business live – latest updates

The Post Office has avoided a fine over a data breach that resulted in the mistaken online publication of the names and addresses of more than 500 post office operators it had been pursuing during the Horizon IT scandal.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has reprimanded the Post Office over the breach, in which the company's press office accidentally published an unredacted version of a legal settlement document with the operators on its website.

The ICO said the data breach in June last year involving the release of names, home addresses and operator status of 502 out of the 555 people involved in the successful litigation action against the Post Office led by Sir Alan Bates had been “entirely preventable”.

“The people affected by this breach had already endured significant hardship and distress as a result of the IT scandal,” said Sally Anne Poole, the head of investigations at the ICO.

“They deserved much better than this. The postmasters have once again been let down by the Post Office. This data breach was entirely preventable and stemmed from a mistake that could have been avoided had the correct procedures been in place.”

The ICO said its investigation had found that the Post Office had failed to implement appropriate “technical and organisational measures” to protect people's information.

The data watchdog highlighted a lack of documented policies or quality assurance for publishing documents online, as well as “insufficient” staff training with “no specific guidance on information sensitivity or publishing practices”.

The ICO said it had initially considered imposing a fine of up to £1.09m but decided that the data breach did not reach the threshold of “egregious” under its approach to fining public-sector companies.

The Open Rights Group (ORG), a campaigning organisation, said the ICO's determination that the data breach was not egregious was “ludicrous”.

“This reprimand is a go-ahead for public organisations in the UK to keep inflicting harm, knowing that the ICO will let them off the hook,” said Mariano delli Santi, a legal and policy officer at the ORG. “As reprimands lack the force of law, the Post Office can rest assured that they will not face consequences if they fail to address their shortcomings.”

Last June, the Post Office apologised for the data breach with Nick Read, then the chief executive, saying the leak was “a truly terrible error”.

The former post office operator Christopher Head tweeted the text of a letter he had written to Read and Nigel Railton, the chair of the Post Office, in which he said that many of his colleagues “hadn't shared details with their own families” at the time.

The Post Office settled the civil claim brought by 555 claimants for £57.75m over the wrongful prosecutions on faulty Horizon evidence – amounting to £12m after legal costs – without admitting liability, in December 2019.

Last May, hundreds of post office operators convicted on charges including false accounting, theft and fraud were exonerated by an unprecedented act of parliament.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

The crash Tuesday in the crypto miner American Bitcoin Corp. was instantaneous. At 9:31 a.m. on Wall Street, just one minute after trading opened, its shares were down 33%. Five minutes later, losses had ballooned to 42% and then, for a brief moment, to more than 50%.

It was all so spectacular that American Bitcoin quickly became the symbol of not just the crypto market wipeout of late 2025 but also the collapse of the myriad ventures that the Trump family has been promoting in the digital-currency world over the past year. For as much as broader crypto markets have sunk these past two months — roughly 25% in the case of bellwether Bitcoin — projects that are tied to the Trump family are down far, far more.

World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, has seen its WLFI token tumble 51% from its peak in early September, more than both Bitcoin and an index of smaller digital tokens. Alt5 Sigma, a company promoted by the Trump sons, has plunged around 75% as it deals with a growing number of legal problems. 

Then there are the memecoins named after the president and his wife, Melania, which have fallen around 90% and 99% respectively from their record highs back in January. American Bitcoin, which was co-founded by Eric Trump, is now down 75% after the big drop on Tuesday. 

These moves have put a big dent in the huge piles of crypto wealth that the first family amassed earlier in the year. But they also carry a broader significance for both the digital asset industry and the president's public image. Trump's embrace helped boost a wide array of crypto tokens during the early months of his second term and turned the price of Bitcoin into a marker of his political success. 

Now, though, what looked like a Trump premium has suddenly turned into a Trump drag, taking out one of the central pillars holding up cryptoassets and offering an indication of just how quickly confidence in these speculative markets — and even in the president himself — can dissolve.

“The Trump presidency has been a double edged sword for legitimacy,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University's Washington College of Law. “Trump started launching his own crypto projects, many of which lost value very quickly. If the goal was to achieve legitimacy through the Trump family, that's not helped.”

World Liberty Financial and the company behind Trump's memecoin, Fight Fight Fight, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  

While the president has recently toned down his public promotion of crypto, Eric Trump took to social media on Tuesday to blame American Bitcoin's bad performance on the end of a lockup period for its shares, rather than any broader weakness. 

“Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched,” he wrote in a post on X. “I'm 100% committed to leading the industry.”

To be clear, the dramatic moves in the assets associated with the Trump family are hardly new for an industry that has been defined by its volatility. Digital tokens have experienced big drops in the past, before bouncing back. On Tuesday, as American Bitcoin struggled, the original cryptocurrency had one of its best days in the last few weeks, rising around 6%.

Earlier this year, though, it seemed like Trump's embrace of the technology might be enough to take digital tokens out of their endless cycle of boom and bust and turn them into a more reliable part of the financial system. If nothing else, many crypto believers figured Trump would have enough power to ensure the success of the projects he cared about the most.

And for a while, the various cross-promotions seemed to be working. People looking to express their support for the president brought up Trump tokens and pushed up their value. Gryphon Digital shares surged 173% when it announced that it was merging with Eric Trump's American Bitcoin in May. On the first day of trading after the merger, in September, shares of American Bitcoin rose another 16%.

These projects were all helped by policies and regulatory changes that Trump promoted, led by legislation that aimed to bring crypto stablecoins, tied to the value of the dollar, into the mainstream. 

But the signs of trouble have been mounting over time. The memecoins that were launched right before the inauguration, with lots of promotional muscle from Trump himself, have steadily lost steam over time, with just occasional moments of relief, like the rally in April after the president offered to join some of the biggest holders of the coin for dinner.   

Joel Li, the chief executive of an online marketplace for electric vehicles, bought the memecoin so he could attend the dinner, but sold out soon after. He noticed things getting particularly bad after Trump launched a new salvo of tariffs against China in October. 

“People started to realize, this might not be what they thought,” Li said. 

Michael Terpin, a long-time crypto investor, said that the tariff moves have served as a cold reminder: “Trump giveth and Trump taketh away.”

The problems, though, have gone beyond the vagaries of the broader markets. American Bitcoin has had to deal with a report that the mining machines it uses, from a Chinese manufacturer, have been investigated as a risk to US national security. Meanwhile, Alt5 Sigma, a public company that set out to buy one of the tokens issued by World Liberty Financial, has faced an exodus of executives after announcing that one of its subsidiaries had faced a criminal probe in Rwanda. 

Alt5 Sigma did not respond to requests for comment on the recent developments. 

The downdraft since October has taken out more than $1 billion of the wealth that the Trumps generated through their crypto ventures and other businesses. But they are still sitting on significant profits, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It is retail investors who bought into assets when they were flying near their peaks that are nursing the most painful losses. 

Kevin Hu, a 22-year-old student in Vancouver, had positioned for a continued rally, but instead saw his portfolio of digital tokens drop by as much as 40% by mid-November.

“You'd think with the president being so pro-crypto, it would create a floor,” he said. “But the market didn't respond that way. And the stuff around the memecoins, it just turned a lot of people off.”","{'href': 'https://www.ndtvprofit.com', 'title': 'NDTV Profit'}","cryptocurrency"

Entrée Capital has launched $300 million in new funds targeting early-stage investments across Israel, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States. With this raise, the firm's total assets under management have reached $1.5 billion, reinforcing its commitment to backing founders building category-defining technologies in fast-moving global markets.

The new capital will focus on pre-seed, seed, and Series A opportunities, with investment themes spanning AI-native applications and infrastructure, deep-tech and quantum computing, software and data, crypto infrastructure and security, and contrarian frontier innovation. The firm emphasized that these sectors are experiencing structural shifts driven by breakthroughs in AI, computing, defense technology, autonomy, and cryptographic infrastructure.

Entrée's team highlighted the rapid convergence of physics, compute, software, and national-security technologies; the rise of AI agents, vertical AI systems, and autonomous software; and the expanding role of Web3 in institutional-grade infrastructure. Leadership noted that the industries historically underserved by software—still reliant on paper, phone calls, or decades-old systems—now present some of the most dramatic reset opportunities as AI unlocks full P&L transformation.

Entrée Capital's long-standing focus on deep-tech and AI, along with its founder-driven investment approach, positions the new funds to accelerate global company-building from day zero. The firm has backed AI companies for more than seven years and plans to increase its exposure as the next wave of AI-native platforms and infrastructure takes shape.

“Our mission is to partner with the exceptional to build the impossible. As AI and Web3 evolve and disrupt it all, our mission is ever more relevant and we are looking to meet these outliers.”

Avi Eyal

“We are entering a new era where physics, compute, software, and national-security innovation converge. Israel remains a global powerhouse for deep-tech and quantum innovation, and we are scaling that reach across Europe, the UK, and the United States.”

Ran Achituv

“AI is not a fad. It is a foundational transformation of the global economy. We are focused on AI-native founders building vertical agents, infrastructure, and category-defining software. We've been investing in AI for over seven years, and these funds will double down on the theme.”

Eran Bielski

“Entrée stands out because of its deep founder DNA and its commitment to standing with entrepreneurs from day zero. I am excited to support world-class founders building enduring companies from Israel and globally.”

Yoni Osherov

“The biggest opportunities are in the verticals everyone skips because the software spend looks tiny. AI doesn't care about historical software budgets. One sharp wedge—hardware, ambient capture, autonomous agents—unlocks the entire P&L. The less software these categories have bought in the past, the more violent and complete the reset will be.”

Saul Levin

“Three themes are top of mind: AI agents, decentralized physical infrastructure, and policy automation. Web3 is evolving from speculation to institutional adoption, where real utility and infrastructure take center stage. Policy automation and compliance as code are enabling institutions to interact with these systems safely, embedding trust and regulation directly into programmable finance.”

Scientists Just Tore Up a Major Particle Physics Theory

New results from the MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab found no evidence of a hypothetical fourth flavor of neutrino

Scientists announced on Wednesday that they have found no evidence for the hypothetical “sterile neutrino,” an extra version of the ghostly neutrino particles that are ubiquitous in the universe. The finding comes from the U.S. Department of Energy–run Fermilab's MicroBooNE experiment. Sterile neutrinos are a popular theoretical prediction because they could help explain the cosmos' mysterious dark matter, if they exist.

The finding, which was published in Nature on Wednesday, calls into question a popular explanation for anomalies seen in past neutrino experiments that couldn't be accounted for with existing physics. It could also hold major implications for the Standard Model, which is the best particle physics theory we have to explain how the universe works.

“We are making a very general statement, which is, you cannot just take the Standard Model, add a fourth neutrino and, in that way, explain any of the previous anomalies,” says Justin Evans, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester in England and one of MicroBooNE's spokespeople.

Neutrinos come in three known flavors—electron, muon and tau—and can oscillate, or flip, between them. In the 1990s physicists observed these elusive particles oscillating in a way that seemed inconsistent with established theory. To explain the weird observations, physicists proposed that what they were observing was in fact a new, fourth kind of neutrino—the sterile neutrino. But although the new results essentially rule that possibility out, they pose new, exciting questions.

“It's very clear what our result is,” says Matthew Toups, a senior scientist at Fermilab. “What is unclear to me is what the experiments that saw anomalies actually saw.”

Importantly, the results don't fully take the prospect of an unknown fourth kind of neutrino off the table entirely.

“We have lots of reasons to believe that there are more neutrino states,” says André De Gouvêa, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University. A challenge, he says, is that physicists don't know if these other hypothetical neutrinos are detectable using current technology.

The scientists at Fermilab hope their results will soon be validated by other neutrino experiments. But already, their attention is turning to answering the bigger question posed by their findings: If it wasn't sterile neutrinos, then what caused the anomalies?

One possible theory is that there may be a neutrino that decays before it gets to the detector, Evans says. Another possibility is that neutrinos interact with the detector in ways the scientists didn't already know about. There are yet other hypotheses. Ultimately, this enduring mystery is just one of the many enigmas surrounding these elusive particles and their properties.

“There are a lot of very concrete things about neutrinos that we don't know,” De Gouvêa says. For one, can neutrinos help explain dark matter? “Maybe the dark matter is secretly a sterile neutrino,” he says.

The phase 3 IMpower150 trial in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrates significantly longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with first-line atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)-bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ABCP) than with bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (BCP). We characterise four molecular NSCLC subtypes identified by unsupervised clustering of transcriptomes of 564 pre-treatment primary tumour samples from IMpower150 using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF1-4). Each subtype has distinct tumour PD-L1 expression levels, epithelial characteristics, immune composition, and treatment outcomes. Both NMF2 (enriched in tumour proliferation signal, macrophages, and monocytes) and NMF4 (enriched in B cells and T cells) have elevated tumour PD-L1 expression. Of these two, only NMF4 demonstrates PFS and OS benefits with ABCP versus either BCP or atezolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ACP). Patients with NMF1 (enriched in basal and squamous-like cells) have improved outcomes on ABCP compared with ACP or BCP; those with NMF3 (enriched in adenocarcinoma signatures) show similar outcomes among treatments. These insights could help inform individualised first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC.

Dell

Dell (16 GB)

Amazon

Dell had a killer $500 discount all weekend on the Core Ultra 5 version of its Dell 14 Plus. It was a high-end laptop being sold for downright budget-level prices. It's sold out now, unfortunately. But the current discount is still quite good. It's on a slightly more powerful configuration with the Core Ultra 7, as well as the same 2560 by 1600 resolution screen. This is a very strong display for a laptop at this price. While the Surface Laptop is better in many ways, the $650 Dell 14 Plus gets you a full terabyte of storage.—Luke Larsen

Microsoft

Amazon

Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus)

Best Buy (15-inch)

Microsoft's Surface Laptop is the closest thing the Windows world has to a MacBook, and it's never been so cheap.

Acer

Best Buy

Usually, inexpensive Chromebooks have subpar displays and touchpads, but this Acer model's are just fine—at a killer price.

Razer

Razer

Our favorite gaming laptop has a sleek, thin design and impressive graphics. It doesn't go on sale very often.

Asus

Weighing only 2.16 pounds, it's one of the lightest laptops you can buy, without making any major sacrifices to achieve that weight.

The M4 MacBook Air has been the best laptop on the market since it was released in 2024. The price has slowly dropped, too. The price has slowly dropped, too. It's now down to $750, and when you compare this directly with the quality of similarly priced laptops, you'll see why it's still at the top of my list. The display quality and resolution is top-notch, while the performance and battery life remain best in class. If the rumors are true, we're still at least a few months out from the M5 MacBook Air, making this M4 still worthy of a purchase at this price. —Luke Larsen

Apple

Amazon

Apple

The new MacBook Pro is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It wasn't a significant revamp, though it's currently the only Mac with the latest M5 chip.

Apple

Amazon (16 Inch)

The M4 Pro MacBook Pro remains a super-powerful and premium laptop, a meaningful step up in performance over the M5 MacBook Pro. It's not a huge discount, but a deal is a deal.

Dell

The $200 range used to get you a crappy, 1080p monitor with terrible colors. But thanks to this deal, it can afford you a beautiful 4K monitor with a 120-Hz refresh rate and a fully-adjustable stand. It's IPS, but it has decent color coverage and accuracy, with a max brightness of 355 nits. Just be aware: it doesn't have built-in USB ports and the stand doesn't have enough height adjustment to be used as a vertical monitor. But for run-of-the-mill, at-home use, you won't find another monitor with the complete package that the Dell 27 Plus 4K has. —Luke Larsen

This display lives somewhere between OLED monitor and TV. It's perfect for a mixed-use room that's home office by day and entertainment room by night.

This is the Wi-Fi 7 router I recommend for most people in our best Wi-Fi routers guide because it's easy to set up and will cover homes and apartments up to around 2,000 square feet with fast, reliable connectivity. It's only dual-band, so you do miss out on the 6-GHz band, but you get all the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7. It also has a generous array of ports and comes with free security software and parental controls. Support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh rounds out an excellent device. —Simon Hill

Amazon (3-Pack)

Amazon (2-Pack)

Best Buy (3-Pack)

This Wi-Fi 6E mesh is ideal for smart homes, provides reliably speedy Wi-Fi, and is oh-so-easy to set up and use. It's one of our favorites. You can nab the three-pack for 40 percent off.

TP-Link

Amazon (3-Pack)

Best Buy (3-Pack)

This high-performing, tri-band, Wi-Fi 7 mesh is the runner-up in my best mesh guide, and it's a great value at this discounted price, which is $200 below standard.

Asus

A Wi-Fi 6 mesh is still enough for most folks and this is the cheapest we've ever seen our favorite system.

This router is a great way to get a better Wi-Fi signal into your backyard and outbuildings.

Audioengine

Amazon

Walmart

When it comes to your home office, there's still nothing like a solid pair of desk speakers to amplify your work-from-home setup. These computer speakers from Audioengine rarely go on sale, so now's a great time to pick up a pair. They're our favorite computer speakers, with robust sound, and they won't take up much room on a desk. Music is where these speakers shine, even without a dedicated subwoofer.—Luke Larsen

SteelSeries

SteelSeries (Wired)

SteelSeries (Wireless)

A good gaming mouse is nice to have even when you're not gaming, especially one that's this affordable. They aren't super groundbreaking, but the reliable Rival 3 Gen 2 comes in wired or wireless flavors.

SteelSeries

Amazon

Lenovo

This surround system for your PC will crank up the immersion for games and movies.

Western Digital

Amazon

This portable hard drive is our pick for the best portable backup because it's small (less than an inch thick) but sturdy and balances respectable performance with convenience in the form of a regular USB-C connection. This is the device we'd want to run daily backups in a hotel room while on location shooting photos or video.

The current model of iPad (A16) has dropped below the $300 price we typically see on sales. This tablet functions as a second screen for everything from watching movies on a flight to checking the news in bed without your reading glasses. The last one I bought was promptly taken over by my daughter, who uses it to play Roblox. —Martin Cizmar

Google

Amazon

Best Buy

Google Store

Google's shiny new Pixel 10 is one of the best Android phones on the market right now. It's rare to find a phone at this price, especially on sale, with a triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom sensor so you won't have trouble capturing sharp photos of birds up in the tree, your kid earning their diploma, or your favorite artist onstage. Not to mention this is one of the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnets, meaning, similar to Apple's iPhones, you can magnetically attach the phone to wireless chargers and docks for speedy charging (and attach various fun magnetic accessories). Best of all is Google's smart software; Yes, there's a lot of generative AI creep that isn't super useful, but tools like Call Screen can filter out spam calls, and Now Playing automatically tells you what song is playing at the coffee shop without you having to lift a finger. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more details. —Julian Chokkattu

Motorola

This is the hottest flip-style folding phone of the year. The Razr Ultra comes in snazzy designs, has a strong camera, and a super-useful external display for when you don't want to open the whole thing up.

Motorola

Motorola

This Moto G Stylus (make sure it's the 2025 model) is the best bang for your buck, with wireless charging, good performance, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and, naturally, a built-in stylus.

Anker

Amazon (Pad)

Amazon (Stand)

Anker (Pad)

The best wireless charger is usually pretty affordable, but at just over $10, it's a no-brainer for anyone in the market. You can choose from a pad or a stand option; Both have rubbery grips on the bottom to prevent slips and slides, and they'll charge your phone reliably at 10, 7.5, or 5 watts depending on your device. Note that you need to bring your own wall charger! (I like these from the same brand.) —Louryn Strampe

Anker

Amazon

Snag a great deal our favorite charging cable. It works over 200 degrees of temp swing and has 240W charging.

PopSockets

PopSockets are user-friendly, especially this MagSafe version which pops onto the back of your compatible device (or case).

Spigen

This clear case comes in several interesting designs that portray the internal components of a smartphone. It's my favorite cheap case for the iPhone 17 range, though it's available for devices dating back to the iPhone 14 Pro.

Meta

Whatever you think of Meta's AI policies (they're garbage) the best smart glasses are the ones that you already want to wear. The 2024 version are now on sale.

This is our favorite full-grain leather case, with hides are sourced from Europe and the US. It looks gorgeous, smells lovely, features stainless steel buttons.

Anker

The Anker 737 power bank is my go-to companion for … well, basically all the time, but especially music festivals. (It's literally sitting next to me right now.) The beefy brick is surprisingly heavy, and it has a 24,000-mAh capacity with 140-watt fast-charging. It can top off your phone, your Nintendo Switch, or even your laptop. My favorite part is that the power bank itself recharges really quickly, in just about an hour. It also has a neat built-in display that offers helpful information like charging speeds and battery health. —Louryn Strampe

Anker

This hefty power bank is packing serious heat, with a smart and practical design, plenty of speedy charging ports, and a handy display.

The best Qi2 power bank we've tested has never sold for less. It has a handy built-in kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and a tiny LED display.

A built-in retractable USB-C cable in a power bank is so handy, and it's one more thing you don't have to remember. The 10,000-mAh is enough to fully charge any phone.

This is the current generation of Echo Dot. This small device has powerful, robust sound and works a treat if you want Alexa access in a discreet space. I keep one in my hallway so I can ask quick questions as I move through the house, and one in my bedroom as an alarm clock. It packs some of the best sound you can get for this price, especially when it's on sale like it is for Cyber Monday. —Nena Farrell

Amazon (Signature)

The latest generation Kindle Paperwhite came out last fall, and it's got just about everything we want in an e-reader: an auto-adjusting warm light, a three-month battery life, snappy performance, integration with Overdrive so you can get your library books, and the ability to “speak” several languages.

Amazon

Amazon

Best Buy

The Kindle Scribe is a great combo e-reader and digital notebook. There are a few new models coming soon, but we still think this one is worth buying, especially since it's on sale for $120 off.

Amazon

Amazon (Colorsoft Signature Edition)

Amazon (Colorsoft)

The Kindle Colorsoft takes everything we love about Kindle's e-readers and adds a color screen. You'll get most of the benefits of a Kindle Paperwhite in living color.

Amazon's cheapest Kindle is still a powerful, snappy device, and comes in fun colors like matcha green. It's a great gift for bookworks and kids you want to become bookworms.

reMarkable

Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio)

ReMarkable (with Marker Plus)

ReMarkable (With Marker)

The reMarkable 2 is one of the best digital notebooks you can get. It's my favorite budget option, which might seem weird since it's not necessarily the cheapest (it's the same price as the Kindle Scribe). It's the best for the features and the available accessories like a keyboard folio at this price point, and it costs less than the rest of reMarkable's lineup or competitors like Supernote. You can get bundles (you'll need to choose both a marker and folio) of the reMarkable 2 for $70 right now, letting you add on your favorite folio or upgrade the marker without paying as much as you usually would. The digital notebooks from reMarkable are rarely on sale, so don't miss this one. —Nena Farrell

The Kindle Scribe is a great combo e-reader and digital notebook. There are a few new models coming this winter, but we still think this one is worth buying, especially since it's on sale.

Kobo

Amazon (E-Reader Only)

Kobo (With Stylus 2)

Amazon (With Case and Stylus)

This is our favorite digital notebook for readers, and it's a great affordable color option. It's only $30 off the typical price, but that's still some savings on our favorite e-reader.

TCL

Best Buy

Costco

This is our favorite TV for most people, because it offers excellent color and great processing, and contains virtually every app you could want. Mini LED backlighting means that you'll have excellent contrast and plenty of performance in bright rooms, and TCL's anti-glare technology makes it nice even when sunlight hits it. Its price is the main appeal; you'll pay hundreds of dollars more for a TV that looks any better. —Parker Hall

The G5 is LG's highest-end OLED, and it is perhaps the prettiest screen we saw all year. With the price dropping below $2,000, it's a no-brainer for your home theater update.

Sony

Amazon

Walmart

Costco

Sony TVs are high-priced for a reason: They have the best processing in the game, and they tend to look just a bit sharper than their competitors.

LG

Amazon

This is probably the best all-around OLED of the year. We've yet to get this specific model in for testing, but the C series models we have tested in the past offer a great mix of brightness and color, and good performance for gaming and sports.

Roku

Amazon

Walmart

This latest Roku Pro Series TV is uniformly bright and easy to set up and navigate, and it works well for both watching shows and movies and for gaming.

Anker

Amazon (Speaker and Mic Bundle)

Anker

Projector

Reviewer Chris Haslam lavished praise on this Anker projector, which claims to be the world's first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system. It's a 4K projector capable of creating a 200-inch image with 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness, but requires very little setup. It will also work with microphones for karaoke or business presentations. The list price is very steep for a portable projector, but this Cyber Monday sale drops $800 off. —Martin Cizmar

Walmart

This streaming stick is what I'd recommend for anyone who just wants to enable an older TV to stream modern apps. It looks fine, but you may want to spring for a nicer stick if you have a newer TV. That said, you really cannot beat this $20 price. This is a gadget that can breathe new life into an older screen in your basement or garage, or which you can use to stream your shows in a hotel room without being too annoyed if you someday leave it behind. —Parker Hall

Note: There are lots of great streaming service deals right now too, such as HBO Max's $3 per month offer, which locks you in for a whole year at that price.

Roku

Amazon

The highest-end Roku is the one we'd recommend if you want the highest possible streaming quality, thanks to its support for Dolby Vision.

This is the best streaming stick for most people, thanks to its support for 4K resolution and HDR.

Yamaha

Amazon

Walmart

This is our favorite soundbar system for most people, thanks to its great wireless subwoofer, solid audio processing, and compact footprint below most screens. If you've been struggling to hear the voices on screen, or you just want for a more cinematic experience, I recommend the SR-C30A. —Parker Hall

Sony

Amazon

B&H

If you don't want to see speakers all around your room, the System 6 is a classy and good-looking wireless system from Sony that will fill your room with sound without physically standing out.

This is essentially Yamaha's Dolby Atmos-enabled version of the SR-C30A above, and it is worth the upgrade if you're looking for even more immersion.

JBL

JBL's Bluetooth speakers are some of our favorites that money can buy, and the Flip 7 is no exception. We like how durable it is, as well as how loud the tube-shaped speaker can get when placed on a table or in a corner. —Parker Hall

These are our favorite wireless earbuds for most people. I actually just bought a pair last week after confirming with resident audiophile Parker Hall that I'd like them more than my stinky, annoying, horrible-touch-controls AirPods Gen 2. And I do! The Nothing Ear (a) have a super-cool translucent charging case, and they're comfortable. They also sound great out of the box, though you can tweak the EQ in the app. Tack on the 5-hour battery life and excellent touch controls, and I don't know why I ever waited so long to get a pair for myself. This deal matches the best we've ever tracked. —Louryn Strampe

TP-Link's Kasa line of mini smart plugs performs as well as larger plugs but in a smaller size that won't obstruct a second outlet. The app is simple to navigate and has scenes, timers, and schedules. For the extra cautious, there's even an away mode that turns the plugs on and off randomly during the time you choose to confuse anyone observing your routine. Smart plug sales are in short supply this Cyber Monday, but this is a few bucks cheaper than it was in recent weeks. —Martin Cizmar

Crate & Barrel

The debut of Dyson's first tabletop-sized air purifier was just announced in September; it's finally here, and we've tried it. Its claim to fame is that it uses electrostatic filtration, which incorporates electrically charged plates to attract dust, pollen, dander, and other allergens. In our guide to the Best Air Purifiers, WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro notes this means the filter can last up to five years, as opposed to six to 12 months like a typical HEPA. She found it to be a little loud, measuring twice the advertised decibels on its highest setting, but it's otherwise a great option for smaller areas like bedrooms. —Kat Merck

The upfront price is usually more of a barrier, but half off is a very good discount. —Matthew Korfhage

You can enjoy it without a subscription (though for the AI identification and image/video storage, you'll want to spring for the extra $5 a month), and the app makes it easy to save and share great captures of birds. Note that Birdfy only works with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the base model comes without a solar panel. I don't mind this, as Birdfy's panel has to be mounted separately, and it's hard to do this when the feeder is installed on a pole, which is what I recommend. —Kat Merck

The systems do take a fair amount of maintenance, but as a busy, full-time working parent, it's nothing I haven't been able to handle. If you've been curious about these, all Gardyn systems are now 20 percent off for Cyber Monday, netting you $180 off a Home or $111 off a Studio.

If you already own an Apple Watch, I generally do not advocate upgrading to the latest model, given they're all pretty iterative. I do think that this year's Series 11 is worth getting because, for the first time ever, it really does have a full 24 hours of battery life. It's on sale for $369 right now. But last year's Series 10 (Apple's 10th anniversary watch) has the same S10 chip as the latest watches. It also has the same slim case, large screen, and is compatible with watchOS 26 (with an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone), so you can still enjoy the Liquid Glass design, Workout Buddy, and flick away Smart Stack with your wrist. —Adrienne So

Here it is; the one, the only, the legend—the original air styler that spawned a hundred imitators. I tested it for the first time this year for my guide to the Best Hair Straighteners.

I still needed to use a traditional flat iron afterward, especially on the top of my head. But the Dyson engineering and quality are evident in every small detail, from the Hyperdymium motor—same as in Dyson's vacuum cleaners—to the glass bead thermistors that regulate the tool's temperature. I can see how it would be life-changing for those with wavy or just generally easier-to-straighten hair.

Cyber Monday Retailers To Watch

Amazon: For better or worse, Amazon has changed the game when it comes to shopping—if you want it, Amazon probably sells it. In the tradition of Amazon Prime Day, Amazon is rolling out major discounts for Cyber Monday and Cyber Monday on everything from bedding to home office gear to TVs to air fryers. This is a good time to save on the brand's own hardware, like Kindles and Blink security cameras, some of which are 50% off.

Walmart: The Arkansas-based big box store has lots of tech deals like the gray colorway of Beats Solo4 for $79 ($50 off) plus the home and garden deals you'd expect like a Blackstone griddle for $157 ($67 off).

REI: Outdoor co-op REI is a favorite among hikers, campers, and general outdoor enthusiasts. REI's cyber week sale starts November 29, with rotating deals on a myriad of WIRED-tested products, though you will find their deals live now, notably not called “Cyber Monday.”

Home Depot: Home improvement projects and general home upkeep can get costly quick. Home Depot has Cyber Monday discounts for virtually everything you need for the home, including Christmas trees and smart home appliances.

Branch: We love Branch's home office furniture, including some WIRED-tested favorite office chairs. Everything is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday, so now's a great time to upgrade.

Helix: We love Helix mattresses—if you're going to be spending a third of your life on something, it better be good. Upgrade your sleep for less with Helix's Cyber Monday sale, with 25 percent off sitewide.

Target: Target has everything from groceries to flat screens to celebrity-endorsed beauty products. In addition to regular Cyber Monday sales, Target has price match guarantee and doorbuster clearance items.

Best Buy: In addition to major discounts for Cyber Monday and Cyber Monday, Best Buy rolls out new doorbusters every Friday, slashing prices on everything from refrigerators to MacBooks. We've rounded up the best Best Buy deals we've seen so far, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro (M5) for $1,349 ($250 off) and Google Pixel 10 for $599 ($200 off).

Dyson: Making everything from blow dryers to vacuums to air purifiers, we at WIRED are generally huge fans of this well-made, long-lasting (but often pricey) tech, made a lot more affordable with Cyber Monday sales.

Lowe's: In addition to Cyber Monday sales, Lowe's has rotating daily deals on home improvement essentials, upgraded appliances, and outdoor tools like grills and lawnmowers.

Atlas: At WIRED, we love caffeine, and subscription services. So we go bonkers for this coffee club subscription, and now you can get a free bag of beans for Cyber Monday.

Anthropic is prepping for an IPO that could come as early as 2026, the FT reports.

It has brought on law firm Wilson Sonsini to help kick off the process, and the company is tackling an internal checklist to prepare it for what could be one of the largest IPOs ever.

The company is also reportedly looking to raise a funding round that could value it at over $300 billion and has also been in talks with investment banks, though it has not chosen an underwriter, the FT reported. Anthropic last announced a $13 billion raise in September, giving it a $183 billion valuation. Wilson Sonsini has been an advisor to Anthropic since 2022.

This news comes as OpenAI, valued at $500 billion, is also reportedly testing the waters for an IPO and has started to prep itself for the process, though no listing date has been suggested, the Reuters reported.

Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.

I hope Gabe has setup Valve in such a way that they can pass on his mentality as a whole inside the business practices themselves. I think, after all these years, he must have surely thought about what leaving would look like for Valve. Considering this is a guy who seemingly thinks in decades, I feel maybe even optimistically calm about it.

reply

Although this is true for most games it is worth noting that it isn't universally true. Usermode anti-cheat does sometimes work verbatim in Wine, and some anti-cheat software has Proton support, though not all developers elect to enable it.

You can be clever and build a random memory allocator. You can get clever and watch for frozen struct members after a known set operation, what you can't do is prevent all cheating. There's device layer, driver layer, MITM, emulation, and even now AI mouse control.The only thing you can do is watch for it and send the ban hammer. Valve has a wonderful write up about client-side prediction recording so as to verify killcam shots were indeed, kill shots, and not aim bots (but this method is great for seeing those in action as well!)

Sure, but you still have to make a serious attempt or the experience will be terrible for any non-cheaters. Or you just make your game bad enough that no one cares. That's an option too.

Yes they do. They don't stop all cheating, but they raise the barrier to entry which means fewer cheaters.I don't like arguments that sound like ""well you can't stop all crime so you may as well not even try""

Because of that, usermode anti-cheat is definitely far from useless in Wine; it can still function insofar as it tries to monitor the process space of the game itself. It can't really do a ton to ensure the integrity of Wine directly, but usermode anti-cheat running on Windows can't do much to ensure the integrity of Windows directly either, without going the route of requiring attestation. In fact, for the latest anti-cheat software I've ever attempted to mess with, which to be fair was circa 2016, it is still possible to work around anti-cheat mechanisms by detouring the Windows API calls themselves, to the extent that you can. (If you be somewhat clever it can be pretty useful, and has the bonus of being much harder to detect obviously.)The limitation is obviously that inside Wine you can't see most Linux resources directly using the same APIs, so you can't go and try to find cheat software directly. But let's be honest, that approach isn't really terribly relevant anymore since it is a horribly fragile and limited way to detect cheats.For more invasive anti-cheat software, well. We'll see. But just because Windows is closed source hasn't stopped people from patching Windows itself or writing their own kernel drivers. If that really was a significant barrier, Secure Boot and TPM-based attestation wouldn't be on the radar for anti-cheat vendors. Valve however doesn't seem keen to support this approach at all on its hardware, and if that forces anti-cheat vendors to go another way it is probably all the better. I think the secure boot approach has a limited shelf life anyways.

Any player responding to ingame events (enemy appeared) with sub 80ms reaction times consistently should be an automatic ban.Is it ever? No.Given good enough data a good team of data scientists would be able to make a great set of rules using statistical analysis that effectively ban anyone playing at a level beyond human.In the chess of fps that is cs, even a pro will make the wrong read based on their teams limited info of the game state. A random wallhacker making perfect reads with limited info over several matches IS flaggable...if you can capture and process the data and compare it to (mostly) legitimate player data.

Why would Apple ever invite Valve to potentially do the same to them?

apple on a desktop/laptop is not a primary gaming platform; edge cases, at bestmobile gaming is a different story, but at the end of the day apple is making money off of hardware sales first and foremost, esp. w/r/t laptops and phones.

When Cyberpunk, AC, and a couple other AAA titles came to macOS, Apple made a big deal of them being in the mac app store, specifically. They didn't go out of their way to call out that they run on mac, you can get them from Steam, etc. The big deal was they are in the app store.That's where Apple wants mac gaming to happen so they can get their 30% cut.I wish that weren't the case, but Apple's gonna Apple.

I actually see it as the reverse.  Valve might be going for the whole pie and want to carve out a niche for their Steam Box.  Inviting Apple to the party might detract from that effort.  Or at the very least distract from their main focus.

reply

But, I do think it might actually be a net positive for them on the Mac by expanding the audience of people who might buy a Mac.Given that full PC-Game-style game sales via the Mac App Store are likely abysmal, at least compared to mobile game revenue, I don't think they have that much to lose.

For some reason the prospect using Wine, Rosetta 2, and DXVK with MoltenVK on top just to run some games doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that this whole thing will be performant and/or stable.

Above all, Apple wants to show that their hardware is awesome, especially because it really is. Running x86 games or compatibility layers even with great emulation will make that $3000 Mac look half decent at best, against a $1500 gaming laptop. Simply not the story Apple want to tell.

You guys remember when you bought a computer and could run the software you wanted, independent of political motives? In perpetuity? Reading excuses like this makes me feel validated for cutting macOS out of my professional workflow. The concept of paying Apple to provide high-quality long term support only works if Apple does better than the free offerings. Free offerings that still run 32-bit libraries, run CUDA drivers and other things Apple arbitrarily flipped the switch on.

Valve is using ARM to run Windows games on ""ultra portable"" devices, starting with the Steam Frame. At least right now, there isn't a competitive x86 chip that fits this use case. It also feels like more of an experiment, as Valve themselves are setting the expectation that this is a ""streaming first"" headset for running games on your desktop, and they've even said not to expect a great experience playing Half-Life: Alyx locally (a nearly 7 year old title).It will be interesting to see if Intel/AMD catch up to ARM on efficiency in time to keep handhelds like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally from jumping ship. Right now it seems Valve is hedging their bets.

There's a lot of work and experience built up for ARM through Proton and other tech (that can be reverse engineered to see how it works) like Rosetta. A lot of that would have to be redone for RISCV. Seems like a lot of risk in the short term for what's not an obvious product benefit.I would expect the high-end RISCV market to mature before a company like Valve dives in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","Launch HN: Phind 3 (YC S22)","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137548","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 17:49:15 GMT","

We are launching Phind 3 (https://www.phind.com), an AI answer engine that instantly builds a complete mini-app to answer and visualize your questions in an interactive way. A Phind mini-app appears as a beautiful, interactive webpage — with images, charts, diagrams, maps, and other widgets. Phind 3 doesn't just present information more beautifully; interacting with these widgets dynamically updates the content on the page and enables new functionality that wasn't possible before.For example, asking Phind for “options for a one-bedroom apartment in the Lower East Side” (https://www.phind.com/search/find-me-options-for-a-72e019ce-...) gives an interactive apartment-finding experience with customizable filters and a map view. And asking for a “recipe for bone-in chicken thighs” gives you a customizable recipe where changing the seasoning, cooking method, and other parameters will update the recipe content itself in real-time (https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-an-recipe-for-7c30ea6c-...).Unlike Phind 2 and ChatGPT apps, which use pre-built brittle widgets that can't truly adapt to your task, Phind 3 is able to create tools and widgets for itself in real-time. We learned this lesson the hard way with our previous launch – the pre-built widgets made the answers much prettier, but they didn't fundamentally enable new functionality. For example, asking for “Give me round-trip flight options from JFK to SEA on Delta from December 1st-5th in both miles and cash” (https://www.phind.com/search/give-me-round-trip-flight-c0ebe...) is not something that neither Phind 2 nor ChatGPT apps can handle, because its Expedia widget can only display cash fares and not those with points. We realized that Phind needs to be able to create and consume its own tools, with schema it designs, all in real time.

The new Phind Fast model is based on GLM-4.5-Air while the new Phind Large model is based on GLM 4.6. Both models are state-of-the-art when it comes to reliable code generation, producing over 70% fewer errors than GPT-5.1-Codex (high) on our internal mini-app generation benchmark.

For example, asking Phind for “options for a one-bedroom apartment in the Lower East Side” (https://www.phind.com/search/find-me-options-for-a-72e019ce-...) gives an interactive apartment-finding experience with customizable filters and a map view. And asking for a “recipe for bone-in chicken thighs” gives you a customizable recipe where changing the seasoning, cooking method, and other parameters will update the recipe content itself in real-time (https://www.phind.com/search/make-me-an-recipe-for-7c30ea6c-...).Unlike Phind 2 and ChatGPT apps, which use pre-built brittle widgets that can't truly adapt to your task, Phind 3 is able to create tools and widgets for itself in real-time. We learned this lesson the hard way with our previous launch – the pre-built widgets made the answers much prettier, but they didn't fundamentally enable new functionality. For example, asking for “Give me round-trip flight options from JFK to SEA on Delta from December 1st-5th in both miles and cash” (https://www.phind.com/search/give-me-round-trip-flight-c0ebe...) is not something that neither Phind 2 nor ChatGPT apps can handle, because its Expedia widget can only display cash fares and not those with points. We realized that Phind needs to be able to create and consume its own tools, with schema it designs, all in real time.

First: my sense is that for most use cases, this will begin to feel gimmicky rather quickly and that you will do better by specializing rather than positioning yourself next to ChatGPT, which answers my questions without too much additional ceremony.If you have any diehard users, I suspect they will cluster around very particular use cases, say business users trying to create quick internal tools, users who want to generate a quick app on mobile, scientists that want quick apps to validate data. Focusing on those clusters (your actual ones, not these specific examples) and building something optimized for their use cases seems likelier to be a stronger long term play for youSecondly, I asked it to prove a theorem, and it gave me a link to a proof. This is fine, since LLM generated math proofs are a bit of a mess, but I was surprised that it didn't offer any visualizations or anything further. I then asked it for numerical experiments that support the conjecture, and it just showed me some very generic code and print statements for a completely different problem, unrelated to what I asked about. Not very compellingFinally, and least important really: please stop submitting my messages when I hit return/enter! Many of us like to send more complex multi-line queries to LLMsGood luck

It's a black blob! It's a rotten leaf! No, it's a slug, and a pretty cool one at that.

Snorkelers in Nova Scotia, Canada, have found a number of Elysia chlorotica, commonly known as eastern emerald elysia—elusive slugs that steal the photosynthetic abilities of their food. Studying these creatures could carry implications for various human industries, but they've been difficult to study both in the wild and in the lab.

When snorkeler Elli Ofthenorth, admin of the Facebook group Snorkel 💙 Nova Scotia, first spotted the slug, she “just thought, oh, that's a rotten leaf, keep going,” she told CBC. It wasn't until her third time swimming past it that she paid closer attention and realized it wasn't just a leaf. “I just started yelling, there's a sea slug here!”

We can forgive Ofthenorth for mistaking an E. chlorotica for a rotten leaf. When the enigmatic slug eats the alga Vaucheria litorea, its primary food source, it starts using the plant's chloroplasts—the organelles that photosynthesize—to create energy for itself. The chloroplasts turn the slug green, and it looks remarkably like a leaf, veins and all, which works both as camouflage and an effective photosynthesizer. The green is temporary, and the slug eventually turns gray.

“It's like if I ate a whole bunch of spinach and then I just woke up this morning and I just sunbathed for an hour and then I wouldn't need to eat for the rest of the week,” Hunter Stevens, a biologist with the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society's Nova Scotia chapter and a member of Ofthenorth's Facebook group, told CBC. “These slugs are essentially doing the same thing.”

What's more, the slugs appear to consume algae only at the beginning of their lives, with the chloroplasts working their entire lifetimes. But since E. chlorotica can live for long periods of time without sunlight, researchers aren't sure of the extent to which the slugs rely on the organelle's photosynthesis.

After Ofthenorth's discovery near Halifax, Stevens also went in search of E. chlorotica and was greatly rewarded—he found hundreds of individuals, according to his social media post. “Yes, it's a slug that photosynthesizes like a plant!” he wrote. “They also have remarkable regenerative abilities, with laboratory studies showing they can regrow their bodies even if they are decapitated.”

Understanding how E. chlorotica can go without eating, living only on sunlight, for seemingly immeasurable amounts of time could have practical applications for areas such as clean energy technology, drug treatments, wound repair, and more, according to the CBC.

But while the slugs live along North America's east coast, from Nova Scotia all the way down to southern Florida, researchers have had a hard time getting their hands on them.

The slug's populations are “ephemeral,” Patrick Krug, a researcher at the College of Natural & Social Sciences at California State University, Los Angeles, told the Canadian broadcaster. They seem to cycle through periods of abundance and sudden disappearance. Plus, they're divas—they live in particular habitats and have particular eating habits, which could contribute to the difficulty of spotting them in the wild and sustaining populations of multiple generations in labs, the CBC said.

It remains to be seen whether “these beautiful emerald angels,” as Stevens described them in his post, will yield any of their enduring secrets any time soon.

A man in his seventies presented with a brief episode of vertical visual tilt after blinking, described as a room tilting to the right, together with rightward deviation when walking, mild vertigo, and nausea.

A brain MRI later identified a small ischaemic stroke in the right parieto-occipital junction and an older, smaller right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct; duplex sonography showed only minimal intimal atherosclerosis.

There was only slight intimal atherosclerosis, and no cardiac abnormalities were found. The stroke was classified as an embolic stroke of undetermined source.

The case report by neurologist Cecilia Ronnevi, Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues highlighted the difficulty of distinguishing central from peripheral causes and showed that early MRI can detect acute parieto-insular and parieto-occipital ischaemia in patients with subtle subjective visual tilt and vertigo.

The patient with a history of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumour treated with lanreotide had been diagnosed 6 months earlier with amaurosis fugax in the right eye and a chronic, asymptomatic right cerebellar infarction, for which no embolic source had been identified.

He re-presented to the emergency department after a brief episode of nausea and difficulty in fixating on objects. Each time he blinked and opened his eyes while standing still, he perceived the room to be slightly tilted to the right for a few seconds. This disappeared if the patient closed his eyes or kept them open for longer; however, the post-blinking tilt sensation persisted for several minutes.

The family, social, drug, travel, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

On admission, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation in room air, and body temperature were within normal limits. General physical examination (inspection, auscultation, palpation, and percussion) was unremarkable and consistent with the history.

Laboratory tests ruled out a tumour-associated prothrombotic condition.

Neurologic examination showed normal cranial nerve function; however, gaze pursuit revealed horizontal saccadic eye movements without nystagmus.

Initial CT and CT angiography were unremarkable, apart from the known chronic right posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct.

A subsequent brain MRI revealed a small diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion in the postcentral gyrus at the parieto-occipital junction, consistent with an acute ischaemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory.

Duplex sonography revealed minimal intimal atherosclerosis.

Telemetry of 36 hours did not detect atrial fibrillation. Blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, A1c, and antiphospholipid antibody levels were unremarkable. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed no embolic source or valvular abnormality, including those previously reported in association with lanreotide. Likewise, ambulatory 3-week ECG did not detect atrial fibrillation.

The differential diagnoses considered included acute stroke, acute peripheral vestibulopathy, Meniere disease, vestibular migraine, prodromal symptoms of an epileptic seizure, demyelinating disease, and dysautonomia.

Antiplatelet agents and statins were administered for an additional 3 months. During this time, the patient suffered several small and asymptomatic embolic infarcts, as well as amaurosis fugax. The therapy was switched to warfarin. There were no signs of coagulation deficiency or atrial fibrillation.

Stroke aetiology was classified as embolic stroke of an undetermined source.

“The rarity of this case is in the appearance of the transient vertical tilt only very specifically referred to post blinking (when opening the eyes again after briefly interrupting visual input) but disappearing after the eyes were opened for a longer time (allowing for visual correction). The tilt was also to the same side of the cortical lesion, which more often is contralateral for infratentorial central lesions and ipsilateral for medullary or vestibular lesions.”

The authors noted that parietal vertigo is uncommon and that symptoms of visual or bodily tilt may easily go unnoticed or be misattributed to peripheral vestibular disorders, underscoring the importance of early MRI and careful localisation in patients presenting with subtle tilt illusions and vertigo.

The FDA has granted Cleveland Diagnostics' IsoPSA test premarket approval (PMA) to help detect prostate cancer in men aged 50 years or older with elevated PSA levels.

IsoPSA is a blood assay that detects variations of the PSA protein that signal a higher likelihood of high-grade tumors. It is one of several biomarker tests included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's guidelines on early detection of prostate cancer.

Cleveland Diagnostics noted that 75% of prostate biopsies are negative for high-grade disease. IsoPSA and similar tests aim to help identify men who need a biopsy while allowing others avoid an unnecessary procedure.

IsoPSA has been available since 2020 under the FDA's Laboratory-Developed Test rubric, meaning that blood samples had to be shipped for analysis to Cleveland Diagnostics' lab. With the PMA, testing can now be done at CLIA-certified labs across the country.

The company expects the approval should increase access to IsoPSA and reduce turnaround time. “We remain focused on executing our commercial strategy and expanding access to IsoPSA,” company President and CEO Arnon Chait, PhD, said in a press release. 

The approval was based, in part, on a prospective validation study of 888 men scheduled for prostate biopsy. IsoPSA demonstrated an AUC of 0.783 for high-grade tumors, with a sensitivity of 90.2% and a specificity of 45.5%. In a real-world clinical utility study with 900 patients, IsoPSA testing led to a 55% decrease in biopsy recommendations.

The test is covered by Medicare and a growing number of commercial payers, Cleveland Diagnostics said.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) imaging software helps stroke patients receive treatment more than an hour earlier, a new study has found, supporting its wider rollout across the NHS.

The AI tool analyses CT scans in real time. It accelerates clinical decision-making and enables faster transfer of patients to specialist stroke centres.

The study, published in The Lancet Digital Health, found that for patients who presented to a primary stroke centre and were then transferred to a comprehensive stroke centre, the median door-in door-out time was a “clinically meaningful” 64 minutes shorter when the AI software was used. Thrombectomy rates at participating sites doubled from 2.3% to 4.6%, compared with smaller increases at hospitals not using the technology (1.6% to 2.6%).

Around 15,000 patients directly benefited from having their scans reviewed by the AI tool, the authors said.

“This landmark study confirms what we have already been seeing in daily practice: that stroke AI imaging is helping us deliver faster decision-making and better care for our patients,” said Dr David Hargroves, NHS national clinical director for stroke and study co-author.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in England, with around 80,000 strokes each year. 

Endovascular thrombectomy is the standard of care for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke. Used alone or with intravenous thrombolysis, it can rescue salvageable tissue, reduce brain damage, and limit long-term disability.

Timely identification of large vessel occlusion is crucial. Every 20-minute delay in thrombectomy reduces the chance of full recovery by around 1%. 

Primary stroke centres typically lack neuroradiology expertise and neurointerventional capability to deliver endovascular thrombectomy. Comprehensive stroke centres can provide these services, but delays in transfer can affect outcomes.

The AI tool identifies key stroke features within minutes. The study found the greatest improvements in treatment rates and transfer times at hospitals without on-site neuroradiology expertise, where rapid interpretation is critical.

The prospective observational study analysed data from 71,017 patients with ischaemic stroke admitted to one of 26 evaluation sites.

Patients reviewed with AI were more likely to receive thrombectomy and intravenous thrombolysis. They were also more likely to have a favourable functional outcome at discharge, with no increase in in-hospital mortality.

“These results support the routine use of AI imaging software in the management of patients with stroke,” the authors said.

The researchers noted some limitations. Patients assessed with the AI tool tended to have more severe stroke at presentation but better baseline function, which may have influenced the association with higher endovascular thrombectomy rates. Long-term outcome data were also limited. However, the authors said the clinical impact at discharge aligns with known benefits of improving access to thrombectomy.

“This technology supports clinicians to make rapid treatment decisions, which means more patients can receive life- and disability-saving treatments in time — giving them a better chance of returning to independent living,” Hargroves said.

He added that the findings provide robust, real-world evidence of the technology's impact and show why the NHS moved quickly to roll it out nationwide.

A new study by a research team at Université de Montréal highlights a critical lack of knowledge about the cognitive profiles of people living with both schizophrenia and a personality disorder. 

A comprehensive review of scientific literature from the past 24 years, published in Schizophrenia Research: Cognition, reveals that despite the high prevalence of this dual diagnosis (affecting approximately 40 per cent of people diagnosed with schizophrenia) and its association with unfavourable outcomes, the available data are surprisingly limited and fragmented. 

""Our analysis shows a significant blind spot in current knowledge,"" said Anouck Chalut, lead author of the study and a Psy. D. in neuropsychology from UdeM. ""Little is known about cognition in people living with a personality disorder in addition to schizophrenia."" 

Led by UdeM psychology professor Tania Lecomte-director of L'ESPOIR, a research laboratory in the Department of Psychology dedicated to improving treatments and services for people with severe mental disorders-the researchers combed through hundreds of scientific articles but found only 10 that met their criteria for scientific rigour. 

""We found that the existing research is limited, fragmentary and sometimes contradictory, leaving clinicians with few clear guidelines,"" noted Chalut. This gap is consequential because cognition is the strongest predictor of recovery for individuals living with schizophrenia, she said. 

Significant health challenges 

The combination of schizophrenia and a personality disorder presents considerable challenges, including more severe psychotic symptoms, serious functional impairment, reduced compliance with medication, more frequent hospitalization and increased risk of suicide. 

Despite these challenges, people with this dual diagnosis are often excluded from clinical studies or grouped together with patients who have only schizophrenia. 

""Our findings underscore the need to improve our understanding of these individuals and focus on their cognitive profiles to support functional recovery, given that cognition plays a decisive role in that process,"" said Chalut. 

The study offers concrete recommendations for both clinicians and researchers, including systematic screening for symptoms of personality disorders in people living with schizophrenia and the use of standardized tools to characterize cognitive profiles in this population. 

The research highlights the need for further investigation into adapting treatments and therapies to the specific needs of these individuals, who are often overlooked in current research, the study team argues. 

Approaches such as cognitive remediation – which aims to mitigate the effects of cognitive deficits and support strategies to strengthen impaired mental abilities, including memory, attention and problem-solving – could prove useful, the researchers believe.

The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) have announced a new collaborative initiative, the Healthcare Infection Prevention Advisory Group (HIPAG), to address infection prevention priorities of national importance.

The elimination of the CDC's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has created gaps in coordinated, multidisciplinary alignment on infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship issues, raising concerns, about potential variation and inconsistencies in organizational policies and clinical practice. HIPAG was established to help fill these gaps and ensure continuity by offering timely, evidence-informed advisory expertise that supports the needs of participating organizations and the broader healthcare community.

This initiative reflects a shared commitment to enhancing transparency, inclusivity, and scientific rigor in national infection prevention discussions.

APIC and SHEA believe that this group, which will include invited representative experts across medical societies, healthcare organizations, public health, and patient advocacy groups, will help maintain a unified approach to infection prevention as new challenges and emerging threats continue to evolve.

 HIPAG is intended to prevent fragmented or duplicative efforts, promote alignment and strengthen collaboration by connecting subject matter experts across disciplines and care settings. 

HIPAG must reflect the full breadth of expertise and experience in infection prevention and epidemiology. We are inviting expert representatives from key medical, public health, and patient groups to ensure broad and inclusive engagement across disciplines. Evidence-informed infection prevention policies save lives-there's no room for compromise. We owe it to our patients and our field to get this right.""

David Weber, MD, MPH, FIDSA, FSHEA, FRSM, President of SHEA

""APIC is proud to partner with SHEA and our colleagues across healthcare and public health in this essential initiative,"" said Carol McLay, DrPH, MPH, RN, CIC, FAPIC, FSHEA, 2025 APIC president. ""HIPAG reflects our shared commitment to ensuring that infection prevention remains science-driven, practical, and grounded in real-world expertise. This collaboration is not only critical to the safety of healthcare delivery-it is key to restoring trust and confidence among patients, families, and the professionals who care for them.""

HIPAG's structure and membership will be finalized in the coming weeks, along with a coordinated communication and engagement plan.

Organizations interested in participating in or contributing to expert representatives are encouraged to contact APIC or SHEA for more information.

NEW YORK -- U.S. Soccer held a day-long summit Tuesday for more than 400 commercial partners, donors and other soccer industry leaders ahead of Friday's FIFA World Cup draw in Washington D.C. The event, titled “Beyond the 90,” featured a series of panels and presentations highlighting the breadth of the non-profit federation's work at all levels of the sport.

The lavish event at The Glasshouse in Hell's Kitchen captured the scale of U.S. Soccer's financial glow-up under CEO JT Batson and President Cindy Parlow Cone, particularly since bringing its commercial rights in house in 2023. The logos of the federation's 22 sponsors, as well as those of media partners TNT Sports and Telemundo, were on display inside the expansive auditorium. Coffee brand La Colombe and candy maker Ferrara sponsored networking breaks between sessions. 

In addition to previewing its brand campaign for next summer's FIFA World Cup, details of which will be made public later, U.S. Soccer used the event to announce the launch of the Kang Women's Institute, a women's soccer-focused research initiative funded by mega-donor Michele Kang. The institute will have a physical presence at the forthcoming Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center outside Atlanta. Kang, the majority owner of the NWSL's Washington Spirit, has committed $55 million to the national governing body since November 2024.

“All the research is done on men -- over 94%,” Kang said. “So, we have a lot of those things to change. It's not charity. It's the only logical thing to do if you really want to advance women's football. So, I hope that this is a small match that has lit the fire, and I hope more people join the movement.”

Kang urged others in attendance to “take out your checkbook” to support U.S. Soccer's work in advancing women's soccer. Parlow Cone seconded Kang's sentiment and took the opportunity to stump for reelection ahead of a vote at the organization's Annual General Meeting in March 2026. No candidates have yet declared to run against her.

“As president of U.S. Soccer, I know we've done big things, but we're not done yet,” Parlow Cone said. “There's a reason why I'm running for reelection again. I love doing big ambitious things and getting sh-- done, and there's still more sh-- to get done.”

The day culminated in an on-stage interview by Fox Sports' Jenny Taft of U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino and assistant coach Jesús Pérez. During that session, the federation formally announced that the USMNT will play four pre-World Cup friendlies in Atlanta (March 28 vs. Belgium and March 31 vs. Portugal), Charlotte (May 31 vs. TBD) and Chicago (June 6 vs. Germany).

Former USMNT player Landon Donovan served as the emcee for the program. Other notable speakers and panelists included Batson, Bank of America President of Marketing, Digital & Specialized Consumer Client Solutions David Tyrie, M+C Saatchi Chief Growth Officer for North America Suresh Raj, former U.S. women's national team player Abby Wambach, U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker and Telemundo EVP/Marketing and Creative Claudia Chagui.","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

(New York) – The arrest and return of an asylum seeker who took his children to the Club World Cup soccer tournament final on July 13, 2025, raises serious concerns about the safety of noncitizens attending the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Human Rights Watch said today.

In May, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the World Cup organizer, to express concerns about the risks and impact of US immigration policies on the 2026 World Cup and the 2025 US Club World Cup, recommending “immediate action” to address US policies that create risk and threaten FIFA's ability to uphold its stated values of human rights, inclusion, and global participation.

FIFA responded on June 3, stating that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.” FIFA also said it would engage with relevant authorities if it becomes aware of human rights concerns.

But the incident at the Club World Cup final, uncovered by Human Rights Watch, illustrates the limitations of FIFA's efforts to address the serious human rights risks noncitizens face at FIFA events.

“A father who loves soccer planned a special day with his children at a FIFA tournament, ended up detained for three months, and was then sent to a country where he said his life is at risk,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “Under the Trump administration's policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger.”

The man, whose name and country of origin are being withheld at his request, was detained in New Jersey before the Club World Cup tournament final between Chelsea (England) and Paris Saint-Germain (France). He was in the American Dream Mall parking lot near MetLife Stadium with two of his children, ages 10 and 14, waiting for the match to begin.

The man and his family members told Human Rights Watch that police questioned and then detained him after he attempted to fly a small drone to take a photograph of his family. When the drone malfunctioned, he put the drone back in his car and was detained as he was doing so.

A local ordinance prohibits the use of drones on or over the MetLife Complex, implementing a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directive against flying drones in and around stadiums during sporting events. Unintentionally violating the FAA prohibition is a civil offense and usually only results in a fine, according to an aviation lawyer consulted by Human Rights Watch.

The man said that the officer who questioned him initially told him they would issue him a citation and release him quickly. Instead, law enforcement officers asked about his immigration status and then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. ICE agents detained the man the same day and moved to deport him.

Interviewed in the detention facility, he told Human Rights Watch that his last memory of the day of his arrest was “seeing my kids cry because I was captured.” His children thought their father would be released to attend the match. But when one child checked his phone, he saw his father's location was 40 minutes away, the man's wife told Human Rights Watch.

People facing deportation have the right to ask for asylum. The family said they fled their country of origin in 2022 after armed groups threatened to kill them.

But the administration of President Donald Trump does not ordinarily allow release from immigration detention, even if asylum seekers can post bond, a sum of money to guarantee that they will continue to appear for deportation hearings.

After three months in immigration detention, the man decided not to appeal when the immigration judge denied his asylum claim. He told Human Rights Watch the prospect of being locked up longer left him in despair. “It's so psychological what they do to you there.… You want to get out so badly.”

The Trump administration has frequently stated that immigration enforcement targets “the worst of the worst.” But research by Human Rights Watch and other groups has shown that people swept up in raids or apprehended in more targeted operations often have no criminal history.

Ahead of the Club World Cup kickoff, and in response to whether he had any concerns about ICE agents at the games, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: “I don't have any concerns … we want everyone who comes to the games to pass a good moment…. I'm sure this will be a great, great celebration.”

Especially in light of the Trump administration's abusive immigration dragnet, state and local law enforcement agencies that do not have arrangements with ICE to conduct immigration enforcement should generally not ask about immigration status or hold people for ICE to investigate their status, Human Rights Watch said. Agencies that do have such arrangements, known as 287(g) agreements, should take note of their inherent abuses and abandon them. ICE should avoid detaining asylum seekers to the maximum extent permitted by law.

FIFA should call on US authorities not to target World Cup events for immigration enforcement, including through 287(g) arrangements, Human Rights Watch said.

“The 2026 World Cup should be a celebration of soccer, not an immigration enforcement operation that destroys families and puts lives at risk,” Worden said. “This case illuminates the dire contradictions of the US preparing to welcome the world's largest sporting event while simultaneously implementing policies to separate families and deport asylum seekers.”For more details, please see below.Since President Trump took office in January 2025, the US government has taken steps to limit access to legal pathways to seek asylum. Human Rights Watch has documented how US deportation policies have exposed deported immigrants to the risk of death and human rights abuse.

Immigration and other law enforcement authorities have dramatically scaled up the number of arrests and detentions since the beginning of the Trump administration, with large operations in major cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and Chicago. Federal immigration officers have targeted Latino communities, carrying out raids and arrests based on people's perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin.

The 2026 World Cup will take place in 11 US cities and areas, including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The World Cup final will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the 2025 Club World Cup final took place.

From January 20 to October 15, ICE arrested at least 92,392 people in and around cities where World Cup games will be played, according to government data provided by ICE in response to a freedom of information request to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Human Rights Watch. This does not include arrests made by US Customs and Border Protection or other law enforcement agencies. Of all these arrests, 65.1 percent were of immigrants with no US criminal convictions, which closely tracks with nationwide trends.

In New Jersey, 73.8 percent of 5,331 ICE arrests were of noncitizens with no US criminal convictions. ICE raids have occurred in New Jersey, leading to the arrests of large numbers of people at their workplaces, including noncitizens and US citizens.

Media reported that some fans who purchased tickets to the Club World Cup sold their tickets for fear of being arrested or detained at stadiums and eventually deported. Staff from Telemundo (a Spanish-language US news outlet), Miami's mayor, and FIFA officials were at a World Cup boat party in Miami that was canceled when the vessel was boarded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Coast Guard and some attendees were asked to show documentation of their legal status.

According to online posts, DHS officers were present during Club World Cup matches outside Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, and ICE planned to be present at Lumen Field in Seattle.

The impact of arrests and raids on communities where World Cup games will be hosted has been devastating. In New Jersey, people are afraid of going outside, families have lost breadwinners, and businesses are suffering, according to members of Estamos Unidos. “Nobody feels safe,” one member said. The presence of local police during some of the documented arrests often leads to community members feeling less safe and subsequently less likely to report crime if they fear that any encounter with police could lead to them being turned over to immigration.

Many immigrants, faced with detention and deportation, have opted for “voluntary departure” in part to avoid the legal bars on re-entering the United States that come with being deported. The number of immigrants who have left voluntarily in New York and New Jersey courts from July to October 2025 increased by 1,373 percent compared to the same period last year, according to an analysis by Documented New York, an immigration-focused news outlet. This increase followed a July 8 ICE policy that limited bond eligibility for immigrants in detention.

The man arrested near the World Cup event was detained in Delaney Hall, an immigration detention facility in Newark, where there have been media reports of poor treatment of detainees, lack of food, and unsafe conditions for visitors.

An immigration judge denied the father's asylum claim in September. The father said that, traumatized by three months of detention and desperate to speak more regularly to his children, he decided not to pursue further legal action, despite his fear of returning to his country of origin. The family had to purchase air tickets for his “voluntary departure.”

Article 4 of FIFA's Human Rights Policy states that “FIFA will strive to go beyond its responsibility to respect human rights, as enshrined in the UNGPs [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights], by taking measures to promote the protection of human rights and positively contribute to their enjoyment, especially where it is able to apply effective leverage to help increase said enjoyment or where this relates to strengthening human rights in or through football.”

The familiar Vancouver Whitecaps name has a long and rich history.

The Vancouver Whitecaps FC are now just one win away from hoisting their first-ever MLS Cup, with Lionel Messi's Inter Miami standing between them and history this Saturday.

This club's story stretches far beyond its current Cinderella run. The franchise first came to life on December 11, 1973, launched by Denny Veitch and Herb Capozzi during the original NASL era. Fast-forward decades later, after submitting their MLS bid in 2008, Vancouver officially carved out their place in Major League Soccer.  

And here's the fun twist: the club hasn't always gone by the now-famous ""Whitecaps"" identity. The name and crest that supporters chant and wear today have traveled a winding, storied road through Vancouver's soccer history.

So… how did this club climb from its NASL roots to a shot at MLS glory? GOAL finds out... 

The nickname ""The Caps"" for Vancouver Whitecaps FC is an abbreviation of their official name, but also has cultural significance. It traces back to the natural scenery that defines the city, the snow-capped North Shore Mountains in Vancouver, British Columbia, framing the skyline, known as ""White Caps,"" which inspire both the team's name and nickname.

The name was coined on December 11, 1973, when club founder Denny Veitch was driving over the Lions Gate Bridge on a bright afternoon and spotted white-tipped waves below and white-topped peaks above, sparking the inspiration for the original NASL team.

The Whitecaps name first hit the pitch in 1974 with the NASL franchise, then resurfaced in 2001 for the USL side before carrying over into MLS in 2011, preserving the club's deep connection to Vancouver's coastal roots. The colors, deep sea blue, Whitecaps blue, and white, were intentionally chosen to mirror the region's ocean, mountains, and snow-dusted horizons.

1979 will forever feel like a fairy-tale chapter in Vancouver's soccer folklore, the year the Whitecaps tore through the NASL and lifted the league championship for the first time. It was the moment the club crashed through the ceiling and announced itself on the continental stage. But the party didn't last forever. The NASL's financial collapse dragged everyone down, and by 1984, both the league and the Whitecaps were gone, at least temporarily.

The city didn't stay quiet for long. Just two years later, a new side stepped into the spotlight: the Vancouver 86ers, a team widely considered the direct predecessor of today's Whitecaps. And they didn't just exist, they dominated. The 86ers ripped through the Canadian Soccer League, winning four top-division titles before the league folded in 1992. From there, the club bounced to the APSL from 1993–94, continuing to keep elite soccer alive in Vancouver.

The migration continued in 1995 when the club entered the A-League, which later became the second tier once MLS launched in 1996. For 15 rugged years, Vancouver were the perennial grinder of the second division, competing in the rebranded USL-1 from 2005–09 and then the USSF Division 2 Professional League in 2010. But it was all building toward the inevitable return to the big stage, their jump into MLS in 2011.

A key identity shift came in 2001, when the club ditched the ""86ers"" badge and officially reclaimed the ""Whitecaps"" name. More than two decades later, that identity endures. And before stepping into MLS, they added silverware to their résumé, winning USL-1 championships in 2006 and 2008.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

All you need to know about getting tickets to the two huge semi-final match-ups

A football frenzy will sweep North America in the summer, with the best soccer stars on the planet descending on the region for FIFA World Cup 2026.

Football is a funny old game, as we know, and events rarely go to script, but if the top-seeded sides do progress through to the latter stages, then we are set for some exhilarating knockout encounters. Tickets are now available for all World Cup matches, including the semi-finals, and this could be the perfect opportunity to snap them up before they are gone.

Let GOAL bring you all the vital ticket information you need regards the FIFA World Cup 2026 semi-finals in July, including how much they will cost and how you can guarantee yourself a seat at one of the standout footballing occasions of the year.

Book World Cup 2026 semi-final ticketsBuy tickets

Football fans have several opportunities to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets via the ticket portal on the FIFA site, between now and next summer.

The various sales phases, shown below, differ in terms of purchasing processes, payment methods, and ticket products.

The Visa Presale Draw was considered the first opportunity to purchase World Cup 2026 tickets and ran from September 10-19. It was only open to those fans who had qualifying Visa cards.

The entry period for the second phase took place between October 27-31. Like the first phase, it involved an application process followed by a randomized selection.

Successful applicants received a designated time slot to purchase tickets, which commenced on November 17.

Shortly before then, there was a prioritized slot (November 12-15) for residents of the three host nations (the United States, Canada, and Mexico), which allowed them early access to buy tickets.

Following the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw on December 5, the next phase of ticket sales commences. During this phase, fans will be able to submit further applications.

Closer to the tournament (Spring 2026), fans will be able to purchase any remaining tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.

FIFA hasn't said how many tickets will be released, but you can expect limited availability and quick sellouts.

To purchase tickets, you must visit the official FIFA ticketing portal and register for an account. You can then log in to your FIFA account and check out ticket availability.

Nearer the time, and if tickets sell out (which they are likely to), fans can also take to the secondary marketplace on websites like StubHub, where fan-to-fan resale will be available with fluctuating prices.

The FIFA World Cup is returning to North America for the first time since USA '94. Despite soccer's relative lack of popularity in the host nation thirty years ago, it proved to be the most one of the most successful World Cups ever, breaking average match and overall attendance records. 

We are now looking forward to another stellar soccer extravaganza in the Americas and with the tournament expanded to 48 teams for the first ever, it's set to be bigger and better than ever.

Both FIFA World Cup 2022 semi-finals in Qatar were entertaining affairs, with several of the world's elite talents rising to the occasion when it mattered most. Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez (twice) netted for Argentina as La Albiceleste beat Croatia 3-0 in the opening semi, back in December 2022. 

Twenty four hours later, France would follow Argentina's example, standing tall against another one of the tournament surprise packages, when beating Morocco 2-0. 

We are set for more drama and excitement when we reach the World Cup 2026 semis in the summer and you could be part of it. They take place on July 14 in Dallas and July 15 in Atlanta.

If you are looking for an official and secure way to resell/exchange your FIFA World Cup 26 tickets, the FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace is the official channel for doing so. The Marketplace opened on October 2 and be accessed via FIFA.com/tickets.

The FIFA Resale Marketplace is available to Canadian, American and international residents, while the FIFA Exchange Marketplace (Mercado de Intercambio de la FIFA) is intended for residents of Mexico.

One key point for resale buyers: availability can be very limited, and tickets may appear sporadically. Fans hoping to secure resale tickets should check the platform frequently, act quickly when tickets appear, and have payment details ready in advance.

It's also worth checking out secondary resellers, such as StubHub, if you're looking for FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets. Prices on secondary platforms are subject to availability and demand.

Book World Cup 2026 semi-final ticketsBuy tickets

Ticket prices for the World Cup 2026 vary by seating category as follows:

Prices will fluctuate throughout the various ticket releases/sales phases, but seats for the two semi-finals originally ranged from $420-$2780, depending on the venue, as shown below:

On secondary resale sites such as StubHub, fans can secure FIFA World Cup 2026 semi-final tickets from $1181 upwards.

FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets will also be available from secondary resellers, such as StubHub.

No, tickets will not be available for purchase at the stadiums during the FIFA World Cup 26. There will be no over-the-counter ticket sales. FIFA.com/tickets is the official portal for purchasing tickets.

The World Cup 2026 finals draw will take place at 12pm ET on Friday, December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

The 48 teams will be divided into four pots of 12. Pot 1 will consist of the three hosts and the top nine teams in the FIFA World Rankings not including the hosts. Pots 2, 3, and 4 will consist of the remaining teams according to the world rankings. The 12 groups will randomly be formed by selecting one team from each of the four pots. Two teams from the same confederation cannot be placed into the same group, with the exception of UEFA teams, where up to two teams can be in the same group.

The three host nations have been pre-allocated to three groups for scheduling purposes. Mexico has been placed in Group A and will play the opening match of the tournament on June 11. Canada and the United States have been placed in Groups B and D, respectively. They will play the third and fourth matches of the tournament, which both take place on June 12.

The four winners of the UEFA playoffs and the two winners of the inter-confederation playoffs will not be known at the time of the draw, as these matches are scheduled to take place in March 2026.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cup Draw

The Village People perform ""Y.M.C.A."" with President Donald Trump at a victory rally before his inauguration in January. Sam Greene / USA Today Network via Imagn Images

FIFA has announced that the Village People, the pop group that sings President Donald Trump's adopted anthem of “Y.M.C.A.,” will perform at the World Cup draw Friday.

The draw will take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5 in Washington for the World Cup, which will be co-hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Kennedy Center is chaired by Trump since he and his allies took over the venue's board after his return to power earlier this year.

Trump has previously said he will be “involved” in the event.

On Tuesday night, FIFA announced what it described as a “world-class entertainment line-up” that will be co-hosted by supermodel, producer and Emmy-winning television personality Heidi Klum, as well as comedian Kevin Hart and actor and producer Danny Ramirez.

There will also be live music performances from classical singer Andrea Bocelli, as well as a duet between British pop star (and FIFA music ambassador) Robbie Williams and American singer Nicole Scherzinger.

FIFA said that when the draw has concluded, the Village People will treat the audience to an “iconic” performance of “Y.M.C.A.” The song was often heard at Make America Great Again rallies during Trump's re-election campaign, as well as at Mar-a-Lago fundraisers, and Trump often dances along while his supporters sing the song.

FIFA's president Gianni Infantino was present at Trump's inauguration in January as well as his pre-inauguration rally.

After Trump expressed his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which went to Venezuelan democracy advocate Maria Corina Machado, FIFA has since announced it will award its own Peace Prize at the draw Friday, which is widely expected to go to the U.S. president. Infantino previously wrote on Instagram, after the Israel-Gaza ceasefire, that Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. The Athletic has previously reported FIFA did not consult its own FIFA Council or the organization's vice presidents before conceiving of or announcing the peace prize, and the council and vice presidents had no consultation on the selection criteria.

FIFA said the announcement of the draw conductors and assistants is still to follow. At the FIFA Club World Cup draw in Miami last December, Trump's daughter Ivanka and grandson Theo made the ceremonial first picks.

GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch Georgetown vs UMBC NCAAM game, live stream, TV channel, plus plenty more.

The Georgetown Hoyas are headed back home to the nation's capital, gearing up for a Wednesday night showdown with the UMBC Retrievers on December 3 at Capital One Arena.

Georgetown comes into the matchup still licking its wounds from a 78–65 setback against the Miami Hurricanes in the finale of the Terry's Chocolate ESPN Events Invitational on Friday in Kissimmee, Florida. 

UMBC arrives in D.C. riding early momentum with a 5–2 record, matching its strongest start since the 2021–22 campaign, which doubled as Jim Ferry's first season at the helm. 

Here, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch Georgetown vs UMBC NCAAM game, plus plenty more.

The Hoyas will face off against the Retrievers in an exciting NCAAM game on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, at 8:00 pm ET or 5:00 pm PT at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., United States.

Fans in the USA can catch all the action between the Hoyas and the Retrievers live on truTV nationally. Streaming options are available on DirecTV Stream, which offers a FREE trial to new subscribers.

It's been a rough stretch for the Hoyas, in the earlier loss to Dayton, they dug themselves an early 13-3 hole, trailed by as many as 15 before halftime, and despite a furious late push behind Mack's 24-point outburst to force overtime, they watched the game slip away. The same sluggish starts haunted them against Miami, falling behind by 21 before the break and never truly threatening, even with a career-best 23-point showing from Caleb Williams.

After the Invitational, Mack, who leads Georgetown with 16.7 points and 4.3 assists per game, didn't shy away from accountability, taking responsibility for the team's slow openings and stressing that the fix begins with him. Lewis, the high-scoring transfer from Arizona, is right behind him in production, averaging 16.6 points this season.

The Retrievers are getting their first crack at a power-conference opponent this year after finishing last season 13-19 overall and 5-11 in America East play. They most recently rolled past Delaware State 71–57 on Saturday at Chesapeake Employers Insurance Arena in Baltimore.

The offensive spark for UMBC has come from Jah'Likai King (12.9 ppg) and DJ Armstrong (12 ppg), with Armstrong lighting teams up from deep at a scorching 48.8% while averaging three triples a night. The Retrievers shoot a respectable 34.8% from long range collectively, noticeably better than Georgetown's 28.4% clip.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Success for Novak Djokovic means one thing: a 25th Grand Slam singles title.At least, for now.In 2025, Djokovic cut the perceived carbs of his schedule, playing just 13 tournaments. In four of those tournaments, he played just one match. But even that streamlined itinerary wasn't enough to convince Djokovic that the ATP Finals was worth it. The Serbian withdrew with an “ongoing injury,” but Turin was always in doubt given his participation in Athens just days before.Djokovic has lamented that, from a physical standpoint, he's up against a near-impenetrable two-headed giant in Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. He lost in straight sets to the Spaniard at the US Open (though he beat him at the Australian Open), and has dropped his last six to the Italian. If nothing else, Djokovic is giving himself more chances to flip the script. He won 27 of his last 31 matches, 15 of those wins coming in majors.But that 15-3 record at the majors includes three losses to Sinner or Alcaraz.Novak's narrow goal, combined with rivals he's having great difficulty overcoming in the format needed to achieve that goal—best-of-five set play—makes “success” more elusive than ever. Will Djokovic change his tune as time goes on? I think it's possible. When Roland Garros comes around, Djokovic will be 39. Maybe deep runs at the Slams will be seen in a different light. Maybe success at other tournaments will be cherished more.Or maybe Novak Djokovic will continue to play and approach the sport like no one else has before.—Ed McGrogan

“You can never lose if you give it all, what you have in your heart.”BySteve TignorPublished Dec 03, 2025 copy_link

This week, Steve Tignor will reveal his ATP Matches of the Year, and the TENNIS.com editors will reveal our ATP Players of the Year. The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.“We cannot lose for our country,” Flavio Cobolli said after this year's Davis Cup Final. “You can never lose if you give it all, what you have in your heart.”Coming from a man who had just led Italy to its third straight Cup title, those words might sound like a bit of poetic exaggeration. There's always a winner and a loser, right? In this case, maybe not. Bergs finished this epic struggle in tears, but listening to him later, it seemed like Cobolli had a point: Davis Cup lifts all boats.“I don't think it gets more emotional than this,” Bergs said after his 6-3, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (15) loss. “It's a combination of really, really enjoying being out there, as well as feeling so much love for your team and for the fans that I hear, dealing with a very difficult crowd.”“All those combinations make it a very emotional one. At least I'm really happy that I enjoyed myself out there.”

Cobolli's teammate Matteo Berrettini was so nervous, he pulled his shirt over his eyes and hid behind his teammates. By the time it was over, Cobolli had saved seven match points, and Bergs six.

The season's Grand Slam events were over, and the ATP's stars—Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic—had already started their vacations. But the stakes felt just as high, and the fans were every bit as involved, when these two took the court in Bologna with Italy up 1-0.The noise in the arena began at maximum volume, and somehow only grew louder over the next three hours. The players, as Cobolli said, gave everything they had on every point. Roughly the same size, and with similar baseline styles, they stood their ground and slugged, sprinted, grunted, and never backed down for three long, close sets. Cobolli, a rising star, played and performed with theatrical Italian flair. Bergs's backwards hat, sweaty brown hair, and stomping gait recalled one of the grittiest of recent players, David Ferrer.

Bergs showed enough grit to fend off Cobolli and the crowd in a tight second-set tiebreak. That set up the unforgettable finale, a 98-minute third set, capped by a 32-point tiebreaker. As the breaker went on, the two rose to the occasion at certain moments, and showed their nerves on others. Cobolli's teammate Matteo Berrettini was so nervous, he pulled his shirt over his eyes and hid behind his teammates. By the time it was over, Cobolli had saved seven match points, and Bergs six.Bergs led 3-1 4-2, 5-3, and 6-4. But with a chance to end it on his serve, he pulled the trigger too quickly and sent a forehand 10 feet long. Up again 7-6, Bergs looked like he had the point won, only to see Cobolli make a series of retrievals, get back in the rally, attack the net, and close with a smash.“What are we watching right now?” one commentator asked in astonishment, as the crowd went berserk.

“What are we watching right now?” one commentator asked in astonishment, as the crowd went berserk.

Bergs also performed a miracle or two. He saved one match point with a lunging volley winner, and another with a brilliant set of increasingly lethal forehands. At 14-14, he reflexed back a pair of defensive backhands, and drew an error on a smash from Cobolli. That set up Bergs's seventh match point. With Cobolli and the crowd reeling from his miss, and Bergs taking the ball to serve, it felt like the Belgian might finally have the upper hand for good.That's when he made his fatal mistake. On the first shot of the next rally, Bergs had a look at a mid-court forehand. Instead of pummeling it, the way he had been, he tried a drop shot. He hit it well, but this wasn't the moment to try to catch Cobolli napping. The Italian bolted to the net in plenty of time, and sliced a forehand that Bergs couldn't handle. The score was 15-15. The fans were relieved. Momentum had shifted back to Cobolli, this time for good.“There were so many important points,” Bergs said. “In those moments you're going to fail, you're going to do right things. Even if you do the right thing sometimes, doesn't mean you're going to get rewarded.”“I was just laughing so many times on court,” he said, “realizing what crazy points we're doing in a crazy atmosphere.”

Two days later, the 23-year-old Cobolli would win a second epic against Jaume Munar, to clinch the Cup for Italy and give his country another star to watch. But nothing could top his tiebreaker with Bergs. When it was over, Cobolli celebrated by tearing his shirt in half.Asked later if he was paying tribute to his favorite player, and another notorious shirt-shredder, Novak Djokovic, Cobolli said no. He was thinking of someone even more powerful.“Today I felt like I was trying to be like Hulk,” he said with a laugh.Davis Cup can still change mortals into superheroes for a day. As Cobolli said, you can't lose for your country, if you give what's in your heart.

From the Drivers' Championship showdown to a big 2026 promotion – here are the main stories ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Twenty three races down, one to go, and still three drivers in with a chance of becoming the 2025 World Champion. The season is set for a thrilling finale this weekend, and on top of the three-way battle there are plenty of other positions to be finalised, and reactions to be given, at the last race of the year in Abu Dhabi.

A week ago, it was only Lando Norris who could win himself a Drivers' Championship, but the two other contenders managed to keep themselves in the frame in Qatar, even if there were differing emotions as a result.

What looked set to be an Oscar Piastri victory – likely ahead of Max Verstappen in second and Norris in third – changed on Lap 7 in Qatar when McLaren were the only team not to bring their drivers into the pits during a Safety Car period. With the entire rest of the field doing so, it lost out on race time and the path was clear for a Verstappen victory.

Piastri still salvaged second but could not challenge Verstappen, while Norris was limited to fourth place behind Carlos Sainz. The upshot of all that was Norris retained his championship lead, but Verstappen moved into second place – 12 points adrift – and Piastri dropped to third, 16 points behind his team mate.

The equation for Norris is simple this weekend, as a podium finish will guarantee him the title. Beyond that, it's easiest to focus on what the other two contenders need to do.

Verstappen has to finish on the podium – with neither McLaren driver doing so – to have any chance. A win for Verstappen coupled with fourth or lower for Norris will win him the championship, while if the Red Bull driver is second he needs Norris no higher than eighth, or if he's third then Norris no higher than ninth.

For Piastri, a top-two finish is necessary to be in the frame, and a win would be enough as long as Norris doesn't finish in the top five. If Piastri is second, he will need Norris to be 10th or lower, and Verstappen to not finish on the podium.

Given the pace of the McLaren, the title picture still remains firmly in their hands with Norris, but as Team Principal Andrea Stella pointed out on Sunday night, they will need to execute better than they have at the last two races.

Drivers' standings after Qatar

While Mercedes are in control, there remains a chance that Red Bull could still earn second place in the Teams' Championship off the back of Verstappen's drivers' title charge.

Kimi Antonelli's mistake late on in Qatar drew misguided questions from Red Bull for a spell after the race, as the Italian rookie lost a position to Norris. Red Bull have since said they “sincerely regret” comments that the move could have been intentional, after Antonelli received online abuse.

The impact of the error that cost Antonelli fifth place was not only two extra points for Norris, but two fewer for Mercedes in their fight against Red Bull for second in the standings. Verstappen's win meant Red Bull closed in by seven points on Sunday, and sit 33 adrift heading into the final round.

There are a maximum of 43 points on offer, so Mercedes simply need to add 11 points of their own to cement second place, but given a strong overall showing from Yuki Tsunoda in Qatar – where he scored points in both the Sprint and grand prix – it's not beyond the realms of possibility that Red Bull could pick up enough points to put pressure on if Verstappen is able to win the race.

The final race weekend of the season always brings clarity on the final results, but sometimes there are more positions decided than is the case this year.

In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Antonelli are separated by just two points for sixth place, while Alex Albon in eighth could still theoretically be overtaken by any one of four drivers in Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Nico Hulkenberg or Fernando Alonso.

Below them, everyone is also in a position that could change – albeit only a win would move Franco Colapinto up in the standings – with Oliver Bearman in 13th theoretically able to climb as high as ninth or drop as low as 19th.

But the final Teams' Championship positions are deemed more important this weekend, given the extra prize money that comes with each place a team gains.

Ferrari are guaranteed to finish fourth and Williams fifth, but sixth is still up for grabs, with Racing Bulls 12 points ahead of Aston Martin. Haas in eighth (19 points behind Racing Bulls) and Sauber in ninth (24 adrift) can also both technically climb as high as sixth, though they would need big results to do so.

If Racing Bulls are able to hold onto the sixth place they currently occupy, they will end the year on a high and say goodbye to one of the stars of the season as Isack Hadjar prepares to move up to Red Bull in 2026.

Red Bull have confirmed the talented Frenchman will partner Max Verstappen next season, with the rookie having impressed in a debut year that featured a podium in Zandvoort and two other top-six finishes – so far at least – as he currently sits 10th in the Drivers' standings.

The second Red Bull seat has been a difficult one to occupy in recent seasons, with Sergio Perez replaced 12 months ago, Liam Lawson only getting two races with the team at the start of this year, and then Yuki Tsunoda managing just one top-six finish of his own in that car.

It will be an emotional weekend for Tsunoda as he loses his race seat for next year and becomes reserve at Red Bull, with Arvid Lindblad a new name on the grid next season at Racing Bulls alongside Liam Lawson.

The British-Swedish driver steps up after just one year in F2 – where he currently sits sixth in the championship with two wins to his name – and will continue the Red Bull tradition of providing opportunities to young talents.

Abu Dhabi marks the final race of the ground effect era cars that were introduced in 2022, with an emphasis on trying to create impressive aerodynamic performance from the floor while also making it easier to follow another car more closely.

It has been a very fruitful era for Red Bull and Max Verstappen, but has also seen the return of McLaren as a force at the front of the field, while Ferrari came close to a Teams' Championship last year and Mercedes have also won races.

As the field bunches up towards the end of a regulatory cycle, naturally the small differences in cars make it harder for drivers to overtake. But four teams have won races, and nine of the 10 have stood on the podium across the past three seasons, while every team finished in the top six at some stage this year.

The new regulations in 2026 provide the chance for a complete reset of the competitive order, but will also see two new names joining the fray as Audi and Cadillac become part of the grid. Audi are taking over the Sauber team, while Cadillac represent an expansion to 11 constructors, and there promises to be some exciting storylines to follow from both next season.

When the chequered flag drops on Sunday night, there will be just 50 days until the new cars are running for the first time during a private shakedown in Barcelona, and both Audi and Cadillac will be able to say that they will be on the grid for the next race, in Australia on March 8.

The tech giant's new feature will be available to Alexa+ users simply describe the moment they want, and the AI-driven tech will handle the rest.

	We've all been there: You're describing a scene from a movie, but you can't quite remember all the details. Frantic efforts to find it in your library fall short, or you can't remember if it is 45 minutes in or an hour and 40 in.


Amazon has built a solution to that conundrum, combining its AI prowess, Fire TV devices, its Alexa+ voice assistant and the vast scale of Prime Video in one new feature for Alexa+ users with Fire TV devices: Describe a scene in a movie, and Prime Video will pull up the scene instantly, no guesswork required.

	Users can describe the scene using the names of actors or characters, lines of dialogue, or whatever else they can think of. Here are some examples of requests, as outlined by Amazon:


	Amazon has thousands of movie titles available at launch, including tens of thousands of scenes, and the company says that it is indexing more all the time.

	It is worth noting that users will need to be fully-baked in the Amazon ecosystem to get the capabilities: They will need a Fire TV device (sorry Roku or Apple TV users!), a Prime or Prime Video subscription, and access to Alexa+, which is included in Prime but will soon be available as a standalone subscription.

	











	Amazon has also been integrating AI into its platform for years, going back to its X-Ray tools, which provide information about actors and scenes.

A blockbuster Paramount rights deal meets a crypto-fueled prediction platform. What could possibly go wrong?


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	On Nov. 13, TKO heralded what it termed a “first-of-its-kind sports partnership” with Polymarket, the controversial crypto-powered platform that treats news events as tradable assets. This deal promises to place betting center stage — in the words of CEO Ari Emanuel, “transforming passive viewership into active participation” — by integrating a real-time “prediction scoreboard” into the UFC's octagon experience during broadcasts on Paramount's streamer. (In August, the studio revealed a $7.7 billion rights pact.)


	The timing wasn't optimal. On Nov. 4, UFC boss Dana White confirmed an FBI investigation into the alleged fixing at a recent match after multiple online sportsbooks refunded bets following a fighter's suspicious loss. He explained he'd spoken with the bureau's director, Kash Patel, a friend from Las Vegas who previously suggested he'd like the UFC to partner in training his agents. Soon after, the issue magnified as reports emerged of other fighters having been approached to throw bouts, federal authorities having flagged a significant number of events and a wide-ranging FBI probe now apparently underway to explore suspicious betting and manipulated outcomes. White, appearing on TMZ Sports, derided this all as “total bullshit.”

	Mark Shapiro, president and COO of UFC's parent company TKO, tells The Hollywood Reporter that “we're aware of investigations into only two isolated incidents over the span of three years,” adding that UFC hosts nearly 500 fights annually and “works with an independent betting integrity service, IC360, to monitor wagering activity on every UFC event, and took immediate action in both instances.” The UFC's fight-fixing scandal has emerged as the NBA and MLB have recently faced their own crises in which players have been indicted in purported illegal sports-betting schemes. Yet mixed martial arts events are thought to be much more vulnerable to corruption.

	Among the reasons: A single participant can determine the outcome of a match; most fighters earn low pay, which means that a bet is often worth more than a purse; and there's a lack of institutional guardrails, from a union to a standardized injury reporting process. Legal exposure aside, some observers think betting problems are a serious brand danger for the UFC, a promotional organization accomplished in skyrocketing MMA's popularity. “The possibility in sport of predetermined outcomes is an existential threat,” says American University's N. Jeremi Duru, an expert in sports law. “If serious doubt is sown about true competition, then it's no longer even sport. It may be something else — art, theater, histrionics — and there might be an audience for extraordinary athletic feats that are predetermined. But that's a different audience than for competitive sport.”


	Attorney Jeremy Evans, who practices at the nexus of athletics and entertainment, agrees: “The big question becomes, ‘Is this scripted?'”


	Smith College economics professor Andrew Zimbalist, who's long consulted for players associations and leagues — including in a class-action lawsuit that MMA fighters won against the UFC for anti-competitive practices — believes that White, a classic showman, has perhaps safeguarded his organization by promoting what happens in the octagon as, above all, pure entertainment. For many fans, that's likely enough. “There's always economic viability for him in being what the WWE is,” Zimabalist says, referring to the staged wrestling company, another TKO division.

	











	Enter Polymarket. The futures exchange, now valued at $9 billion, has been a lightning rod. It had operated in a legal gray zone until acquiring necessary federal licensing after President Trump was reelected. (Donald Trump Jr. is a key investor.) Critics contend that incentives-sensitive, real-world outcomes — including for disease outbreaks and political violence — risk being warped by inside information. The danger for sports is that competition can be reduced to a mere MacGuffin for betting. 


	Shapiro dismisses any concern, noting that UFC has maintained successful compliance protections for five years in its partnership with sports betting firm DraftKings. He insists that Polymarket's utility is “as an information and fan engagement tool — a way to visualize what fans believe will happen in real time. No different from CNN or CNBC integrating Polymarket odds into their reporting on New York's recent mayoral race, congressional election coverage or the selection of Pope Leo XIV.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Kris Jenner is ‘aging in reverse' in perfect re-creation of one of her ‘80s outfits","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/03/style/kris-jenner-is-aging-in-reverse-in-re-creation-of-red-valentino-dress-from-1985/","Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:41:00 GMT","

Kris Jenner is throwing it back to the 1980s — again! 

The momager made a rare red carpet appearance on Tuesday night with daughter, Kendall, as her date at the 20th anniversary L'Oréal Paris Women of Worth event in LA.

Wearing a shade of red as bold as the beauty giant's iconic lipstick, Kris wowed in a strapless red Valentino gown with a black bow at the front and back. She wore a black tuxedo blazer over the dress, giving the design a more modern flair.

However, Jenner's gown wasn't just any old Valentino item. It was a re-creation of a dress she owned in 1985, revived in 2022 by designer Pierpaolo Piccioli during his tenure at the helm of the French fashion house.

Jenner revealed the look on Instagram, using a permanent spot on her grid for the outfit.

The original sketch of the dress is pictured alongside an '80s-era photograph of Kris wearing the look alongside her late ex-husband, Robert Kardashian. The oversized images part to reveal Kris in the present, wearing an identical gown.

“She's aging in reverse,” writes one follower. Another shares the sentiment, commenting, “An iconic princess.”

Just last week, Kris wore a vintage power suit from 1988, following the lead of her daughter, Kim Kardashian, who not only wears vintage on the regular, but was recently slammed for wearing an iconic Alexander McQueen gown in the ocean.

Kris' original Valentino gown was designed for the house's Haute Couture spring 1985 collection. It was revived in 2022 as part of a celebration of Valentino Garavani's 90th year with a Valentino Vintage Project exhibition and a book, celebrating the vibrant red hue that is so iconic of the brand.

Kris saw that sentimental dress pop up on her Instagram feed, and was compelled to reach out to Pierpaolo to ask if he could re-create the red gown for her.

While unboxing the gown on her feed, Kris shared, “I'm going to try to explain how much this package means to me, from Valentino.”

“It really touched my heart,” she continued, “because I used to have the same dress back in the ‘80s. And I reached out to Pierpaolo and asked him, ‘Could you ever re-create this dress for me?' and he said, ‘Absolutely!'”

“It brought back so many amazing, amazing memories,” Kris mused.

Though Instagram was certainly not a thing in 1985, the momager is using modern technology to ensure that the special dress gets as much exposure as possible, making its inaugural outing a red-letter day, for sure.

“The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” is having a real moment in pop culture. Now, one of its founding cast members, Jen Shah, is set to be released from prison after reporting in February 2023. Recently, Andy Cohen expounded on his previous thoughts about her returning to the show. 

The Bravo host responded to the news of Shah's early release during a November 2025 episode of his Andy Cohen Live SiriusXM radio show. He began, “I just wanna say once again for anyone who is asking. I think I've said this before… She's not coming back to The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. She's not.”

When asked why Jen won't be coming back to RHOSLC, Andy states it's because you have to draw the line somewhere.  🎧: Andy Cohen Live, December 2 📸: Deadline  #fyp #bravotv #bravo #peacock #rhoslc

Cohen continued, “So, I wish her all the best in her next life.” He then discussed her future in entertainment. According to Cohen, “I would assume she'll wind up on a reality show of some kind, but [it] won't be anything that I'm working on. I can't- I don't know that I could see Bravo working with her again, so there you go.”

From there, Cohen went on to give “kudos” to the current cast of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.” Specifically, he noted how the cast has “thrived” in the years since Shah went to prison. 

Shah pleaded guilty in 2022 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud for her role in a telemarketing scheme. Initially, the former “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star was supposed to be behind bars until 2029. However, the court continued to amend her sentence. 

Finally, PEOPLE reported on November 21, 2025, that Shah would be released from prison on December 10. Upon her release, Shah will have served 33 months of her sentence. Her manager, Chris Giovanni, spoke to the outlet about her release. 

Giovanni said, “Everyone's very grateful for the BOP's decision, especially because it means Jen will be able to reunite with her family for the holidays. It's a gift she doesn't take for granted.”

He then said, “Jen's in a really positive, hopeful place mentally. She's done a lot of reflecting and real growth during her time away, and is genuinely not the same woman as she was before. Her focus is on her family and building a healthier, more grounded life. She understands the seriousness of the mistakes she made and is excited to put this chapter behind her so that she can show everyone the woman she's worked hard to become.”

Many “Housewives” fans agree that RHOSLC is one of the best editions to the franchise in quite some time. This is so much the case that A-list celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence have weighed in on the show. 

Recently, Cohen praised season six of the show. Per Bravo, he said, “I have to say, this upcoming episode of Salt Lake City is one of my favorite, recent, full episodes of the Housewives because there's a lot of sisterhood, and there's a lot of joy, and there's a lot of coming together, but there's also a lot of kind of personal drama and kind of shocking moments.”

He continued, “And, so, I think it kind of encapsulates what the whole series is meant to be.”

Can someone explain why when Teresa got out of jail she was brought right back to RHONJ.  However when it comes to Jen Shah Bravo is not bringing her back?

							By 

	Joseph Hudak



	Producers of this month's 59th CMA Awards decided to end the show with a high-profile, cross-genre collaboration: Dallas rapper BigXthaPlug teamed up with established country star Luke Combs to perform their song “Pray Hard.” It was a show of acceptance by mainstream country music and the Nashville system to BigX, who released the album of collabs with country stars, I Hope You're Happy, in August.


Breland, the singer, songwriter, and producer behind the hit “My Truck” and songs for Keith Urban like “Out the Cage,” says there's a reason why some non-country artists are accepted by Music Row and others, like Beyoncé are not.


	“I think that country music is fine with certain artists coming over here if they do it with the artists that they trust,” he tells Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast. “For BigXthaPlug, and I don't know what he might feel like — ‘Nah, I haven't been accepted here at all…,' I don't want to assume — but what it looks like to me is that BigXthaPlug started doing some of these collabs with much success and then decided, ‘Hey, I'm going to lean all the way in and do a whole collab album with all of these pop and country artists and it's gonna work.'”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	That's in direct contrast to Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, last year's Grammy winner for both Album of the Year and Best Country Album.


	“She chose to put a bunch of artists on there that people weren't as familiar with. And didn't come to town and play the game the same way that everyone else would,” Breland says. “So it's really easy for the institutions in Nashville to be like, ‘She's not with us because she didn't come here and take all the same steps that someone like Post Malone or BigXthaPlug did.”'

	











	The mainstream Music Row response to Cowboy Carter would have been different had Beyoncé done likewise, according to Breland.


	“I promise you that if Beyoncé had made her album in town and had written with more writers and producers who were here in town and popped out somewhere on Broadway and did CMA Fest, and debuted at the Grand Ole Opry, people's reception to her in town would have been a little different.

            Changes by the Trump administration have left US diplomats demoralized and less able to do their jobs, according to a scathing new report by the union representing foreign service officers.
    


            The report, based on a survey of foreign service members, found that a vast majority of respondents — 98% — said morale had declined since January, and a third were considering leaving the foreign service early.
    


            Twenty-five percent of the foreign service has “resigned, retired, seen their agencies dismantled, or been removed from their posts” since January, the report said, and more are considering leaving.
    


            The findings of the report from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) underscore concerns voiced for months by career diplomats and foreign policy experts about the negative impact of the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the State Department and foreign assistance programs.
    


            Scores of diplomats have lost their jobs due to the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). More than 240 foreign service officers were given termination notices in July, to take effect later in the year, as part of the State Department's drastic reorganization. The report is being released as the department moves forward with those terminations, which AFSA has said is in violation of the law.
    


            “The U.S. Foreign Service is being systematically undermined by its own leadership,” AFSA President John Dinkelman warned in the report, which is set to be released on Wednesday afternoon. “The Foreign Service—the very institution tasked with navigating our global interests—is being dismantled in real time.”
    


Rubio hails end of USAID as study says its elimination could contribute to 14 million deaths in next 5 years



            More than 2,100 AFSA members responded to the survey, which was conducted between August and September of this year.
    


            Eighty-six percent said policy changes made by the Trump administration “have negatively affected their ability to implement the foreign policy of the United States,” according to the forthcoming report, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Just 1% of respondents reported any improvement, the report said.
    


            Many survey respondents reported diplomatic work is now more difficult because of cuts in budgets and staff and “diminished credibility.”
    


            Most said that “key projects and initiatives are being delayed or suspended” and that they “are managing significantly heavier workloads due to staffing losses.” Forty-six percent “report new obstacles in negotiating with foreign counterparts” due to the changes implemented by the administration.
    


            Asked to respond to the report, a senior State Department official said there were 5,751 applicants to take the foreign service officer test this year, a significant increase over past years.
    


            The official said career diplomats were “integral in informing and implementing policy” on things like the “response to Hurricane Melissa, our efforts to secure peace between Cambodia and Thailand, and our work in Iraq, Haiti, and in South America.”
    


            Foreign policy experts and former diplomats had warned that the changes put in place by the Trump administration, including the sudden suspension and cancellation of US foreign assistance, would threaten the country's credibility abroad.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke highly of State Department staff when he arrived in the role, calling them “the greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world.”
    


            In remarks on his first day as secretary, he said he wanted the State Department to be “at the core of how we formulate foreign policy, because we're going to have the best ideas of any agency, and because we're going to execute it better and faster and more effectively than any other agency in our government.”
    


            However, in the months since, many have felt the expertise of the career foreign service has been largely overlooked as President Donald Trump has mainly turned to a small team of business associates and personal allies to conduct foreign policy.
    


            State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Rubio “values candid insights from patriotic Americans who have chosen to serve their country.”
    


            He said that the use of special envoys is not new, and “those complaining are either unable or unwilling to find a way to be productive or contribute.”
    


            Many diplomats who spoke to CNN have expressed fears of reprisal. Morale has plummeted in the wake of the State Department's reorganization, during which 246 foreign service officers and more than 1,000 civil service officers were given reduction-in-force notices.
    


            Pigott said the administration's reorganization of the State Department was meant “to ensure those on the front lines – the regional bureaus and the embassies – are in a position to impact policies.”
    


            Foreign service officers who were given the notices were to be placed on administrative leave for 120 days before formally losing their jobs. But on the day that those terminations were supposed to be finalized, affected diplomats were told the State Department was extending administrative leave. This week, they received emails saying firings would be finalized on December 5.
    


            AFSA said that this is illegal under the continuing resolution to fund the government, which says that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the federal government” while it is in effect.
    


            A State Department spokesperson said the language in the continuing resolution doesn't apply to these terminations “since the State Department's lawful reduction in force (RIF) process was commenced and initiated well before the lapse in appropriations.”
    


            “Legal opinions published by both OMB and DOJ confirm that outcome. The State Department will proceed with executing the RIF process as planned,” the spokesperson said. AFSA has said it will be pursuing legal action.

A viral TikTok trend, known as the ""door kick challenge"" or ""door knock challenge,"" led to the arrests of three Florida teenagers.

According to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office (SJSO), the teens were arrested on Nov. 23 for loitering and prowling. One is 13 and two are 14.

Viral video from the ""challenge"" was captured on the home's security system. The footage captured the homeowner calling police to report that someone was ""attempting to kick their door in.""

In 911 call audio, the homeowner told police that the individuals did not appear to have weapons, but her husband had his weapon ""in his hand in case they come back.""

HOMEOWNERS TERRORIZED IN VIRAL CHALLENGE AS POLICE WARN PRANK COULD TURN DEADLY FOR TEENS

Deputies responded to the property and located three teenagers dressed in dark clothing and gloves, hiding near the victims' home.

""Show me your hands! How old are you?"" one deputy was heard asking the three teens.

""Fourteen,"" two said.

""Thirteen,"" the third suspect said as they were ushered into the police SUV.

A deputy was then heard asking the teens if they wanted to ""catch a felony today.""

""What the hell are you guys doing out here acting like this?"" the deputy asked.

""Just being stupid,"" one teen responded.

""You guys want to get shot by a homeowner when you're kicking their front door, and they think you're breaking in to kill them?"" an officer was recorded asking the teens in body camera footage. ""Because it will be justified. They don't even go to prison, and you're six feet under.""

The teens were charged with loitering and prowling; one also faces a charge of criminal mischief for damaging the door. (St. Johns Sheriff's Office)

HOMEOWNER ARRESTED AFTER ARMED CLASH WITH TEEN PRANKSTER: REPORT

According to SJSO, the teenagers went to multiple homes in the neighborhood, causing damage to the front door of one of the homes.

The three teens were arrested and charged with loitering and prowling. SJSO said that due to the damage caused to the front door of the homes, one of the teens was also charged with criminal mischief.

""This ‘challenge' is not a harmless prank. As you heard in the audio, the complainants were armed, waiting at the front door to shoot the possible intruder. Participating in this criminal act has serious and possibly life-changing consequences,"" the department said.

""Parents and guardians – please talk to your children and teenagers about the dangers of this behavior,"" they said. ""SJSO will not tolerate any participation in these challenges. We are prepared to arrest and charge individuals involved, regardless of age.""

When deputies arrived, they found the teens — two 14-year-olds and one 13-year-old — dressed in dark clothes and gloves, hiding nearby. (St. Johns Sheriff's Office)

The ""door kick challenge"" has spread on social media, with participants – mostly teenagers – aggressively banging on random residential doors, often at night, then running away.

Though reminiscent of the traditional ""ding-dong ditch"" prank, this challenge has escalated to significant property damage and caused police departments across the country to warn teens of the potentially dangerous consequences.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

One: the number of Cabinet meetings former President Joe Biden held during his final year in office in 2024. The singular meeting featured “Dr.” Jill Biden, a non-Cabinet member sitting at the head of the table and kicking off the meeting. Totally normal.

Nine: the number of Cabinet meetings President Donald Trump has held since taking office in 2025. These meetings can last anywhere from one to three hours, as was the case in August, and are televised live to the public.

Zero: the number of press conferences Biden held in 2024.

One thousand five hundred twenty-two: the total minutes of questions Trump took from the press in the first 100 days of his second term alone. No day goes by without Trump taking questions from the Oval Office, outside the White House, or on Air Force One.

And after his first three Cabinet meetings, he took almost 100 questions afterward.

Zero: the number of vacations Trump took in August, traditionally a time when presidents take significant time off.

You can agree or disagree with his policies and approach, but anyone with eyesight and hearing can clearly see that Trump works as hard as anyone in the country. He is also the most accessible president to the press by Secretariat proportions, as outlined above.

Yet, here is the New York Times with a report that Trump is losing stamina and showing signs of aging: “Nearly a year into his second term, Americans see Mr. Trump less than they used to, according to a New York Times analysis of his schedule,” it reads. “Mr. Trump has fewer public events on his schedule and is traveling domestically much less than he did by this point during his first year in office, in 2017, although he is taking more foreign trips.”

At last check, taking more foreign trips is the opposite of showing signs of aging and reduced stamina. It's also notable that the New York Times never analyzed Biden's schedule during his first year in office.

Instead, here's how the New York Times covered Biden three years into his presidency. “He is trim and fit, exercises five days a week and does not drink,” the paper of record swooned, also adding he “exhibited striking stamina.”

“Mr. Biden manages his day with more discipline than his predecessor,” the report also reads. “Jill Biden, who teaches at Northern Virginia Community College, gets up around 6 a.m. while the president wakes an hour later, according to accounts he has given. Mr. Biden has told aides that their cat sometimes wakes him in the middle of the night by walking across his face.”

How cute.

Now compare that to the New York Times's report this week on Trump.

“There is one thing Mr. Trump is doing more of in his second term: talking about the afterlife. He has brought up heaven — and the question of whether he would get in — half a dozen times since taking office for the second time.”

Memo to the Old Gray Lady: If you were nearly assassinated twice and remain the most targeted person on the planet, maybe thoughts about the afterlife begin to creep in.

Here's one more from Biden's 2023 profile. It's amazing this actually made it to print.

“Some who accompany him overseas express astonishment at his ability to keep up. When Italy's new leader pushed for a meeting while the president was in Poland, he readily agreed to add it to the already packed schedule. During a trip to Ireland, people with him said he was energized and wanted to talk at length on Air Force One rather than rest.”

Again, here's the paper, relying solely on accounts from unnamed Biden aides, taking everything at face value and presenting it as fact.

In 2024, shortly before Biden's disastrous debate against Trump at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, the New York Times ran to Biden's defense again, regurgitating the White House spin of Biden's behavior, which included shaking hands with the air after speeches, not knowing how to exit a stage after 50 years as a politician, claiming to have conversations literally with dead world leaders, and forgetting the names of his own Cabinet members. They were hilariously referred to as “cheap fake videos.”

On June 21, 2024, six days before the debate, a headline read: How Misleading Videos Are Trailing Biden as He Battles Age Doubts.

“There is the distorted, online version of himself, a product of often misleading videos that play into and reinforce voters' longstanding concerns about his age and abilities,” the report with three bylines on it reads.

“In the last two weeks, conservative news outlets, the Republican National Committee and the Trump team have circulated videos of Mr. Biden that lacked important context and twisted mundane moments to paint him in an unflattering light.”

Exactly one horrible debate and one month later to the day, Biden announced he would not seek reelection after his own party and George Clooney convinced him to get out of the way. The New York Times report aged like milk left in a sauna.

Thankfully, Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reminded reporters and the country on Monday about the New York Times's track record when it comes to reporting on the health of presidents.

“I will point out one fake news story over the weekend before I let you all go from the Times that took about one-third of the president's daily calendar and his daily schedule and said that he's doing less than he did in his first term, or he might not be fit for the job,” Leavitt said to end Monday's press briefing.

“That is unequivocally false, and it's deeply unfortunate that this story was written by the same outlet and the same reporter who wrote this, ‘Biden “is doing 100% fine” after tripping while boarding Air Force One,” she added.

Nope. It's not a joke. And when you look at what Trump has done in his first 10 months in office, it's impossible to think he's slowing down: border essentially closed; violent criminals being deported on a daily basis; record stock market highs; more than 200 executive orders signed; energy independence; a gallon of gas at its lowest cost in four years, below $3; average inflation rate of just 2.7%, compared to more than 6% under Biden; tax cuts made permanent; no tax on tips starts in 2026; better trade deals; trillions in foreign investment into the country; destruction of Iran's nuclear program; Gaza peace deal; American hostages around the world now home; and a culture shift that says it's absolutely not OK for biological men to compete against women in sports.

If those are signs of aging and falling stamina, we'd all sign up for that.

HOW HOSTILE REGIMES BOUGHT INFLUENCE IN US SCHOOLS

The New York Times and other outlets are attempting a do-over in making Trump's age and health an issue while pretending they didn't participate in the failed cover-up of Biden's health and poor aging.

President Donald Trump pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case on Wednesday, citing what he called a ""weaponized"" justice system.

Trump, who has argued that his own legal troubles were a partisan witch hunt, said on social media without presenting evidence that Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were prosecuted because the congressman had been critical of President Joe Biden's immigration policies.

Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that Cuellar ""bravely spoke out against Open Borders"" and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife ""simply for speaking the TRUTH.""

Federal authorities had charged Cuellar and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House.

Cuellar has said he and his wife are innocent. The couple's trial had been set to begin next April.

""Henry, I don't know you, but you can sleep well tonight,"" Trump wrote in his social media post announcing the pardon. ""Your nightmare is finally over!""

Cuellar, who has served in Congress for more than 20 years, is a moderate Democrat who represents an area on the Texas-Mexico border and has a history of breaking with his party when it comes to immigration and firearms.

He was among the most vocal critics of the Biden administration's response to a record number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He also is one of the last Democrats in Congress who opposes abortion rights.

Cuellar is not the only Democrat Trump has pardoned this year. In February, he pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, five years after he had commuted his sentence in a political corruption case.

Like in Cuellar's case, Trump suggested that New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, faced federal corruption charges because he made comments critical of Biden's immigration policies.

Trump did not pardon Adams, but after Trump took office, the Justice Department moved to drop the case against the mayor, who had begun working with the Republican administration on immigration issues.

A top Justice Department official, who was also Trump's defense lawyer in several of his cases, stepped in to seek dismissal in the case.

The existence of three distinct neutrino flavours, νe, νμ and ντ, is a central tenet of the Standard Model of particle physics1,2. Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected sometime later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation. Several anomalous observations inconsistent with this three-flavour picture have motivated the hypothesis that an additional neutrino state exists, which does not interact directly with matter, termed as ‘sterile' neutrino, νs (refs. 3,4,5,6,7,8,9). This includes anomalous observations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND)3 experiment and Mini-Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE)4,5, consistent with νμ → νe transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture. Here we use data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber10 in two accelerator neutrino beams to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level (CL). Moreover, we rule out a notable portion of the parameter space that could explain the gallium anomaly6,7,8. This is one of the first measurements to use two accelerator neutrino beams to break a degeneracy between νe appearance and disappearance, which would otherwise weaken the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino hypothesis. We find no evidence for either νμ → νe flavour transitions or νe disappearance that would indicate non-standard flavour oscillations. Our results indicate that previous anomalous observations consistent with νμ → νe transitions cannot be explained by introducing a single sterile neutrino state.

A broad experimental programme has shown that the three quantum-mechanical eigenstates of neutrino flavour, νe, νμ and ντ, are related to the three eigenstates of neutrino mass, ν1, ν2 and ν3, by the unitary Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) matrix11,12. This mixing between flavour and mass states gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, in which neutrinos transition between flavour eigenstates with a characteristic wavelength in \(L/{E}_{\nu }\propto {(\Delta {m}_{ji}^{2})}^{-1}\), where L is the distance travelled by the neutrino, Eν is the neutrino energy and \(\Delta {m}_{ji}^{2}={m}_{j}^{2}-{m}_{i}^{2}\) is the difference between the squared masses of the mass eigenstates νi and νj. The three known neutrino mass states give rise to two independent mass-squared differences and thus to two characteristic oscillation frequencies that have been well measured with neutrinos from nuclear reactors13,14, the Sun15, the atmosphere of Earth16,17 and particle accelerators18,19,20.

In apparent conflict with the three-neutrino model, several experiments during the past three decades have made observations that can be interpreted as neutrino flavour change with a wavelength much shorter than is possible given only the two measured mass-squared differences3,4,5,6,7,8,9. These observations are often explained as neutrino oscillations caused by at least one additional mass state, ν4, corresponding to a mass-squared splitting of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\gtrsim 1{0}^{-2}\,{{\rm{eV}}}^{2}\), which is much greater than the measured \(\Delta {m}_{21}^{2}\) and \(\Delta {m}_{32}^{2}\). New mass states would require the addition of an equivalent number of new flavour states, in conflict with measurements of the Z-boson decay width21, which have definitively shown that only three light neutrino flavour states couple to the Z boson of the weak interaction. Therefore, these additional neutrino flavour states must be unable to interact through the weak interaction and are thus referred to as ‘sterile' neutrinos. In this analysis, we focus specifically on light sterile neutrinos—those with masses below at least half the mass of the Z boson. It should be noted that the term ‘sterile neutrino' has also been used to describe new particles, such as heavy right-handed lepton partners, that are potentially more massive than the Z boson. However, our study does not directly test these scenarios. The discovery of additional neutrino states would have profound implications across particle physics and cosmology, for example, on our understanding of the origin of neutrino mass, the nature of dark matter and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe.

With the addition of a single new mass state ν4 and a single sterile flavour state νs, the PMNS matrix becomes a 4 × 4 unitary matrix described by six real mixing angles θij (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4). Oscillations driven by the two measured mass-squared splittings have not had time to evolve for small values of L/Eν. The νμ to νe flavour-change probability, \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\), and the νe and νμ survival probabilities, \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\) and \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{mu}}}}\), can then, to a very good approximation, be described by

where θee ≡ θ14, \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu \mu }}})\equiv 4{\cos }^{2}{\theta }_{14}{\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}(1-{\cos }^{2}{\theta }_{14}{\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24})\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\equiv {\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{14}){\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}\), following the common parameterization22. Flavour transitions due to these new oscillation parameters are experimentally probed by observing unexpected deficits or excesses in charged current (CC) νe and νμ interactions in a flavour-sensitive neutrino detector from a source of well-defined neutrino flavour content.

Observations compatible with a fourth neutrino mass state have been made in measurements of intense electron-capture decay sources6,7,8, in which a deficit in detected νe rates implies non-unity \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\) from a \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2} > {\mathcal{O}}(1\,{{\rm{eV}}}^{2})\). Although a hint of non-unity \({P}_{{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\to {\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}}\) is provided by the nuclear-reactor-based Neutrino-4 experiment9, this result is in conflict with other reactor-based observations from DANSS, NEOS, PROSPECT and STEREO, which see no evidence for L/Eν-dependent \({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\) disappearance23,24,25,26. Two accelerator-based experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE, have observed potential evidence of non-zero \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\) associated with large mass splittings of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2} > {\mathcal{O}}(1{0}^{-2}\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2})\). The LSND experiment observed an anomalous excess of \({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\) interactions in a π+ decay-at-rest beam3. The MiniBooNE experiment, situated downstream from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) proton target facility generating a beam of GeV-scale νμ and \({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}}\) from decays of boosted π+ and π−, observed an excess of electromagnetic showers indicative of νe interactions that would imply a non-zero \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\) (refs. 4,5). Observations of νe disappearance and νe appearance should be accompanied by νμ disappearance (non-unity \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}}\)) if the PMNS matrix is unitary. No conclusive observation of this νμ disappearance has been reported27,28,29. The overall picture of the existence and phenomenology of sterile neutrino states thus remains inconclusive.

In this article, we present new results on sterile neutrino oscillations from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiment at Fermilab10. Situated along the same BNB beamline hosting the MiniBooNE experiment, MicroBooNE was conceived to directly test the non-zero \({P}_{{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}\to {\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}}\) observation of MiniBooNE. By supplanting the Cherenkov detection technology of MiniBooNE with the precise imaging and calorimetric capabilities of a LArTPC, MicroBooNE can reduce backgrounds and select a high-purity sample of true νe-generated final-state electrons. The first νe measurement results of MicroBooNE using differing final-state topologies showed no evidence for an excess of νe-generated electrons from the BNB30,31,32,33. These results were used to set limits on νμ → νe flavour transitions, excluding sections of the region in \((\Delta {m}_{41}^{2},{\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}}))\) space favoured by LSND and MiniBooNE data34. As the BNB has an intrinsic contamination of electron neutrinos, the disappearance of electron neutrinos can cancel the appearance of electron neutrinos from νμ → νe oscillations35. This effect leads to a degeneracy between the impact of the mixing angles θμe and θee of equations (1) and (2) that weakens the sensitivity to the parameters of the expanded 4 × 4 PMNS matrix.

We overcome the limitations of the degeneracy between νe appearance and νe disappearance by performing one of the first oscillation searches using two accelerator neutrino beams: the BNB and the Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam. The MicroBooNE detector is aligned with the direction of BNB and is at an angle of about 8° relative to the NuMI beam. Beam timing information is used to distinguish and record events from each beam separately. This configuration results in two neutrino datasets differing in the intrinsic electron-flavour fraction. The electron-flavour content of BNB is 0.57% and that of the NuMI beam is 4.6%. These two independent sets of data, with substantially different electron-flavour contents, break the degeneracy between νe appearance and disappearance. We show the impact of using two beams in Fig. 1a,b, in which we compare simulated νe energy spectra from the BNB and the NuMI beam for the three-flavour (3ν) hypothesis and for two sets of parameters of the expanded four-flavour (4ν) PMNS model with \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}=1.2\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2}\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})=0.003\). For \({\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}=0.0045\) the νe appearance and disappearance cancel in the BNB, leaving a νe spectrum that is almost identical to the 3ν case, whereas the NuMI beam shows an indication of νe disappearance. The appearance and disappearance effects almost fully cancel in the NuMI beam for \({\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}=0.018\), whereas the BNB shows a clear indication of νe appearance. In the Methods, we provide further discussion of this degeneracy over a broader range of mass-squared splittings and mixing angles.

a,b, Simulated reconstructed energy spectra of FC CC νe interactions in MicroBooNE from the BNB (a) and the NuMI beam (b). The dark blue histograms show the 3ν expectation for \({\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}={\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})=0\). The light blue and red histograms show expectations for two sets of parameters of the 4ν model, both with \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}=1.2\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2}\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})=0.003\). The light blue histograms show the expectation for \({\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}=0.018\) and the red histograms show the expectation for \({\sin }^{2}{\theta }_{24}=0.0045\). Note that these parameters were chosen specifically to highlight differences in the oscillated spectra between BNB and NuMI and do not imply that parameter spaces associated with these values are newly excluded by this result.

Using the two-beam technique, this new MicroBooNE analysis achieves marked improvements in sensitivity to the parameters \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\) relative to MicroBooNE's prior sterile neutrino analysis over a broad range of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) values. These improvements are shown by the sensitivities presented in Extended Data Fig. 2. The results presented here using two neutrino beams place robust new constraints on the validity of the sterile neutrino hypothesis in explaining existing short-baseline anomalies in neutrino physics. This analysis strengthens the direct test of the sterile neutrino interpretation of the MiniBooNE anomaly and allows MicroBooNE to probe the \({\sin }^{2}(2{{\theta }}_{{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}})\) parameter space favoured by LSND. We also constrain \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})\), complementing existing exclusions from reactor, solar36,37 and β-decay38 experiments, thereby further restricting the sterile neutrino parameter space relevant to the gallium anomaly.

We use data corresponding to 6.369 × 1020 protons on target (POT) in the BNB, with magnetic van der Meer horns configured to focus positively charged hadrons, leading to a νμ-dominated beam with a 5.9% \({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}}\) component and a 0.57% \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}+{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\) component. From the NuMI beam, a total of 10.54 × 1020 POT are used, in which 30.8% were taken with horns configured to focus positively charged hadrons and the remainder with horns focusing negatively charged hadrons. The NuMI flux observed in the MicroBooNE detector, with both horn configurations combined, is νμ dominated with a 42.1% \({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}}\) component and a 4.6% \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}+{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\) component. In the rest of this paper, we do not discriminate between neutrinos and antineutrinos and refer to the \({\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}+{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}}\) and \({\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}+{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}}\) samples as νμ and νe samples for brevity. For both BNB and NuMI, the POT used in this analysis represent roughly half of the total data collected by the MicroBooNE detector; additional data remain available for future studies.

The LArTPC detector of MicroBooNE has an active volume of 10.4 × 2.6 × 2.3 m3 containing 85 tonnes of liquid argon. Charged particles passing through the argon create ionization trails. A 273 V cm−1 electric field drifts the ionization electrons towards an anode plane consisting of three layers of wires separated by 3 mm and each with a 3-mm wire pitch that collects the electrons and enables three-dimensional imaging of the neutrino interactions. The passage of charged particles through the argon also produces scintillation light that is collected by a system of photomultiplier tubes to provide timing information. Signal processing and calibrations of MicroBooNE data are described in refs. 39,40,41,42,43,44.

Neutrino interactions in the LArTPC are reconstructed with the Wire-Cell analysis framework45. The techniques for identifying and reconstructing neutrino interactions and their energies have been described elsewhere33. We select a sample of CC νe interactions from the BNB (NuMI beam) with 82% (91%) purity and 46% (42%) efficiency, and a sample of CC νμ interactions with 92% (78%) purity and 68% (62%) efficiency. The CC νe and CC νμ samples are divided into fully contained (FC) and partially contained (PC) samples, depending on whether all charge depositions are contained in a fiducial volume 3 cm within the TPC boundary. The CC νμ events that contain a reconstructed π0 are separated into two additional FC and PC samples per beam. Neutral current (NC) interactions that produce a π0 are distinguished by the absence of a long muon-like track and the presence of detached reconstructed electromagnetic showers. These form an additional sample. In total, we define 14 distinct event categories, seven for each beam.

We produce a Monte Carlo prediction of our 14 samples, to which we compare the data. There is substantial systematic uncertainty creating this Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty on the predicted rates of the 14 samples is given in Table 1 and is referred to as the unconstrained systematic uncertainty. The largest uncertainties come from neutrino interaction modelling for the BNB samples and from a combination of neutrino flux and interaction uncertainties for the NuMI samples. Many of these uncertainties are highly correlated. Thus, a combined fit of all samples effectively constrains the uncertainties on the CC νe prediction and at the same time allows the CC νe prediction to be modified, as can be seen from Table 1. The pionless samples constrain uncertainties on CC νe signal events, whereas the π0 samples constrain uncertainties on the dominant background.

Uncertainties on the neutrino flux prediction arise from uncertainties in the production of charged pions and kaons in the BNB and NuMI targets and the material around the target halls and hadron-decay volumes. These uncertainties are evaluated through comparison with external hadron production data46,47,48, following a procedure similar to that described in ref. 49. The νe flux from three-body K and μ decays is highly correlated with the νμ flux from two-body π and K decays, allowing our νμ samples to effectively constrain the uncertainties on the νe flux predictions. The neutrino interaction model is tuned using datasets of pionless CC interactions from the T2K experiment50. Uncertainties on this neutrino interaction model are evaluated by varying the input parameters within their allowed uncertainties. These uncertainties are correlated between the BNB and NuMI datasets and between the CC νμ and νe samples because of the lepton universality of the weak interaction. Uncertainties on the simulation of the detector include uncertainties on the response of the detector to ionization, uncertainties on the amount of ionization charge freed by passing charged particles through the detector, uncertainties on the electric field map of the TPC, uncertainties on the production and propagation of scintillation light, uncertainties on backgrounds from interactions occurring outside the cryostat, and uncertainties on finite statistics of the simulation samples used for predictions.

The simultaneous fit to the 14 samples from the BNB and the NuMI beam incorporates all sources of systematic uncertainty through a covariance matrix. We allow \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\), \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})\) and \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) complete freedom within unitarity bounds as parameters of the fit. The covariance-matrix formalism χ2 test of the fit can be found in the Methods. The constrained predictions shown in Fig. 2 assume the 3ν hypothesis of \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})={\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})=0\). They agree well with the data, with a P-value of 0.92. The best-fit values for the oscillation parameters in the 4ν hypothesis are \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}=1.30\times 1{0}^{-2}\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2}\), \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})=0.999\), and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})=0.999\), with a χ2 difference with respect to the 3ν hypothesis of

We observe no marked preference for the existence of a sterile neutrino with a P-value of 0.96 evaluated using the Feldman–Cousins procedure.

The data points are shown with statistical error bars. The constrained predictions for each sample are shown for the 3ν hypothesis as the solid histograms, with the blue showing the true CC νe events and the green showing the background events. The background category contains CC νμ interactions, NC neutrino interactions, cosmic rays and interactions occurring outside the fiducial volume of the detector. The yellow band shows the total constrained systematic uncertainty on the prediction.

Exclusion contours are calculated using the frequentist CLs (confidence level as a function of s) method51. The exclusion contour in any two-dimensional parameter space is obtained by profiling the third free parameter. At any point in the two-dimensional space, the value of the profiled parameter that minimizes the χ2 with respect to the data is chosen. Figure 3a shows the 95% CLs exclusion contour in the \((\Delta {m}_{41}^{2},{\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}}))\) parameter space. The region allowed at 99% CL by the LSND measurement and the vast majority of the region allowed at the 95% CL by the MiniBooNE experiment are excluded. Figure 3b shows the 95% CLs exclusion contour in the \((\Delta {m}_{41}^{2},{\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}}))\) parameter space. A notable portion of the region allowed by gallium measurements and part of the region derived from the Neutrino-4 measurement are excluded. In the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2, we compare our exclusions with the expected median sensitivities.

a,b, The red lines show exclusion limits at the 95% CLs level in the plane of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}})\) (a) or \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{e}}{\rm{e}}})\) (b). All the regions to the right of these lines are excluded by the MicroBooNE data. In a, the yellow shaded area is the LSND 99% CL allowed regions3, which neglects the degeneracy between νe disappearance and appearance. The light blue area is the MiniBooNE 95% CL allowed region58, considering both νe disappearance and appearance. In b, the purple shaded area is the 2σ allowed region of the gallium anomaly59. The dark blue shaded area is the 2σ allowed region from the Neutrino-4 experiment9. For context, note that the stronger-than-expected constraint on \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\), driven by the deficit observed in the BNB νe CC FC sample and the excess in the NuMI νμ CC sample, is discussed in detail in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2.

In summary, using data from the MicroBooNE detector, we report one of the first searches for a sterile neutrino using two accelerator neutrino beams. The oscillation fit to the 4ν model using a total of 14 CC νe, CC νμ and NC π0 samples from the BNB and the NuMI beam in a single detector achieves a marked reduction of systematic uncertainties and a powerful mitigation of degeneracies between νe appearance and disappearance. The result shows no evidence of oscillations induced by a single sterile neutrino and is consistent with the 3ν hypothesis with a P-value of 0.96. We comprehensively exclude at a 95% CL the 4ν parameter space that would explain the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies through the existence of a light sterile neutrino in a model with an extended 4 × 4 PMNS matrix. Our result expands the diverse range of experimental approaches, excluding regions that would explain the gallium anomaly and the Neutrino-4 observation with a light sterile neutrino. This work, therefore, provides a robust exclusion of a single light sterile neutrino as an explanation for the array of short-baseline neutrino anomalies observed over the past three decades, representing the strongest constraint from a short-baseline experiment using accelerator-produced neutrinos. Expanded models, including several light sterile neutrinos52, neutrino decay effects53,54 or production and decay of new particles connected with the dark sector55,56 might explain the anomalies. The Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Programme57 at Fermilab adds two new LArTPC detectors in the BNB, at different distances from the proton target. Future measurements by MicroBooNE and the broader SBN Programme can shed light on this expanded model space, with future comprehensive insights provided by near-term short-baseline measurements from diverse flavour channels and energy regimes.

The BNB and the NuMI are conventional neutrino beamlines that use intense proton beam pulses to generate on-axis neutrino fluxes peaking in the neutrino-energy range 0.5–5 GeV. Boosted charged mesons escaping the target are focused into a decay pipe using magnetic horns, allowing decaying mesons to impart much of their kinetic energy directly to their neutrino product. The MicroBooNE detector is on the axis of the BNB, 468.5 m from the proton target. The detector is about 8° off-axis and 679 m from the proton target of the NuMI beam. The muon flavour components of these beams are mostly generated via the primary decay channel of the dominant π mesons, \({\pi }^{\pm }\to {\mu }^{\pm }+{\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}}({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}})\), whereas the electron-flavour component is generated by decay of the pion's boosted μ± daughter, by \({\mu }^{\pm }\to {e}^{\pm }+{\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{\mu }}}({\nu }_{{\rm{\mu }}})+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}})\), and by semileptonic decays of sub-dominant K mesons, specifically \({K}^{\pm }\to {\pi }^{0}+{e}^{\pm }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}})\) and \({K}_{{\rm{L}}}^{{\rm{0}}}\to {\pi }^{\mp }+{e}^{\pm }+{\nu }_{{\rm{e}}}({\overline{\nu }}_{{\rm{e}}})\).

Neutrinos in the BNB are created by colliding protons with a kinetic energy of 8 GeV on a beryllium target, whereas in the NuMI beamline, 120 GeV protons collide with a carbon target. These differences serve to generate a higher on-axis beam energy in the NuMI beam, as well as a greater proportion of K meson production, leading to a higher νe content at the highly off-axis position of MicroBooNE. The NuMI beam also incorporates a longer charged-meson decay pipe (675 m) than the BNB (50 m), which increases its electron-flavour content by facilitating a higher proportion of decays of secondary μ+ from upstream π+ decay. Although the latter effect drives higher electron-flavour content on-axis for NuMI relative to the BNB, it is the larger proportion of unfocused or poorly focused K mesons of NuMI that drives its elevated electron-flavour content at the off-axis angle of MicroBooNE relative to the on-axis flux of BNB.

The simulation of the neutrino flux at MicroBooNE accounts for the production of hadrons from the initial interaction of the proton beam on the target and the propagation of these hadrons through a detailed beamline geometry description, achieved using the Geant4 toolkit60. Hadron production cross-sections are constrained by dedicated external measurements where available, tailored to the specific beam parameters, including target differences and initial proton beam energy. The BNB simulation, identical to that used at MiniBooNE61, uses Geant v.4.10.4 with a custom physics list and constrains π± yields with data from the HARP experiment62, along with an updated K+ production constraint from SciBooNE63,64. The NuMI simulation has been updated to Geant v.4.10.4 with the FTFP-BERT physics list65. The constraints on π± and K± yields from the NA49 experiment at CERN46,47 are implemented using the PPFX toolkit49, which has been updated to use the new Geant version. Uncertainties are estimated for each process and various components of the beamline geometry, resulting in a combined systematic uncertainty of approximately 13% for the BNB and 26% for the NuMI beam on the integrated flux. These uncertainties on the fluxes are different from the uncertainties quoted in Table 1, which are on the overall event rates. These uncertainties are dominated by hadron production rates and are larger for the NuMI beam because of the lack of constraints at large off-axis angles from dedicated hadron production experiments. As the nature of neutrino production in the two beams is different, the uncertainties are considered uncorrelated across the respective beams.

The interplay between oscillation of intrinsic νμ and νe components in the BNB and the NuMI beam is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. For various combinations of the expanded 4ν PMNS mixing angles, and assuming \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}=1.4\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2}\), the ratio of predicted νe signal events with 0 < Eν < 2.5 GeV in MicroBooNE relative to the 3ν prediction is shown for the BNB on the x-axis and for the NuMI beam on the y-axis. By tracing vertically along x = 1, we observe that a MicroBooNE BNB νe measurement could be consistent with the 3ν hypothesis of θee = θμe = 0 as well as with non-zero mixing angles in the alternate 4ν case. The addition of a NuMI νe measurement enables a much clearer interpretation of the allowed oscillation behaviour, while also strengthening the constraining power of the analysis. Specifically, perfect agreement between data and the 3ν prediction for both BNB and NuMI would favour the null oscillation case, whereas a large deficit in the high νe-content NuMI beam would indicate competing appearance and disappearance effects in the BNB νe sample. Moreover, we can see that the range of allowed 4ν predictions in NuMI and BNB when taken together is quite restricted, allowing us to set tighter limits on this oscillation model based on the observed CC νe event rates after constraints in Table 1 (x ≈ 0.9, y ≈ 1).

Extended Data Fig. 2 shows the impact of the degeneracy breaking on the sensitivity to the 4ν parameter space. The dashed lines show the exclusion regions of the previous BNB-only analysis of MicroBooNE34, compared with the solid red lines, which show the exclusions obtained by this analysis when including the NuMI beam data.

The combined statistical and systematic uncertainties on the 14 event samples are described by the covariance matrix

where the Ci,j are the bin-by-bin covariance matrices between the ith and jth event samples. These covariance matrices are the sums of the covariance matrices arising from statistical uncertainties and from each source of systematic uncertainty,

where the sum runs over the k sources of systematic uncertainty. The covariance matrix for the statistical uncertainty follows the Pearson format.

Figure 2 and Table 1 demonstrate the power of the 14 event samples to effectively constrain the systematic uncertainties due to the correlations present in the covariance matrix. To produce the constrained predictions shown in Fig. 2 and the constrained systematic uncertainties in Table 1, a conditional constraint formalism66 is used, which uses the 14 event samples simultaneously to constrain the systematic uncertainties and to provide updated predictions for each event sample. To understand how the constraint is applied to the ith event sample, the full unconstrained covariance matrix can be written as

where elements with a subscript x represent the remaining 13 blocks of the full matrix. An updated, constrained covariance matrix for the ith event sample is obtained as

Given the unconstrained binned prediction for the ith event sample, μi, and the remaining binned prediction and data samples, μx and nx, a constrained binned prediction can also be formed as

To perform the oscillation fit, a χ2 test statistic,

is formed using the 14 binned event samples from the data, N = (n1, …, n14), where ni is the ith event sample from the data, and the corresponding unconstrained binned predictions for the 14 event samples, M = (μ1, …, μ14). The oscillation parameters used to produce the prediction are varied until χ2 is minimized. As the bin-to-bin correlations between the 14 event samples are contained in the matrix Σ, minimizing this χ2 intrinsically incorporates the constraint procedure into the measurement of the oscillation parameters. As χ2 is minimized, the absolute systematic uncertainty varies as the number of oscillated neutrino interactions within the fiducial volume changes, whereas the fractional systematic uncertainty remains constant. By contrast, the absolute systematic uncertainty related to non-neutrino backgrounds and out-of-fiducial-volume neutrino interactions remains unchanged. Consequently, the total covariance matrix is updated in accordance with the oscillation parameters of interest.

Exclusion limits on the oscillation parameters are calculated using the frequentist-motivated CLs method51, which is commonly used for determining exclusion limits in high-energy physics. The CLs test statistic is defined as CLs = P4ν/P3ν, where P4ν and P3ν are the one-sided P-values of \(\Delta {\chi }_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{L}}}_{{\rm{s}}},{\rm{d}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{a}}}^{2}\) under the 4ν and the null 3ν hypotheses, respectively, where

at a given point in the 4ν parameter space. These P-values are one-sided because the test statistic measures the deviation from the null in the specific direction of the alternative hypothesis. The P-values are determined using a frequentist approach by generating pseudo-experiments with the full covariance matrix, assuming the respective hypothesis is true. The region in which CLs ≤ 1 − α is excluded at the confidence level α. By generating pseudo-experiments under the null 3ν hypothesis, expected exclusion limits are calculated across the 2D parameter spaces of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) and \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\) or \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})\).

To quantify the expected sensitivity of the analysis, the median \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e(ee)}}})\) value from all expected exclusion limits is determined for each \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) value. These median sensitivities are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2 and are compared with the exclusions set using the data. To show the expected level of fluctuations of the measured limit from the median sensitivity, 1σ and 2σ bands are also shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, which encompass the central 68.3% and 95.5% of exclusions from the pseudo-experiments. In \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu e}}})\) space, our exclusion is stronger than our median expected sensitivity. Two factors contribute to this stronger exclusion. First, a deficit in the BNB CC νe sample more strongly disfavours νe appearance. Second, the excess in the NuMI CC νμ sample leads to a reduction in the constrained fractional uncertainty on the NuMI νe prediction through the joint fit procedure, which in turn further strengthens the exclusion limit. In \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{ee}}})\) space, the deficit in the BNB CC νe FC sample plays the opposite role, slightly favouring νe disappearance and making the exclusion contour weaker than the median sensitivity.

As shown in Table 1, a combined fit of the 14 reconstructed samples constrains the signal CC νe prediction and its uncertainties due to the correlations between the sideband and the signal channels. For the NuMI CC νe signal sample in particular, a crucial driver of the constraint is the corresponding CC νμ sideband, shown in Extended Data Fig. 3. Before the fit, the normalization difference between data and the prediction is 24.5% with an overall uncertainty of 21.1% on the prediction.

To evaluate the impact of this difference on the combined fit, we can extend the covariance matrix used in the analysis (364 × 364, corresponding to the energy spectra of the 14 channels) by adding a bin representing the overall NuMI CC νμ normalization (combining FC and PC) and computing the respective covariances with the other 364 analysis bins, resulting in a 365 × 365 matrix. We can then obtain a post-fit mean and error on this normalization parameter by constraining the 364 × 364 block to the data using equations (8) and (9). This gives us an estimate of how much this parameter is effectively being pulled in the combined fit. The post-fit value of this parameter is 1.28 ± 0.058, indicating consistency with the corresponding observed value as well as a modest pull of  about 1.3σ.

The measured data, predicted signal and background, along with their complete systematic uncertainties for the corresponding reconstructed neutrino energy bins in the νe channels, are publicly accessible on HEPData (https://doi.org/10.17182/hepdata.166435.v1) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17161263). Moreover, Δχ2 values for each 4ν hypothesis across the three-dimensional grid of oscillation parameters are provided.

The x-axis (in log scale) shows the expected CC νe event rate in the MicroBooNE detector in the 4ν scenario, with respect to the 3ν scenario, from the BNB. The y-axis (in linear scale) shows the same ratio from the NuMI beam. The lines indicate how these ratios depend on the oscillation parameters of the expanded 4ν PMNS matrix for \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}=1.4\,{{\rm{e}}{\rm{V}}}^{2}\).

The red solid lines show the measured exclusion lines at the 95% CLs level in the plane of \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) and (a) \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{\mu }}{\rm{e}}})\) or (b) \({\sin }^{2}(2{\theta }_{{\rm{e}}{\rm{e}}})\). The blue dashed lines show the median expected sensitivities. The green and yellow bands show the 1σ and 2σ expected fluctuations around the median sensitivities at each \(\Delta {m}_{41}^{2}\) value. The red dashed lines show the previous MicroBooNE BNB-only result34 and the blue solid lines shows the measured NuMI-only exclusions at 95% CLs.

Reconstructed energy spectra of events selected as (a) fully contained CC νμ candidates in the NuMI beam, and (b) partially contained CC νμ candidates in the NuMI beam. The data points are shown with statistical error bars. The constrained predictions for each sample are shown for the 3ν hypothesis as the solid histograms, with the blue showing the true CC νμ events and the green showing the background events. The background category contains NC neutrino interactions, cosmic rays, CC νe interactions, and interactions occurring outside the fiducial volume of the detector. The yellow band shows the total systematic uncertainty on the prediction.

Uptime Kuma is really nice: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kumaSupports all sorts of alerts and can even tell you if it ever looks like your TLS certs will soon expire (if any automation is broken, or you use commercial certs with manual rotation).

A CI that's completely broken and not building anything cannot produce incorrect results.If it's producing no result at all, you know it's broken, not simply incorrect.

Currently Zig is the second most ""stared"" project on Codeberg (1443 stars). The first one is forgejo/forgejo (3154 stars) which is powering Codeberg, and the third one is dnkl/foot terminal emulator (1434). (see https://codeberg.org/explore/repos?q=&only_show_relevant=tru...)It's always interesting to see big and significant projects moving away from major commercial platforms. Could it be a sign of something new on the horizon?

I always like to move as much as possible into the repo itself, 'issues' etc in a TODO, build scripts, or however you want to achieve that, so you can at least carry on uninterrupted when the host is down.

That doesn't make it impossible to buy it, but all profits from a sale must flow into recognized public good efforts. The incentive to sell for huge sums is just much lower for all people involved.

Both Codeberg and sourcehut are good options when escaping the walled gardens of Big Tech :)

Remember Ready or Not? That horror comedy starring scream queen Samara Weaving that ends with her in a wedding dress, covered in blood, taking a well-earned drag from a cigarette, having just survived a messed-up family tradition that saw her hunted for sport? Well, there's a sequel film on the horizon called Ready or Not 2: Here I Come that sees her put right back into the horrors of a new game for her life.

The trailer opens up on Weaving's Grace waking up handcuffed to a hospital bed shortly after the events of the first film, as Elijah Wood's creepy lawyer character exposits to her that her killing her family (justifiably, I might add) only set off a new chain of events. Evidently, by surviving that game of Hide and Seek with the Le Domas family, Grace pissed off four of the “High Council” families, leading to a brand new game she must play for her life. If that sounds a little like John Wick, we won't hold it against you. Second verse, same as the first for Grace; the name of the game will see these newer, richer assholes try to kill her again.

Key among the rich assholes (actors, who we assume are nice people IRL) out for Grace's head are Shawn Hatosy, Kevin Durand, David Cronenberg, Nestor Carbonell, Varun Saranga, Dan Beirne, and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Despite this game having a pretty stacked card against Grace, she's joined (unwittingly) by her sister, Faith (Kathryn Newton). Alongside her sister, Grace must survive yet another messed-up game of death and, hopefully, find a way out so she can put an end to this chicanery once and for all. Hopefully, she'll have enough hutzpah to survive being staked by Buffy the Vampire Slayer without exploding into chunks by the time the games are over.

Ready or Not 2: Here I Come hits theaters “soon,” which is apparently April 10, 2026.

Portugal and the United States men's soccer national teams will face off in a friendly in March at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta as a preparation for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The game will kick off at 7 p.m. and will be shown live on TNT, TruTV, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Portugal is currently ranked sixth in the FIFA Men's World Rankings, while the United States occupies the 14th position.

Portugal won the 2025 UEFA Nations League championship led by Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time leading scorer in men's international soccer history and a five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or.

The last time Portugal and the United States played against each other was on Nov. 14, 2017 in Leiria, Portugal, in a friendly match that ended in a 1-1 draw. 

Before then, the two teams had faced off on June 22, 2014 in a game of Group G of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final Tournament at the Arena da Amazônia in Manaus Brazil. That match also ended in a draw (2-2).

The U.S. squad will face two other world's top 10 teams in friendlies in order to sharpen its form ahead of the tournament on home soil.

On March 28, the USMNT will host the eighth-ranked Belgian side at Mercedes-Benz Stadium at 3:30 p.m.

State Sen. Michael Rodrigues is Portuguese group's Person of the Year

To close out its World Cup preparation schedule, the USMNT will take on four-time World Cup champion Germany in the Coca-Cola Send-Off Match on June 6 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The game against the ninth-ranked German team will kick off at the current home of the Chicago Fire at 2:30 p.m.

“For us, this is a massive opportunity to challenge ourselves against some of the top teams in the world. These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans,” said USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino in a prepared statement. “We are so happy to be playing in our new home of Atlanta, and of course to be competing in the great cities of Charlotte and Chicago ahead of the World Cup.”

Tickets for the matches against Portugal and Belgium go on sale to the public on Friday, Dec. 5 at 10 a.m. local venue time.

The presale for these matches began Wednesday, Dec. 3 at 10 a.m. local venue time and will run to Friday, Dec. 5 at 8 a.m. local venue time.

There will be plenty of glitz and glamor on Friday when the eyes of the soccer world turn to Washington, D.C., for the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw.

Supermodel and TV personality Heidi Klum and actor-comedian Kevin Hart will co-host the draw from the Kennedy Center, alongside actor-producer Danny Ramirez.

Among the musical performances will include Andrea Bocelli, the Village People and Robbie Williams, who will be joined by the award-winning Nicole Scherzinger.

""To be hosting the final draw again, after having been involved in this show 20 years ago in my home country, is truly extraordinary,"" said Klum, having previously taken part in the event ahead of the 2006 tournament in Germany. ""The World Cup brings the world together like nothing else, and being part of that magic again, on an even bigger stage involving three host countries and 48 teams, is an incredible honor.""

""As someone who grew up playing football, getting to co-host the draw and meet and speak with World Cup legends at such a high-profile event is a dream,"" said Ramirez. ""With this tournament coming to the United States, where I was born, and Mexico, where some of my roots lie, it is even more special – and I couldn't be more excited to be part of this show.""

The draw will take place from 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM ET and upon its conclusion, live coverage on FOX will continue until 3:00 PM ET providing instant analysis, reactions and interviews.

FOX Sports' veteran sportscasters Rob Stone and Jenny Taft will anchor the network's on-site broadcast alongside former U.S. men's team stars and acclaimed analysts Alexi Lalas and Stu Holden.
