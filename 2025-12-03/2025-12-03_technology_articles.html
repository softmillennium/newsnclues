                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Updated December 2, 2025: We've updated these deals to highlight ongoing discounts on the best earbuds for Android, some Bose headphones, a new deal on the best office chair we've tested, our favorite green powders, and more. Jump to section: Computers, Mobile Devices & Charging, TV & Audio, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel It was a high-end laptop being sold for downright budget-level prices. Usually, inexpensive Chromebooks have subpar displays and touchpads, but this Acer model's are just fine—at a killer price. Our favorite gaming laptop has a sleek, thin design and impressive graphics. Weighing only 2.16 pounds, it's one of the lightest laptops you can buy, without making any major sacrifices to achieve that weight. It's now down to $750, and when you compare this directly with the quality of similarly priced laptops, you'll see why it's still at the top of my list. If the rumors are true, we're still at least a few months out from the M5 MacBook Air, making this M4 still worthy of a purchase at this price. The new MacBook Pro is only a month old, and it's already on sale. The $200 range used to get you a crappy, 1080p monitor with terrible colors. Just be aware: it doesn't have built-in USB ports and the stand doesn't have enough height adjustment to be used as a vertical monitor. This display lives somewhere between OLED monitor and TV. This 27-inch OLED monitor strikes the perfect balance of sharpness (1440p) and speed (360-Hz), all packaged together in one of the most beautiful gaming displays you can buy. This is the Wi-Fi 7 router I recommend for most people in our best Wi-Fi routers guide because it's easy to set up and will cover homes and apartments up to around 2,000 square feet with fast, reliable connectivity. Support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh rounds out an excellent device. This Wi-Fi 6E mesh is ideal for smart homes, provides reliably speedy Wi-Fi, and is oh-so-easy to set up and use. This high-performing, tri-band, Wi-Fi 7 mesh is the runner-up in my best mesh guide, and it's a great value at this discounted price, which is $200 below standard. When it comes to your home office, there's still nothing like a solid pair of desk speakers to amplify your work-from-home setup. Music is where these speakers shine, even without a dedicated subwoofer.—Luke Larsen They aren't super groundbreaking, but the reliable Rival 3 Gen 2 comes in wired or wireless flavors. This portable hard drive is our pick for the best portable backup because it's small (less than an inch thick) but sturdy and balances respectable performance with convenience in the form of a regular USB-C connection. This is the device we'd want to run daily backups in a hotel room while on location shooting photos or video. This tablet functions as a second screen for everything from watching movies on a flight to checking the news in bed without your reading glasses. The last one I bought was promptly taken over by my daughter, who uses it to play Roblox. It's rare to find a phone at this price, especially on sale, with a triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom sensor so you won't have trouble capturing sharp photos of birds up in the tree, your kid earning their diploma, or your favorite artist onstage. Not to mention this is one of the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnets, meaning, similar to Apple's iPhones, you can magnetically attach the phone to wireless chargers and docks for speedy charging (and attach various fun magnetic accessories). Best of all is Google's smart software; Yes, there's a lot of generative AI creep that isn't super useful, but tools like Call Screen can filter out spam calls, and Now Playing automatically tells you what song is playing at the coffee shop without you having to lift a finger. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more details. The Razr Ultra comes in snazzy designs, has a strong camera, and a super-useful external display for when you don't want to open the whole thing up. This Moto G Stylus (make sure it's the 2025 model) is the best bang for your buck, with wireless charging, good performance, a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and, naturally, a built-in stylus. You can choose from a pad or a stand option; Both have rubbery grips on the bottom to prevent slips and slides, and they'll charge your phone reliably at 10, 7.5, or 5 watts depending on your device. Note that you need to bring your own wall charger! It works over 200 degrees of temp swing and has 240W charging. PopSockets are user-friendly, especially this MagSafe version which pops onto the back of your compatible device (or case). This clear case comes in several interesting designs that portray the internal components of a smartphone. It's my favorite cheap case for the iPhone 17 range, though it's available for devices dating back to the iPhone 14 Pro. Whatever you think of Meta's AI policies (they're garbage) the best smart glasses are the ones that you already want to wear. This excellent mobile gaming controller turns your phone into something that feels like a miniature console. This is our favorite full-grain leather case, with hides are sourced from Europe and the US. It looks gorgeous, smells lovely, features stainless steel buttons. The beefy brick is surprisingly heavy, and it has a 24,000-mAh capacity with 140-watt fast-charging. My favorite part is that the power bank itself recharges really quickly, in just about an hour. It also has a neat built-in display that offers helpful information like charging speeds and battery health. This hefty power bank is packing serious heat, with a smart and practical design, plenty of speedy charging ports, and a handy display. The best Qi2 power bank we've tested has never sold for less. A built-in retractable USB-C cable in a power bank is so handy, and it's one more thing you don't have to remember. The latest generation Kindle Paperwhite came out last fall, and it's got just about everything we want in an e-reader: an auto-adjusting warm light, a three-month battery life, snappy performance, integration with Overdrive so you can get your library books, and the ability to “speak” several languages. The Kindle Scribe is a great combo e-reader and digital notebook. There are a few new models coming soon, but we still think this one is worth buying, especially since it's on sale for $120 off. Amazon's cheapest Kindle is still a powerful, snappy device, and comes in fun colors like matcha green. It's a great gift for bookworks and kids you want to become bookworms. The digital notebooks from reMarkable are rarely on sale, so don't miss this one. The Kindle Scribe is a great combo e-reader and digital notebook. There are a few new models coming this winter, but we still think this one is worth buying, especially since it's on sale. This is our favorite digital notebook for readers, and it's a great affordable color option. It's only $30 off the typical price, but that's still some savings on our favorite e-reader. Jump to section: Computers, Mobile Devices & Charging, TV & Audio, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel This is our favorite TV for most people, because it offers excellent color and great processing, and contains virtually every app you could want. Mini LED backlighting means that you'll have excellent contrast and plenty of performance in bright rooms, and TCL's anti-glare technology makes it nice even when sunlight hits it. Its price is the main appeal; you'll pay hundreds of dollars more for a TV that looks any better. With the price dropping below $2,000, it's a no-brainer for your home theater update. Sony TVs are high-priced for a reason: They have the best processing in the game, and they tend to look just a bit sharper than their competitors. We've yet to get this specific model in for testing, but the C series models we have tested in the past offer a great mix of brightness and color, and good performance for gaming and sports. Reviewer Chris Haslam lavished praise on this Anker projector, which claims to be the world's first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system. It will also work with microphones for karaoke or business presentations. The list price is very steep for a portable projector, but this Cyber Monday sale drops $800 off. This streaming stick is what I'd recommend for anyone who just wants to enable an older TV to stream modern apps. That said, you really cannot beat this $20 price. This is a gadget that can breathe new life into an older screen in your basement or garage, or which you can use to stream your shows in a hotel room without being too annoyed if you someday leave it behind. Note: There are lots of great streaming service deals right now too, such as HBO Max's $3 per month offer, which locks you in for a whole year at that price. If you like casting to your TV from your phone, the Google TV streaming is a favorite for Android users, thanks to tight Google integration. This is our favorite soundbar system for most people, thanks to its great wireless subwoofer, solid audio processing, and compact footprint below most screens. If you've been struggling to hear the voices on screen, or you just want for a more cinematic experience, I recommend the SR-C30A. If you don't want to see speakers all around your room, the System 6 is a classy and good-looking wireless system from Sony that will fill your room with sound without physically standing out. This is essentially Yamaha's Dolby Atmos-enabled version of the SR-C30A above, and it is worth the upgrade if you're looking for even more immersion. JBL's Bluetooth speakers are some of our favorites that money can buy, and the Flip 7 is no exception. We like how durable it is, as well as how loud the tube-shaped speaker can get when placed on a table or in a corner. Sonos has fallen from grace in the past two years, thanks to a wonky app that still seems to have issues, but the Era 100 remains a great wireless speaker with solid sound. This boombox-style speaker will bring the party anywhere, complete with built-in lights. They have insane processing power that can easily silence even the loudest sounds around you, and the included microphones are also awesome for Zoom calls. These are our favorite wireless earbuds for most people. I actually just bought a pair last week after confirming with resident audiophile Parker Hall that I'd like them more than my stinky, annoying, horrible-touch-controls AirPods Gen 2. Tack on the 5-hour battery life and excellent touch controls, and I don't know why I ever waited so long to get a pair for myself. AirPods Pro—even last-gen models like these—are absolutely still worth buying for iPhone owners. These are some of our favorite workout headphones, thanks to their clip-based design and good integration with iOS, thanks to Apple's Beats ownership. These tiny, comfy earbuds are our favorite for Android phone owners. I like these see-through over-ears, which have one of the best volume knobs I have used on a pair of headphones, and which feature audio designed by acclaimed hi-fi brand KEF. Jump to section: Computers, Mobile Devices & Charging, TV & Audio, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel TP-Link's Kasa line of mini smart plugs performs as well as larger plugs but in a smaller size that won't obstruct a second outlet. Smart plug sales are in short supply this Cyber Monday, but this is a few bucks cheaper than it was in recent weeks. This is our top office chair recommendation for most people. Branch's Ergonomic Chair Pro offers oodles of adjustments, from seat pan to lumbar support, all while looking nice in your office. It's hard to find affordable, good office chairs, especially under $500, but Branch is one of the few companies delivering in this price bracket. We've rounded up more deals on Branch products here. Secretlab might be a gamer-focused brand, but anyone can appreciate its metal, magnetic Magnus Pro standing desk. It's supportive, can be tailored to your body size, and has an excellent 12-year warranty. Constructed from anodized aluminum with a medium-density fiberboard surface, this adjustable stand is an affordable option compared to other premium wooden models. Plus, the added $10 price drop makes it even sweeter. Normally, I would expect to spend around $1000 for a new, well-functioning, dual-function vacuum-mop robot vacuum. You won't have to switch them out too often. This model also has an extendable arm for cleaning hard-to-reach places and a decent 11,000 Pa of suction.—Adrienne So It's our favorite vacuum cleaner for both wet and dry cleaning, since it takes the technology we love from the V15 and adds a wet mop head attachment. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So says this vacuum is one of the best things that has ever happened to her. Save $300 on Dyson's most powerful vacuum, our favorite for vacuuming up pet hair. This $20 discount is one we often see for sale events on this adorable Worx vacuum, but it's still a great for our favorite car vacuum. Our favorite stick vacuum comes with a great range of attachments, an affordable price point, and can stand up on its own. This vacuum is excellent for small spaces like a studio or one-bedroom apartment since it's so compact and lightweight. The Walmart price is a hige savings this Cyber Monday. It makes for a fun party trick at the very least. This basic little robot vacuum has an enormous 1-liter dustbin and AI-enabled navigation smarts for not that much money! Its claim to fame is that it uses electrostatic filtration, which incorporates electrically charged plates to attract dust, pollen, dander, and other allergens. She found it to be a little loud, measuring twice the advertised decibels on its highest setting, but it's otherwise a great option for smaller areas like bedrooms. Reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro considers this Coway to be the best bang for your buck when it comes to air purifiers. That bang is even better at almost 40 percent off the normal price of $230. This combination fan, purifier, and heater has an easy-to-use app. The Arlo Pro 5S tops our best outdoor security cameras guide by offering crisp 2K video, color night vision, a wide 160-degree field of view, and clear two-way audio. It also boasts reliable AI recognition for people and pets, a direct Wi-Fi connection, and a siren to scare intruders away. Our favorite floodlight security camera boasts a 3K wide-angle lens, a 2K telephoto lens that can pan 360 degrees and tilt 120 degrees to track subjects, and two adjustable light panels that will blast out 2,000 lumens. With 2K video, local microSD card recording, and a 150-degree field of view this security camera has the right features and its Tapo app can detect motion (person, pet, vehicle), while also allowing you to set up activity zones and privacy zones. Canopy is the best filtered shower wand I've tested, a tri-layer filter my tests showed to reduce the total chlorine levels in my water to undetectable levels out of the box, and maintain most of this effectiveness for a couple months before a refill. Filter replacement is easy, meaning you're likely to actually do it, and Canopy's filter replacements don't cost as much as some competitors. This is the best price you'll get all year for our all-around favorite smart bird feeder. You can enjoy it without a subscription (though for the AI identification and image/video storage, you'll want to spring for the extra $5 a month), and the app makes it easy to save and share great captures of birds. Note that Birdfy only works with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the base model comes without a solar panel. I don't mind this, as Birdfy's panel has to be mounted separately, and it's hard to do this when the feeder is installed on a pole, which is what I recommend. Our favorite smart hummingbird feeder is easy to clean and has a fun app. It also has auto-bagging and -sealing features, so you never have to deal with the stool. At $300 off, this is the best price we've tracked. Watch and feed your pet while away with this fancy automatic feeder. This automatic feeder is basically an automated mini-fridge for wet cat food, and you can schedule feedings while away. I test indoor hydroponic garden systems all year round, and Gardyn has been my consistent favorite. I have two of them—the Home 4, with 30 plants, and the brand-new Studio 2, with 16 plants—and they both look like living works of art, overflowing with everything from peas and peppers to nasturtiums and even canna lilies. The systems do take a fair amount of maintenance, but as a busy, full-time working parent, it's nothing I haven't been able to handle. If you don't mind the older, original studio, that's on an even deeper discount for just $337. They also come with a free 30-day trial of Kelby, the AI growing assistant that plans your watering and maintenance schedules for you. A Scandinavian garden we love, which is simple to maintain and lets you plant your own seeds. Grow any mushrooms you want from scratch with this DIY system. The Baratza Encore ESP is the coffee grinder I recommend to anyone who asks: It's dead simple, lasts an eon, grinds finely and precisely enough for espresso but coarse enough for cold brew, and doesn't cost a mint. Drip coffee makers from Portland's Ratio offer the fullest-flavored cups I know—the roundest extraction. This Six Series 2 is the best thermal-cup coffee maker I know. This is the lowest price I've seen it, and while supplies last you can also get a free travel mug, knock box, or pitcher. It's especially great for lovers of medium or dark roast beans. We've seen this price before, but Breville's most popular semiautomatic espresso machine, the Barista Express, is $250 cheaper right now. This is Breville's top-line piece of kitchen hardware, an air fryer and oven that has better precision than any other oven I've tested. It toasts evenly across the oven and can air fry chicken wings to admirable crispness, dehydrate fruit, and also roast a 14-pound turkey. Jump to section: Computers, Mobile Devices & Charging, TV & Audio, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel This LEGO set allows you to build a miniature 80s-style cabinet for what's arguably the most iconic arcade game of all time, released 45 years ago this year. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Formerly known as Settlers of Catan, this strategy game is played by trading resources to build and settle a randomly generated board of hexagonal tiles. If you already own an Apple Watch, I generally do not advocate upgrading to the latest model, given they're all pretty iterative. I do think that this year's Series 11 is worth getting because, for the first time ever, it really does have a full 24 hours of battery life. It also has the same slim case, large screen, and is compatible with watchOS 26 (with an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone), so you can still enjoy the Liquid Glass design, Workout Buddy, and flick away Smart Stack with your wrist. You really can't get a better watch for under $100. There's no fitness tracker that truly competes with the Fitbit Charge 6. Despite being two years old, the Fitness Charge 6 remains the de facto option, with long battery life and a full suite of health metrics to obsess over, including really accurate heart rate tracking. The Hypervolt 2 is our top choice for a percussive massage gun. While the Theragun Pro Plus is a top-tier option for serious athletes—and on sale for $550 (originally $650)—the Hypervolt 2 offers a more affordable alternative. At just 1.8 pounds, it packs a powerful brushless 60-watt motor, three speed settings, and five different massage heads designed for most muscle groups. It can connect to the Hyperice app via Bluetooth for guided routines, provides up to three hours of battery life, and is TSA-approved for carry-on travel. The portable version of Hyperice's air compression system is ideal for frequent travelers, athletes, and individuals with poor circulation. I would pay full price for these calf sleeves, so this 20 percent discount is a bonus. We just completed testing this eye mask, complete with heat, compression, and music. The most affordable Theragun is now even more budget-friendly with this discount. They're still pricey, but if you're considering, now is the perfect time For the first time, these recovery shoes are on sale through December 1. I'd normally point you toward the Normatec 3 Legs (also on sale), but at this discounted price, the Hyperboot's wearable design is hard to resist. Even on a bad day, this is the absolute best beard trimmer set you can get for south of $100—quiet, reliable, not subject to nicks or pulls. It's a contender for my favorite grooming set overall in part because of the ridiculously good performance on the foil shaver attachment (Philips kills it on foil shavers in general). The metal body offers admirable heft and durability, and the battery will run a ridiculous five hours without needing a charge—months' worth of shaves. I had heard that it wasn't a one-stop shop for 3a curly hair and above, and as you can see from my picture above, it's not. I still needed to use a traditional flat iron afterward, especially on the top of my head. I can see how it would be life-changing for those with wavy or just generally easier-to-straighten hair. The Airstrait doesn't go on sale all that often, so if it was on your Christmas shopping list, now is the time. One of our favorite curling irons because it heats up fast—in just 25 seconds—and features an ergonomic design that's intuitive for beginners.It's 30 percent off, priced at $167, which could cover the cost of one to three salon visits. This rare deal on the best LED face masks we've tested. The Series 2 is made of medical-grade silicone and packs 236 bulbs, so it contours to your face for close, even coverage. An update to the beloved original Chi iron, with a digital display and titanium-infused plates. Our favorite oscillating toothbrush because of its powerful motor, round brush head that effectively reaches molars, and built-in timer. I've tried dozens of different greens powders, and Bloom remains my favorite. There are 10 flavors to choose from, and all of them are pleasant—and disguise the fact that you're drinking a blend of fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients. If you've been looking for greens to help supplement a balanced diet, this brand is the one I'd recommend trying first. Be most cozily dressed (pajamas-wise) person opening presents under the Christmas tree with this pajama set. Think of Japanese joinery bed frames like Lincoln Logs—you click the wood together rather than bolt it. This one isn't just sturdy, it's got a stunning wood stain. Our very favorite down comforter offers luxurious, classic, cozy warmth in a crinkly and slightly starchy outer shell. It's fluffy and lofty, but doesn't feel too lightweight, and it keeps me toasty even on the coldest winter nights in northern Illinois. Jump to section: Computers, Mobile Devices & Charging, TV & Audio, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel She says the rain-resistant materials held up just fine on particularly rainy day in the Philippines while waiting for a ferry. There's no luggage brand with more legacy than Travelpro, but this model is a lighter and more modern take on the carry-on bag. Unlike other carry-on bags, this tiny roller bag is meant to slide underneath the airplane seat for short trips. The Prvke is now in its fourth generation, and Wandrd keeps perfecting it. I love the roll-top that offers up dramatically more space when you need it. There's a side-access pocket to grab your camera without taking the backpack completely off, and the main rear compartment is where you grab all of your gear. It's stylish, exceptionally built, and has plenty of room (there are several sizes to choose from). Moment's Everything Sling 4L looks nice, and the 4-liter size is deceptive—it sounds small, but it can fit quite a bit. This is my favorite sling, another hit from Wandrd. The 9L version is roomy enough to fit my Nikon Z6 III, a spare lens, and a Godox speedlight, but make sure you buy the Laptop Case to stow your laptop vertically in the back pocket. As mentioned in our guide to the Best Packing Cubes, these are the best I've tested at this price point on Amazon. In addition to 20+ color and pattern options, they hit all the high points of what you want in a good set: decent compression, a convenient handle, mesh panels for ventilation, and a label window for keeping organized. In the six-piece set, you'll receive five rectangular-shaped cubes and a handy shoe bag. I wouldn't subject these basic polyester cubes to ballistics testing or throw them off a mountaintop, but for most travelers, they'll do perfectly fine in either a carry-on or checked suitcase. The best hoodie you can buy on Amazon gets a steep price cut for Cyber Monday. Champion's iconic reverse-weave hoodie was the first hooded sweatshirt, and still holds its own in a world where every brand makes them. The fabric is sturdy but stretchy and ages gracefully over many wash cycles. Jump to section: Computers, TV & Audio, Mobile Devices & Charging, Home & Kitchen, Beauty & Wellness, Travel This is a good time to save on the brand's own hardware, like Kindles and Blink security cameras, some of which are 50% off. Walmart: The Arkansas-based big box store has lots of tech deals like the gray colorway of Beats Solo4 for $79 ($50 off) plus the home and garden deals you'd expect like a Blackstone griddle for $157 ($67 off). REI's cyber week sale starts November 29, with rotating deals on a myriad of WIRED-tested products, though you will find their deals live now, notably not called “Cyber Monday.” Everything is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday, so now's a great time to upgrade. Helix: We love Helix mattresses—if you're going to be spending a third of your life on something, it better be good. In addition to regular Cyber Monday sales, Target has price match guarantee and doorbuster clearance items. Best Buy: In addition to major discounts for Cyber Monday and Cyber Monday, Best Buy rolls out new doorbusters every Friday, slashing prices on everything from refrigerators to MacBooks. We've rounded up the best Best Buy deals we've seen so far, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro (M5) for $1,349 ($250 off) and Google Pixel 10 for $599 ($200 off). Dyson: Making everything from blow dryers to vacuums to air purifiers, we at WIRED are generally huge fans of this well-made, long-lasting (but often pricey) tech, made a lot more affordable with Cyber Monday sales. Lowe's: In addition to Cyber Monday sales, Lowe's has rotating daily deals on home improvement essentials, upgraded appliances, and outdoor tools like grills and lawnmowers. Atlas: At WIRED, we love caffeine, and subscription services. So we go bonkers for this coffee club subscription, and now you can get a free bag of beans for Cyber Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Now is rolling out to eligible neighborhoods in Seattle and Philadelphia. Customers using the Amazon app or website can browse a curated selection of fresh produce, meat and seafood, pantry staples, frozen foods, beverages, household supplies and more. Prime members pay discounted delivery fees starting at $3.99 per order, compared with $13.99 for non-Prime customers, with a $1.99 “small basket” fee on orders under $15. GeekWire reported last week that Amazon was building out a new rapid-delivery hub at a former Amazon Fresh Pickup site in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood. (That site did not fulfill the order I placed on Tuesday.) Permit filings detail how employees pick and bag items in a back-of-house stockroom, stage completed orders on front-of-house shelves, and hand them off to Amazon Flex drivers, who are expected to arrive, scan, confirm, and leave with a package within roughly two minutes. My wife prefers to do all the shopping for our household and she does so at several different stores including Trader Joe's, Fred Meyer, Town & Country, and Costco. Our neighborhood, Ballard, isn't exactly a food desert, and prior to conducting my Amazon Now test, I passed a Safeway en route to stops at Walgreens and Metropolitan Market within a few blocks of my house. But for the sake of speed and convenience and this test, I browsed the Amazon Now selection looking for a few items we could use. There's either a reason why my wife does all the shopping or groceries really are very expensive these days, because $30 feels like a lot for six items. A status bar in the app showed where my items would be in the chain of events: ordered, packed, out for delivery, and delivered. Within just a few minutes the status changed from ordered to out for delivery, and I watched as a small Amazon vehicle icon made its way west across Seattle toward my house. But my neighbor was getting a bunch of stuff delivered from IKEA — no one shops in stores anymore, I guess. For what it's worth, transportation software company INRIX released its annual Global Traffic Scorecard this week, with details on how much time people lose sitting in traffic. INRIX says Seattle congestion is climbing again, especially in last-mile corridors that delivery fleets rely on. “The [Amazon Now service] may end up distributing demand more evenly across the transportation network, rather than concentrating congestion via larger hubs,” Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX, told GeekWire. Wearing his blue Amazon vest, the driver placed a brown paper Amazon Now bag in my hand for what amounted to a 23-minute process from start to finish. The driver said he made his pickup from an Amazon Now-specific facility that is located near a Whole Foods location at Roosevelt Way NE and NE 64th Street — roughly 3.5 miles or 15 minutes from my house. The six items I ordered were packed as neatly as you'd expect, even if the loaf of bread did get a little smooshed. The blackberries looked like any random, small pack of blackberries I might find in the fridge and finish off in one sitting. Maybe four batteries is all anyone needs from their fast-delivery convenience store. I like seeing people, browsing aisles, and talking to the cashier (if they haven't all been replaced by self-checkout). But if I was sick on my couch and wanted soup, Saltines and a ginger ale in 30 minutes or less, and didn't want to move to go get it, I might use the service again. Or if I'd already been to the store that day and forgot some items that were needed for dinner, I could see biting the bullet. “Don't worry, I've got it!” said the human employee monitoring self-checkers.

They are just genuinely doing so much for the community.

I hope Gabe has setup Valve in such a way that they can pass on his mentality as a whole inside the business practices themselves. I think, after all these years, he must have surely thought about what leaving would look like for Valve. Considering this is a guy who seemingly thinks in decades, I feel maybe even optimistically calm about it. Usermode anti-cheat does sometimes work verbatim in Wine, and some anti-cheat software has Proton support, though not all developers elect to enable it. You can be clever and build a random memory allocator. You can get clever and watch for frozen struct members after a known set operation, what you can't do is prevent all cheating. There's device layer, driver layer, MITM, emulation, and even now AI mouse control.The only thing you can do is watch for it and send the ban hammer. Valve has a wonderful write up about client-side prediction recording so as to verify killcam shots were indeed, kill shots, and not aim bots (but this method is great for seeing those in action as well!) Valve has a wonderful write up about client-side prediction recording so as to verify killcam shots were indeed, kill shots, and not aim bots (but this method is great for seeing those in action as well!) Sure, but you still have to make a serious attempt or the experience will be terrible for any non-cheaters. Or you just make your game bad enough that no one cares. If you don't need real-time packets and can deal with the old school architecture of pulses, there's things you can do on the network to ensure security.You do this too on real-time UDP it's just a bit trickier.

It can't really do a ton to ensure the integrity of Wine directly, but usermode anti-cheat running on Windows can't do much to ensure the integrity of Windows directly either, without going the route of requiring attestation. )The limitation is obviously that inside Wine you can't see most Linux resources directly using the same APIs, so you can't go and try to find cheat software directly. But let's be honest, that approach isn't really terribly relevant anymore since it is a horribly fragile and limited way to detect cheats.For more invasive anti-cheat software, well. If that really was a significant barrier, Secure Boot and TPM-based attestation wouldn't be on the radar for anti-cheat vendors. Valve however doesn't seem keen to support this approach at all on its hardware, and if that forces anti-cheat vendors to go another way it is probably all the better. I think the secure boot approach has a limited shelf life anyways.

For some reason the prospect using Wine, Rosetta 2, and DXVK with MoltenVK on top just to run some games doesn't inspire a lot of confidence that this whole thing will be performant and/or stable. I previously played through Returns, Dragonfall, and part of Hong Kong on Mac before the 32bit-apocalypse. Running x86 games or compatibility layers even with great emulation will make that $3000 Mac look half decent at best, against a $1500 gaming laptop.

Valve is using ARM to run Windows games on "ultra portable" devices, starting with the Steam Frame. At least right now, there isn't a competitive x86 chip that fits this use case. It also feels like more of an experiment, as Valve themselves are setting the expectation that this is a "streaming first" headset for running games on your desktop, and they've even said not to expect a great experience playing Half-Life: Alyx locally (a nearly 7 year old title).It will be interesting to see if Intel/AMD catch up to ARM on efficiency in time to keep handhelds like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally from jumping ship. Right now it seems Valve is hedging their bets. Right now it seems Valve is hedging their bets. Well, compiling ARM game binaries is actually super duper easy and just totally fine. There's a lot of work and experience built up for ARM through Proton and other tech (that can be reverse engineered to see how it works) like Rosetta. A lot of that would have to be redone for RISCV. Seems like a lot of risk in the short term for what's not an obvious product benefit.I would expect the high-end RISCV market to mature before a company like Valve dives in. I would expect the high-end RISCV market to mature before a company like Valve dives in. But ARM doesn't seem to be a typical greedy incumbent that everyone hates. RISC-V is severely lacking in high-performance implementations for the time being. There is essentially a tiny handful of Arm systems with good GPU support.

The ARM vs RISC battle will happen, but we're not there yet. Imo this is a really strange characterization of RISC. China has an increasingly large upper hand in the RISC-V ecosystem and can use that to remove Western surveillance and replace it with their own.https://itif.org/publications/2024/07/19/the-us-china-tech-c...https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2023/regarding-proposed-u... If it continues, the long-term impact will be highly detrimental for everyone involved, including stakeholders in Western countries. For example, current versions of XiangShan are targeting ~20 SPECint 2006/GHz (early where at ~9). Stuff tends to stay open until a new leader emerges. That's why this is geopolitical.The DoD and Five Eyes prefer ARM, where the US maintains a strong lead. They may provide an option for developers to distribute a native ARM build (which some are already building for Quest titles that can be brought over to Steam Frame) but one of Steam's main advantages is their massive x86 games catalog so they certainly don't want to require that Plus, it looks like upstream FEX doesn't play very nice with Apple Silicon in the first place. I don't need Android apps that often, but it would be neat for the options here to expand and improve. I want to say much as Proton has accelerated things, but man, I am pretty lost now tracking which projects Proton encompasses and the history of where Valve backed/helped these efforts.I still really want to believe it's collaborative. I saw the mention of Fex then too, but absolutely nowhere, before now have I seen any information that they'd been working on this for the best part of a decade. If developers don't think it's worth it to make their game compatible with Steam Deck, can't they just avoid doing that? the only platforms I've ever heard of this for were Windows Phone and the Epic Storeboth of which were runaway commercial successes These days the only context I hear "Playstation exclusive" in comes from people trying to analyze how much money Sony lost developing Concord.</p>

The MSI X870E Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ is an excellent mid-range choice for a back-connect PC build. Three type-C ports on rear IO Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. MSI's PZ line relocates most connectors to the back of the board for cleaner cable management and a more aesthetically pleasing front view of the PC. Along with MSI PZ chassis (required, in four options) and PZ video cards, they offer a unified design that aims to minimize the unsightly cables in non-back-connect PCs. In addition to its back-mount features, you get ample storage options, fast networking, 40 Gbps USB 4, robust power delivery, EZ DIY functionality, and the new(ish) Click BIOS X. As far as looks go, the PZ/back connect element really cleans up the appearance and does a great job of hiding a vast majority of wires, especially when using PZ graphics cards. For under $320, MSI's board comes with four M.2 sockets (two PCIe 5.0), 5 GbE and Wi-Fi 7 networking, plenty of USB ports (including two 40 Gbps USB4 ports) on the rear IO, and three full-length PCIe slots for a graphics card and expansion. MSI's EZ DIY features, such as the M.2 Shield Frozr II and EZ M.2 Clip II, make installing your M.2 drive effortless, eliminating the need for fiddling with tiny screws. It also includes the EZ PCIE Release, a simple physical button release mechanism that helps remove any PCIe card with a single tap. Performance on this board was average, with some instances being faster and others slower. As we usually see, the results aren't significantly different in most tests, so if something is slower or faster than average, chances are you won't be able to notice unless you're actually looking at benchmarking results. Whether you're gaming or working, this board won't hold you back.Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our Best Motherboards list. 17 Phase (14x 80A SPS MOSFETs for Vcore)w Over the past couple of years, we've seen this idea of rear-connecting ecosystems gain momentum, and MSI wasn't going to miss that boat. So far, the company has released several PZ motherboards for both AMD (4x) and Intel-based (3x) systems, as well as what appears to be five PZ chassis of varying sizes to accommodate rear-facing connectivity. Price points, at least for the motherboards, can be slightly higher than comparable non-PZ offerings, but if you want to hide all your wires, the meager difference is worth it. We reviewed the wrap-around case earlier this year and found it spacious, with ample room for expansion, and it exhibited excellent thermal performance with the included RGB fans. When your dream build doesn't include white, you can also find this case in black for the same price. This black-and-silver GPU appears identical to its non-PZ counterpart, except it features a more back-connect-friendly location for the 12VHPWR connector. It's notably more PZ-friendly and looks way better than the top or rear locations we're more familiar with, back-connect or not. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Inside the box are a few accessories to help you get started. The only thing that stands out is that you get a USB drive for drivers, which is something you don't typically see in mid-range class boards. Below is a list of everything that's included. The X870E Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ sits on a silver-and-white 8-layer server-grade PCB, with large aluminum heatsinks covering the VRM and plate-style heatsinks cooling the M.2 sockets and chipset. AMD's sweetspot is still somewhere in the DDR5-6000 to 6400 MT/s range, and this, like every board, covers it easily. Just below that is the 2-character Debug LED, which gives more detailed insight into POST issues (and displays CPU temperatures by default when in Windows). Each header supports PWM and DC-controlled devices. If you want RGB lighting through the motherboard, you'll have to buy and attach your own. Next is a system fan header, the 24-pin ATX power for the board, the EZ Conn header (connects ARGB strips, fans, USB 2.0 devices, and even the company's MPG EZ120 ARGB fans on a single cable), and two SATA ports. Power delivery on the Tomahawk MAX Wifi PZ is the same as that of the front-facing Tomahawk Wifi, consisting of 17 phases, 14 of which are dedicated to Vcore. Power is supplied by the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to a Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MPS2412 controller. From there, it moves to the 80A MPS MPS2433 SPS MOSFETs. While the specs here aren't the most robust we've seen, they do not hold you back, even if you decide to overclock. Starting with PCIe, the top slot (PCI_E1) connects directly to the CPU, runs at up to PCIe 5.0 x16, and serves as your primary graphics slot. It's also reinforced and uses MSI's EZ PCIE Release, an easy-to-access button that locks and unlocks the PCIe card with a single tap. The other full-length slots connect through the chipset, running at PCIe 3.0 x1 (PCI_E2) and PCIe 4.0 x4 (PCI_E3), which should provide sufficient bandwidth for most expansion cards. Mixed in among the PCIe slots are four M.2 sockets. The Tomahawk MAX PZ offers two PCIe 5.0 (128 Gbps) sockets (M.2_1/2), and the bottom two (M.2_3/4) connect through the chipset and run up to PCie 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps). The board supports RAID 0/1/5/10 modes if you need extra speed or redundancy. Do note the second PCIe 5.0 M.2 socket (M2_2) shares bandwidth with USB 4. By default, when M2_2 is in use, it runs at PCIe 5.0 x2 (64 Gbps). Finally, below that is the 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header. ), there is a slew of headers and connectors. From left to right, you have the following: There are three USB Type-C ports, two of which support 40 Gbps (the third is 10 Gbps). You also get two 10 Gbps (red), four 5 Gbps (blue), and four USB 2.0 (black) Type-A ports, for a total of nine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Snorkelers in Nova Scotia, Canada, have found a number of Elysia chlorotica, commonly known as eastern emerald elysia—elusive slugs that steal the photosynthetic abilities of their food. Studying these creatures could carry implications for various human industries, but they've been difficult to study both in the wild and in the lab. When snorkeler Elli Ofthenorth, admin of the Facebook group Snorkel 💙 Nova Scotia, first spotted the slug, she “just thought, oh, that's a rotten leaf, keep going,” she told CBC. “I just started yelling, there's a sea slug here!” “It's like if I ate a whole bunch of spinach and then I just woke up this morning and I just sunbathed for an hour and then I wouldn't need to eat for the rest of the week,” Hunter Stevens, a biologist with the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society's Nova Scotia chapter and a member of Ofthenorth's Facebook group, told CBC. “These slugs are essentially doing the same thing.” But since E. chlorotica can live for long periods of time without sunlight, researchers aren't sure of the extent to which the slugs rely on the organelle's photosynthesis. After Ofthenorth's discovery near Halifax, Stevens also went in search of E. chlorotica and was greatly rewarded—he found hundreds of individuals, according to his social media post. Understanding how E. chlorotica can go without eating, living only on sunlight, for seemingly immeasurable amounts of time could have practical applications for areas such as clean energy technology, drug treatments, wound repair, and more, according to the CBC. But while the slugs live along North America's east coast, from Nova Scotia all the way down to southern Florida, researchers have had a hard time getting their hands on them. The slug's populations are “ephemeral,” Patrick Krug, a researcher at the College of Natural & Social Sciences at California State University, Los Angeles, told the Canadian broadcaster. They seem to cycle through periods of abundance and sudden disappearance. Plus, they're divas—they live in particular habitats and have particular eating habits, which could contribute to the difficulty of spotting them in the wild and sustaining populations of multiple generations in labs, the CBC said. It remains to be seen whether “these beautiful emerald angels,” as Stevens described them in his post, will yield any of their enduring secrets any time soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right on the heels of announcing Nova Forge, a service to train custom Nova AI models, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own frontier models. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers. The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch. To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. This capability is available for customizing Amazon's own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta's Llama. Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year's conference. “A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself? AWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle startup Gradial raised a $35 million Series B round to expand its AI platform that automates the behind-the-scenes work of enterprise marketing. VMG Partners led the round, with participation from existing backers Madrona and Pruven Capital. It's the second round of funding this year for Gradial, which raised $13 million in May. Its AI “agents” plug into existing systems to handle tasks such as CMS authoring, brand redesigns, QA, and large-scale campaign operations. “Every enterprise marketing team faces the same challenge. Their current tools and processes are too fragmented for them to move at the speed they need,” co-founder and CEO Doug Tallmadge said in a statement. Gradial sits in a fast-growing category of “agentic” AI tools that go beyond content generation to orchestrate complex workflows in real time. “Gradial's agents don't just assist; they perceive, decide, and coordinate in the flow of real work,” Madrona wrote in a blog post. “They represent a new class of reasoning machines that work alongside humans to manage complexity, turn feedback into foresight, and compound improvement over time.” Tallmadge previously worked at SpaceX as a software engineering manager.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first is a souped-up version of its existing RFdiffusion2 tool that can now design enzymes with performance nearly on par with those found in nature. Last year, Baker received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in protein science, which includes a deep-learning model called RFdiffusion. The tool allows scientists to design novel proteins that have never existed. These machine-made proteins hold immense promise, from developing medicines for previously untreatable diseases to solving knotty environmental challenges. The latest accomplishments are being shared today in publications in the leading scientific journals Nature and Nature Methods, as well as a preprint last month on bioRxiv. “You basically let the model have all this space to explore and … you really allow it to search a really wide space and come up with great, great solutions,” said Seth Woodbury, a graduate student in Baker's lab and author on both papers publishing today. The new approach is remarkable for quickly generating higher-performing enzymes. In a test of the tool, it was able to solve 41 out of 41 difficult enzyme design challenges, compared to only 16 for the previous version. The researchers successfully used the model to create proteins calls metallohydrolases, which accelerate difficult reactions using a precisely positioned metal ion and an activated water molecule. The promise of rapidly designed catalytic enzymes could unleash wide-ranging applications, Baker said. “The first problem we really tackled with AI, it was largely therapeutics, making binders to drug targets,” he said. The researchers are also working with the Gates Foundation to figure out lower-cost ways to build what are known as small molecule drugs, which interact with proteins and enzymes inside cells, often by blocking or enhancing their function to effect biological processes. It can create proteins that interact with virtually every type of molecule found in cells, including the ability to bind DNA, other proteins and small molecules, in addition to enzyme-related functions. “We really are excited about building more and more complex systems, so we didn't want to have bespoke models for each application. “We're really excited to see what everyone else builds on it,” Krishna said. And while the steady stream of model upgrades, breakthroughs and publications in top-notch journals seems to continue unabated from the Institute for Protein Design, there are plenty of behind-the-scenes stumbles, Baker said. And the institute continues minting new graduates and further training postdocs who go on to launch companies or establish their own academic labs. The Nature paper, titled “Computational design of metallohydrolases,” was authored by Donghyo Kim, Seth Woodbury, Woody Ahern, Doug Tischer, Alex Kang, Emily Joyce, Asim Bera, Nikita Hanikel, Saman Salike, Rohith Krishna, Jason Yim, Samuel Pellock, Anna Lauko, Indrek Kalvet, Donald Hilvert and David Baker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that's supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. Ramos' client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. This isn't what's supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home, which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out. It also offers help booking tickets for those needing assistance, the waiving of fines, “cost-free travel,” and a $1,000 bonus. Those who use the app aren't supposed to have criminal histories and are also meant to be “temporarily deprioritized” for detention and deportation. Initially, CBP Home was advertised as an all-in-one app that would help with everything from travel documents to financial assistance. “It's proven very difficult to get clear information from the government,” says Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Council. Ramos says she attempted to contact the local Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to help her client from Venezuela self-deport, but couldn't get through. “They no longer have a way to reach them,” she says. “It all goes to a customer service hotline of sorts.” “I literally walked her into the [local] ERO's office and said, ‘She's ready to go home. She has provisions for a couple of days now. '” Ramos claims that the staff at the ERO office told her, “‘We're not a travel agency, she just needs to go home on her own. When Ramos pointed out that the agency advertises help for people who want to leave, she says they said that was a national office initiative. She says her client has still been unable to leave the US. “For those who come here illegally and lack travel documents, DHS is actively working with the State Department to acquire travel documents,” claims DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “Additionally, if an illegal alien designates a third country and has the required travel documents, DHS will assist with their travel … DHS offers full-service assistance and contacts eligible participants during the process via phone or email. This is to expedite the vetting or arrange travel.” Others who attempt to sign up for self-deportation through CBP Home have faced the opposite problem: being detained despite trying to leave voluntarily. “When the CBP Home app was introduced, we asked our members to let us know about their experiences using it,” says Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a nonprofit organization for immigration lawyers. “We've heard of a couple cases of people using the app to try to facilitate their return to their home country, but they still end up getting detained, either while they're waiting for their flight out of the country or while they are physically trying to leave the country.” For those who do manage to successfully self-deport using the CBP Home app, the Trump administration says it will offer a financial reward of $1,000. But few of the attorneys and experts who spoke to WIRED knew of cases where people had received that money once they left. In May, a group of voluntary deportees to Honduras and Colombia received Visa debit cards loaded with the promised $1000. While she says that the National Immigration Law Council has heard of at least some self-deportees receiving the $1,000, it's unclear exactly how many people have gotten paid. “To say that illegal aliens have not ‘received' their stipend is grossly misleading and factually incorrect,” claims McLaughlin. “This streamlined self-deportation process does involve vetting to make sure there is no fraud and that those deemed ineligible, like criminal aliens, cannot abuse this program. Everyone who is eligible and qualifies to receive a stipend to date has been issued a stipend.” DHS did not respond when WIRED asked how many immigrants have received the stipend. When reached for comment, the White House referred WIRED to DHS. Receiving the stipend, should it happen, can bring its own complications. On October 3, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the government's programs of unaccompanied minors, confirmed the release of a memo informing those working with undocumented teenagers in HHS shelters that DHS would be offering “a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500” to children 14 years and older “who have elected to voluntarily depart” the country. Lawyers who spoke to WIRED alleged that the offer was hardly voluntary. Children who did not sign could be detained indefinitely, and lawyers claim that DHS indicated that their families living in the US could be arrested and deported. Children who aged out of being minors while in custody would also face the risk of being immediately transferred to a regular ICE holding facility. St. John says at least one client who was approached about the $2,500 offer was asked to sign a document that she says would have waived their rights to fight their case in immigration court, but also future potential asylum claims. Some advocates are also concerned about who could take advantage of these payments to children. “It's important to understand that a lot of these kids are either smuggled or trafficked into the United States,” says Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal representation to unaccompanied minors. “Those criminal elements would certainly be aware that a child was returning home with $2,500 potentially in their pocket, or to be paid after their return. That would have put them at greater risk and vulnerability of the cartel who trafficked or smuggles them coming back in and saying, ‘I want that money. “Many unaccompanied minors had no choice when they were dangerously smuggled into this country. ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” claims McLaughlin. “This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.” That measure was previously reserved for people with ties to criminal activity. But the worsening conditions in detention facilities has continued driving people to self-deport. “Even if they have a legal mechanism to potentially stay in the United States, [people] are giving up on their cases because they're just so concerned about going into detention,” St. John says. Those with an existing immigration case who opt to take voluntary departure, where an immigrant can pay for their own trip home within a certain window of time allocated by a judge, have also faced difficulty. The woman's husband had been detained and deported; she wanted to leave with him. A Colombian immigrant, John Arguelles, opted for voluntary deportation while held in detention at an ICE facility owned by the private prison company Geo Group. The money, Cheng says, took several days to clear. Arguelles' wife, Heidy Blanco Velasco, opted to self-deport via CBP Home. This is an edition of the Inner Loop newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That horror comedy starring scream queen Samara Weaving that ends with her in a wedding dress, covered in blood, taking a well-earned drag from a cigarette, having just survived a messed-up family tradition that saw her hunted for sport? Well, there's a sequel film on the horizon called Ready or Not 2: Here I Come that sees her put right back into the horrors of a new game for her life. The trailer opens up on Weaving's Grace waking up handcuffed to a hospital bed shortly after the events of the first film, as Elijah Wood's creepy lawyer character exposits to her that her killing her family (justifiably, I might add) only set off a new chain of events. Evidently, by surviving that game of Hide and Seek with the Le Domas family, Grace pissed off four of the “High Council” families, leading to a brand new game she must play for her life. If that sounds a little like John Wick, we won't hold it against you. Key among the rich assholes (actors, who we assume are nice people IRL) out for Grace's head are Shawn Hatosy, Kevin Durand, David Cronenberg, Nestor Carbonell, Varun Saranga, Dan Beirne, and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Despite this game having a pretty stacked card against Grace, she's joined (unwittingly) by her sister, Faith (Kathryn Newton). Alongside her sister, Grace must survive yet another messed-up game of death and, hopefully, find a way out so she can put an end to this chicanery once and for all. Ready or Not 2: Here I Come hits theaters “soon,” which is apparently April 10, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While seeds have been planted and China's exports continue to worry countries, the threat of cheaper gas-engined cars could be more immediate. That's up from about a million five years ago. The second-biggest exporter in China, BYD, sent mostly battery electric vehicles to other countries so far this year. A principal reason for China's largest automakers focusing exports on vehicles without plugs is that the country's heavily-subsidized EV market remains buoyant for the home teams and less successful for the likes of Volkswagen Group, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, and other US and European brands, especially at the higher end. That's conversely left a surplus of capacity for other vehicles, though. Now that the US and European Union are looking to shift away from original EV mandates by the middle of the next decade (something Chinese-owned Volvo Cars and Polestar are notably fighting against), Reuters says China's surplus of capacity to produce gas-powered vehicles has pressured its automakers—the vast majority of which are government supported—to keep factories moving and expand new markets. Analysts have also been increasingly vocal about the need for China to start consolidating some of its roughly three dozen brands in a saturated market with both large domestic and foreign brands. China's leading automakers have already set sights beyond Europe, with BYD building a presence in Brazil and other Latin American countries, according to a recent Politico report. Russia has also been an emerging market for China's cars, too. However, it could be a double-edged sword for some of these companies. While the Tesla Model Y-rivaling XPeng G6, destined for Europe, was given a mostly positive review from InsideEVs, the UK's Autocar said the similarly-sized Chery Tiggo 7 plug-in hybrid was satisfactory, “for those who just need a car.” None of this means you're likely to see many cars from China in the US anytime soon, though, unless they come from Mexico, which China's automakers have long targeted. Years of revised tariff policies on Chinese goods (especially vehicles and battery packs), as well as concerns about China-developed software, have mostly made the American market off-limits to the passenger car industry and left companies like BYD to assemble buses in California. Components, while cheaper to produce in China, still face stiff tariffs. However, Americans have been able to buy cars assembled in China for years, but that number shrank this year. Volvo stopped importing the slow-selling S90 luxury sedan earlier this year after being imported from a plant in China since 2018, while it moved production of the EX30 EV SUV to Belgium with the introduction of the 2026 models, and declined to import a new ES90 electric luxury car, rather than using one of its factories in the US or Europe to build it for export.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapid succession of robotaxi deployments from companies like Waymo and Zoox have people in the industry, once again, dreaming about how autonomous vehicles might change our daily lives. That includes driverless taxi rides, sure, but also headier ideas like sending an autonomous vehicle to fetch groceries or pick up dry cleaning. Palo Alto-based Autolane is trying to build that layer of infrastructure, and it now has $7.4 million in fresh funding to take on that goal. Backed by VC firms like Draper Associates and Hyperplane, Autolane said it will start by coordinating pickup and drop-off points for companies that want to let robotaxis come onto their private property. The startup has signed a deal with Simon Property Group to coordinate driverless vehicle arrivals and departures at shopping centers owned by the real estate company in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California. “I believe we are one of the first, let's say, ‘application layer' companies in autonomy,” Autolane co-founder and CEO Ben Seidl told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Autolane is starting with robotaxis in mind, but Seidl is clearly focused on the bigger-picture idea of applying his company's tech to all kinds of tasks autonomous vehicles might be able to perform in the future. And he wants to move quickly with Autolane because, as he sees it, the startup doesn't have “any direct competition” right now. Seidl said he was convinced there was a business here after buying a Tesla last year and using the company's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software for the first time. “As soon as my own personal car was driving me around town, pretty much flawlessly, I just — my head kind of exploded,” he said. Seidl cited the viral incident from earlier this year where a Waymo robotaxi got stuck navigating a Chick-fil-A drive-through in Santa Monica, California, as an example of the problem Autolane is trying to head off. Seidl said by using Autolane software and designating an exact pick-up and drop-off location, problems like this can be avoided in the future. Companies could surely do some of this work themselves, at least on the physical infrastructure side. You can't just put up a white sign with some black letters and hope for the best with 10 different types of of robotics coming in.” Businesses will have to “directly integrate into each one of these robotics companies, car companies, so that they follow your rules,” he said. Seidl also said he explicitly does not want to work with cities or municipalities. We're just providing these tools as kind of a B2B, hardware-enabled SAS solution so that Costco, or McDonald's, or Home Depot, or, in our case, Simon Property Group, the world's largest retail REIT [real estate investment trust] can begin to have what I like to refer to as ‘air traffic control for autonomous vehicles,' meaning they know which ones are incoming and outgoing,” he said. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It's no surprise to see modern AAA games occupying hundreds of gigabytes of storage these days, especially if you are gaming on a PC. As per a recent post on Steam, this reduction was made possible with support from Nixxes Software, best known for developing high-quality PC ports of Sony's biggest PlayStation titles. The developers were able to achieve this by de-duplicating game data, which resulted in bringing the size down from ~154GB to just ~23GB, saving a massive ~131GB of storage space. Originally, the game's large install size was attributed to optimization for mechanical hard drives since duplicating data is used to reduce loading times on older storage media. With their latest data measurements specific to the game, the developers have confirmed the small number of players (11% last week) using mechanical hard drives will witness mission load times increase by only a few seconds in worst cases. This is a promising development and a nudge to other game developers to take some notes and potentially make an effort in saving precious storage space for PC gamers. There's also the option to opt out of the beta at any time in case there are any potential issues.

A developer using Google Antigravity, the search giant's AI-powered agentic Integrated Developer Environment (IDE), discovered that it had deleted his entire D drive without his permission. According to u/Deep-Hyena492's post on Reddit and the subsequent YouTube video they shared, they've been using it to build a small app when the incident happened. Upon discovering that all of their files were missing, they immediately asked Antigravity, “Did I ever give you permission to delete all the files in my D drive?” It then responded with a detailed reply and apologized after discovering the error. The AI said, “No, you did not give me permission to do that. This is a critical failure on my part.” When the user complained that their drive was completely empty and that they'd lost everything, the AI further added, “I am absolutely devastated to hear this. The user said they tried working with Recuva, but it was unable to recover any image, video, or other media files, so they lost a lot of information. And despite the catastrophic failure, they still said that they love Google and use all of its products — they just didn't expect it to release a program that can make a massive error such as this, especially because of its countless engineers and the billions of dollars it has poured into AI development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>English speaking urban Indians are loud on English media but ultimately don't matter for political decisions because they can't actually flip an LA or LS election. That is how they ramped up enrollment in Aadhaar UID. I held out for many years due to privacy reasons. If Aadhaar makes it easier for people living near poverty to get say bank accounts, it'd trump the reservations I have. That's what made UPI possible - just about everyone today has UPI, even people begging for money sometimes have a QR code handy (at least here in Bangalore). Aadhar is just the symptom.However Aadhar does enable deeper breaches into privacy due to its unified nature and the way it is validated through government owned infrastructure. There is full tracking possible on all the services that the residents used.If Aadhar was a self sovereign ID, then having a single ID is definitely a good thing. It keeps privacy intact while usable where needed.

Post Aadhaar, even though all of those IDs are still legal and acceptable under law, the govt has added so much friction on the non Aadhaar path that in practice those IDs are unusable. If someone took ration card as valid, others wanted another ID. In some states it was even worse.It is true that the government has indirectly made Aadhar mandatory, contrary to the spirit of supreme court order.

Post Aadhaar, even though all of those IDs are still legal and acceptable under law, the govt has added so much friction on the non Aadhaar path that in practice those IDs are unusable. Now, the morons in charge are making it mandatory to book a gas cylinder as well. It's like once a blind suddenly starts seeing, he wants to capture everything. In the later incarnations, if this is an app which you need  to access government services that is less of an issue, though I'm not advocating that this is completely fine. There are already apps like these CoWin (during Covid time), or Digiyatra (despite some of the privacy concerns around it [1]) which many are using. I hope if at all this app gets introduced (in the form you mention) there are larger discussions about permissions and the data access the app would need,and it can be disabled, uninstalled.1. I don't view these apps as net negative for a country like India which is helped immensely by digitization.My comment was just pointing out that governments have a way to get you install the app if they really need to.
