Bergs finished this epic struggle in tears, but listening to him later, it seemed like Cobolli had a point: Davis Cup lifts all boats.“I don't think it gets more emotional than this,” Bergs said after his 6-3, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (15) loss. “It's a combination of really, really enjoying being out there, as well as feeling so much love for your team and for the fans that I hear, dealing with a very difficult crowd.”“All those combinations make it a very emotional one. “We cannot lose for our country,” Flavio Cobolli said after this year's Davis Cup Final. “You can never lose if you give it all, what you have in your heart.”Coming from a man who had just led Italy to its third straight Cup title, those words might sound like a bit of poetic exaggeration.

By the time it was over, Cobolli had saved seven match points, and Bergs six. The season's Grand Slam events were over, and the ATP's stars—Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic—had already started their vacations. The players, as Cobolli said, gave everything they had on every point. Cobolli, a rising star, played and performed with theatrical Italian flair. Bergs's backwards hat, sweaty brown hair, and stomping gait recalled one of the grittiest of recent players, David Ferrer. Davis Cup did for the 22nd-ranked Cobolli and the 43rd-ranked Bergs what it has done for countless lesser-known players over the past 125 years: It gave them a shot at glory.

Bergs showed enough grit to fend off Cobolli and the crowd in a tight second-set tiebreak. But with a chance to end it on his serve, he pulled the trigger too quickly and sent a forehand 10 feet long. Up again 7-6, Bergs looked like he had the point won, only to see Cobolli make a series of retrievals, get back in the rally, attack the net, and close with a smash.“What are we watching right now?” one commentator asked in astonishment, as the crowd went berserk.

He saved one match point with a lunging volley winner, and another with a brilliant set of increasingly lethal forehands. At 14-14, he reflexed back a pair of defensive backhands, and drew an error on a smash from Cobolli. The Italian bolted to the net in plenty of time, and sliced a forehand that Bergs couldn't handle. Momentum had shifted back to Cobolli, this time for good.“There were so many important points,” Bergs said. Even if you do the right thing sometimes, doesn't mean you're going to get rewarded.”“I was just laughing so many times on court,” he said, “realizing what crazy points we're doing in a crazy atmosphere.” The Italian bolted to the net in plenty of time, and sliced a forehand that Bergs couldn't handle.

But nothing could top his tiebreaker with Bergs. When it was over, Cobolli celebrated by tearing his shirt in half.Asked later if he was paying tribute to his favorite player, and another notorious shirt-shredder, Novak Djokovic, Cobolli said no. He was thinking of someone even more powerful.“Today I felt like I was trying to be like Hulk,” he said with a laugh.Davis Cup can still change mortals into superheroes for a day.
