                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jody Glidden has spent more than three decades building tools for people who never have enough time. But the idea behind Postilize, his latest startup, came from something even simpler: lawyers kept losing clients because they had no clue what was happening in their own accounts. “Law firms were losing clients and they didn't see it coming,” Glidden told Refresh Miami. His last company helped firms understand the strength of their relationships. Postilize pushes that further by having AI track early signs of trouble or opportunity. It's just pouring through data and will bring you insights,” he added. If rumors of layoffs appear online, it alerts the employment team. “Now we can put AI to the problem.” Glidden jokes that the rise of generative AI feels like finding “ten billion new people who are smart and want to work for free.” Those new helpers don't merely point out risks – they help with business development. “Helping them find opportunities before they even occur. The platform now works across a wide range of firms. “It's fairly common among 100-lawyer firms and above,” Glidden said. But it also powers major global clients, including one of the Big Four accounting firms. A couple of single-user firms even slipped in thanks to personal connections, although that's not the target market. Glidden said Latera's database of firm experience – every matter, opposing counsel, and outcome – made it a perfect pairing. “I thought it would be a great source of information for Postilize,” he said. Their combined product helps firms filter a massive stream of predicted legal matters down to the ones they are most likely to win. He stayed anyway, and that decision worked out. He also credits the community for providing connections that help legal tech companies grow. “We have a great network in Miami,” he said. “It's been really great for the tech community.” Postilize now has around 25 employees, though most work outside Miami. “We're already able to predict an incredible amount of legal matters,” he said. “These types of predictions would never have been possible even last year,” he said. With better models and deeper integrations, he believes the platform will advance quickly. Refresh Miami is a 501c3 non-profit with a mission to educate, inspire, connect and grow South Florida's tech and startup ecosystem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christmas doesn't have to be just holly jolly. It's ok to have a little spooky fun too. The Victorians really grabbed onto that idea: Christmas magazines were full of ghost tales, and families made it a whole vibe to sit around on Christmas Eve and try to outdo each other with hauntings and eerie encounters. Readers still love paranormal Christmas stories because they hit this perfect mix of cozy and creepy. You've got warm lights, snow outside, family drama, and then - boom - ghosts, unfinished business, and visits from the past, which lets people think about loss, guilt, and new beginnings without it feeling preachy. That contrast makes the scares feel sharper and the emotional moments hit harder, so a good Christmas ghost story ends up feeling both unsettling and weirdly comforting at the same time. Check out this list of ghostly holiday reads, not too scary but a heap load of holiday cheer and fun! A writer renovating an old Cornish cottage before Christmas finds her new home and its uncanny resident cat steeped in local legend, with gentle paranormal and magical-realism notes rather than full-on horror. Follows Holly Claus, on a mission to collect holiday “Cheer” in a small Oregon town where the magic around Christmas might not be operating the way she expects, giving a cozy-fantasy twist to North Pole lore. A Viking vampire, his human wife, and their kids travel to Transylvania for the holidays; expect over‑the‑top humor, fish‑out‑of‑water gags, and paranormal Christmas chaos rather than serious scares.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new analysis of July temperatures in Death Valley between 1923 and 2024 suggests the world record near-surface air temperature of 134 F measured in July 1913 may be erroneous. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Weather Bureau data, the air temperature at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley reached a scorching 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius) on July 10, 1913. This is still the highest air temperature on record, but its authenticity has been debated by meteorologists and climatologists, because — despite global warming — temperatures in the region have rarely reached 130 F (54.4 C) since 1913. "I, along with many meteorologists and climatologists, have been quietly skeptical of the Death Valley world record our entire careers," Roy Spencer, a meteorologist and principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who recently led a study about Death Valley's world record status, told Live Science in an email. For the study, Spencer and his colleagues analyzed July temperatures recorded at stations within 155 miles (250 kilometers) of Greenland Ranch between 1923 and 2024. Many scientists were previously skeptical about Death Valley's temperature record but few really questioned it because the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) accepted it and observations from the early 1900s with which to scrutinize the Greenland Ranch data were scarce, Spencer said. "All deserts are hot in the summer, but Death Valley is especially hot because it is below sea level," he said. "The Death Valley record has more entertainment than climatological value, with an element of 'bragging rights' from the standpoint of tourism."

"Newspaper, magazine, book accounts, and even correspondence with the Weather Bureau in San Francisco from back then show that 135 deg. The findings suggest Death Valley's world record should be rescinded, although temperatures of 130 F recorded in 2020 and 2021 might help the valley keep it, Spencer said. —Death Valley shrub rearranges its insides to thrive in one of the hottest places on Earth —Racetrack Playa: The home of Death Valley's mysterious 'sailing stones' —'This is weird': Experts 'shocked' by record-breaking longevity of Death Valley's phantom lake "I would support further investigation into this by the WMO and NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information," said Dan McEvoy, an associate research professor of climatology at the Desert Research Institute who was not involved in the study. The true story behind the value recorded on July 10, 1913 may never be known, but the study's conclusion that 134 F is incorrect is convincing and based on solid historical evidence, McEvoy told Live Science in an email.

A large plume of helium gas was spotted evaporating from the giant planet, known as WASP-107b, according to research based on observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The research represents the first time JWST has "captured helium escape from this planet," lead author Vigneshwaran Krishnamurthy, a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University's Trottier Space Institute in Montreal, said in a statement. The discovery could help researchers better understand how exoplanet atmospheres behave, especially in extreme star systems like WASP-107, where WASP-107b resides, the team said. WASP-107b was discovered in 2017 near a star about 210 light-years from Earth. (For comparison, the closest planets to us are about 4 light-years away.) WASP-107b is almost the same size as Jupiter, at 94% of the gas giant's diameter, but its mass is just 12% that of Jupiter. This extremely low density and large size place WASP-107b in the "super-puff" category of exoplanets. In Earth's neighborhood, by contrast, rocky planets are closer to the sun and gas giants like Jupiter are farther away. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. They think WASP-107b, like Jupiter and Saturn, formed much farther from its star but something in the system — possibly another planet — forced WASP-107b to migrate closer to its star over time. "WASP-107c, much farther out than WASP-107b, could have played a role in this migration," study co-author Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb, an exoplanet researcher now at the University of Chicago who completed her Ph.D. at the University of Montreal in 2024, said in the statement. For example, there was more oxygen in the planet's atmosphere than would be predicted if it had formed close to its star, which provides more evidence that its migration was relatively recent. —Mysterious 'puffy' planet may finally be explained by James Webb Space Telescope JWST also found water in the planet's atmosphere — confirming previous observations from the Hubble Space Telescope — alongside traces of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ammonia. Because JWST's instruments are sensitive enough to detect methane from afar, the researchers suggest other gases poor in methane must have instead been drawn up from deep in the planet's atmosphere due to "vigorous vertical mixing" driven by the heat of the star, Piaulet-Ghorayeb added. While planets like Earth also have some atmospheric loss, it is not this extreme. Studying worlds like WASP-107b could help us understand how atmospheric escape works on planets like Venus, which lost water over the eons, the research team said in a statement from the University of Geneva.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astrobiologist Caleb Scharf joins Michael Shermer for a wide-ranging conversation about the past, present, and future of our relationship with space. Drawing on his new book The Giant Leap, Scharf explains why human expansion beyond Earth may be less a choice than an evolutionary development, and he walks through the physics, history, and personalities that shaped our journey off the planet. Scharf also explains the biological toll of radiation and microgravity, and why terraforming Mars is probably unrealistic and why our future might rely more on building vast rotating habitats in space than on settling other planets. Caleb Scharf is an astrobiologist and recipient of the 2022 Carl Sagan Medal.
