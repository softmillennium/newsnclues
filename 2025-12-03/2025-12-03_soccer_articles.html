                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK -- U.S. Soccer held a day-long summit Tuesday for more than 400 commercial partners, donors and other soccer industry leaders ahead of Friday's FIFA World Cup draw in Washington D.C. The lavish event at The Glasshouse in Hell's Kitchen captured the scale of U.S. Soccer's financial glow-up under CEO JT Batson and President Cindy Parlow Cone, particularly since bringing its commercial rights in house in 2023. Coffee brand La Colombe and candy maker Ferrara sponsored networking breaks between sessions. In addition to previewing its brand campaign for next summer's FIFA World Cup, details of which will be made public later, U.S. Soccer used the event to announce the launch of the Kang Women's Institute, a women's soccer-focused research initiative funded by mega-donor Michele Kang. “All the research is done on men -- over 94%,” Kang said. “So, we have a lot of those things to change. So, I hope that this is a small match that has lit the fire, and I hope more people join the movement.” Parlow Cone seconded Kang's sentiment and took the opportunity to stump for reelection ahead of a vote at the organization's Annual General Meeting in March 2026. No candidates have yet declared to run against her. “There's a reason why I'm running for reelection again. The day culminated in an on-stage interview by Fox Sports' Jenny Taft of U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino and assistant coach Jesús Pérez. During that session, the federation formally announced that the USMNT will play four pre-World Cup friendlies in Atlanta (March 28 vs. Belgium and March 31 vs. Portugal), Charlotte (May 31 vs. TBD) and Chicago (June 6 vs. Germany). Other notable speakers and panelists included Batson, Bank of America President of Marketing, Digital & Specialized Consumer Client Solutions David Tyrie, M+C Saatchi Chief Growth Officer for North America Suresh Raj, former U.S. women's national team player Abby Wambach, U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker and Telemundo EVP/Marketing and Creative Claudia Chagui.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dutch international defender himself has featured in three of those five line-ups, while Manchester City's star centre-back Ruben Dias has featured in two of those teams. His impressive performances for the Reds have earned him a place in three out of the last five FIFA FIFPro World XI sides. Van Dijk is followed by City's Dias, who made it into the line-ups in 2021 and 2023. In a chat with GOAL, Van Dijk was asked to name the defenders from the last five FIFPro World XIs and, quite surprisingly, the Dutchman named each backline accurately for all five seasons.

They started 2025-26 with five Premier League wins in a row but thereafter their form took a major dip as they have managed to win only two out of their next eight league games. After the club's disastrous 3-0 loss against Nottingham Forest last month, Van Dijk lashed out at his colleagues as he told reporters: "We concede too many easy goals. They scored obviously from a set piece again. You can ask if he was in front of Alisson, but it counted, so we're 1-0 down. We were not good in terms of battles, challenges, the fight, too rushed. It's a very difficult situation at the moment. There was nervousness after we conceded, but not before. We tried to rush things and that's human when you're in a difficult moment. Everyone in the team has to take responsibility as well. Football is a team and everyone has to take responsibility. We have to digest this and take it on the chin. Everyone is disappointed, like they should be, because losing at home to Nottingham Forest is, in my eyes, very bad. That's the least I can say about it. We will bounce back but it doesn't happen overnight. I'm not a quitter and we will keep going. I can't decide what the supporters are doing if they leave early. I know the fans have been through thick and thin with us. They will be there with us when we come out of this because we will come out of this." Arne Slot's side finally ended their three-game losing streak last weekend as they beat West Ham on Sunday, courtesy of Alexander Isak and Cody Gakpo's strikes. The busy schedule starts with a Premier League match against Sunderland on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former U.S. men's national team star Alexi Lalas believes Christian Pulisic can become the “greatest male American soccer player” of all time, but only if he delivers at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Yet wearing the Stars and Stripes' armband at the World Cup, on home soil, is a new type of weight for the 27-year-old, one that could turn him into a legend. “There's no better way in polishing your brand than doing it at a home World Cup here,” Lalas, who played every minute for the USMNT at the 1994 World Cup, told the New York Post. “It doesn't matter where you play or the fame that you have, the money that you have; this is an opportunity in front of your home country to almost introduce or reintroduce yourself. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. “So I think with Christian Pulisic, a lot of eyes will be on him and rightfully so. “I think as he continues on [he] will ultimately be looked at as, arguably, the greatest male American soccer player in history. Pulisic has been uttered in the same conversation as Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey throughout his entire career for the USMNT. The two icons slammed Pulisic and a slew of other American stars for skipping last summer's Gold Cup, questioning the commitment of the current generation. The AC Milan winger fired back and even snubbed Donovan and Dempsey when naming his dream USMNT five-a-side team. The forward is fifth on the all-time goalscorers list, just 25 goals behind joint record-holders Donovan and Dempsey. If Pulisic, who has scored 40 goals since his move to Milan in July 2023, translates his elite club form to the national team this summer, he will have the chance to do something even Donovan and Dempsey never could: lead his team to World Cup glory on home soil.

The draw for next year's tournament will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, with model and TV personality Heidi Klum, comedian Kevin Hart and actor Danny Ramirez co-hosting the event. The Village People will perform YMCA to cap off an event that promises have distinctly Trumpian overtones. The disco hit became a staple at Donald Trump's campaign rallies and Mar-a-Lago fundraisers. Other musical performances will include the classical singer Bocelli and a duet by Williams – who is Fifa's music ambassador – and Nicole Scherzinger. The tournament takes place in the US, Canada and Mexico next summer, running from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities. Adding another layer of Trump connection, Fifa also plans to unveil its new “Peace Prize – Football Unites the World” during the event. Expanded to 48 teams and 104 matches, the World Cup will span venues from Mexico City to Vancouver and from New York to Los Angeles, with the bulk of games staged in the US as Fifa looks to tap into the world's biggest sports market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (CAROLINA SPORTS LIVE) — Charlotte will get to experience the biggest summer in the United States in nearly 30 years when it hosts a friendly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. “Next year will be the biggest summer of soccer in the history of this country and Charlotte is set to host the U.S. Men's National Team's penultimate friendly ahead of the FIFA World Cup,” Kristi Coleman, Tepper Sports & Entertainment CEO, said. “At Tepper Sports & Entertainment, we're committed to continuing to work alongside our local partners to attract marquee events to Bank of America Stadium, strengthening Charlotte's position as a premier destination and driving meaningful economic impact for our community.” Not only will this friendly be in Charlotte, but Bank of America Stadium will also serve as the site of the 2026 MLS All-Star Game. The date for that game has yet to be announced. Before the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup, the U.S. Women's National Team beat South Korea after their World Cup triumph in 2019 in Charlotte. That match featured the largest USWNT crowd ever in North Carolina. Recently, Charlotte was included in the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup bid book from the U.S. Soccer Federation, Mexican Football Association, Costa Rican Football Association, and Jamaica Football Federation. “We are thrilled to welcome the U.S. Men's National Team to Charlotte for one of their World Cup send-off matches at Bank of America Stadium,” Will Pitts, CEO of Charlotte Sports Foundation, said. “Our city has a deep passion for soccer, and we look forward to showcasing the hospitality, energy, and incredible experiences that make Charlotte such a memorable destination for fans from across the country. This event would not be possible without the tremendous partnership of Tepper Sports & Entertainment, the State of North Carolina, and the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. We're grateful for their support and excited to bring this world-class match to our community.” Charlotte FC defender Tim Ream has earned 79 appearances for the USMNT since 2011, and has been a captain 25 times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>64 Quirky Facts on World Cup Draw Teams Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has been granted indefinite leave by the club following a request for a period of absence. The Uruguay international has played 15 games across all competitions for Hansi Flick's side this campaign and his most recent appearance was in last week's Champions League defeat at Chelsea, when he was sent off in the 44th minute. The 26-year-old was not part of the Barca matchday squad for Saturday's 3-1 league home win over Alaves on Saturday. “It is a private situation, I don't want to say more,” Barca head coach Hansi Flick had said earlier on Monday. The coach's comments came after Barca president Joan Laporta said on Friday that he wanted to “support and defend” the player. “He has been heavily criticised, and I don't think that's fair,” Laporta said at an event in Andorra. “He's had a tough time, and I want to tell him that we're behind him, that he needs to turn the page because here we all win and we all lose, and no one person is responsible for defeats or victories.” Araujo, a central defender who has also been played at right-back, has made 190 first-team appearances for Barca since joining in 2018 from Uruguayan club Boston River.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesota Aurora FC is a community-owned women's soccer team born from a parking lot meeting in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, they consistently play in front of crowds larger than some professional teams in the top flight of women's soccer. Yet they started and remain an amateur side. In September 2020, Burdine and Privratsky gathered a group of about 25, standing six feet apart with masks on, and laid the foundations for a new kind of team. “They were talking about it and had this idea of, well, maybe we could start a soccer team. Maybe we don't need a rich person,” Yoch told CNN Sports. “One of the biggest things we needed to figure out was funding, and how we were going to announce the team, and what league we were gonna play in. “After meeting with all the leagues, the USL W was coming in brand new in 2022, and they were the only ones that were okay with a community-owned model,” Yoch said. “We didn't have what anybody wanted as a franchise fee, but the USL W believed in our vision. With nine founders and support from a new league, Minnesota Aurora launched its first community ownership campaign in August 2021. Within three months, they raised a million dollars and sold out the 3,080 community shares. Yoch said of the early success, “We just hit a moment in time where everybody was incredibly intrigued and excited about this idea of being able to own a women's soccer team.” Despite its relatively small population, Minnesota has a professional team in every major sports league. Yet Aurora, an amateur women's team, found a way through the saturated market. “It was Covid, George Floyd had been murdered; you know, we had just a lot of damage – physically and mentally – in Minnesota. “I think the combination of people finally being aware of how poorly female athletes were being treated and Minnesotans wanting to do something positive worked together.” “Our contact at the Vikings called me and said, ‘I think you need to open up the whole stadium,'” Yoch recalled. Our first night, we were at over 5,000 fans, and unless it's a terrible rain game or something, we have never dipped below 4,000.” Jen Larrick was at that first socially-distanced meeting in 2020, having met Privratsky through a showcase she ran to give exposure to girls outside the typical pay-to-play club soccer system. Larrick joined the team as assistant coach for the inaugural season and just finished her first season as head coach. “I personally am queer, and even that first year we had, you know, half our coaching staff was queer,” Larrick said. “My deep hope is that, you know, from within the team and then also as a fan, it feels like a space where people are welcome when they show up.” “I think you see people coming in the door and continuing to engage with Aurora because they can tell, just based on the way the club carries itself, based on how the club shows up in all of the spaces … people see that and they take notice, and they want to be there because they feel seen, they feel represented, they feel heard.” However, Aurora's mission – “creating pathways for women, girls, and gender expansive people to reach their potential, on and off the field” – has not been without challenges. “The USL W has some rules about the trans community that are not okay or in line with our values and we're trying to do what we can, kind of within the difficult context.” CNN Sports has reached out to the USL W about their transgender athlete guidelines. “I think, for me, social justice or trying to be socially responsible actors in your community is not about being perfect or getting it right all the time, but it's about on an everyday basis trying to wrestle with these important, big questions,” Larrick emphasized. “Aurora, I think, in so many ways operates internally, but also in terms of media attention and just general functioning, like a professional team,” Hassoun said. The club provides housing for its athletes, broadcasts every game locally, and sells full sponsorship packages. However, under league rules, players are not allowed to earn a salary. In addition to requiring a principal owner, the NWSL confirmed via email to CNN Sports that it “require(s) infrastructure investment, an expansion fee and sufficient operating capital to fund a team.” Some have wondered why Minnesota Vikings owners Zygi, Leonard and Mark Wilf haven't added the Aurora to their portfolio, as the team plays at the NFL franchise's training ground. “They are very committed to Orlando,” Yoch confirmed. “While there's no money exchanging hands, (the Wilfs) do help us a lot. This message on maintaining their “fierce advocacy” was echoed by Yoch. “We had one dinner with someone who I thought was a great potential. And once we walked through what the team stood for and what we were hoping for in an owner, she was very kind and it was very graceful, but she just said, ‘That just doesn't match up with our family's beliefs.' We believe the right person is out there. For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 'ESPN FC TV' crew react to FIFA's new ranking system ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw next week. The final six teams will be decided in the coming months, but what do you know about those who have already confirmed their place? Here, we look at one thing that defines the way each team plays -- whether it's tactical, statistical or just plain interesting. - 2026 World Cup: Who has qualified, and how the rest can make it Ten games into the Jesse Marsch era and Canada already have a tactical trademark -- albeit niche -- named "Maplepressing." In a tight, aggressive 4-4-2 (or 4-2-2-2), Canada defend on the front foot with a high line, minimal spacing between the units and a high pressing unit that stays narrow to shut down central passing options. Even with top talent like Jonathan David in attacking roles, Marsch has built the hosts on intensity, discipline and a clear pressing ID. The most discussed dilemma to address, however, is how to pair strikers Raúl Jiménez and Santi Giménez without unbalancing the team structure -- Aguirre has used both together in a 4-4-2 in the past, but that doesn't appear to be his preferred system. Mauricio Pochettino's biggest challenge -- or advantage -- is choosing between two credible formations. While the USMNT primarily operates in a 4-2-3-1 that becomes a 3-2-5 in possession, built around Christian Pulisic drifting inside as the main creator, a 3-4-3 remains a fully viable alternative when Pochettino wants more control in buildup or additional threat from the wingers. Mauricio Pochettino talks about his work's progress at USMNT and looks ahead to the 2026 World Cup as they now prepare to face Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay. Ralf Rangnick has shaped Austria into a full-throttle Red Bull national team, built on aggression, directness and suffocating pressure. No European side pressed with more intensity in World Cup qualifying as Austria registered the continent's highest number of tackles (144), second highest recoveries (365), and lowest Passes Per Defensive Action (PPDA) of 7.14, edging even England and Germany. Rangnick favors front-foot pressure and immediate transitions; they don't just defend high, they force turnovers and once the ball is won, it's a matter of one or two passes before a chance is created. Few teams at this World Cup will bring more pure intensity. No side attacked the opposition box more in UEFA qualifying -- 491 touches, 101 clear of Croatia in second -- or attempted more take-ons (201), a direct reflection of their world-class wide talent. Under Rudi Garcia they feature stretches of intense pressing, quick regaining of the ball and longer spells of possession, but the general idea is designed to open lanes for Jérémy Doku and Kevin De Bruyne to run at the defense. Croatia cruised through qualifying, dropping just two points, but Zlatko Dalic's approach bucks the trend of Europe's mid-tier/top sides. Rather than pressing to maximum lung capacity, they dominate the ball -- a 69.7% possession share places them fifth, just behind Spain -- and build patiently through a veteran midfield. Croatia also ranked among Europe's leaders in key passes (124) and crosses attempted (241), yet their methodical tempo has drawn domestic criticism, with some dubbing them "the new Greece" [after the pragmatic win at Euro 2004.] England have quietly become Europe's most ball-dominant national team. The shift is by no means cosmetic, though, as long periods of controlled circulation have doubled as a defensive weapon, helping England win all eight qualifiers without conceding a goal. Frank Leboeuf and Craig Burley question England's place as second favourites in the bookmakers' odds to win the 2026 World Cup. Thirteen years into the Didier Deschamps era, France remain exactly what they've always been: utterly disciplined, compact and brutally hard to break down. The qualifiers backed up that narrative once again. No team in Europe allowed fewer shots -- just 23 in six games, an absurdly low 3.83 per 90 -- with England a distant second at 4.25. The shape may read 4-2-3-1, but their priorities rarely change. There's a double pivot in midfield shielding the back line, wide players working both ways and enough on-ball control to keep games in Deschamps' preferred rhythm. Julian Nagelsmann has restored structure to Germany, straightening up distances and clarifying roles, but the team's real breakthrough lies in the double No. Their input and reception/passing between the lines are the catalyst of Germany's fluidity, freeing full backs and reducing reliance on a prolific No. With 72.7% possession in qualifying, they prefer to take charge of games centrally, while they're one of Europe's most intense pressing sides off the ball (7.50 PPDA). The Oranje defend primarily in a mid-block and build asymmetrically, with full back Denzel Dumfries supplying much of the width. Despite the pragmatism, there's still a style to their play as they rank among Europe's best for progressive passes (724, second behind England) and attacking take-ons from the wingers. Norway topped the UEFA qualifying stats for goals scored (37) and assists (29), while they were second with Expected Goals (xG) of 24.70, much thanks to Erling Haaland's finishing but also due to a far more sophisticated style under Ståle Solbakken. Traditionally mocked as a direct side, they played just 6.6% of long balls (eighth among UEFA teams), instead basing their game on a coordinated buildup, wide/inverted winger take-ons and early combinations into the box. While Roberto Martínez has kept Portugal's possession-heavy approach -- their 71.0% share in qualifying ranked third in Europe -- he's added a more assertive high press against stronger opponents. Martínez often fields five natural attackers, supported by playmaking rather than ball-winning midfielders, which can expose the back line when possession breaks down. Adding one or two midfield grafters in the centre might be needed if Portugal's game is to hold up against world-class opposition. Europe's most senior side (at an average age of 28.8) enter the tournament with squad experience, though they haven't been in a World Cup since 1998. Steve Clarke's team defend deep (they were third among UEFA teams for shots blocked at 5.83 shots per 90), build width through the full backs and depend on midfield runners to get forward and provide chances. They don't see a lot of the ball (45.7% possession) but don't play it long that often either (12.2%), so set pieces could represent Scotland's primary attacking weapon. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. While Luis de la Fuente's Spain still enjoy possession (70.1% from the qualifiers, behind England, Germany and Portugal), the days of pure "tiki-tika" are long gone. The European champions press higher and harder -- their PPDA of 9.76 ranks among Europe's most aggressive -- and possession now serves as a launchpad for quick attacks when openings appear, rather than wearing teams down with endless passing. Consequently, Spain's build-up is quicker, their wingers are extremely direct, and combinations unfold at a sharper tempo than in the previous era. Switzerland's strength lies less in standout metrics than in the reliability of their core with the midfield double pivot of Granit Xhaka and Remo Freuler essential for defensive balance and in denying the opposition space. Boss Murat Yakin may alternate between a back four and a situational back three, but the midfield pair give the Swiss their trademark order with fluid distribution, well-timed pressure and a defensive line that's difficult to pass through (they were seventh among UEFA teams for recoveries per 90, with 43). Switzerland rarely dominate and there's little flashness to them, yet their discipline and midfield control make them an awkward opponent for anyone. The ESPN FC crew debate if Vinicius Jr & Rodrygo play with more freedom for Brazil than Real Madrid. The keys are a CONMEBOL qualification-leading 64.0% possession, then compact mid-block out of possession (9.34 PPDA), quick vertical balls after regaining the ball, and an attacking shape made on familiar patterns with room for individual brilliance (they scored the most goals, with 31). Brazil reached the 2026 World Cup after their worst CONMEBOL qualifying run of the modern era and boss Carlo Ancelotti is still searching for answers. The talent up front remains incredible -- Brazil often field four forwards, three of which are usually elite dribblers (Brazil recorded 365 take-ons in the qualifiers) -- but full back issues, spacing problems and a lack of domination have forced Ancelotti toward a more compact 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 with a clearer defensive structure. This is a Brazil side trying to impose order on chaos, even though Ancelotti freely admits they're still far from the fluid, mid-block team he imagines. Under Néstor Lorenzo, Colombia have become CONMEBOL's most assertive attacking outfit. Their 4-3-3 formation blends organization with flair, but the numbers point to incision too. Colombia overwhelm their opponents through pressure and repeat patterns to get into dangerous spaces. Under Sebastián Beccacece they conceded just five goals in all of CONMEBOL's 18-game qualifying, a remarkable return given the quality of opposition, regardless of whether they lined up in a back three or four. The flipside, however, is that they're unlikely to entertain any neutrals, as a third of their qualifiers ended 0-0. The identity is clear, though: rigid organization, collective pressing and a strong physical imprint, all complemented by rapid counter attacks rather than long spells on the ball. Paraguay fans flood the streets of the capital Asuncion after they qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 20 years. Gustavo Alfaro has rebuilt Paraguay by reverting to the strengths that have historically defined La Albirroja; structure, toughness and ruthless attention to (defensive) detail. His 4-2-3-1 is drilled around cutting off space, compact lines and winning duels, which helps explain why Paraguay produced the most clearances (403) and aerial duels (619) in CONMEBOL qualifying and conceded only 10 goals, the joint second-best record. Creativity is still limited -- just 14 goals scored -- but Alfaro's side are once again competitive, mentally prepared and exceptionally pragmatic. With Marcelo Bielsa in charge, Uruguay were always going to be direct going forward, man-to-man marking oriented defensively and immediately drive forward the moment the ball is won. As much as Bielsa's sides can be chaotic at both ends, this version is surprisingly more measured -- 22-12 goal difference over 18 qualifiers is very un-Bielsa like -- yet the energetic, relentlessly competitive edge is still present. Curaçao might be the most "European" team in CONCACAF. They also finished the entire CONCACAF qualifying cycle as aggregate top scorers across all three stages (28), powered by the Bacuna brothers (Leandro and Juninho) in midfield and two attack-minded full backs. Despite that offensive profile, Curaçao kept six clean sheets in 10 qualifiers. Against elite opposition, though, expect them to sit deep, invite pressure, then explode forward with pace. Following a 5-1 collapse to Curaçao, Sebastian Migné tightened the formation, choosing a deeper, more compact defensive setup while keeping the option to set off short, explosive pressing waves. They may sit deeper against stronger sides -- and they managed a CONCACAF-high 436 recoveries -- but their backbone remains strong with disciplined box defenders, a hardworking midfield core and a frontline built for sudden attacking bursts. Under former Barcelona forward Thomas Christiansen, Panama have evolved into one of CONCACAF's tidiest sides in possession and were second in the qualifying field (61.5%), a number that reflects Christiansen's emphasis on patient, progressive build-up and using the ball as their main tactical idea. Heading into AFCON, on the back of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, South Africa have developed a winning instinct that was lacking before, says defender Thabo Moloisane. ALGERIA (4-2-3-1): "A team that wakes up after 45 minutes." Algeria eased their way to the 2026 World Cup with eight wins from 10 and Mohamed Amoura scoring 10 goals, but their Swiss coach Vladimir Petkovic still hasn't convinced everyone. His side posted 63.6% possession, the second-highest in African qualifying, yet often looked stagnant in build-up and vulnerable once the ball turned over, which is a strange contrast for a team packed with attacking flair and individual creativity. Petkovic's long tinkering phase didn't help clarity either. Still, Algeria's ability to change gears after halftime, press high and force opportunistic mistakes represent a defining weapon. CAPE VERDE (4-3-3): "A late bloomer you shouldn't underestimate." Cape Verde enter their first World Cup with what is projected to be the tournament's oldest squad, averaging 30.7 years of age through qualifying. Pedro Leitao's side conceded just eight goals, based on strong organization and a calmness going into vital games. They operate from a compact 4-3-3, absorb pressure willingly and counter with precision through a sharp, pacy, front line which is happy to take opponents on. Their maturity, structure and game management make them unusually tricky for an easily underestimated debutant. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Egypt walked through qualifying unbeaten, conceding just two goals in 10 games, a true testimony of Hossam Hassan's shift toward risk-management. They control games through conservative organization first, which in turn makes Mohamed Salah's form the central variable heading into 2026. Egypt have the defensive base to frustrate anyone, but their attacking output remains modest (they "underscored" their xG by 2.4 in the qualifiers, but topped for key passes) and heavily rely to Salah's ability to turn tight matches with moments of quality. Though ranked lowest in the FIFA ranking (72nd), Ghana are a functioning, pragmatic side under Otto Addo. The main outlets for goals, however, comes from a heavy dependency on 34-year-old striker Jordan Ayew (14 goals+assists from the qualifiers), which means that Addo needs to get more out of creative talents such as Mohammed Kudus and Kamaldeen Sulemana. Though Ghana's proficiency from set-pieces does somewhat ease the burden on their seasoned captain. Under Emerse Faé they feature a disciplined 4-3-3 that can look like a 4-2-3-1 away from home, controlling long stretches of possession. Their attacking impact comes from rapid full backs and interchangeable wide forwards, but the collective spirit is key. This is a more mature, consistent, tournament-ready Ivory Coast than seen in recent editions. MOROCCO (4-3-3/4-1-4-1): "Hard to break down, but flair and creativity going forward." They are constructed around a compact 4-3-3 that becomes 4-1-4-1 when the wingers drop, but this isn't only about control and defensive rigidity as Morocco also carry genuine attacking flair: Achraf Hakimi's overlaps, Azzedine Ounahi's press resistance, Brahim Díaz's creativity, and the end-product of Hakim Ziyech, Youssef En-Nesyri and Ayoub El Kaabi. Senegal is arguably Africa's most complete and aesthetically pleasing side, packed with talent from back to front who are comfortable dictating games. They recorded 64.8% possession -- the highest in CAF qualifying -- and make good use of that to patiently shift the opponent from side to side until openings appear. Pape Thiaw's team press aggressively and rely on an energetic midfield to suffocate transitions. With this mix of technique, organization and top-level individual quality, Senegal can potentially trouble whoever they come up against. South Africa lean heavily on a core of players from Mamelodi Sundowns -- the country's perennial champions -- which gives them a rare cohesion at international level. Hugo Broos has built a nearly organized, well-drilled side which allowed just 5.8 shots per 90 minutes in qualifying, one of the stingiest records across Africa. Tunisia had one of the most remarkable qualifying campaigns anywhere, with 10 clean sheets from 10 matches, which was the joint-best defensive record in Africa (along with Ivory Coast). Coach Sami Trabelsi has undoubtably tightened things by switching from Tunisia's old back three to a more stable back four that keeps players behind the ball and rarely gives up space. However, the question is whether that defensive perfection will be enough as Tunisia lack any forwards who play regularly in one of Europe's top five leagues. Head coach Julen Lopetegui says he is "very proud" after Qatar qualified for the 2026 World Cup for the first time Australia are one of the few World Cup nations who feature a back three as a standard formation and the Tony Popovic version has proved remarkably efficient. While they're comfortable without the ball and rely on their three center backs to protect central spaces, the takeaway from qualifying was their output. Australia outperformed their xG by nearly +10 (28.5 vs. 38), which is quite remarkable in the absence of a high-scoring center forward. Iran completed the second-most through balls in Asian qualifying (12), indicating that their midfield can unpick lines even if the overall approach by and large is reactive. Amir Ghalenoei's 4-2-3-1 tend to sit deep and counter, leaning on the penalty-box instincts of Mehdi Taremi and Sardar Azmoun up front, but chance creation can stall against set defenses. The creative numbers are promising (their xG of 18.99 was sixth in qualifying), yet converting that to tournament play -- where space is scarcer -- is Iran's challenge. Japan swept through qualifying with 51 goals (from an xG of 30.18), 188 chances created and 149 key passes, highlighting how intelligently they move the ball. Hajime Moriyasu's flexible concept is based on high pressing with sharp positional rotations in the final third, consistently crafting spare players between lines. Japan have also found an interesting edge from corners, with six converted in  qualifying. But when things click, Japan generate chances at a rate no regional rival can match. World Cup debutants Jordan made the finals with the lowest average possession of any Asian qualifier (46.7%), which appears very much by design. Houcine Ammouta and now Jamal Sellami have settled fully into a back-three defense that collapses into a 5-4-1, trusting wide center backs to win duels and trigger fast breaks. Their attack comes almost exclusively from vertical runs after regaining the ball and this style has produced one of the region's strongest shot-to-transition ratios. While Julen Lopetegui has added more structure to Qatar's buildup, the headache of their campaign was their defensive troubles. That defensive volatility contrasts sharply with their threat in transition, where the prolific Almoez Ali -- top scorer in qualification with 12 -- gives them a proper edge. Set pieces have also turned into a reliable source of chances, but unless Lopetegui sorts out the defense, the 2022 hosts will really struggle. SAUDI ARABIA (4-3-3/4-2-3-1): "Energy in midfield, short up front." In his second spell as manager, Hervé Renard has improved the country's out-of-possession game, but the attack is still a weak spot. They scored only seven goals in the final qualifying group and the Frenchman is still looking for a compatible front line. South Korea raced through qualifying unbeaten and scoring freely, yet questions remain on how much of their attack still has to flow through the 33-year-old Son Heung-Min. Hong Myung-bo's midfield double pivot and restrained full backs give them territorial control (71.4% average possession, the highest from Asian qualifying) but chance creation often depends on individual interventions rather than collective patterns. His recent shift toward a back three -- wing backs higher; Son as a lone striker -- is one effort to broaden the threat. Despite preferring control and possession, they can "explode" on the final third with 1,324 progressive passes (the best in Asia). Timur Kapadze's arrival mid-campaign -- now reinstated as assistant after the unexpected recent appointment of Italy legend Fabio Cannavaro as manager -- turned Uzbekistan into a more pronounced back-three side, giving them license to attack aggressively through their wing backs while trusting Manchester City defender Abdukodir Khusanov to rescue them in transition with his outstanding recovery pace. Their main source of attacking threat come from wide areas, though, as they produced 222 crosses and 160 shots in qualifying New Zealand's friendly form has been dodgy (no wins in seven, just one draw), but Darren Bazeley's main tactical challenge is getting 33-year-old Chris Wood involved in more than penalty-box finishes, especially since the Nottingham Forest striker has failed to take his Premier League form to international level (just three goals in the qualifying). As Oceania's opponents (such as Fiji and New Caledonia) were predictably no match for the Kiwis, they could rely on a flat 4-3-3 and a steady flow of crosses, but the 2026 World Cup will demand a more cohesive, unadventurous approach, most likely a 4-2-3-1 with Wood linking play earlier.

"To be hosting the final draw again, after having been involved in this show 20 years ago in my home country, is truly extraordinary," said Klum, having previously taken part in the event ahead of the 2006 tournament in Germany. "The World Cup brings the world together like nothing else, and being part of that magic again, on an even bigger stage involving three host countries and 48 teams, is an incredible honor." "As someone who grew up playing football, getting to co-host the draw and meet and speak with World Cup legends at such a high-profile event is a dream," said Ramirez. "With this tournament coming to the United States, where I was born, and Mexico, where some of my roots lie, it is even more special – and I couldn't be more excited to be part of this show." The draw will take place from 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM ET and upon its conclusion, live coverage on FOX will continue until 3:00 PM ET providing instant analysis, reactions and interviews. FOX Sports' veteran sportscasters Rob Stone and Jenny Taft will anchor the network's on-site broadcast alongside former U.S. men's team stars and acclaimed analysts Alexi Lalas and Stu Holden.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cities and venues have been confirmed for the team's last pre-tournament matches, a high-caliber series featuring three of the world's top 10-teams in Belgium, Portugal and Germany. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad will use this elite slate to sharpen its form ahead of the tournament on home soil. All four matches will take place at stadiums that are home to NFL and MLS teams. As the new home of U.S. Soccer, Atlanta will host a pair of matches, beginning with USA-Belgium on March 28 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Kickoff against the eighth-ranked Belgian side is set for 3:30 p.m. Three days later, USA-Portugal, presented by Bank of America, kicks off at 7 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the match against the 6th-ranked Portuguese side to be shown live on TNT, TruTV, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock. Kickoff from the home of Charlotte FC is set for 3:30 p.m. To close out its World Cup preparation schedule, the USMNT will take on four-time World Cup champion Germany in the Coca-Cola Send-Off Match on June 6 at Soldier Field in Chicago.

These are incredible matches for the players and for the fans,” Pochettino said in a statement. Having finished third at the 2018 World Cup, the Red Devils will make their fourth straight World Cup appearance. Winners of Group J in UEFA qualifying, they are led by six-time English Premier League winner Kevin De Bruyne and Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who won the Golden Glove as the best goalkeeper at the 2018 World Cup. Four-time World Cup winners Germany will make its 21st appearance in the tournament, led by Arsenal forward Kai Havertz and Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala, with their most recent World Cup victory coming in 2014.
