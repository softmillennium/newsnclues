                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every year brings new projects that reshape how investors view the market for token presales. 2025 is already seeing strong activity, with fresh projects gaining attention among traders and gaming communities alike. One name rising quickly on the crypto presale list is Based Eggman ($GGs). Positioned within the best crypto presales to buy right now, it blends meme culture, gaming, and Web3 streaming into a single platform. As the search for the best crypto presale continues, $GGs shows how new token presales are not just about speculation but about building ecosystems where people play, stream, and trade. It is a utility-driven memecoin that supports multiple features, from live gaming integration to on-chain community events. With more than 38,490 USDT raised and over 4.8 million $GGs presale crypto tokens already sold at 0.006389 each, the project is gaining early traction. The ecosystem focuses on creating a space where players can game, stream, and trade in one environment. Based Eggman brings together social-fi, gaming, and trading through its native presale token. Users connect a Web3 wallet, fund it with supported assets, and select “Buy $GGs” to confirm. With this process, newcomers to token presales can join without unnecessary complications. Among the top crypto presales of 2025, Based Eggman has secured its place with consistent progress and a growing community. Its integration of Web3 gaming makes it different from many traditional presale crypto coins that rely solely on hype. While most crypto presales focus on trading, $GGs builds a digital ecosystem where streaming, gaming, and culture work together. Whales in the market often indicate where serious interest is moving, and many reports show XRP, ETH, and ADA capital rotating into new token presales like $GGs. For long-term investors, tracking whale moves has always been part of following crypto ICO presales. Based Eggman, now listed among the top presale crypto projects, is capturing this trend. As capital shifts from traditional assets to presale crypto coins, Based Eggman becomes part of a larger story about diversification and evolving interest in new token presale ecosystems. This rotation illustrates how pre sale cryptocurrency markets are drawing attention beyond speculation, toward projects with integrated utility. The market for presale cryptocurrencies continues to grow, with token presales becoming a defining part of crypto culture. Among the best crypto presales, Based Eggman ($GGs) has introduced a mix of gaming, streaming, and token utility that positions it differently from many projects. For those exploring crypto presales, $GGs highlights how a new presale coin can merge entertainment and technology. It is not just another presale crypto project but a sign that culture, creativity, and blockchain can operate in the same space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two digital art staffers were let go as part of the shake-up, which comes under the leadership of Christie's new CEO, Bonnie Brennan, who was appointed in February. A digital art specialist will stay on staff at Christie's, Now Media reports. Christie's went on to invest in the space further, launching its own NFT auction platform. Between 2021 and 2022, Christie's reported a 96 percent decline in NFT sales, as M.K. More recently, a 2024 report from NFTevening found that 96 percent of NFTs are effectively “dead,” or not valuable. The shuttering of Christie's digital art division comes two years after Sotheby's, another renowned auction house, laid off numerous employees in its NFT division, as ARTnews' Shanti Escalante-De Mattei and Angelica Villa reported in 2023. Weighing in on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, digital art adviser Fanny Lakoubay says Christie's decision is “probably tied to the current art market contraction.” “Auction houses can't justify a whole department when it brings in less revenue than the others (even with some recent successful sales),” Lakoubay adds. “Decline in value was driven by cooling at the top end,” the report stated, describing 2024 as “a year of continuing geopolitical tensions, economic volatility and trade fragmentation.” The Christie's news is “definitely not a great public signal,” Lakoubay writes. “But we should also remember: Auction houses only focus on secondary sales of already well-known artists and brands. It's still too early for that model to really work/scale with digital art.” Earlier this year, the auction house debuted a crypto real estate division, which allows buyers to purchase properties with digital currencies. Her work has appeared in NPR, Washington City Paper, DCist and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The revision strengthens expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut even though inflation is still elevated. Bitcoin may mirror gold's rally and regain momentum toward new highs in Q4. Total private hiring was overstated by 880,000 jobs, a scale of weakness not seen outside the Great Depression and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside August's weak 22,000-job gain, the data all but lock in a Federal Reserve rate cut at next week's meeting. Gold, the traditional store of value, has surged 40% this year, with gold miners nearly doubling returns, nearly 10 times that of the S&P 500. Investors have long bet that a weakening labor market would force the Fed to act, despite the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) back above 3% and growth near 3%. For Bitcoin, the implications may be even more powerful. Bitwise Strategist André Dragosch captured it succinctly in an X post, stating, Related: Nasdaq seeks access to Gemini's crypto services via investment: Report With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in eight days, it will mark the first cut in history with inflation still hot, stocks at record highs and GDP strong. That combination signals one thing: The central bank is prioritizing labor weakness over inflation, creating a “dovish but cautious” tone. Just as gold rallied months ahead of policy confirmation, Bitcoin's lean positioning and historical sensitivity to liquidity cycles could transform this rare policy mix into a powerful upside catalyst, potentially reviving momentum toward new highs in Q4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decentralized finance protocol Ethena ENA$0.8257 submitted Tuesday a proposal to issue Hyperliquid's upcoming stablecoin, joining a bidding race that has already attracted a slew of companies like Paxos, Sky, Frax and Agora. The token would be fully backed by Ethena's USDtb, a stablecoin issued with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and fully backed by BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund by asset management giant BlackRock and Securitize. "We are excited to enable Ethena's USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users," said Robert Mitchnick, Blackrock's head of digital assets, in the proposal. If adopted, Ethena pledged that 95% of net revenue from USDH reserves would flow back to the Hyperliquid ecosystem, the proposal said. Ethena also said it would cover the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs on Hyperliquid to USDH to ease adoption. The decentralized exchange executed almost $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume last month, making it an attractive market for stablecoin providers to corner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins may be on the cusp of an explosive move, as Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal shares a bullish outlook for the XRP-led TOTAL3 market cap. “You can't help but stare at this chart,” Pal shared in his X post today. Meanwhile, Pal highlighted its bullishness in his post today, particularly as it nears the upper resistance of an inverted descending triangle. It attempted to break out during the Trump-inspired late 2024 rally but succumbed to the resistance when it topped at $1.16 trillion in December. The TOTAL3 market cap broke out of a descending triangle at the time, sparking a rally from around $65 billion to November 2021's peak of $1.13 trillion. Notably, this break sent altcoins soaring, as capital shifted from Bitcoin and Ethereum to mid and low-cap tokens, sparking multiple new all-time highs. A similar outcome would finally usher in the long-awaited altseason, where other cryptocurrencies like XRP would dominate BTC and Ether. Since its peak at 66% in June, Bitcoin's market share has dropped 11.8%, with altcoin leader Ethereum leading the sector's rebound. After recovering over the last two weeks, Bitcoin's dominance has resumed its downtrend this week, further raising the enthusiasm that altcoins would continue to gain weight against the pioneering cryptocurrency. It currently trends at 58.20% and is on course for its third consecutive downtrend day. Notably, these converging factors align with Pal's earlier assertion that the market would see a similar rally from the 2017 bull cycle. He mentioned the weakening dollar as a catalyst, with the recently highlighted bullish chart development also fueling these sentiments. He shared this outlook in August, insisting that XRP will full port to unprecedented prices. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cboe Global Markets CBOE said on Tuesday it would launch so-called continuous futures for bitcoin and ether starting November 10, as the derivatives exchange looks to expand its crypto offerings. Exchanges have been pushing to expand digital asset offerings amid a more crypto-friendly environment under the Trump administration. While traditional futures contracts can require periodic rolling, Cboe's continuous futures are planned to be single, long-dated contracts with a 10-year expiration. That can help simplify position management for traders, according to the exchange. Futures contracts allow traders to bet or hedge against the future price of an asset, without owning it. Cboe's move would give U.S. traders an option to gain long-term market exposure to digital assets in a regulated framework. Cboe has been looking to expand its futures product suite, which includes its flagship Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures, to serve all types of market participants. The new product suite could help Cboe bolster its presence among the growing segment of retail traders seeking access to crypto derivatives. The long-dated crypto futures will be cleared through Cboe Clear U.S., a CFTC-regulated derivatives clearing firm. Select reference data provided by FactSet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is the US preparing a debt escape plan hidden as Putin's adviser suggests — one that could devalue trillions and force the world to adjust? During the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sep. 6, Anton Kobyakov, senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave a sharp view on how the U.S. may be attempting to manage its $35 trillion national debt. He claimed that Washington is exploring a strategy to transfer part of its liabilities into cryptocurrencies, specifically stablecoins, which he described as a kind of “crypto cloud.” In his view, such a move could allow the U.S. to devalue its obligations and trigger a rapid financial reset, once again pushing economic risk outward onto the global system. Kobyakov presented gold and digital currencies as increasingly viable alternatives to traditional government-backed money. He argued that these instruments could be used to ease domestic fiscal strain while reshaping the global financial order. Both episodes, he said, reshaped global monetary dynamics and shifted the costs of adjustment onto other nations. He also suggested that a similar transition today could unfold within 3 to 5 years. Let's try to understand what may be occurring behind the scenes and examine whether these claims stand up to the current realities of global finance. Historical records show that the U.S. has, at key moments, altered its monetary system in ways that allowed it to manage debt pressures without defaulting in formal terms. While domestic reasons such as deflation, reserve imbalances, or inflation control were cited as triggers, the outcomes frequently involved global ripple effects that supported U.S. solvency at the expense of creditors. Laws were passed to seize gold holdings, nullify gold-payment clauses in both public and private contracts, and revalue gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce. That change alone created nearly $2.8 billion in paper profits, which seeded the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, a vehicle used to influence currency markets with minimal Congressional oversight. These measures not only lifted domestic prices but also reduced the real weight of dollar-denominated debt, in part because contracts once tied to fixed gold weights were now settled in paper currency that had already declined in real terms. But in the 1960s, rising external liabilities and insufficient U.S. gold reserves created doubts about that commitment. In 1971, President Nixon suspended gold convertibility for foreign governments and imposed domestic price controls. In 1973, global currencies were no longer anchored to gold, and the dollar's value was now shaped by market forces rather than metal parity. These two episodes are widely studied for their effects on debt dynamics. That meant creditors holding fixed-rate claims, whether pension funds, savers, or foreign central banks, saw the real value of those assets shrink. In economic terms, the government reduced its debt burden through inflation and currency devaluation without missing a payment. Viewed from this perspective, Kobyakov's argument is not without precedent. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins and opening a new chapter in how crypto finance connects with government debt. Stablecoins must be backed fully by cash or short-term U.S. Treasuries; issuers must publish monthly reserve disclosures, follow anti-money laundering rules, and obtain direct federal licenses. Its passage comes at a time when stablecoin reserves are already becoming intertwined with the U.S. public debt market. That practice creates a direct link between crypto platforms and government funding. Crypto platforms are now tied into the short-term borrowing system Washington relies on to keep its financing running. Tether's most recent attestation showed holdings of more than $127 billion in Treasuries, an amount comparable to a mid-size sovereign nation's creditor position. Tether is based offshore and serves a global user base, so its inflows and redemptions follow international market conditions rather than U.S. domestic cycles. Sudden changes in activity can shift demand for Treasury bills and ripple into the broader market's liquidity. When inflation runs above those yields, the real value of debt shrinks over time. The burden is not eliminated but instead transferred onto global holders of tokenized cash, ranging from everyday users to large institutions in crypto markets. The pattern recalls earlier U.S. moves that reshaped debt repayment terms without outright default. Whether deliberate or emergent, the stablecoin structure now makes it possible to ease the real weight of federal debt while leaving existing contracts formally intact. China and Russia have expanded cross-border settlement in local currencies. That environment makes U.S. stablecoin legislation more complicated in its effects. In the past, monetary shifts were absorbed mainly by foreign governments or large institutional creditors. The concept of a “crypto cloud” does not remove debt from view. It spreads the consequences across a larger pool of holders, many of whom may not realize the part they play in carrying that burden. “US will drive its $35T debt into crypto”, Kremlin warns — reset or propaganda?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A closely watched technical setup is emerging across the altcoin market, and traders believe it could signal the start of a powerful new rally. Once the pattern completes, traders typically anticipate an acceleration in buying pressure. At present, the altcoin market cap (excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) sits around $1.09 trillion. Despite setbacks through 2022 and 2023, the recovery in 2024–2025 has brought valuations back into a range where technical patterns like this gain relevance. Historically, cup-and-handle setups have led to sustained bullish phases across both traditional equities and crypto markets. If the pattern confirms, a rally toward new highs would likely drive capital rotation from Bitcoin and Ethereum into mid- and lower-cap tokens. This could mirror past market cycles where altcoins dramatically outperformed once confidence returned. Global liquidity conditions, regulatory decisions, and macroeconomic pressures could disrupt the setup. But with sentiment slowly improving, the possibility of a $3 trillion altcoin market is becoming harder for traders to ignore. Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as traders point to historical patterns and on-chain signals that suggest a major rally could be brewing. Cboe Global Markets has unveiled plans to roll out Continuous futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) starting November 10, 2025, pending regulatory approval. Fresh analysis from Alphractal suggests that the momentum story for Bitcoin and Ethereum is starting to diverge. The GameFi sector delivered a mixed performance this week, with overall market cap steady at $18.79 billion while trading volume plunged 30.7% to $2.6 billion. Altcoins may be heading for deeper losses against Bitcoin, according to crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, who sees no signs of reversal in the broader trend. CoinShares, a prominent crypto asset management and research firm, reported a significant rebound in institutional investment last week, with millions of dollars flowing into altcoin products. Market dynamics are shifting, and these digital assets could reach unprecedented levels. Insights from advanced analysis point to certain coins that might reshape the crypto landscape. Investors and enthusiasts may find these emerging opportunities worth watching closely. After weeks of leading the charge, Bitcoin's dominance is showing cracks—creating space for altcoins to reemerge with strength. Altcoins have struggled to perform as expected in the current market cycle, raising questions about whether this period will follow the traditional altseason pattern. As November draws near, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about which digital coins could deliver astronomical returns. Many cryptocurrencies with real promise are stumbling over new regulations. Yet, an unexpected player in the meme coin arena might break through these barriers. Amazon shareholders are gearing up for a pivotal decision at their annual meeting next year: whether the company should explore incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into its corporate treasury. Amazon briefly sparked political controversy after exploring the idea of showing shoppers how tariffs are impacting product prices—a move that quickly drew fire from President Trump's team. A pastor from Washington state, Francier Obando Pinillo, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding over 1,500 people through a cryptocurrency scheme called Solano Fi. has introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, a landmark bill that seeks to modernize federal home loan underwriting by including digital assets in mortgage eligibility assessments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenSea committed $1 million to a flagship NFT reserve while teasing its SEA token launch, blending cultural preservation with new user rewards. Non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea has unveiled its first NFT reserve, pledging $1 million to digital art through a curated Flagship Collection. OpenSea said the initiative aims to showcase NFTs with lasting cultural relevance, not as a financial investment but as a “living museum” of digital art and innovation. The NFT platform also shared an update about its upcoming SEA Token Generation Event expected as early as next month. This story is an excerpt from the Unchained Daily newsletter.

Ethereum could trade as high as $250,000 if Bitcoin hits the widely predicted $1 million mark, according to financial research firm Fundstrat. Fundstrat investment chief Tom Lee shared a table on Tuesday outlining the firm's Ethereum price targets at various Bitcoin milestones. The table was based on ETH's historical value relative to BTC. According to the table, If Bitcoin reaches $1 million, Ethereum could range from $48,000, based on its eight-year average of 0.0479 BTC, to over $87,000 if ETH matches its 2021 high relative value of 0.0873 BTC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market thrives on both established coins and fresh token presales. Investors look for projects that mix stability with innovation, making it essential to track both sides of the spectrum. The best crypto presale to buy right now often combines culture with function, while altcoins like Ethereum and Avalanche deliver proven ecosystems. New crypto presale projects like Based Eggman $GGs bring a playful yet practical layer of gaming and community into the mix. Based Eggman $GGs positions itself at the center of crypto gaming and meme culture. It belongs to the category of new crypto token presales but adds deeper functionality than many presale coins. The token is used for gaming rewards, streaming integration, payments, and liquidity. Unlike many presale crypto tokens, $GGs directly embeds itself into culture, taking inspiration from the universal gaming phrase “Good Games.” This connection creates immediate recognition across communities. With a structured token supply and expansion plans across multiple blockchains, Based Eggman $GGs offers an example of how presale crypto projects can create ecosystems rather than isolated assets. Following the rally, ETH has corrected and now tests critical support levels. Institutional interest continues to fuel attention toward Ethereum, supported by record inflows into stablecoins and a strong developer base. Technical signals currently show a neutral-to-bearish bias, suggesting the market is waiting for clear direction. For those comparing crypto coins on presale with established leaders, Ethereum represents maturity and scale. Avalanche, trading in the mid-$24 range, is showing consolidation after a period of caution. The blockchain continues to see steady network growth and adoption, supported by institutional interest in its scaling capabilities. While short-term technicals highlight uncertainty, longer-term sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. When evaluating top presale crypto opportunities alongside altcoins, AVAX shows how emerging networks can build lasting ecosystems. Its position between growth and consolidation makes it a relevant asset to compare with cryptocurrency presales and new token presales entering the market. The balance between altcoins and token presales defines much of today's crypto conversation. Ethereum and Avalanche show how established ecosystems mature with steady development. Meanwhile, Based Eggman $GGs highlights how presale crypto projects use culture and gaming to create new communities. For investors, the best crypto presale to buy right now often depends on recognizing where innovation meets usability. Established assets provide resilience, while new crypto presale tokens deliver opportunities for early adoption. Risk Warning: Trading may result in the loss of your entire capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, a paper form of government bond was issued, which rapidly lost its value. Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless. But what appeared to be an inexhaustible source of value soon proves illusory. It is a tale which could well have parallels for digital currencies now. People use them despite not fully understanding how they work, sometimes to their financial loss. And history shows us that we should be wary of the idea that currency systems always change for the better, following some sort of natural evolutionary path. In fact, new currency systems don't always succeed, and even when they do, monetary regime change can be a long and arduous process. Coins and tokens were used more than 2,000 years ago, and continued through to the 19th century before paper finally dominated. Rather than a clean, irreversible shift from coins to notes, nations often alternated between the two systems. There were failed experiments with paper money in 14th-century China, 17th-century Sweden and 18th-century France, to mention just a few. Research on these problematic attempts suggests that social division also makes new currency shifts especially vulnerable. It was later abandoned due to mismanagement and misunderstanding, but had also served to sharpen political tensions between the patriots who supported it, and the loyalists to Britain, who detested it. The consequent extreme inflation coincided with intense social division and led to a period of political chaos. In 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, a paper form of government bond was issued, which rapidly lost its value. Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless. Britain fared slightly better, as I explore in my book The Age of Paper. But the paper-based regime came to a halt in 1819, a year of bitter class conflicts, which culminated in the Peterloo massacre, where at least 18 people were killed and hundreds wounded by the cavalry at a peaceful rally for democratic reform. The public had come to detest Bank of England notes, which became a symbol of economic depression and political oppression. Britain then followed the pattern of other nations, reverting to a traditional monetary system that rested on the solid value of precious metals. These cases of failed paper currencies – and there are many more – show that the general acceptance of currency ultimately requires shared values and social solidarity. It would otherwise be unlikely for a piece of paper to become a reliable means of payment and value. Once such shared values are lost, there is usually a downward cycle of currency depreciation. For cryptocurrencies exist only in the realm of blockchain technology. Even so, with Donald Trump's strong support, cryptocurrencies are enjoying a surge in popularity. This trend will undoubtedly be reinforced by further deregulation which means requirements for transparency will be relaxed, and safeguards for consumer protection weakened. But the combination of social division and rapid expansion may not be a positive sign for the future of cryptocurrency. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. But what appeared to be an inexhaustible source of value soon proves illusory. It is a tale which could well have parallels for digital currencies now. People use them despite not fully understanding how they work, sometimes to their financial loss. And history shows us that we should be wary of the idea that currency systems always change for the better, following some sort of natural evolutionary path. In fact, new currency systems don't always succeed, and even when they do, monetary regime change can be a long and arduous process. Coins and tokens were used more than 2,000 years ago, and continued through to the 19th century before paper finally dominated. Rather than a clean, irreversible shift from coins to notes, nations often alternated between the two systems. There were failed experiments with paper money in 14th-century China, 17th-century Sweden and 18th-century France, to mention just a few. Research on these problematic attempts suggests that social division also makes new currency shifts especially vulnerable. It was later abandoned due to mismanagement and misunderstanding, but had also served to sharpen political tensions between the patriots who supported it, and the loyalists to Britain, who detested it. The consequent extreme inflation coincided with intense social division and led to a period of political chaos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The iconic auction house is doing away with its dedicated NFT section as part of a larger strategy to blend digital and traditional art. This is all happening in a tough market where art sales have dropped by about 12% since 2024. Let's be honest, the NFT market has been a wild ride. At first, it was the shiny new thing, capturing both collectors' and investors' imaginations. Crazy record sales, everyone from 20-somethings to grandmas wanting in. Christie's move to close its NFT department is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle. What does this actually mean for the future of NFT sales? Fanny Lakoubay, a digital art adviser, thinks this is a response to the current market contraction, making it hard for auction houses to justify keeping separate departments when the revenue isn't matching that of traditional art. For artists and collectors, this raises questions about the sustainability of NFT sales moving forward. There's a clear need for solid business models that can handle volatility and changing consumer sentiment. Newer digital art platforms can learn a thing or two from Christie's experience. A hybrid business model that combines both physical and digital art sales could be the way to go. By investing in better digital infrastructure and partnerships, these platforms can create an engaging and accessible environment for collectors. That could bring a whole new level of transparency and trust to the table. As we look ahead, the future of NFT auctions might hinge on a few key trends and innovations. Hybrid auction formats that combine physical and online experiences could also help. This way, they can pull in both in-person and remote bidders. By analyzing bidder behavior and preferences, auction houses could tailor their marketing to identify potential high-value bidders, ultimately boosting engagement and sales. It shows that the market is changing, and digital art sales are becoming more integrated with traditional art. The future of this space will require all of us—artists, collectors, and auction houses—to adapt to new dynamics, hybrid models, and tech innovations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) whales have flipped bullish on the native token of decentralized perpetuals exchange Hyperliquid (HYPE), according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. Lookonchain says that four addresses have acquired HYPE tokens worth approximately $24.03 million within hours of each other. qianbaidu.eth bought 260,900 HYPE ($13 million) in the past 16 hours via 2 wallets. 0xe0f0 opened a long position of 136,906 HYPE ($6.9 million) in the past 6 hours. Entities interested in deploying the proposed USDH stablecoin will be required to submit proposals. The winner will be decided by Hyperliquid validators. Blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos Labs has already declared interest in issuing the USDH stablecoin. “Paxos will allocate 95% of interest from reserves backing USDH to buy back HYPE and redistribute it back to ecosystem initiatives, partners and users.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Capital flows in and out of securities markets, whether from or to external jurisdictions, would become instantaneous if these make use of e-rupee wallets—enabling wide compliance with the mandated speed of settlement, post transaction. Recently, the number of daily UPI transactions exceeded 700 million. This platform transfers funds from one bank account to another instantly, which suits  users who routinely access funds in their own accounts online, but not everyone. For India's vast migrant population, hailing from remote corners of the country where bank branches and automated cash dispensers are a rarity, UPI transfers are not enough. For them, e-rupee wallets in the hands—or rather, phones—of family members offer a cheap, quick and secure way to remit funds back home. Notably, welfare transfers could also be done this way. Delays in reaching the nearest cash dispenser, difficulty in using one and the risk of finding a machine out of notes to dispense—all such problems are overcome if money comes into a CBDC wallet in a handheld device. From this, payments could be made to bank accounts  or other wallets, including ones that change  e-rupees into paper cash. Government transfers to such wallets, meanwhile, would do away with middlemen. While this raises privacy concerns, it also offers an advantage in cases where authorities have a legitimate reason to track flows, such as benefit transfers for specific purposes and indirect tax payments. Input tax credit fraud in GST over the last five years has been estimated at almost  ₹1.8 trillion. Were all GST payments to be made with the e-rupee, such fraud would likely vanish. Since the destination of despatched goods—complete with details of their value, tax paid and consignee—would be available on the online ledger, there would be no need for e-way bills and physical stoppage of haulage for inspection. Given how CBDC technology permits ‘programmed' or preset flows  of money, it could ease tax compliance on the whole. And, as the long history of money has shown, tax mop-ups in a particular currency are an effective way to promote its wider use. We also have compelling reasons to use the e-rupee for cross-border flows—such as speed, security and cost savings. India is the world's largest recipient of remittances. The use of e-rupee wallets at both ends, with spot conversions, would make such transfers simple. What a CBDC in economy-wide use could imply for banking, both central and otherwise, needs some discussion. Let's stay at the front edge of its evolution.
