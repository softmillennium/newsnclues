Shell signed a 10-year natural gas supply agreement with Hungary's MVM CEEnergy on Sept. 9, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, according to Reuters.  

This is Budapest's largest and longest deal with a Western energy provider, though Szijjarto said Russian gas imports will continue.

Under the contract, Shell — the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader — will deliver around 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas annually to MVM starting in January 2026. The LNG will be shipped via Croatia's Krk terminal, regasified, and then delivered through the Hungary-Croatia pipeline.

Hungary consumes about 8 billion cubic meters of gas each year and remains the European Union's biggest buyer of Russian gas. Most EU countries have sharply reduced imports from Moscow following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Szijjarto welcomed the Shell contract, calling it "the largest volume and longest western supply contract ever." He made clear that Russian supplies, mainly via Gazprom (state-controlled Russian energy corporation) through the Turkstream pipeline, will not be replaced.

"With this, are we going to be able to live without Russian gas? No, because of geographical and infrastructural conditions," Szijjarto said. "Not until we have proper infrastructure development in the region."

Hungary has deepened purchases from Russia in recent years, importing some 5 billion cubic meters of gas via Turkstream by late August, according to Reuters. Szijjarto earlier this year rejected European Commission proposals to phase out Russian imports, aligning with Slovakia.

The new Shell deal builds on a six-year contract signed in 2020 that provided Hungary with 250 mcm of LNG annually between 2021 and 2027.

The agreement comes amid renewed tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over energy security.

Last month, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil facilities temporarily disrupted operations on the Druzhba pipeline, which delivers Russian crude directly to Hungary and Slovakia. The halt underscored Budapest's heavy reliance on Moscow for energy.

President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested on Aug. 24 the future of Druzhba could hinge on Hungary's stance toward Ukraine's bid to join the European Union, remarks that drew a sharp rebuke from Szijjarto.

"We urge Volodymyr Zelensky to stop threatening Hungary and to stop risking our energy security," Szijjarto said in response.  

Hungary has repeatedly opposed EU efforts to impose stricter sanctions on Russian energy and has threatened to block Kyiv's accession path to the bloc.

Under the contract, Shell — the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader — will deliver around 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas annually to MVM starting in January 2026. 



The arrest was the result of cooperation between Poland's Internal Security Agency (ABW) and its counterparts in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, Tomasz Siemoniak, the Minister Coordinator for Polish intelligence services, wrote on X.

The drones will be manufactured in the United Kingdom and delivered to Ukraine within the next 12 months, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey said

The Zapad-2025 (meaning "west" in Russian) drills, set to begin on Sept. 12 in Belarus and western Russia, have heightened alarm in NATO member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.

The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.

"Therefore it is vital that we use this window of opportunity that we have while Russia is bogged down in Ukraine to strengthen NATO's northern flank,"  Sweden's defense minister Pal Jonson said.



"We aim for 100% by October," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in reference to the 2 million pledged artillery shells.

According to the agency, Ukrainian forces destroyed a 48Ya6-K1 Podlet low-altitude radar and an RLM-M module from the 55Zh6M Nebo-M air defense complex. 

The contract, set to be signed on Sept. 10 and worth "hundreds of millions of euros," will see the first units delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year.

Three oil and gas pipelines in Russia were knocked out of service in a series of explosions on Sept. 8, a Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's plans could cost "years and a million people," or even "two or three million corpses" if Russia accelerates its offensive.

Raids by rival hives aren't rare after a dry, hot summer, but Christine McDonald was surprised to find her store besieged

A Canadian beekeeper has described fending off thousands of “robber bees” as they raided her shop in a brazen attempt to steal honey.

Christine McDonald, who owns Rushing River Apiaries in the British Columbia city of Terrace, said she entered her shop to find it overrun by the swarm.

“I think that's the most panicked I have felt … There's thousands of bees, I don't know where they're coming from, and I need to protect all of the honey,” she told CBC News.

Raids of rival hives are common after hot, dry summers, when a “nectar gap” emerges between spring blooms and autumn flowers. Larger bee colonies also need more food to collect and store.

“Fall beekeeping is very intense – trying to help bees hunker down against other bees and wasps and keep the food stores that they've worked so hard for,” said McDonald, who has previously seen raids on her outdoor hives – but never on her store.

Experts warn against attempting to stop a “robbing frenzy” and suggest covering hives with wet blankets to ward off invaders.

“When a hive is robbed, the invading bees kill bees and may even kill the queen. They tear open wax cells to get at the honey inside and can remove large amounts of honey very quickly,” said one beekeeping guide. “Worse, ripping open cells spreads the smell of honey far and wide, which attracts other invaders like wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets. These insects are even more aggressive, and will promptly kill off any bees left in the hive.”

McDonald says she avoided disaster by throwing a tarp over the equipment and products, but ended up “sacrificing her bathroom” in order to trap the invading bees.

By leaving the lights on in the room, she lured the bees away from their target. McDonald later scoured the shop in search of ingress points, discovering that the bees had entered through a gap in the door frame, which has since been sealed.

She said it took four or five days before the ravenous bees stopped trying to return to her shop.

“I think they've learned that, nope, there's no more food here,” she said. “We can't get in.”

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield say it is ‘not the Ben & Jerry's' they founded after being ‘silenced' by Unilever over matters of social justice

The co-founders of Ben & Jerry's have called for the ice-cream brand to be made independent and excluded from current owner Unilever's plans to list its ice-cream business on the stock market.

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield say The Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC), a new division of Unilever that is set to be separately listed in November and includes the brand founded by the pair in 1978 alongside Magnum, Cornetto and Wall's, “must free Ben & Jerry's” in an open letter to prospective investors and the group's board.

The pair, who no longer have a financial interest in Ben & Jerry's or any formal role, say they “feel compelled to speak out – as concerned individuals”.

“We are deeply concerned that the commitments made to us, our employees, and our customers are being eroded. For several years now the voice of Ben & Jerry's has been silenced by Unilever, particularly when the brand has tried to speak out about social justice and unjust wars. That is not the Ben & Jerry's that we founded, or the one that we envisioned when we agreed to join.”

The ice-cream company launched in Vermont in the US with a mission to “advance human rights and dignity”.

The letter says: “We believe that the founding values are central to what Ben & Jerry's is, and cannot simply be discarded out of convenience or under political pressure.”

Cohen added: “Ben & Jerry's was founded on a simple but radical premise: that our business could thrive and make outstanding products whilst standing up for progressive values.

“We fought to ensure our social justice mission was protected by Unilever when the company was acquired, but over the past several years, this has been eroded, and the company's voice has been muted. We won't be silent any more. Authenticity has always been at the very heart of what we do, and stripping this away risks destroying the very value of Ben & Jerry's. We urge the board and potential investors to rethink the inclusion of Ben & Jerry's in Magnum's future makeup and establish a Free Ben & Jerry's.”

A spokesperson for TMICC said: “Ben & Jerry's is a proud part of The Magnum Ice Cream Company and is not for sale. We remain committed to Ben & Jerry's unique three-part mission – product, economic and social – and look forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved business.”

The latest spat comes after a series of disagreements.

Last year, Ben & Jerry's social mission board, an entity that is independent from Unilever, launched legal action against Unilever, accusing its parent company of trying to block the ice-cream brand from making public statements supporting Palestinian refugees in the conflict in Gaza.

The lawsuit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle its board and sue directors over the issue.

Unilever has rejected the claims and said it would “defend our case very strongly”.

Ben & Jerry's has also clashed with its parent company over the sale of its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Unilever subsequently sold Ben & Jerry's Israel division to a local operation, prompting the ice-cream maker to sue its parent company before reaching a settlement.

            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard directed the National Security Agency in recent months to recall a classified report about Venezuela – despite agency staff affirming it was accurate and complied with all NSA policies – in a move that has raised major questions inside the intelligence community, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            The classified report related to Venezuela and one of President Donald Trump's special envoys, Richard Grenell, the people said. One of the people said it included conversations that Grenell had with Nicolas Maduro, the leader of Venezuela whom the US has accused of drug trafficking, as well as information about Grenell collected by the National Security Agency.
    


            After it was released, an unclassified addendum was added directing staff to “recall this report” at Gabbard's direction. The unclassified addendum was issued in April, according to the person familiar with the matter.
    


            “The report is accurate and in accordance with all NSA policy, directives, and guidance; however, the DNI directed NSA to recall the report,” the addendum said. “Please remove the original report from all manual and computer files.”
    


            Grenell, who multiple sources said is close with Gabbard, declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the White House and Gabbard's office for comment.
    


            A senior intelligence official told CNN that the report was withdrawn over concerns about protecting a person's civil liberties and privacy. The NSA report, the person said, made a person's identity obvious, although the substance of it was not embarrassing or derogatory. GOP officials have long raised concerns about “unmasking” people's identities in intelligence reports, feeling the common practice has been used to target and embarrass them by Democratic administrations.
    


            The official said that the White House ordered reduced distribution of Venezuela intelligence reporting a few weeks ago.
    


            NSA staff, though, were given no reason in the addendum for recalling the report. Updating is often a reason reports are retracted.
    


            One US official called the move “highly unusual,” noting that senior intelligence officials typically defer to each agency when it comes to recalling reports of this nature, especially when they involve US persons whose identity is masked.
    


            The report's recall was first reported by the New York Times.
    


            Gabbard, as director of national intelligence, is one of only a few senior policy makers who receive unredacted versions of these reports. A former official with knowledge of the process questioned why she recalled the intelligence product, rather than taking less intrusive action to limit who could access it.
    


            “If it was very sensitive, the usual method would be to increase the classification, which is still not the way it is supposed to be, but it is better than pretending a piece of intelligence doesn't exist,” the former official said.
    


            “Plus, the NSA is very rigorous about masking identity for US persons,” the official added, saying that the names of those individuals are typically hidden by default. Intelligence officials have to write a detailed justification, which receives multiple reviews, to get specific identities unmasked just for themselves in a report, they added.
    


            Grenell serves as a special envoy for Trump and has at times clashed with the State Department over attempts to release Americans from Venezuela. Shortly after Trump took office, Grenell visited Caracas to meet with Maduro. The surprise visit prompted speculation that the White House might be walking back the “maximum pressure” campaign against Maduro that it had previously pursued. Grenell returned to the US with six Americans the US had deemed illegally detained, and the White House celebrated their return.
    


            But the episode set up a clash between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long opposed giving any concessions to Maduro, and Grenell, who was pushing to make deals with the leader. In the months since the visit, the White House has made clear that it opposes Maduro.
    


            Gabbard fired the top two career officials leading the National Intelligence Council, which is the senior most analytical group in the intelligence community whose job it is to understand and assess the biggest threats facing the United States.
    


            The dismissals came shortly after the ODNI — which Gabbard leads — released a declassified assessment from the council about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that undercut the Trump administration's key argument for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations.
    


            Gabbard, when asked about the assessment at the time, blasted the media for “twisting and manipulating intelligence assessments to undermine the president's agenda to keep the American people safe.”
    


            Gabbard has vowed to root out what she has described as politicization of the intelligence community and launched a war on leaks to the media that critics say is hollowing out the intelligence community of needed expertise from experienced professionals.

            Two key figures in the Iran-Contra affair quietly married last month, nearly 40 years after the scandal rocked US politics and President Ronald Reagan's administration.
    


            Oliver North married his former secretary, Fawn Hall, on August 27 in Virginia, according to a copy of the marriage certificate obtained by CNN.
    


            Reached by phone Tuesday morning, North declined to comment, apart from quoting a line famously delivered by Clark Gable's character in “Gone with the Wind.”
    


            “Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,” he told CNN.
    


            North, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, was a National Security Council staffer when he gained attention for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. North was part of the twin schemes to sell weapons to Iran and then use proceeds to fund anti-communist rebels, known as the Contras, in Nicaragua.
    


            Hall, North's secretary, admitted to shredding damning documents related to the controversy. She snuck documents that possibly implicated North's involvement out of the White House by stuffing them in her clothing and shoes, and the two later overfed a paper shredder to the point of it jamming.
    


            After the intertwining scandals were revealed in 1986, those involved defended their actions as necessary to secure the release of American hostages in the Middle East and said they facilitated Reagan's anti-communist policy goals in Central and South America.
    


            But the sales ran afoul of legislation that limited US government assistance to the Contras, an arms embargo against Iran, and Reagan's previous assurances that the US would not negotiate with terrorists.
    


            North was convicted in 1989 on three felony charges, but the convictions were vacated shortly after. Hall was granted immunity from prosecution.
    


            News of the marriage was first reported by journalist Michael Isikoff for SpyTalk, a Substack publication focused on national security issues.
    


            After his convictions were vacated, North mounted an unsuccessful bid for a US Senate seat in Virginia in 1994 and went on to become a conservative political commentator. He was named president of the National Rifle Association in 2018 before leaving less than a year later amid a power struggle with the organization's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. His first wife, Betsy, died last year.



            Hall has largely stayed out of the public eye since the scandal. She was married to Danny Sugerman, manager of the rock band The Doors, from 1993 until his death in 2005.

The strike came as Hamas officials were in Qatar to discuss a ceasefire proposal put forth by the Trump administration.

Israel struck the capital of Qatar on Tuesday, targeting senior Hamas political officials as they gathered in Doha to discuss the latest ceasefire proposal put forth by the U.S.

Loud explosions were heard in the capital city, with pictures of smoke plumes rising. Israel took responsibility for the strikes, saying that they were targeting Hamas leaders.

“The [Israel Defense Forces] and [Israeli Security Agency] conducted a precise strike targeting the senior leadership of the Hamas terrorist organization,” the military said in a statement. “For years, these members of the Hamas leadership have led the terrorist organization's operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7 massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel.”

The number of casualties is currently unknown. A senior Hamas source told Al Jazeera that Khalil al-Hayya, the leader of Hamas's negotiating team, was not killed in the strike, though Saudi Arabian media put out a conflicting report. Israel has already assassinated Hamas leaders in Lebanon and Iran, as well as in Gaza.

The attack comes just as Hamas officials were meeting in Doha to discuss a ceasefire proposal put forth by the U.S. this weekend. A Hamas source told Al Jazeera that the strike specifically targeted the negotiation team. 

This is the first known time that Israel has struck Qatar — a key party in the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas — amid its genocide in Gaza. Just in the past month, Israel has struck at least five Arab countries: Palestine, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Qatar. On Monday, a Gaza-bound aid flotilla was struck by an aerial projectile in a Tunisian port, and activists have pointed the finger at Israel. 

Israel has also escalated its siege on Gaza City in recent weeks, and ordered an estimated 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City to evacuate on Tuesday.

The strike comes just after Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar claimed that Israel accepted the U.S. ceasefire proposal. Hamas officials had accepted a separate, similar ceasefire deal put forth by Qatar last month, that Israel never responded to.

Israel has been known to sabotage ceasefire deals just as they are reaching completion, effectively prolonging the genocide. Israeli officials have long said that their goal is to take over Gaza, and that they will stop at nothing to achieve this objective.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office claimed full responsibility for the strike in a statement on social media. “Today's action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility,” his office said.

However, Qatar is an ally of the U.S., and commentators have said it's unlikely that the strike would not be done in coordination with the U.S. Qatar hosts the largest military base in the Middle East, the regional headquarters of U.S. Central Command. 

The White House has thus far declined to comment. Israeli media reported that the strikes were approved by the Trump administration. Axios's Barak Ravid, citing a U.S. official, said that Israel only notified the U.S. of the strike right before it happened.

Qatar condemned the strike, saying that it targeted residential buildings where Hamas political officials were staying.

“This criminal assault constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qataris and residents in Qatar,” said Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majed Al Ansari. “While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

ICC hearing takes place in absence of Ugandan rebel leader accused of murder, rape, torture and sexual slavery

An international criminal court hearing into charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Ugandan fugitive rebel leader Joseph Kony has begun with accounts of atrocities allegedly committed by his Lord's Resistance Army.

The ICC's first in-absentia hearing will confirm charges but cannot progress to a trial in Kony's absence. The warlord faces 39 counts, including murder, rape, sexual slavery, enslavement and torture, allegedly committed in northern Uganda between July 2002 and December 2005.

From 1986, the LRA sought to overthrow Uganda's government, saying it wanted to establish a state based on the Bible's 10 commandments. By 2006, the UN estimated that 2 million people had been displaced. The LRA was then pushed into the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan and later the Central African Republic.

US special forces are among those who have tried and failed to find Kony. It is not known if the warlord is even still alive.

The victims “had no choice when they were forced to watch killings. They had no choice when they were made to kill. They had no choice when their bodies were turned into tools of war”, Sarah Pellet, a lawyer representing victims of the LRA, told the court in The Hague.

Pellet cited a woman forced to abandon her child: “The rebels shot at me, forcing me to throw my baby down to run for my life. I still do not know where my child is.”

An estimated 60,000 children were abducted by the LRA, many subjected to sexual violence. More than 100,000 people were killed.

Opening the prosecution case, the ICC deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said: “The social and cultural fabric of Uganda has been torn apart and they are struggling to recover.”

The court-appointed counsel for Kony argued the proceedings violated their client's fair trial rights and should not have been held at all. “The empty chair impacted the preparation of the defence,” the lawyer Peter Haynes said, pointing to the courtroom seat where Kony would have been if he were present.

Everlyn Ayo, 39, told Agence France-Presse how the LRA attacked her school when she was five years old: “The rebels raided the school, killed and cooked our teachers in big drums and we were forced to eat their remains … For many years now, I do not see well. All I see is blood.”

Richard Ochola, one of around 200 people who watched the hearing at Gulu secondary school in northern Uganda, criticised the process. “Watching the screen without seeing Kony's face is not satisfying at all. Our dream is to have Kony face trial, denying or confirming he killed people,” the 34-year-old farmer said.

“What we are watching at the moment is no different from watching a movie produced in a foreign country, because inside the courtroom there are no people we know or we can relate to our suffering.”

Legal experts said ICC prosecutors could use the case as a precedent for other high-profile suspects charged by the ICC and yet to face trial, including Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

“[Prosecutors] have their eyes in the long run on the possibility of using this procedure against Putin or Netanyahu if they continue to elude justice year after year,” Michael Scharf, an international law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told Reuters.

Willfully misinterpreting the Bible to justify what passes for “law and order” has only intensified in recent decades.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

It was a moment somewhat like this, 30 years ago, that turned me into a biblical scholar. In the lead-up to the passage of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, political and religious leaders quoted scripture to justify shutting down food programs and kicking mothers and their babies off public assistance. Those leaders, many of them self-described Christians, chose to ignore the majority of passages in the Bible that preached “good news” to the poor and promised freedom to those captive to injustice and oppression. Instead, they put forward unethical and ahistorical (mis)interpretations and (mis)appropriations of biblical texts to prop up American imperial power and punish the poor in the name of a warped morality.

Three decades later, the Trump administration and its theological apologists are working overtime, using Jesus's name and the Bible's contents in even more devastating rounds of immoral biblical (mis)references. In July, there was the viral video from the Department of Homeland Security, using the “Here I am, Lord. Send me” quotation from Isaiah — commonly cited when ordaining faith leaders and including explicit references to marginalized communities impacted by displacement and oppression — to recruit new agents for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, a job that now comes with a $50,000 signing bonus, thanks to Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's former pastor went even further in marrying the Bible to anti-immigrant hatred by saying, “Is the Bible in favor of these ICE raids?… The answer is yes.” He then added: “The Bible does not require wealthy Christian nations to self-immolate for the horrible crime of having a flourishing economy and way of life, all right? The Bible does not permit the civil magistrate to steal money from its citizens to pay for foreign nationals to come destroy our culture.”

A month earlier, during a speech announcing the bombing of Iran, President Trump exhorted God to bless America's bombs (being dropped on innocent families and children): “And in particular, God, I want to just say, we love you God, and we love our great military. Protect them. God bless the Middle East, God bless Israel, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.”

And in May, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Republican congressional representatives formed a prayer circle on the floor of the House as they prepared to codify the president's Big Beautiful Bill. Of course, that very bill threatens to cut off millions of Americans from life-saving food and healthcare. (Consider it a bizarre counterpoint to Jesus's feeding of the 5,000 and providing free health care to lepers.)

And if that weren't enough twisting of the Bible to bless the rich and admonish the poor, enter tech mogul Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir and the man behind the curtain of so much now going on in Washington. Though many Americans may be increasingly familiar with him, his various companies, and his political impact, many of us have missed the centrality of his version of Christianity and the enigmatic “religious” beliefs that go with it.

In Vanity Fair this spring, journalist Zoe Bernard emphasized the central role Thiel has already played in the Christianization of Silicon Valley: “I guarantee you,” one Christian entrepreneur told her, “there are people that are leveraging Christianity to get closer to Peter Thiel.”

Indeed, his theological beliefs grimly complement his political ones. “When you don't have a transcendent religious belief,” he said, “you end up just looking around at other people. And that is the problem with our atheist liberal world. It is just the madness of crowds.” Remember, this is the same Thiel who, in a 2009 essay, openly questioned the compatibility of democracy and freedom, advocating for a system where power would be concentrated among those with the expertise to drive “progress” — a new version of the survival of the fittest in the information age. Such a worldview couldn't contrast more strongly with the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus demonstrates his preferential option for the poor and his belief in bottom-up strategies rather than top down ones.

More recently, Thiel has positioned himself “right” in the middle of the Republican Party. He served as Trump's liaison to Silicon Valley in his first term. Since then, he has convened and supported a new cohort of conservatives (many of whom also claim a right-wing Christianity), including Vice President J.D. Vance, Trump's Director of Policy Planning Michael Anton, AI and crypto czar billionaire David Sacks, and Elon Musk, who spent a quarter of a billion dollars getting Trump elected the second time around. Thiel is also close to Curtis Yarvin, the fellow who “jokingly” claimed that American society no longer needs poor people and believes they should instead be turned into biofuel. (A worldview that simply couldn't be more incompatible with Christianity's core tenets.)

Particularly relevant to recent political (and ideological) developments, especially the military occupation of Washington, D.C., Thiel is also close to Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir and founder of the Cicero Institute, a right-wing think tank behind a coordinated attack on the homeless now sweeping the nation. That's right, there's a throughline from Peter Thiel to President Donald Trump's demand that “the homeless have to move out immediately… FAR from the Capital.” In July, Trump produced an executive order facilitating the removal of housing encampments in Washington, a year after the Supreme Court upheld a law making it a crime, if you don't have a home, to sleep or even breathe outside. And Thiel, Lonsdale, and the Cicero Institute aren't just responsible for those attacks on unhoused people and “blue cities”; they also bear responsibility for faith leaders being arrested and fined for their support of unhoused communities and their opposition, on religious grounds, to the mistreatment of the poor.

On top of this troubling mix of Christianity and billionaires, however, I find myself particularly chagrined that Thiel is offering an oversold four-part lecture series on the “antichrist” through a nonprofit called ACTS 17 collective that is to start in September in San Francisco. News stories about the ACTS 17 collective tend to focus on Christians organizing in Silicon Valley and the desire to put salvation through Jesus above personal success or charity for the poor. That sounds all too ominous, especially for those of us who take seriously the biblical command to stop depriving the poor of rights, to end poverty on earth (as it is in heaven), and defend the very people the Bible prioritizes.

For instance, Trae Stephens (who worked at Palantir and is partners with Thiel in a venture capital fund) is the husband of Michelle Stephens, the founder of the ACTS 17 collective. In an interview with Emma Goldberg of the New York Times, Michelle Stephens describes how “we are always taught as Christians to serve the meek, the lowly, the marginalized… I think we've realized that, if anything, the rich, the wealthy, the powerful need Jesus just as much.”

In an article at the Denison Forum, she's even more specific about her biblical and theological interpretation of poverty and the need to care for those with more rather than the poor. She writes, “Those who see Christ's message to the poor and needy as the central pillar of the gospel make a similar mistake. While social justice movements have done a great deal to point out our society's longstanding sins and call believers to action, it can be tempting for that message to become more prominent than our innate need for Jesus to save us.” Such a statement reminds me of the decades-long theological pushback I lived through even before the passage of welfare reform and the continued juxtaposition of Jesus and justice since.

Of course, such a battle for the Bible is anything but new in America. It reaches back long before the rise of a new brand of Christianity in Silicon Valley. In the 1700s and 1800s, slaveholders quoted the book of Philemon and lines from St. Paul's epistles to claim that slavery had been ordained by God, while ripping the pages of Exodus from bibles they gave to the enslaved. During the Gilded Age of the nineteenth century, churches and politicians alike preached what was called a “prosperity gospel” that extolled the virtues of industrial capitalism. Decades later, segregationists continued to use stray biblical verses to rubber-stamp Jim Crow practices, while the Moral Majority, founded in 1979 by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell, Sr., helped mainstream a new generation of Christian extremists in national politics.

Over the past decades, the use of the Bible to justify what passes for “law and order” (and the punishing of the poor) has only intensified. In Donald Trump's first term, Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their families at the border with a passage from the Apostle Paul's epistle to the Romans: “I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order. Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders summed up the same idea soon after in this way: “It is very biblical to enforce the law.” And in his first speech as speaker of the House, Mike Johnson told his colleagues, “I believe that Scripture, the Bible, is very clear: that God is the one who raises up those in authority,” an echo of the New Testament's Epistle to the Romans, in which Paul writes that “the authorities that exist are appointed by God.”

Over the past several years, Republican politicians and religious leaders have continued to use biblical references to punish the poor, quoting texts to justify cutting people off from healthcare and food assistance. A galling example came when Representative Jodey Arrington (R-TX), rebutting a Jewish activist who referenced a commandment in Leviticus to feed the hungry, quoted 2 Thessalonians to justify increasing work requirements for people qualifying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And that was just one of many Republican attacks on the low-income food assistance program amid myriad attempts to shred the social welfare system in the lead-up to President Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” the largest transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top in American history and a crowning achievement of Russell Vought's Project 2025. Arrington said: “But there's also, you know, in the Scripture, tells us in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3:10 he says, uh, ‘For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: if a man will not work, he shall not eat.' And then he goes on to say ‘We hear that some among you are idle'… I think it's a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements.”

And Arrington has been anything but alone. The same passage, in fact, had already been used by Representatives Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Stephen Lee Fincher (R-TN) to justify cutting food stamps during a debate over an earlier farm bill. And Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) used similarly religious language, categorizing people as deserving and undeserving, to argue against a healthcare plan that protects those of us with pre-existing conditions. He insisted that only “people who lead good lives” and “have done the things to keep their bodies healthy” should receive reduced costs for health care.

Such “Christian” politicians regularly misuse Biblical passages to blame the impoverished for their poverty. There is never a suggestion, of course, that the rich, who have functionally stolen people's wages and engorged themselves by denying them healthcare, are in any way to blame.

Such interpretations of biblical texts are damaging to everyone's lives (except, of course, the superrich), but especially the poor. And — though you wouldn't know it from such Republicans — they are counter to the main themes of the Bible's texts. The whole of the Christian Bible, starting with Genesis and ending with the Book of Revelation, has an arc of justice to it. The historical equivalents of anti-poverty programs run through it all.

That arc starts in the Book of Exodus with manna (bread) that shows up day after day, so no one has too much or too little. This is a likely response to the Egyptian Pharaoh setting up a system where a few religious and political leaders amassed great wealth at the expense of the people. God's plan, on the other hand, was for society to be organized around meeting the needs of all people, including describing how political and religious leaders are supposed to release slaves, forgive debts, pay people what they deserve, and distribute funds to the needy. The biblical arc of justice then continues through the prophets who insist that the way to love and honor God is to promote programs that uplift the poor and marginalized, while decrying those with power who cloak oppression in religious terms and heretical versions of Christian theology.

My own political and moral roots are in the welfare rights and homeless union survival movements, efforts led by poor and dispossessed people organizing a “new underground railroad” and challenging Christianity to talk the talk and walk the walk of Christ. Such a conviction was captured by Reverend Yvonne Delk at the 1992 “Up and Out of Poverty Survival Summit,” when she declared that society, including the church, must move to the position that “poor people are not sinners, but poverty is a sin against God that could and should be ended.”

Delk's words echo others from 20 years earlier. In 1972, Beulah Sanders, a leader of the National Welfare Rights Organization, the largest organization of poor people in the 1960s and 1970s, spoke to the National Council of Churches. “I represent all of those poor people who are on welfare and many who are not,” she said, “people who believe in the Christian way of life… people whose nickels and dimes and quarters have built the Christian churches of America. Because we believe in Christianity, we have continued to support the Christian churches… We call upon you… to join with us in the National Welfare Rights Organization. We ask for your moral, personal, and financial support in this battle for bread, dignity, and justice for all of our people. If we fail in our struggle, Christianity will have failed.”

In a Trumpian world, where Christian extremism is becoming the norm, we must not let the words of Beulah Sanders be forgotten or the worst fears of countless prophets and freedom fighters come true. Rather, we must build the strength to make a theological and spiritual vision of everybody-in-nobody-out a reality and create the capacity, powered by faith, to make it so. Now is the time. May we make it so.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Editor's note: The article was updated with comments by U.S. President Donald Trump.

A 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 22, The Charlotte Observer reported.

The incident occurred at 9:55 p.m. while the victim, Iryna Zarutska, was on a train at the South End light rail station.

Zarutska had fled Kyiv in 2022 seeking safety from Russia's full-scale invasion, and was described by family members as hoping for a new beginning.

“This is an irreparable loss for her family,” a GoFundMe campaign started by Zarutska's aunt states.

Police arrested 34-year-old Decarlos Brown at the scene and charged him with first-degree murder.

Brown's criminal record showed a long history of arrests dating back to 2011, with 14 prior court cases and a six-year North Carolina prison sentence for convictions including robbery with a dangerous weapon.

Court records show Brown displayed signs of mental illness earlier this year, and his public defender has filed a motion questioning his competency to stand trial.

U.S. President Donald Trump called the attack "horrible" when asked about the case by reporters on Sept. 7, adding he would "know all about it tomorrow morning." 

In a subsequent statement the following day, Trump called Zarutska a "beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious war in Ukraine" before she was attacked by a "mentally deranged lunatic."

In a post on Truth Social, Trump used the attack to denounce the "mainstream media" and his political opponents in the Democratic Party and said only the Republicans can deliver "law and order" in North Carolina and "every state."

This incident comes just weeks after a 16-year-old Ukrainian refugee was fatally pushed in front of a freight train in Friedland, Germany, on Aug. 11.

The drones will be manufactured in the United Kingdom and delivered to Ukraine within the next 12 months, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey said

The Zapad-2025 (meaning "west" in Russian) drills, set to begin on Sept. 12 in Belarus and western Russia, have heightened alarm in NATO member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.

The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.

"Therefore it is vital that we use this window of opportunity that we have while Russia is bogged down in Ukraine to strengthen NATO's northern flank,"  Sweden's defense minister Pal Jonson said.



"We aim for 100% by October," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in reference to the 2 million pledged artillery shells.

According to the agency, Ukrainian forces destroyed a 48Ya6-K1 Podlet low-altitude radar and an RLM-M module from the 55Zh6M Nebo-M air defense complex. 

The contract, set to be signed on Sept. 10 and worth "hundreds of millions of euros," will see the first units delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year.

Three oil and gas pipelines in Russia were knocked out of service in a series of explosions on Sept. 8, a Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's plans could cost "years and a million people," or even "two or three million corpses" if Russia accelerates its offensive.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki said that a country cannot join NATO while at war and that "today's discussion about Ukraine's membership in the European Union is premature."

The attack may have coincided with Russian President Vladimir Putin's working visit to the city. According to the Kremlin, Putin joined the BRICS summit online from Sochi on Sept. 8.

Alexey Sinitsyn, CEO of potash producer K-Potash Service, was found dead near Kaliningrad.

"That's the only conceivable way to move Putin from his current calculations... get him to compromise and to agree to a ceasefire," former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 84 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses downing 60.

TUNIS, September 9. /TASS/. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak proposed to new Syrian authorities to resume the work of the intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation at an extended meeting of the Russian delegation with Syrian officials in Damascus. The video was published by the Syrian state TV channel Al Ikhbariya.

"We propose to resume the work of the intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation, which has proven itself to be a good tool for expanding our relations, primarily in the economic area," he said.

"We are also discussing practical possibilities for providing assistance to Syria together with our partners in the region, with Qatar in particular, in terms of humanitarian supplies and the restoration of the energy sector," Novak added. "We confirm our readiness to launch a number of projects aimed at providing Syria with food, fuel, and pharmaceutical products both on a commercial basis and as part of humanitarian aid," he said.

 What America Must Do to Meet Surging Demand

 Brian Deese and Lisa Hansmann

The United States faces an energy crunch of historic proportions. After nearly 20 years of flat demand, electricity use is now growing at its fastest rate since World War II. The U.S. economy increasingly relies on electricity to heat and cool homes, to power businesses and factories, and to propel cars, trucks, and buses. New manufacturing facilities, such as those making semiconductors, and the data centers that undergird the country's artificial intelligence ambitions consume unprecedented amounts of electricity. In total, over the next decade, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the independent regulator tasked with monitoring grid reliability, projects that national peak electricity demand will increase 18 percent from today's levels—nearly the equivalent of adding the total current demand of California, New York, and Texas combined.

The surge in electricity demand is not inherently a problem. It reflects the technology-fueled progress that electrification can deliver. But rising demand is already starting to drive up electricity prices and push the grid to its limits. Without rapid action, consumers will pay more, businesses will be less competitive, and the country will risk losing its lead in technological innovation and advanced manufacturing.

Although the United States must build new power plants, these alone cannot produce enough electricity fast enough to meet skyrocketing demand. Another solution, however, is readily available: squeezing more out of the existing electric system. U.S. energy infrastructure has much more to give. On average, roughly half the electric infrastructure in the United States sits idle at any point in time. This is because the U.S. electric system was engineered for moments of intense demand—the rare episodes of extreme heat or cold when the need for electricity peaks—not for delivering power to consumers in the cheapest and most efficient way. What has resulted is a system full of inefficiencies and lost potential.

The technology to get more out of the system already exists. Batteries can store excess power, sensors can boost how much electricity moves across wires, and software can aggregate distributed energy sources in homes and buildings and make them work together like power plants. Utilities, energy companies, and grid operators need to shift their focus from maximizing energy output to prioritizing improvements that will lower prices and increase reliability for consumers. In the face of rising prices and mounting macroeconomic stress, policymakers and energy players need to meet the political moment by adopting simple, straightforward reforms to utilities and energy markets that will benefit both individual consumers and the broader economy.

For decades, the United States enjoyed a relative energy advantage. Electricity prices for industrial users ran at roughly half those for European competitors, and American households and businesses benefited from the United States' vast energy resources.

The massive spike in demand for electricity, however, is rapidly driving up energy prices across the United States. Retail electricity prices in 2025 have increased at nearly twice the rate of overall inflation. In the first half of the year, utilities requested or received approval for a record $29 billion in rate increases, which means consumers will face higher electricity bills in the coming years. PJM, the regional grid operator serving customers from Michigan to Virginia, announced that the 67 million Americans in its region would see their electricity bills rise by up to 20 to 30 percent next year. Consumers are already feeling the pain: in an April survey run by PowerLines, a consumer education nonprofit, two out of three Americans indicated that utility bills are a source of financial stress.



As prices are increasing, reliability is faltering. U.S. power markets are failing to hold enough spare power to prevent blackouts when demand surges, such as on very hot or cold days. This year, nine out of 13 power markets in the United States are expected to fall below a critical reliability threshold, which marks the level at which the supply of spare power is considered sufficient to avoid outages.



This combination of higher prices and lower reliability poses a direct threat to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. The global economy is entering an era in which a few new or rapidly growing high-tech industries, including AI, innovative energy technologies, and cutting-edge semiconductors, will drive economic growth. Leading the world in these sectors requires an electric system that can power them. China, the main U.S. competitor in many of these fields, has poured money into electricity generation as part of a long-term plan to power more of its economy with electricity.

The good news is that the United States added nearly 50 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024, the highest amount in more than two decades. But even at this record pace, supply from new power generation alone cannot keep up with rising demand because of supply chain constraints and regulatory bottlenecks. New natural gas plants are being delayed until the 2030s because of a 50-month backlog for natural gas turbines, and new nuclear power plants can take more than a decade to get off the ground. Renewables are cheaper and faster to deploy, but securing the permits for large-scale facilities and transmission can take years. And the interconnection queue—the waiting line for power sources to get approval to connect to the grid—has swelled to 2,600 gigawatts, or twice the size of the current grid. Washington's recent tax and spending law, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, also raises costs by curtailing federal incentives for new sources of renewable power.

The United States can meet staggering demand, however, without technological moonshots, long time horizons, or hefty price tags. This is because even modest improvements in the use of the existing energy infrastructure can yield huge gains. A five percentage point boost in the use of the country's existing electric infrastructure would unlock the electric equivalent of roughly 60 new natural gas power plants.

Although increasing the efficiency of the existing infrastructure may seem obvious, it is the opposite of how the system has been designed up to this point. In the twentieth century, with limited energy generation technologies and few ways to easily improve efficiency, the goal was to build as many new power plants as possible. Policymakers rewarded utilities, which have a regional monopoly over electricity and whose profits are determined by regulators, on the basis of how much new capital they deployed rather than how well the system performed. Over the past two decades, energy developers have also largely adopted an install-and-forget approach: maximizing upfront capital investments while ignoring the expense of ongoing servicing and maintenance.

The result is a system that is both underused and underperforming. Data from the Federal Reserve indicate that the percent of electricity generation resources in use on average has declined by ten percentage points over the last decade. Performance has deteriorated as well: outages increased by 60 percent from 2013 to 2023.

The electric system is underperforming because utilities and energy companies don't get rewarded for making the existing system operate more efficiently or adopting new technologies that could render outdated systems obsolete. Instead, utilities are paid to figure out how to profit from building a new power plant, not how to adopt the cheapest, most efficient solution. But when policymakers change incentives and remove regulatory barriers for utilities and energy companies to adopt better technology, electric systems work better. Texas is an example of how to get this right.

Since 2021, electricity demand in Texas has grown nearly 20 percent because of record population growth, an influx of energy-intensive manufacturing, and the construction of new data centers. Peak energy demand in the state could double by the end of the decade.

Yet despite this growth, Texas is not facing an energy crisis. Electricity prices are falling, and grid reliability is increasing. Texas has chosen “all of the above” when it comes to strategies to boost electric capacity. This includes connecting new power plants to the grid quickly; installing batteries to store more of the resulting cheap, clean electricity and then releasing it to the grid when demand spikes; and requiring new large-scale electricity users to operate flexibly when connecting to the grid so that the system takes full advantage of its existing capacity without stretching beyond its breaking point. Texas is projected to have the lowest wholesale electricity prices of any market in the country in 2025, and the state has had no blackouts so far this summer.



Unlike other operators that force new power generators to wait years before they can plug into the grid, Texas's grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, uses a “connect and manage” model that connects new plants to the grid and then handles congestion by managing their operations in real time. As a result, Texas integrates new power sources into the grid more quickly than any other region in the United States. ERCOT processes the interconnection requests for new power to connect to the existing grid at nearly twice the speed of some of its peers. Between 2021 and 2023, the state added at least 70 percent more capacity than any other market, almost all of it cheap, clean energy. Since 2021, Texas has added nearly 40 gigawatts of new clean power generation, enough to comfortably power all of New York State.

Texas is also the fastest-growing market for energy storage: last year, the state deployed more new battery capacity than California—enough to power around three million homes. Texas now has more than 12 gigawatts of battery capacity, which can soak up the glut of cheap solar and wind energy produced during the day and discharge it to consumers when the sun sets.

Texas has realized that using electricity at different times can be as efficient as adding new power. In addition to expanding its battery capacity, earlier this year the Texas state legislature passed a bipartisan law, Senate Bill 6, that allows Texas's grid operator to encourage data centers and other large energy consumers to shift their power use in moments of extreme demand—or, if necessary, to order them to do so. This program could free up to 15 gigawatts of capacity, equivalent to nearly the total demand of Houston. At a national level, estimates have shown that if power-hungry consumers such as data centers shift when they consume energy just a quarter of one percent of the time, it could increase the United States' effective production capacity by ten percent without building new infrastructure.

In addition to the strategies being deployed in Texas, another way to add capacity is to unlock the energy systems that already sit in homes and businesses across the country. Millions of generators, solar panels, batteries, and heating and cooling systems in homes and businesses produce, store, or consume energy. When utilities connect these systems to one another and operate them in concert, they can act like a power plant built from technology rather than steel and concrete.

The idea of a distributed power plant is not new. Starting in the 1970s, when the United States faced a wave of energy crises, utilities in states such as New Hampshire used phone calls and physical switches to coordinate thousands of water heaters to manage electricity demand. Today, basic communications technology such as WiFi and Bluetooth make connecting these assets even easier. Integrating them into the grid is far faster and cheaper than building a new physical power plant because these systems are already in place and paid for.

Studies have shown that a basic distributed power plant can deliver electricity 40 percent more cheaply than a conventional natural gas plant. In New York, the energy company ConEdison's $200 million investment to tap into distributed energy sources allowed it to bypass $1.2 billion in physical infrastructure upgrades. These savings protect consumers from rate increases by avoiding the need for physical improvements to local poles, wires, and substations, which have been the single largest contributor to higher electricity rates in the United States in the last decade. Projections by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that scaling distributed power plants could meet 100 percent of the projected growth in national electricity demand by 2030.

Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it. But construction of transmission is stagnating: the construction of high-voltage transmission lines has fallen from an average of 1,700 miles built per year between 2010 and 2014 to only 55 miles built in 2023. The resulting grid congestion raised consumers' electricity bills in the United States by $11.5 billion in 2023.

Beyond building more transmission lines, increasing the transmission capacity of existing infrastructure with new and proven technologies can save billions of dollars in electricity costs each year. Advanced conductors allow wires to carry twice as much electricity as in the past. Sensors and software installed in wires can adjust electricity flows, which can add 20 percent or more additional capacity by enabling wires to safely carry more electricity when weather conditions allow. These upgrades do not require the same permitting process as new construction, meaning they can be deployed in months, not years, at a fraction of the cost.

Advanced transmission technologies have existed for decades and have been widely adopted in countries around the world. Real-world trials show they can be successful in the United States, too. One recent deployment of grid sensors in Indiana and Ohio took only nine months to install, increased capacity by more than 50 percent, and cost just one percent of the price of building new transmission lines. Other states are also beginning to see the potential of these new technologies. In Montana, for instance, the state legislature unanimously passed a law to incentivize utilities to install advanced conductors.

The looming energy crisis requires federal, regional, and state policymakers to embrace reforms that put consumers first and let efficient solutions win. In Washington, the agency tasked with overseeing the United States' electric system, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has for years asked utilities and grid operators to consider reforms to boost efficiency and upgrade their technology. When utilities and grid operators push back, FERC generally relents. In January, for instance, FERC granted a grid operator's request to delay until 2030 rules requiring it to allow distributed energy systems to participate in electricity markets.

Today's electricity supply crunch offers a perfect moment to break the cycle. FERC should use its rule-making power to make interconnection reforms mandatory, provide clear timelines for upgrades, and levy harsh penalties for underperformance to ensure that capacity grows everywhere as quickly as it has in Texas. It should require that reforms put storage and distributed energy systems on a level playing field with physical power plants to determine which sources produce power at the lowest cost. FERC should also aggressively encourage grid planners to upgrade wires and transmission technology. Policymakers and utilities alike have stalled for too long and claimed reforms are too hard, but in the face of skyrocketing demand, such excuses ring hollow.

Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about efficiency, it is unfortunately pursuing a regulatory approach that increases uncertainty and reduces investment. Reforming the electric system, however, is precisely where the executive branch should embrace the impulse to break through the bureaucratic hurdles holding back reform.



State policymakers also have an important role to play because state public utility commissions set many of the policies that govern utilities. For decades, the public has not paid attention to these institutions; this has empowered some utilities and their lobbyists to stymie attempts at reform. Facing rising prices, both state policymakers and citizens can no longer ignore these institutions. Public utility commissions—and the legislatures that oversee them—should pay utilities for better performance and hold them accountable for rising electricity prices.

In New Jersey, where electricity rates for households have increased by up to 20 percent this year, both Democratic and Republican candidates in the governor's race have centered their campaigns on rising energy costs. Governors in other mid-Atlantic states, in which prices are rising because of constraints on new sources of power generation, are calling for interconnection reforms similar to those in Texas that allow projects to connect to the grid quickly. And just this month, Mike Braun, the governor of Indiana, appointed a new Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents consumer interests against investor-owned utilities, and directed her to evaluate utilities' profits to lower rates in the state.

These reforms will help Americans as workers and consumers. Squeezing more value out of existing energy systems requires investing in the skilled tradespeople who can improve them. Upgrading energy infrastructure is labor-intensive, technical work that relies on electricians, line workers, HVAC technicians, and power engineers, not software alone. Solar and wind technicians are now the two fastest-growing occupations in the entire economy, projected to grow by about 50 percent over the next decade. And research has shown that skilled field trades like those that service the electric system stand to be augmented, not replaced, by artificial intelligence tools such as predictive maintenance and remote diagnostics.

In politics, solutions are never cheap or easy. But when it comes to energy, a set of solutions are at hand that can deliver cheaper and more reliable power right now. If policymakers, utilities, and energy companies optimize the resources available and focus on getting more from the existing system, they can lower electricity bills for consumers and prepare the country to be at the forefront of the next wave of innovation. With the right incentives, the United States can turn an energy crunch into a competitive advantage.

“No society can survive when one man becomes a trillionaire while the working class struggles to survive,” he said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has denounced a plan by Tesla's board to grant its CEO, Elon Musk, a compensation package worth $975 billion, which would make him the world's first trillionaire.

On Friday, Tesla's board submitted a filing proposing a plan that would grant Musk over 423 million shares if Tesla hits $8.5 trillion in total value by 2035 — up from the company's current value of roughly $1.1 trillion. 

Those shares, worth $143 billion today, would bring Musk's stake in the company to a staggering 29 percent.

As the richest man in the world, Musk is currently worth $435 billion. This compensation package would cause his wealth to skyrocket, and would amount to nearly an entire percentage point of the total U.S. household wealth combined.

“Another $900 billion for Elon Musk, while 60% live paycheck to paycheck? Really?” said Sanders in a post on social media on Monday.

“This is not only grossly immoral. It is insane economics,” he went on. “No society can survive when one man becomes a trillionaire while the working class struggles to survive. This cannot stand.”

Indeed, the wealth gap in the U.S. is growing rapidly. A recent Oxfam report found that global billionaire wealth has soared by over $6 trillion since 2015. And a RAND analysis found this spring that $79 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90 percent of Americans to the top 1 percent over the past 50 years.

Everyday Americans are struggling. A Bankrate survey found in January that roughly 6 in 10 Americans say they couldn't afford an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.

Meanwhile, the economy is in a downturn. On the same day of the Tesla board's filing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing extremely low hiring numbers in August, with only 22,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent — the highest since the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The numbers are reflective of a volatile economy, experts said, with CNN noting that “job growth is practically nonexistent.”

Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act will make it even harder for everyday Americans to survive, representing one of the largest redistributions of wealth in a single piece of legislation in modern history. The bill will kick millions off of their health insurance, and will sap $1,600 from the poorest 10 percent of households while giving the richest 10 percent of households an extra $12,000 yearly, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Musk is personally responsible for much of the current economic downward spiral. U.S. companies recently announced plans for a record amount of layoffs, citing “Department of Government Efficiency” actions.

DOGE has already had a sweeping impact, accounting for nearly half of layoffs across the country in just the first few months of Trump's presidency. Hundreds of thousands were directly laid off, while the rogue group's cuts to research are threatening hundreds of thousands more jobs that are supported by federal grants.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

MOSCOW, September 9. /TASS/. Russia resolutely condemns Western attempts to remove Milorad Dodik, the president of Republika Srpska, from office, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference following talks with Dodik.

"We strongly condemn attempts to oust Serbian leaders, those not aligned with the West, by fabricating charges against them. I mean our vis-a-vis, our friend and the legitimate president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik," Russia's top diplomat said.

Lavrov said he was outraged to see Dodik the victim of these attempts. "And the `crime' as per Mr. Schmidt (German Cristian Schmidt, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina - TASS) is that Mr. Dodik has disobeyed Mr. Schmidt's orders and decisions," he explained. "It's hard to imagine that in a normal law-governed state, a self-appointed gauleiter, talking about Germany, would actually try and usurp power in a sovereign state whose rights were very clearly outlined in UN Security Council decisions," Lavrov added.

On August 28, the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina scheduled early presidential elections in the Republika Srpska for November 23. This was preceded by the commission's decision to terminate Dodik's powers in the wake of his being found guilty of ignoring Schmidt's decisions. In response, the president announced that a referendum on confidence in the republic's leadership would be held on October 25.

Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE-T is looking to trim down its refining business with a $1.9-billion deal to sell half interests in two U.S. refineries to joint-venture partner Phillips 66 PSX-N. 

“This transaction aligns with our strategy of owning and operating the assets that are core to our business,” Cenovus chief executive Jon McKenzie said in a news release Tuesday. 

After the sale of its 50 per cent stake in WRB Refining LP, Cenovus will have a refining business comprised of assets that it controls and are well integrated with its vast oilsands operations in Alberta, McKenzie said. 

“The proceeds from this transaction will allow us to accelerate shareholder returns over the near term,” McKenzie said. 

Strathcona boosts bid for MEG Energy to top Cenovus offer

The operations in Wood River, Ill., and Borger, Texas, can churn out 495,000 barrels per day, 247,500 of which belong to Cenovus. 

Once the deal is complete, Cenovus said its downstream business will have total crude throughput capacity of 472,800 barrels per day. The business still includes a refinery and oilsands upgrader in Lloydminster, on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, as well as two refineries in Ohio and one in Wisconsin. 

The deal is expected to close around the end of the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.

Cenovus shares rose about 2.6 per cent to $22.70 in late morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

The refinery deal comes as Cenovus looks to take over its smaller oilsands peer MEG Energy Inc. MEG-T with a cash-and-stock offer worth almost $8-billion including debt. The two companies have side-by-side operations at Christina Lake, south of Fort McMurray, Alta., and have touted the cost savings and efficiencies that could be achieved by joining forces. 

MEG has agreed to the friendly Cenovus offer, but still faces a hostile all-stock bid from fellow oilsands operator Strathcona Resources. The sweetened Strathcona offer was worth about 11 per cent more than the one from Cenovus on a per-share basis before it was announced Monday.

About 1 million people face being displaced again or risk staying as bombing worsens despite international outrage

Middle East crisis – live updates

The Israeli military has issued an evacuation order covering the entirety of Gaza City for the first time during the current round of fighting, ahead of a planned offensive to take over and occupy the city.

The order on Tuesday caused a scramble in the densely populated city and placed the fate of its 1 million residents in limbo, as they decided whether to be displaced once again or stay amid intensifying Israeli bombing.

Humanitarians have repeatedly warned that the consequences of an offensive on Gaza City – which is in the grips of famine – would be dire for its residents and the strip as a whole. On Tuesday, six more Palestinians died from hunger, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death in Gaza to 399.

“I say to the residents of Gaza, take this opportunity and listen to me carefully: you have been warned – get out of there!” the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said. Israel describes Gaza City as Hamas's last stronghold.

The Israeli military has for weeks urged residents to go to al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, which it has designated as a humanitarian zone that contains increased services. Despite the campaign to displace the city's residents, only a small proportion – about 50,000 people – of its 1 million residents have left.

Israel's planned offensive has garnered a wave of international criticism, with much of the international community urging an immediate ceasefire. On Sunday, the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, called on Israel to “change course” on its Gaza City invasion, while standing next to his Israeli counterpart in Jerusalem.

Aid groups have said that the area does not have the capacity nor services to absorb the renewed wave of displacement and urged Israel to stop its planned assault on Gaza City. Residents have also been skeptical of Israel's promise of a safe zone, as it continued to bomb al-Mawasi as recently as last week.

The UN has said that it can cost more than $1,000 to move to southern Gaza, an unimaginable price tag for most of Gaza's residents. Southern Gaza is already packed with people who have already been displaced several times before.

Nonetheless, some residents said they felt they had little choice left but to flee before the Israeli invasion.

“Despite the bombardment in the past week, I have resisted leaving, but now I will go to be with my daughter,” Um Mohammad, a 55-year-old mother of six, told Reuters.

The Israeli military has in recent days intensified its strikes on Gaza City, with Netanyahu saying that it had destroyed 50 “terror towers” in the city, which he said Hamas was using. Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 83 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian ministry of health. More were left without homes as a result of the strikes on the towers.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said that the bombing of the towers was “only the introduction” of the invasion, and vowed a “mighty hurricane” if Hamas did not free hostages and surrender.

Netanyahu also said that Israeli forces were massing for a ground manoeuvre into Gaza City, but the invasion had not yet started as of Tuesday.

Hamas was reportedly considering a new US-proposed ceasefire, which Israel had accepted, the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Monday. The discussions were the first sign of progress on ceasefire negotiations in a month, after Israel did not respond to Hamas's acceptance of a previous deal.

Israel is insisting that Hamas completely disarm and return the remaining hostages it still holds. Hamas has said it will not lay down its arms unless an independent Palestinian state is established.

At least 64,522 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages.

White House press secretary denies that president wrote Epstein a card that included the outline of a woman's body for the sex trafficker's 50th birthday

Photo of novelty check suggests Epstein ‘sold' Trump a woman

Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday book – in pictures

More than 20 minutes into the briefing, Karoline Leavitt is addressing some of the first questions related to the Epstein investigation.

Leavitt says that Democrats “could have cared about those victims four years ago when Joe Biden was in office, they could have pushed for transparency” but they are using victims of Epstein's abuse as “political pawns to try to smear and to push a hoax” against the president.

Leavitt adds that she has seen “forensic analysts” argue that the signature on the note to Epstein was not his. “The president did not write this letter. He did not sign this letter,” she said.

The White House has asked congress to pass legislation that would extend current federal funding until 31 January, avoiding a partial government shutdown that would otherwise begin on 1 October.

“Today's request from President Trump and Russ Vought to kick the can down the road on government funding until 31 January makes it clear the White House wants to be able to continue stealing from American communities for another four months,” said Democratic congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who also serves as the ranking member of the House Appropriations committee.

Republican Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, said the White House's request was a “suggestion” when speaking to reporters on Capitol hill on Tuesday. “We're still working on the dates and how long it would extend, but that hasn't been finalized yet.”

To keep the government funded beyond September, congress would need to pass what's known as a “continuing resolution” – which would require at least seven Democratic senators to join the chamber's Republican majority and advance the legislation.

At the Capitol, top Republicans have joined the White House in alleging that it is not actually Donald Trump's signature on a suggestive poem and drawing addressed to Jeffrey Epstein that was made public on Monday.

“The White House says it's not true,” House speaker Mike Johnson told PBS News, adding that he has not seen the artwork from Epstein's birthday book, which was released by Democrats on the House oversight committee.

The committee's Republican chair James Comer has been leading an investigation into Epstein and the government's handling of allegations of sex trafficking against him. Epstein died while awaiting trial on those charges in 2019, in what the justice department said was a suicide.
 However, Comer says that he does not plan to investigate the veracity of Trump's signature on the document.

“Twenty-two years ago was when that was allegedly sent. So, I don't think the oversight committee is going to invest in looking up something that was 22 years ago,” he told CNN.

Republican congressman and oversight committee member Tim Burchett also doubted that Trump had made the drawing and signed it – even though Trump has a history of making sketches.

“I've never known Trump to be much of an artist,” he told CNN, adding that it was “so easy” to forge a signature.

Leavitt said in today's press briefing that the ruling from the supreme court, which would allow immigration raids in Los Angeles to continue, is not indiscriminate profiling – which several critics have expressed.

“Reasonable suspicion is not just based on race, it's based on a totality of the circumstances to review,” Leavitt said. “When Ice goes out to conduct a targeted operation to deport illegal criminals from our community, they are doing so with intelligence. They are doing so with law enforcement sources. They are doing so in most cases, with the backing of local law enforcement.”

The press secretary has just offered a muddled message about what the White House considers to be a “hoax” when it comes to the Epstein investigation.

Leavitt initially said that the administration doesn't believe the documents are a hoax, but rather the “the entire narrative surrounding Jeffrey Epstein right now, that is absorbing many of the liberal cable channels on television, is a hoax that is being perpetuated by opportunistic Democrats.”

But when pushed about the White House claims that Trump didn't sign either the birthday note or novelty check – all documents provided by the Epstein estate – Leavitt seemed to suggest these were forged.

“The president has one of the most famous signatures in the world, and he has for many, many years,” she said. “He did not sign those documents. He maintains that position, and that position will be argued in court by his lawyers. The President is very confident he's going to win this case.”

Karoline Leavitt just said the president didn't sign a check that is pictured in Epstein's “birthday book”.

The picture shows Epstein posting with a $22,000 novelty check – apparently signed by Donald Trump – “for a fully depreciated woman”.

Karoline Leavitt, notably, did not confirm that Israel informed the US about the strike in Doha. “What I can tell you is the United States military informed the Trump administration,” she said.

More than 20 minutes into the briefing, Karoline Leavitt is addressing some of the first questions related to the Epstein investigation.

Leavitt says that Democrats “could have cared about those victims four years ago when Joe Biden was in office, they could have pushed for transparency” but they are using victims of Epstein's abuse as “political pawns to try to smear and to push a hoax” against the president.

Leavitt adds that she has seen “forensic analysts” argue that the signature on the note to Epstein was not his. “The president did not write this letter. He did not sign this letter,” she said.

Leavitt reads a statement from the White House, which says that the administration “feels very badly about the location” of today's attack by Isreal in Doha, targeting Hamas leaders.

She added:

President Trump believes this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for peace. The President also spoke to the Emir and prime minister of Qatar and thanked them for their support and friendship to our country. He assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.

A reminder, that my colleague, Lucy Campbell, is covering the latest developments in the Middle East. You can follow along below.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, didn't mention or address the president's alleged contribution to Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday scrapbook in her opening monologue in today's briefing.

Instead, she began her briefing calling out the press for failing to cover the murder of Iryna Zarutska on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 23-year-old, who fled the war in Ukraine, was stabbed by a man with a long criminal record, and a history of mental illness.

Leavitt used her opening remarks to advocate the administration's stance for harsher sentences.

A short while ago, border czar Tom Homan spoke with reporters outside the White House.

He claimed that undocumented immigrants with no criminal history, who are fearful of being arrested by immigration enforcement in DC, aren't the specific target of raids. “We're prioritizing public safety, and addressing national security threats,” he said. “Now, if we run into a non-criminal during these operations, they're going to be taken into custody, because we're not going to do what the Biden administration did, and tell Ice you can't enforce immigration law.”

When asked whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers should be required to identify themselves, Homan said “they do,” despite several videos showing masked agents arresting immigrants.

Homan argued that federal law enforcement from various agencies all have “patches” on their tactical gear, and show their credentials to people they are apprehending. “Now, if they're surrounded by a bunch of people who propose danger – safety first. But guaranteed when someone's arrested and put in detention they know who arrests them, and that person identifies themselves.”

The White House press briefing with Karoline Leavitt is due to start shortly amid the furore over Trump's alleged birthday note to Epstein. We will bring you all the key lines here and there will be a live feed at the top of the blog.

Here's a quick recap of the day's events so far:

A scrapbook for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday released yesterday contains a photo of him holding a novelty check bearing Donald Trump's signature, along with a note suggesting Epstein “sold” him a woman for $22,500, shedding further light on the longtime relationship between the president and the convicted sex offender.

An image of a sexually suggestive letter and drawing that appears to bear Trump's signature - the very same note the president had denied writing after reports of its existence were published earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal – was also released yesterday. Inside the sketch of a woman's torso, the note depicts an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein, with what appeared to be Trump's signature below. One House Democrat described the letter as “sickening”.

Trump has called the release of the Epstein “birthday book” a “dead issue”, while Maga loyalists have amplified claims that the alleged note written by the president to Epstein for the scrapbook is “fake”. Here's a roundup of who's in the birthday book and what they said.

Elsewhere, immigration advocates have warned that the supreme court has “effectively legalized racial profiling”, granting federal agents the power to stop people in Los Angeles simply for speaking Spanish or appearing Latino – and opening the door, they say, to a broader unraveling of civil rights protections nationwide. US immigration officers are already ramping up immigration sweeps in Los Angeles again, spurred on by the supreme court's reversal yesterday of the ban on stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a revision today, which says that job growth was overestimated between April 2024 and March 2025. There were actually 911,000 fewer jobs, according to the report. This comes after Trump claimed, baselessly, that job report numbers were being rigged, and fired commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

The Department of Justice is in talks with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), housed within the Department of Homeland Security, about transferring the sensitive voter roll data it has collected from states for use in criminal and immigration-related investigations, according to a report from Reuters.

A state district court judge in Michigan ruled today that 15 “fake electors” will not face a criminal trial for their efforts to overturn and undermine the 2020 election.

Donald Trump has described as a “dead issue” the release of the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's tome of often highly sexualized 50th birthday messages that includes a suggestive note apparently penned by the president.

The letter, which has been reported before but on Monday was released by Democrats on the House oversight committee after receiving it from the Epstein estate, shows the outline of a woman's body around an imagined conversation between Epstein and Trump. It is signed “Donald” in between the silhoutte's legs.

Trump and Epstein were close friends for the better part of 15 years until falling out, allegedly over a real estate deal.

Trump called the letter “fake” and filed a $10bn defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the existence of the document.

A state district court judge in Michigan ruled today that 15 “fake electors” will not face a criminal trial for their efforts to overturn and undermine the 2020 election.

The defendants were Republicans who signed documents which said that Donald Trump won the state in 2020, despite Joe Biden's victory.

Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel charged the electors on several counts of forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. However, Judge Kristen D Simmons said that the group genuinely believed there were problems with the election and were attempting to seek redress. Ultimately, Simmons took issue with the prosecution's ability to prove intent, and rejected claims that the electors understood their duties well enough.

A scrapbook for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday released on Monday contains a photo of him holding a novelty check bearing Donald Trump's signature, along with a note suggesting Epstein “sold” him a woman for $22,500, shedding further light on the longtime relationship between the president and the convicted sex offender.

The photo shows Epstein and Joel Pashcow, a longtime member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and a third figure, apparently a woman, whose face is redacted in the image, which was shared on social media by Democrats on the House oversight committee. The caption, apparently from Paschow, reads: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated' [redaction] to Donald Trump for $22,500.”

Epstein “showed early ‘people skills' too”, the caption continued. “Even though I handled the deal I didn't get any of the money on the girl!”

The check is signed “DJ Trump” in a style that differs from most of his signatures at the time.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the woman was someone whom Epstein and the now two-time US president “socialized with” in the 1990s. The woman's lawyer told the newspaper that she cut ties with Epstein around 1997 and had no romantic relationship with either Epstein or Trump, does not know Pashcow, and had no knowledge of the letter, which she called a “disgusting and deeply disturbing hoax”.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) issued a revision today, which says that job growth was overestimated between April 2024 and March 2025.

There were actually 911,000 fewer jobs, according to the report. This comes after Donald Trump claimed, baselessly, that job report numbers were being rigged, and fired commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The revision, known as “benchmarking” is a standard, annual process from BLS.

It's notably not a correction, but an update using more comprehensive data collated throughout the year.

The new figures, however, suggest that the job market might be weaker than expected, and Trump is expected to use today's revision as fuel for further criticism of the BLS.

Several allies of Donald Trump, also prominent Maga figures, have amplified claims that the alleged note written by the president to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday scrapbook is “fake”.

Charlie Kirk, the podcast host and founder of the right-wing non-proft Turning Point USA, said the signature on the note didn't look like Trump's “at all”.

Meanwhile, administration officials toed the line. White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on X yesterday that the scanned picture was “FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!”

Laura Loomer, the conspiracy theorist who has bragged about having the president's ear, called the Wall Street Journal's original reporting on the note “a fake story”.

On Capitol Hill, the president's allies in congress criticised Democrats on the Hill following the release of the birthday album's pages, after the House oversight committee subpoenaed Epstein's estate.

“President Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing and Democrats are ignoring the new information the Committee received today,” congressman James Comer, Republican chair of the committee wrote on social media. “It's appalling Democrats on the Oversight Committee are cherry-picking documents and politicizing information received from the Epstein Estate today.”

Three leading scholars of election law are starting a new project at New York University, focused on studying public confidence in government and political polarization, according to details first shared with the Guardian.

The effort announced on Tuesday, called the Democracy Project, will be led by NYU law professors Richard Pildes, Samuel Issacharoff, and Bob Bauer (Bauer served as Joe Biden's personal attorney and Barack Obama's White House counsel). It will bring together experts with a wide range of ideological and political backgrounds to discuss what reforms could look like.

“Dissatisfaction with democratic government has been pervasive for the last decade throughout the West. Our aim in launching the Democracy Project is to analyze the sources of this phenomenon along many dimensions and across national boundaries, as well as identify the most promising ways to meet this challenge,” Pildes, Issacharoff, and Bauer said in a joint statement.

The effort comes as vast numbers of Americans are concerned about the state of democracy. A June NPR/Marist poll found that 76% of Americans felt democracy was under serious threat. Seventy-three per cent of Americans also see politically motivated violence as a major problem.

The project is launching with an essay series on democracy issues that will launch daily over the next 100 days. Those set to contribute to the series include former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell, former Montana governor Steve Bullock, former Justice on UK supreme court Lord Jonathan Sumption, former South Africa supreme court Justice Catherine O'Regan, and businessman Mark Cuban.

The Department of Justice is in talks with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), housed within the Department of Homeland Security, about transferring the sensitive voter roll data it has collected from states for use in criminal and immigration-related investigations, according to a report from Reuters.

The voter registration data was gathered over the last several months by the DoJ's civil rights division, which has sent requests for voter registration-related information to at least 24 states, per Reuters.

The report cites government records, which show that HSI plans to run the voter roll data against other information in its law enforcement databases for use in criminal and immigration investigations. Legal experts who spoke with Reuters said sharing such data raises privacy concerns.

Donald Trump has routinely claimed, without evidence, that there is large scale fraud within the US election system, and swathes of non-citizens are casting votes.

Editor's note: The following item contains video footage that is graphic in nature and may be disturbing to some viewers. The story is being updated.

At least 24 people were killed and 19 were injured when Russian forces struck the front-line village of Yarova in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 9, according to local authorities.

The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.

Two of the injured have been hospitalized, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said in a post on social media. 

"This is not a military operation — this is pure terrorism," Governor Vadym Filashkin said on his Telegram channel.

Footage published by the authorities shows a damaged postal service car with several bodies lying around it.

The small village of Yarova lies roughly 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of the city of Sloviansk. Located near local road networks, it sits close to the front line, just 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from areas held by Russian forces.

"Such Russian strikes must not be left without an appropriate response from the world," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.

"The world must not remain idle. A response is needed from the United States. A response is needed from Europe. A response is needed from the G20."

In a later post, Zelensky said Russian forces "knew exactly where they were hitting, they saw exactly that they were hitting civilians."

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has relentlessly targeted civilian areas, striking both major cities such as Kyiv and front-line communities, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties.

At least six civilians were killed and 10 were injured on Sept. 8 in Russian attacks against Donetsk Oblast, an eastern region partially occupied by Russia since 2014.

Recent months saw Russia ramp up its attacks on Ukrainian cities despite months-long efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the hostilities.

European officials have denounced the latest attack, with Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna calling it a "shocking display of the inhumanity shown by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his army."

"It is long past time to roll up the red carpet for him," Estonia's top diplomat said in apparent reference to the welcome Putin received from Trump during the Alaska summit on Aug. 15.

"Is this what Russia means when it talks about peace?" European Council President Antonio Costa said on X.

"When will Russia stop killing people? When will President Putin accept to start peace talks already accepted by President Zelensky?"

The drones will be manufactured in the United Kingdom and delivered to Ukraine within the next 12 months, U.K. Defense Minister John Healey said

The Zapad-2025 (meaning "west" in Russian) drills, set to begin on Sept. 12 in Belarus and western Russia, have heightened alarm in NATO member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.

The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.

"Therefore it is vital that we use this window of opportunity that we have while Russia is bogged down in Ukraine to strengthen NATO's northern flank,"  Sweden's defense minister Pal Jonson said.



"We aim for 100% by October," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in reference to the 2 million pledged artillery shells.

According to the agency, Ukrainian forces destroyed a 48Ya6-K1 Podlet low-altitude radar and an RLM-M module from the 55Zh6M Nebo-M air defense complex. 

The contract, set to be signed on Sept. 10 and worth "hundreds of millions of euros," will see the first units delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year.

Three oil and gas pipelines in Russia were knocked out of service in a series of explosions on Sept. 8, a Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's plans could cost "years and a million people," or even "two or three million corpses" if Russia accelerates its offensive.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki said that a country cannot join NATO while at war and that "today's discussion about Ukraine's membership in the European Union is premature."

The attack may have coincided with Russian President Vladimir Putin's working visit to the city. According to the Kremlin, Putin joined the BRICS summit online from Sochi on Sept. 8.

Alexey Sinitsyn, CEO of potash producer K-Potash Service, was found dead near Kaliningrad.

"That's the only conceivable way to move Putin from his current calculations... get him to compromise and to agree to a ceasefire," former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 84 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, with air defenses downing 60.

ABU, Yamaguchi — A small coastal town will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the creation of its jazz concert that invites world-renowned jazz musicians to perform live in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

This year's concert features Nicki Parrott, a bassist known for her silky-sweet tones, as a main performer. Yoshitaka Masumoto, the owner of jazz cafe Village in Hagi of the same prefecture, has been organizing the festival in Abu, which faces the Japan Sea.

“We will present many jazz standards with the best performances to delight the fans who have supported the event over the years,” said Masumoto.

The town has been striving to revitalize the community through jazz. With Masumoto taking the lead, it hosted the Concord Jazz Festival in Japan for 10 consecutive years since 2005, inviting renowned musicians such as trumpet player Terumasa Hino. The festival was held in 2018 and 2019, and the performances fully resumed in 2022 after a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2023 festival was jeopardized due to the passing of Takao Ishizuka, the president of a Tokyo promotion company that had been a long-time collaborator in bringing renowned overseas musicians to the town's festival. Masumoto overcame this crisis by personally appealing to famous jazz pianist Makoto Ozone.

From that year on, the festival took its current name of Abu Jazz Festival.

The 2025 festival is a huge milestone. The festival will start at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 12 at the Abu citizens center's cultural hall that has a capacity of 500.

Parrott, from Australia, has performed at jazz festivals in Europe, the United States and at the 2022 Concord festival. She reportedly told Masumoto that she was looking forward to coming back.

The two-hour concert will feature many standard numbers including “Autumn Leaves.” Female musicians active in places like Tokyo will be on piano, guitar, saxophone and drums.

“It's a small concert in a tiny town hall but presents world-class performances,” Masumoto said. “I want to continue to keep jazz alive in this town.”

All seats are reserved, and admission is ¥6,000.

 What Trump Could Learn From Reagan

 Celeste A. Wallander

Summits between heads of state are high-stakes gambles to achieve breakthrough solutions. Typically, they are judged on whether they help resolve an intractable international issue. But sometimes, their most consequential impact is on the domestic political standing of one or both of the summit's participants. And U.S. President Donald Trump's summit last month in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin is of this mold: it strengthened Putin, and in doing so has prolonged both the war in Ukraine and his hold on power.

The meeting in Anchorage has parallels to the 1986 summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland. Then, as now, an American leader and a Russian one met to resolve a major foreign policy challenge—in 1986, ending an arms race, and last month, ending the war in Ukraine. In both cases, they failed. The talks in Iceland collapsed when Reagan refused to scuttle his Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed program that would neutralize Soviet nuclear missiles before they struck their targets. Alaska ended without a deal to end Russia's invasion.

But there the parallels diverge. Both summits may have had profound consequences for the Kremlin, yet those consequences could not be more different. For Gorbachev, the Iceland summit hastened the end of his country. He returned to the Kremlin weakened from his failure to stop Reagan's program, and his subsequent decisions paved the way for the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later. Putin, by contrast, has emerged triumphant. Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader in Anchorage and spoke gushingly of their “fantastic relationship.” Putin made no concessions, and Trump shifted the responsibility for ending the fighting to Ukraine: “Now it is really up to President Zelensky to get it done,” he said in an interview with Fox News.

Although Putin did not face any strong opposition before Alaska, he now enjoys a glow of success for, by all appearances, having won over the American president. According to a late August survey by the independent Russian polling firm Levada, 79 percent of Russians view the summit as a success for Putin, and 51 percent are more optimistic for an improvement in relations with the United States. After the summit, Russian media did not have to put out false pronouncements to highlight Putin's diplomatic triumph: it broadcast the real event, along with Western commentary on Putin's victory. Stronger than ever, Putin can continue his war against Ukraine for as long as it takes to win on his terms.

When the Politburo elected Gorbachev general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985, the country was in desperate need of reform. The Soviet military was bogged down in Afghanistan, a conflict that Gorbachev called “a bleeding wound,” and incompetent central planning was dragging down the Soviet Union's economic growth rate. Détente with the United States, which lasted from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, had failed to ease competition between the superpowers. And inequality, corruption, and scarcity were rampant.

Gorbachev promised hard-liners and reformists alike that he would fix these grave issues. Yet he promised to do so not by fundamentally changing the Soviet system. Instead, he said he would succeed by increasing productivity and eliminating wasteful spending. He reassured the Soviet elite that the Communist Party would remain strong and in control. Rather than upend the party's central control, he would secure new resources by improving relations with the West, which would allow Moscow to curtail defense spending and ramp up economic modernization. To that end, Gorbachev asked the Politburo to support negotiations with Washington on limiting each side's stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons. The Soviet security elite agreed to back an agreement, but only if the Americans disavowed defenses against strategic nuclear weapons as part of it. The offense-defense balance, they warned, could not tip in Washington's favor.

That is why Gorbachev went to Iceland: he would show the world and wary party colleagues at home that he could stop the arms race and rejuvenate the Soviet economy by unlocking the conditions for growth. But he failed spectacularly and publicly. The world watched on television in real time as Reagan refused to cancel his Strategic Defense Initiative and Gorbachev left empty-handed. When he returned to Moscow, he had to defend himself before a fractious Politburo, with conservatives continuing to demand that Washington disavow strategic defenses as part of a deal. Gorbachev faced a divided leadership with competing demands on him.

Ultimately, he chose to rely on his core reformist supporters in order to save his power. In 1987, Gorbachev agreed to sign an Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Reagan even though it did not constrain Washington's missile defenses. He pushed aside the Politburo's conservatives and began leaning more on moderate leaders and advisers, especially Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Over the next several years, Gorbachev pursued a sweeping series of economic and political changes that allowed for quasi-private businesses and greater autonomy for the 15 constituent Soviet republics, Russia included. But instead of unleashing an economic dynamism that would silence his opponents, Gorbachev's changes broke the Soviet system without creating a functional new one. Food lines grew longer, Soviet cities were shaken by hunger riots, and wage payments began to fall behind.

In trying to preserve his power, Gorbachev destroyed the structure that gave it to him. And by weakening the tools of Soviet political control, he opened up space for nationalist movements and leaders, including Boris Yeltsin in Russia, to gain strength. Eventually, these movements overwhelmed what was left of a decaying state. In December 1991, the Soviet Union passed into history.

Putin's Russia is not Gorbachev's Soviet Union. There is no collective leadership constraining the Kremlin. Putin does not answer to a Politburo or any powerful committee: he presides over a personalist authoritarian system in which he is the sole source of power. The public officials and business leaders in Putin's orbit owe their positions, their influence, and their wealth to their loyalty and service to him alone. But that does not mean he is invulnerable. Russian state propaganda is formidable, but sufficient economic hardship could disturb the quiescence of Russian society. And it's unclear how the Russian elite might respond if circumstances forced Putin to cut off their economic benefits.

So far, the president has managed these risks well. After more than three years of war, the Russian economy has not crashed under the pressure of sanctions. Instead, the country's skilled economic leaders managed to keep growth above four percent last year, buoyed by high defense spending. Employment, consumption, and access to credit remain high. It is hard to gauge accurate public opinion in an authoritarian police state, but there are no outward signs that discontent within the elite or society at large threatens Putin's rule.

Still, extensive government spending to strengthen the economy has led to high inflation—nearly ten percent in 2024 and over eight percent this year. And Putin's war carries significant opportunity costs for Russia. International sanctions limiting the country's trade, investment, and access to technology hamper productivity and growth. Russia can sell oil to China and India, but its limited access to global markets means it does so at a discount. The Russian army can recruit new contract soldiers, but it must offer substantial sign-on bonuses and ever-higher payments to entice them, and those contracts are driving labor shortages and inflation.



Putin's performance in Alaska helps obviate these pressures. True, he did not secure agreement to some long-standing demands or the business deals that the Trump administration had hinted at. But in the eyes of Russia's elite and ordinary citizens, he succeeded nonetheless. He broke out of the isolation that the West had imposed on him, defiantly landing in the United States despite sanctions and international arrest warrants for war crimes. He delayed and has possibly entirely avoided new crushing sanctions on Russian oil. And he reminded the world that Moscow stands resolute in its demands that Ukraine cede not just territory but its autonomy and sovereignty as well.

In fact, the summit helped Putin legitimize Moscow's grievances, giving Russians who might doubt the wisdom of the invasion reason believe that it was, as Putin promised, just. Addressing reporters in Anchorage against a backdrop that read “Pursuing Peace,” Putin spoke of Russia's “legitimate concerns,” of his desire to see a “just balance of security in Europe and in the world,” and of “the need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes” of the fighting in Ukraine. Trump did nothing to push back against this narrative. Indeed, the American president appears to have accepted Putin's contention that Moscow should have a say over Ukrainian territorial integrity and Western security guarantees. Putin flew home having demonstrated to his subjects that he was right all along, that they must not waver, and that he will win for them.

For Putin, the summit was never about pursuing peace in Ukraine. His aim all along has been to bend the international system to his will and to preserve his monopoly on power at home. Since his first incursions into Ukraine in 2014, Putin has played the long game. He has always believed that time is on his side. The Alaska summit bought him even more time—and gave him a stronger hand for achieving military victory.

Law enforcement officials on Sept. 7 removed a blue tent outside the White House under the order of President Donald Trump, who alleged that the tent was linked to the “communist cause.”

The blue tent marks a 44-year-long protest against nuclear weaponry, started by activist William Thomas in 1981 on Lafayette Square.

LONDON, September 9. /TASS/. European leaders need a plan B if US President Donald Trump refuses to side with them on military assistance to Ukraine, Financial Times commentator Gideon Rachman writes.

According to him, "the clear danger for the Europeans is that they are so immersed in the intricacies of diplomacy <...> that they are missing the big picture."

"The US president has repeatedly signalled by word and deed that he does not want to commit to the defense of Ukraine," Rachman notes, adding that persuading Trump to increase military and economic pressure on Russia would be an incredible achievement. "It is certainly worth a try. But Europe needs a plan B, for when the Trump-whispering fails," he points out.

In Rachman's view, the so-called coalition of the willing was discussing the possibility of using a US "air shield" in order to ensure a ceasefire because they understand that Russia is unlikely to agree to a truce. "The air shield would involve a big increase in air defences that could close the skies to Russian drones, although not to ballistic missiles. The Europeans would contribute, partly through naval support that could help to protect Ukrainian airspace. There is discussion of the deployment of aircraft carriers, probably from Europe," Rachman adds.

Israel launched a strike on Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they discussed a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, officials said.

Hamas says its top leaders survived the Israeli strike on Qatar and that five lower-ranking members died.

A Qatari security personnel was also killed, the Hamas statement said.

Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof its top leaders had survived.

Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they considered a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally marked a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages.

What to know: 



The European Union said the attack on Doha Tuesday might lead to more conflict in the Middle East in one of the strongest statements to date on from the 27-nation bloc.

“Today's airstrike by Israel against Hamas leaders in Doha breaches international law and Qatar's territorial integrity, and risks a further escalation of violence in the region,” said Anouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the European Commission, in a statement posted online by the EU's diplomatic corps.

“Any escalation of the war in Gaza must be avoided — it is in no one's interest. We will continue to support all efforts towards a ceasefire in Gaza,” he said.

The EU has been riven by deep disagreements over Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Mass protests have rocked European cities from Amsterdam to Barcelona calling for a ceasefire.

Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, the Qatari ambassador to the U.N., wrote that an investigation into the attack is underway and that the state “is taking necessary measures to contain its repercussions.”

“While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty,” she wrote in the letter obtained by The Associated Press.

The ambassador did not request for the 15-member council to hold an emergency meeting as is often done after major escalations.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the attack “in the strongest terms.” 

He urged the United Nations and the international community to stop Israel and save the world from these “unprecedented threats by the Israeli regime on the peace and security of the region.”

He was speaking at a news conference Tuesday after signing an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Cairo. The agreement paves the way for cooperation, including resuming inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in a statement that he's very concerned about the safety of the hostages still held by Hamas.

Germany is a staunch ally of Israel, though in recent months it has become increasingly critical of Israel's actions in Gaza.

“Israel's attack in Doha not only violates the territorial sovereignty of Qatar, but also endangers all our efforts for the release of the hostages,” Wadephul said.

“This strike is unacceptable,” he said.

He said he has voiced his concern about the lives and safety of hostages held by Hamas, including German citizens, in a phone call with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar.

Wadephul said he spoke to his Qatari counterpart and expressed his “solidarity” and recognition of efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of the hostages.

“Morocco reiterates its full solidarity with Qatar against anything liable to jeopardize its security, its territorial integrity and the peace of its citizens and residents,” Morocco's foreign ministry said in a statement.

Morocco, which maintains ties with Qatar and Israel, was the fourth Arab country to normalize relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in late 2020, in exchange for U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.

Morocco's group of action for Palestine, a coalition of activists, announced an urgent protest Tuesday in front of the parliament to denounce the attack in Doha.

Libyan Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah denounced what he labeled Israel's “cowardly aggression” that violates international law and underscores the “largest genocide” against the people in the Gaza Strip.

“Every day, the importance of Arab and Islamic countries uniting to confront this aggression in all its forms becomes clearer, as well as the need to call on the international community to bear its responsibilities in immediately stopping these violations,” he said in a post on X.

Sudan called the attack “a blatant violation of Qatar's territorial integrity and national sovereignty” and that it “undermines ongoing efforts to achieve security and stability in the region.”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's condemnation of Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar came a day before he is set to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in the U.K.

“I condemn Israel's strikes on Doha, which violate Qatar's sovereignty and risk further escalation across the region,” he said. “The priority must be an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and a huge surge in aid into Gaza. This is the only solution towards long-lasting peace.”

Downing Street confirmed that Starmer's meeting with Herzog will go ahead Wednesday.

“The Prime Minister will be meeting the Israeli president, where he'll raise the intolerable situation in Gaza, the action Israel must take to end the horrific suffering we're witnessing. It cannot go on any longer,” a spokesman said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the U.S. received prior notice about the pending attack from Israel. 

In response, diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff passed along a warning to the Qataris.

President Donald Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the attack, Leavitt said, and “made his thoughts and concerns very clear.”

She said Trump believes the attack was an “unfortunate incident” that didn't advance peace in the region.





The son of Khalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader and top negotiator, was killed along with the head of al-Hayya's office, Suheil al-Hindi, a member of Hamas' political bureau, told Al-Jazeera. 

Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof they had survived.

A member of Qatar's Internal Security Force was also killed and others were wounded, Qatar's Interior Ministry said.

Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the attack targeting Hamas leadership as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.

The ministry said in a statement that Pakistan is in “complete solidarity” with Qatar and urged the international community to hold Israel accountable.

It called the attack “provocative and reckless” and said it shows Israel's “continued disregard for international peace and security.” 

Pakistan reaffirmed its support for Qatar's sovereignty and territorial integrity, vowing to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Gulf nation's leadership and people.

Benjamin Netanyahu told a U.S. Embassy party that Israel acted “wholly independently” and takes “full responsibility.”

“This action can open the door to an end of the war,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump's latest ceasefire proposal could end the war immediately.

Qatar's Interior Ministry said in a statement that a member of Qatar's Internal Security Force was killed.

Other security personnel were hurt, it added.

It did not offer any details about the status of Hamas officials at the site.

After the Israeli attack, the embassy sent an alert telling its staff and all U.S. citizens in the country to shelter-in-place.

It lifted all restrictions hours later, but advised all American staff and visitors in Doha to “remain vigilant.”

Annalena Baerbock called Israel's attack in Qatar an escalation of the conflict in Gaza and “obviously concerning.” 

Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, stressed that all 193 U.N. member nations are required by the U.N. Charter to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country.

She called for intensified diplomatic efforts toward an immediate and permanent ceasefire, improved humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza by the Israeli government, and the release of all hostages held by Hamas.

Baerbock spoke shortly after taking the oath of office to become president of the 80th session of the General Assembly, which ends in September 2026.

The U.S. military did not participate in the Israeli strikes that took place in Doha, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Pentagon has directed questions to the White House, where officials didn't immediately respond.

Syria's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leadership represented “a dangerous escalation that would undermine security and stability in the region.”

The ministry called the attack “a blatant violation of international law and the sovereignty of the sisterly State of Qatar.”

Qatar has been a strong supporter of the interim government in Syria since former Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive in December. 

Israel has been suspicious of Syria's new Islamist-led authorities, and Israeli forces have seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites since Assad's fall.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Israeli strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar. The strike on Tuesday was a further widening of Israel's campaign against the militant group, as negotiations over ending the war in the Gaza Strip appear stalemated before a new military offensive there.



Israel alerted the U.S. ahead of time, according to an Israeli official, a White House official and another person familiar with the matter. The White House official would not say if Washington provided Israel with approval for carrying out the strike, but another U.S. official said the American military did not participate.

All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Pentagon officials referred questions about coordination to the White House. And the White House officials did not respond to request for comment. 

It was not clear how much warning was provided or whether the U.S. expressed approval for the strike.

Congressional leaders appeared caught off guard by Israel's strike.

“I'm not sure about that development,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked about the situation at his weekly press conference Tuesday. “We'll have to reserve judgement.”

Senate leaders Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican John Thune made no mention of the strikes in their opening remarks as the chamber convened.

It was unclear if they had been briefed ahead of the action.

“We have to pray a lot and continue to work and try to insist” on an end to the hostilities, Pope Leo XIV told Italy's RAI television.

“The whole situation is really serious,” Leo said. 

Leo and the Vatican's top diplomats met Israeli President Isaac Herzog last week, when he called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and entry of humanitarian aid to famine-stricken Palestinians there. 

The Vatican told Herzog a two-state solution was the “only way out of the war,” according to a Vatican statement at the time.

The first American pope also said Tuesday that he tried without success to contact the parish priest at the Catholic church in Gaza. The priest decided against evacuating, choosing instead to remain with Palestinians sheltering in the church.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said the Israeli strikes were “part of a series of attacks committed by Israel, demonstrating its insistence on undermining all efforts made to achieve stability and security in the countries of the region and the safety of its people.”

Since a ceasefire nominally put an end to the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November, Israel has continued to launch near-daily strikes in Lebanon.

Aoun urged “the international community to put an end to these Israeli practices that continue to violate all international laws and agreements and obstruct every commendable effort made by the State of Qatar to establish peace in the region and put an end to the suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people.”

The Egyptian presidency said in a statement that the attack “targeted a meeting of Palestinian leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement” in Gaza.

“This attack sets a serious precedent and an unacceptable development, and constitutes a direct assault on the sovereignty of the sisterly State of Qatar, which plays a pivotal role in mediation efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip,” it said.

Foreign minister Badr Abdelatty said Israel should be held accountable for its “criminal aggression.”

“This arrogance will not achieve security and stability for Israel. Rather it proves completely to the entire world that the State of Israel has no will and no desire to reach a political solution or a ceasefire,” he said during a news conference.

Egypt has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas.

When asked if the British government had been told, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares, pointed to a statement by Israel's prime minister saying the attack was a solely an Israeli operation.

Pares called Hamas “a vile terrorist organization,” but did not directly criticize the Israeli attack.

“We do not want to see a further escalation in violence which risks further destabilization in the region. Our overarching priority is to see an end to the horrific suffering in Gaza,” he said.

Starmer is scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Wednesday. Pares said the British leader would use the meeting to “raise the intolerable situation in Gaza and the action Israel must take to end the horrific suffering.”

In a phone call with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described Israel's attack on Doha as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law.”

He offered Saudi Arabia's “full solidarity” with Qatar.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the strikes, describing them as “evidence of Israel's expansionist policies and its adoption of terrorism of state strategy.”

The ministry's statement expressed Turkey's solidarity with Qatar and renewed a call on the international community to exert pressure to halt Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories and the wider region.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also condemned the attack as a violation of international law and Qatar's sovereignty.

“Those who turn terrorism into a state policy will never achieve their goals,” Erdogan said in a social media post. The Turkish leader also reaffirmed Ankara's support to Palestinians and to its ally, Qatar.

Mohammed al-frah a member of the Houthis' political office, posted his condemnation of the attack on X, saying Israel and the United States are fully responsible.

“This cowardly operation was nothing but a deliberate assassination attempt against the negotiating delegation, a despicable effort to eliminate any prospect for peace, and an execution of any diplomatic hope in the region,” he said.

According to the Houthi-run SABA news agency, Mahdi al-Mashat, head of the Houthis' supreme political council that runs rebel-held areas in Yemen, also commented. 

He said the attack was a “blatant statement that violates the sovereignty of a state ... and sounds the alarm bell for all Arab and Islamic countries, so pay attention before it is too late.”

Iraq's foreign ministry said in a statement that this “cowardly act represents a flagrant violation” of Qatar's sovereignty and poses a threat to its security and stability.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterates Iraq's firm position in standing with the government and people of the sisterly State of Qatar, and fully supporting it in confronting any attacks that undermine its sovereignty or threaten its national security,” the statement read.

Danny Danon defended his country's strike on Hamas' headquarters in Doha, saying “there is no hiding place for terrorists.”

“The precise strike in Doha targeted senior Hamas leaders who planned the October 7 massacre and celebrated while our citizens were abducted,” Danon posted on X. “I commend our security forces for this courageous and precise operation.”

Spain's Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Tuesday that his government is prohibiting the entry of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, its finance minister.

In a televised address Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Israel's attacks in Gaza an “extermination of a defenseless people.”

Israel banned the entrance of two of Spain's ministers in response to that speech.

Sánchez also announced he was formalizing an arms embargo on Israel and prohibiting ships carrying fuel for Israel's armed forces from using Spanish ports.

“We are just learning about the Israeli attacks in Qatar, a country that has been playing a very positive role to achieve a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,” Guterres told reporters at a press conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York. 

“I condemn this flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” he said, adding “all parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.”

“Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it and Israel takes full responsibility,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

It remains unclear what regional reaction will come from the strike. Immediately afterward, Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan wrote online: “Full solidarity with our dear Qatar.” That comes as the United Arab Emirates has already warned Israel that its possible annexation of the West Bank threatened the Abraham Accords, an agreement by which Abu Dhabi normalized relations with Israel five years ago. 

In a statement, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abou Gheit said the attack violated Qatar's sovereignty.

He said Israel “does not care about the consequences of its shameful actions.”

The assault marks the second time the energy-rich nation has been directly attacked in the nearly two years of war that have gripped the wider Middle East since Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — even as it has served as a key negotiator in efforts to end the conflict. It also calls into question whether any negotiations will immediately continue.

The U.S. Embassy in Qatar said that it had “instituted a shelter-in-place order for their facilities.”

“U.S. citizens are advised to shelter-in-place,” it added.

An official in Egypt, which also has been meditating a potential ceasefire, told the AP that the strike came when a meeting by Hamas officials over the talks had been scheduled for the site. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters.

Earlier this week, Trump said that he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regarding a possible ceasefire, as Arab officials described a new U.S. proposal. A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said that it would discuss the proposal and respond within days.

The proposal, presented by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, calls for a negotiated end of the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza once the hostages are released and a ceasefire is established, according to Egyptian and Hamas officials familiar with the talks, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door discussions.

Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar, officials said, further widening its campaign against the militant group.

Black smoke rose over the skyline of the Qatari capital, Doha, with authorities there acknowledging the strike. It wasn't immediately clear if anyone was hurt in the attack, marking the second time the energy-rich nation has been directly attacked in the nearly two years of war that have gripped the wider Middle East since Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

It wasn't immediately clear how the attack was carried out, though an Israeli military spokesman referred to Israel's air force carrying out the strike. Qatar Airways continued landing in Doha amid the strike, even as at least one Qatari air force aircraft took off on patrol over the country.

Chicago reporter William J. Kelly joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the Trump administration's 'Operation Midway Blitz' in Illinois as Democrats continue to push back against the possibility of a Trump-sanctioned crime crackdown. 

A federal raid in upstate New York led to the arrests of 57 illegal workers, five of whom now face criminal charges for illegally reentering the U.S. after previously being deported.

Five of the illegal immigrants were charged by criminal complaint with illegally reentering the country: Alex Ben Chipin, 39, Argentina Juarez-Lopez, 50, Luis Jom-Morales, 27, and Gregorio Baldemar Ramirez-Perez, 45, all of Guatemala, and Francisco Salvardo-Mora, 22, of Mexico, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.

The remaining 52 illegal immigrants were detained administratively pending immigration proceedings, officials said.

Acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III said the Sept. 4 raid in Cayuga County, New York, was one of the largest worksite enforcement actions in recent history.

He added employers across the Northern District of New York must understand they risk criminal investigation if they are employing noncitizens who are not authorized to work in the U.S. 

"Across Upstate and Central New York, there are hard-working Americans in need of well-paying jobs, especially in Cayuga County where unemployment is relatively high," Sarcone wrote in a statement. "Our worksite enforcement actions will ensure that those jobs go to people who are authorized to work in the United States, and not to aliens who illegally re-enter our country after prior deportations."

Authorities said five of the illegal immigrants arrested were charged with reentering the U.S.

The Department of Justice announced Tuesday that Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., the suspect in the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee, has been federally charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

FIRST ON FOX: Federal authorities announced Tuesday that Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., the suspect in the stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a North Carolina train, has been federally charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the DOJ will seek the maximum penalty for Brown, saying that the Aug. 22 attack was a "direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people."

"I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute DeCarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder," she said. "We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man."

"The brutal attack on Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte light rail was a disgraceful act that should never happen in America," FBI Director Kash Patel said. "The FBI jumped to assist in this investigation immediately to ensure justice is served, and the perpetrator is never released from jail to kill again. I want to thank Attorney General Bondi for her pursuit of today's federal charges, which are the first step toward delivering justice for Iryna and her family – as well as the millions of Americans who deserve to live in our great American cities free from being targeted by violent criminals."

James C. Barnacle Jr., the FBI Charlotte special agent in charge, said he hopes the federal charge will "help bring her family a measure of justice."

"Iryna Zarutska had likely taken that train ride many times before. She was probably tired after a day at work and just wanted to go home, but tragically she never made it," he said Tuesday. "We hope this federal charge will help bring her family a measure of justice and the courts will hold the subject charged in this horrific act accountable. Everyone in this country deserves to go to work, to school or just across town without fear of being attacked."

Brown was previously charged with first-degree murder in state court for allegedly stabbing Zarutska, 23, to death aboard a Charlotte light-rail train on Aug. 22.

Surveillance video from the LYNX Blue Line captured the moments before the attack, which police described as "seemingly unprovoked." Court documents obtained by Fox News Digital say that Brown took out a folding knife and stabbed Zarutska, who was still dressed in her pizzeria uniform, three times.

Brown is no stranger to the justice system. Court and prison records examined by Fox News Digital show that he has been convicted of crimes spanning a decade. By the time of Zarutska's killing, Brown had racked up 14 arrests over the years but was no longer under state supervision.

His convictions include larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, as well as a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which he served more than six years in prison. He was released in 2020 and remained on parole until 2021. More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year.

UKRAINIAN WOMAN WHO FLED WAR STABBED TO DEATH AT CHARLOTTE LIGHT RAIL STATION

President Donald Trump seized on the case, calling Brown a "lunatic" and using the killing to push for tougher sentencing policies and stronger federal intervention. On Monday, Patel wrote: "The FBI has been investigating the Charlotte train murder from day one. Stay tuned."

Zarutska fled Ukraine with her family in 2022 to escape the war before settling in Charlotte, according to her obituary. She was working at a local pizzeria, Zepeddie's Pizza, at the time of her death and was captured on the train's surveillance camera wearing her work uniform.

Her family described Zarutska as a passionate artist and graduate of Synergy College in Kyiv, where she earned a degree in art and restoration. She was remembered for her creativity, her love of animals, her determination and her eagerness to learn.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt issues a statement from the Trump administration regarding the Israeli airstrikes in Doha, Qatar.

The White House revealed Tuesday that President Donald Trump "immediately directed" his special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff to inform Qatar of the "impending attack" by Israel. 

Israel's military targeted senior Hamas leadership in Doha, launching what it described as a "precise strike." Khalil al-Hayya and Zaher Jabarin were the two targets of the explosion that rocked the Middle Eastern nation's capital, Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst said Tuesday, citing reports. 

"This morning, the Trump administration was notified by the United States military that Israel was attacking Hamas, which very unfortunately was located in a section of Doha, the capital of Qatar," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. "Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker peace does not advance Israel or America's goals."

"However, eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal. President Trump immediately directed special envoy Witkoff to inform the Qataris of the impending attack, which he did," Leavitt added.

"The president views Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the United States and feels very badly about the location of this attack," Leavitt said. 

Leavitt also revealed that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the strike.

"The prime minister told President Trump that he wants to make peace and quickly. President Trump believes this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for peace," Leavitt said at the White House press briefing. "The president also spoke to the emir and prime minister of Qatar and thanked them for their support and friendship to our country. He assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil." 

Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were present for the call with the Qataris, Leavitt said.

"The president has always made it very clear that he wants peace in the Middle East, just like he sought that and accomplished that in his first term. He expects all of our allies and friends in the region – that includes both Qatar and Israel – to seek peace as well," Leavitt also said. "And he wants to see that happen. And he's working with all of our allies in the region to get that done."

            Two Supreme Court justices – a conservative and the court's senior liberal – appeared to shut down talk of a third term for President Donald Trump in separate appearances this week, with both suggesting that the two-term language included in the 22nd Amendment is clear.
    


            The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms. The amendment states that “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
    


            Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who Trump appointed to the high court during his first term, told Fox News in an interview that aired Monday that it was “true” that the 22nd Amendment appears to limit a president's tenure – despite Trump's yearslong flirtations with a third term.
    


            “That's what the amendment says, right?” Barrett told Fox News “Special Report” host Bret Baier. “After FDR had four terms, that's what that amendment says.”
    


            Baier initially noted that the amendment says a president can run only two times.
    


            “True,” Barrett responded.
    


            Trump has frequently teased the idea of running for a third term, and his company's website encourages people to “rewrite the rules” by purchasing a “Trump 2028” baseball cap.



            Whether the president is serious or just trying to enrage his critics, it's notable that two Supreme Court justices have been asked about the legality of the idea in separate interviews this week.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal, was pressed Tuesday on the same question during an appearance on ABC's “The View.”
    


            “The Constitution is settled law. No one has tried to challenge that,” Sotomayor said. “But it is in the Constitution, and one should understand that there's nothing that is the greater law in the United States than the Constitution of the United States.”
    


            Though justices rarely speak to media, Barrett and Sotomayor are both promoting books and therefore appearing at public events and sitting for interviews. Even as they do so, the Supreme Court is handling a flood of emergency cases dealing with Trump's efforts to consolidate power within the executive branch.
    


            Barrett, for the most part, appears to have voted with Trump in those cases. Sotomayor, who was named to the court by former President Barack Obama, has regularly dissented.
    


            Barrett's careful language in response to Baier – she declined to say directly whether the matter was “cut and dried” – drew some criticism on social media.
    


            But Sotomayor also suggested the matter was “not settled” because “we don't have a court case about that issue.”
    


            Justices virtually never discuss their thoughts on what's legal (or not) in public, so the statements from both Barrett and Sotomayor were notable.

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson sits down for an exclusive interview with 'Fox & Friends Weekend' host Will Cain to discuss the state of the country and more. 

Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson revealed the reason behind his recent slim down that left fans surprised.

Johnson, 53, explained that he's been losing weight for an upcoming film called "Lizard Music." He described his character as "a very whimsical and eccentric 70-something-year-old man called the Chicken Man. And his best friend is a 70-something-year-old chicken." He joked that in preparation for the role, he's been eating "less chicken."

"I'm so excited because I get a chance to hopefully transform again like I was able to do in ‘Smashing Machine,'" he said at a Toronto International Film Festival event on Sept. 8, per People. "Can't wait."

"This is me slimmed down," Johnson said. "In the process of slimming down. I still have a long ways to go."

Johnson debuted his leaner look at the Venice Film Festival on Aug. 25. The actor's lean look was captured in video from the event.

"Yep had to do a double take.." one X user commented.

"He's so lean," a fan commented.

"The Rock slimming down and still owning every room… legendary glow-up unlocked," another chimed in.

Before slimming down, Johnson transformed into MMA fighter Mark Kerr for the sports drama "The Smashing Machine." In an interview with Vanity Fair, Johnson explained that this was the first role in years that made him nervous.

"It was very real. I had not experienced that in a very, very, very long time, where I was really scared and thinking, ‘I don't know if I can do this. Can I do this?'"

He added, "I realized that maybe these opportunities weren't coming my way because I was too scared to explore this stuff."

To properly take on the role, Johnson wore 13 to 14 prosthetics every day and would just "disappear" when he walked on set.

"I just sat in front of that mirror for three to four hours and watched it all change. There were about 13 or 14 different prosthetics. Subtle, yet I think very impactful. By the time I got to set, I was Mark Kerr and I felt it, from how he walked to how he talked and how he looked at life," he said.

Police say the robbery involving a large group of suspects happened on September 5 at around 2 p.m. at Kim Hung Jewelry in San Jose, Calif. (Credit: KTVU)

An 88-year-old jewelry shop owner is recovering after being shoved to the ground by one of the suspects who raided his store in a smash-and-grab robbery caught on camera.

The heist took place just after 2 p.m. Friday at Kim Hung Jewelry in San Jose, California, local KTVU reported. Surveillance video from the scene showed a group of suspects backing an SUV into the store's glass windows before more than a dozen of them, dressed in clothes hiding their appearance, rushed in.

While most of the suspects could be seen grabbing items from display cases, one pushed over the store owner who was trying to stop them from taking merchandise.

As some of the group left the shop, one could be seen pointing a gun at another employee who was standing near a wall. Another suspect then appeared to check the employee's pockets.

The entire group quickly fled once a car horn blared outside.

"If this was your family member, if this was your business that you spent your whole lifetime to build up, and then within one hour you're out of business," San Jose City Councilmember Bien Doan said during a Colation for Community Engagement news conference, KTVU reported.

"We no longer accept the norm. We ask for change," he said. 

The victim's family was also at the news conference, and said the shop owner suffered a stroke, as well as injuries from broken glass. He spent the night in the hospital, but reportedly was later determined to be in stable condition and released.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — More than 350 Greenlandic Indigenous women and girls, including some 12 years old and younger, reported that they were forcibly given contraception by Danish health authorities in cases that date back to the 1960s, according to an independent investigation's findings released Tuesday.

The Inuit victims, many of them teenagers at the time, were either fitted with intrauterine contraceptive devices, known as IUDs or coils, or given a hormonal birth control injection. They were not told details about the procedure, or did not give their consent.

The victims described traumatic experiences that left some with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, ranging from pain and bleeding to serious infections.

The governments of Denmark and Greenland officially apologized in a statement last month for their roles in the historic mistreatment in an apparent attempt to get ahead of the highly anticipated report. An official apology event in Greenland's capital is set for Sept. 24.

Nearly 150 Inuit women last year sued Denmark and filed compensation claims against its health ministry, saying Danish health authorities violated their human rights. That case remains ongoing.

While Tuesday's report covers the experiences of more than 350 women who came forward to speak to the investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls — reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time — received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s.




The alleged purpose was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care.

Greenland took over its own health care programs on Jan. 1, 1992.

The investigation's conclusion comes as Greenland is in the headlines alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he seeks U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland. He has not ruled out a military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.

The leaders of Denmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. Denmark's foreign minister recently summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country for talks after the main national broadcaster reported that at least three people with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland.

Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark's crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity.

The forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanized Greenlanders and their families.

The policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for reeducation and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families.

The investigators received reports from 354 Greenlandic women who were between 48 and 89 years old when they spoke to authorities for the independent investigation, which began June 1, 2023 following a media outcry. 

Almost all victims were between 12 and 37 years old at the time. One girl was under 12, but her exact age was not made public in Tuesday's report due to anonymity concerns. The vast majority of the procedures occurred in Greenland.

An attorney representing some of the victims could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.

A group of 10 North Carolina Republicans is calling for the removal of state Magistrate Judge Teresa Stokes, accusing her of misconduct after she released a repeat offender who allegedly went on to kill a 23-year-old woman on a Charlotte light rail train.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, obtained by the Washington Examiner, 10 Republican members of Congress urged formal removal proceedings under North Carolina law, citing what they called “willful and persistent failure” by Stokes to protect the public. They said her decision to release DeCarlos Brown Jr. without bond earlier this year directly enabled the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte Area Transit System.

“North Carolina's justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” Rep. Tim Moore (R-NC) said. “She came to Charlotte looking for safety and a better life, but instead, she was brutally murdered by a repeat offender who never should've been let back on the streets. Judge Stokes had the chance to protect the public and chose not to.”

Brown, 34, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was arrested in January after repeatedly calling 911 and insisting that officers examine what he described as “man-made” substances inside his body that he believed were controlling his movements. When police declined to investigate, Brown became agitated and was charged with a misdemeanor, according to reports.

Seven months later, Brown is now charged in the Aug. 22 stabbing death of Zarutska, who fled Ukraine in 2022 following Russia's invasion. Footage of the stabbing incident released this week launched a flurry of criticism over the handling of his 911 misuse case, prompting politicians and pundits to question how someone such as Brown would be allowed to walk free despite his history of violent conduct and erratic behavior.

“What happened on the light rail in Charlotte is a tragedy that never should have happened,” Rep. Addison McDowell (R-NC) said. “Teresa Stokes has failed the people and must be removed. She's proven she can't do the job and has lost the trust of the public.”

Other lawmakers tied the case to a broader trend of leniency in urban court systems.

“Magistrate Stokes' rulings highlight exactly why liberal soft-on-crime policies are failing our communities locally and nationwide,” Rep. David Rouzer (R-NC) said. “When lenient laws meet lenient judges, public safety takes a back seat.”

The lawmakers urged Wiggins to begin proceedings under North Carolina General Statute § 7A-173, which allows a magistrate to be removed for failure to perform official duties or for conduct that brings the judicial office into disrepute. They also requested a review of Stokes's bond decisions in other cases.

“Why would a judge knowingly let a repeat criminal with serious mental issues out on our streets?” Rep. Mark Harris (R-NC) added. “Pro-crime judges must be held responsible for their failure to carry out the most basic, commonsense duties. We must ensure there are no future Iryna Zarutskas.”

The controversy has expanded across state lines. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), a Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, called for Democratic Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles to resign and warned South Carolinians to avoid the city.

“Mayor Lyles should resign,” Norman said. “Her statements of concern for this assailant make her unfit to lead a major city.”

Lyles has called the murder a “tragic situation” that “sheds light on problems with society safety nets related to mental healthcare and the systems that should be in place,” according to WSOC-TV, but has defended the CATS as “by and large a safe transit system.”

JUDGE WHO RELEASED CHARLOTTE LIGHT RAIL KILLER HAS HISTORY OF ADDICTION ACTIVISM

Stokes has not responded to the congressional letter. The Washington Examiner reached out to her and Wiggins for comment.

TYLERTOWN, Miss. (AP) — As an ominous storm approached Buddy Anthony's new home, he took shelter in his Ford F-250 pickup parked under a nearby carport.

Seconds later, a tornado tore apart the one-story brick house and damaged the truck while lifting it partly in the air. Anthony emerged unhurt. But he had to replace his vehicle with a used truck that became his home while waiting for President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration allowing federal money to flow to individuals reeling from loss. That took weeks.

“You wake up in the truck and look out the windshield and see nothing. That's hard. That's hard to swallow,” Anthony said. 

Disaster survivors are having to wait longer to get aid from the federal government, according to a new Associated Press analysis of decades of data. On average, it took less than two weeks for a governor's request for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. It's taking more than a month, on average, so far during Trump's current term, the AP found.

The delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure. The AP collaborated with Mississippi Today and Mississippi Free Press on the effects of these delays for this report. 

“The message that I get in the delay, particularly for the individual assistance, is that the federal government has turned its back on its own people,” said Bob Griffin, dean of the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University at Albany in New York. “It's a fundamental shift in the position of this country.”

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Trump is making sure federal tax dollars “are spent wisely to supplement state actions, not replace them,” during disasters. 




“President Trump provides a more thorough review of disaster declaration requests than any Administration has before him,” Jackson said in a statement to the AP. “Gone are the days of rubber stamping FEMA recommendations — that's not a bug, that's a feature.”

Americans expect government help after disasters. About three-fourths of people want the U.S. government to play a major role in providing aid to communities and helping them rebuild after natural disasters, according to a June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency often consults immediately with communities to coordinate their initial disaster response. But direct payments to individuals, nonprofits and local governments must wait for a major disaster declaration from the president, who first must receive a request from a state, territory or tribe. Major disaster declarations are intended only for the most damaging events that are beyond the resources of states and local governments. 

Trump has approved more than two dozen major disaster declarations since taking office in January, with an average wait of almost 34 days after a request. That ranged from a one-day turnaround after July's deadly flash flooding in Texas to a 67-day wait after a request for aid because of a Michigan ice storm. The average wait is up from a 24-day delay during his first term and is nearly four times as long as the average for former Republican President George H.W. Bush, whose term from 1989-1993 coincided with the implementation of a new federal law setting parameters for disaster determinations.

The delays have grown over time, regardless of the party in power. Former Democratic President Joe Biden, in his last year in office, averaged 26 days to declare major disasters — longer than any year under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

FEMA did not respond to the AP's questions about what factors are contributing to the trend.

Others familiar with FEMA noted that its process for assessing and documenting natural disasters has become more complex over time. Disasters have also become more frequent and intense because of climate change, which is mostly caused by the burning of fuels such as gas, coal and oil.

The wait for disaster declarations has spiked as Trump's administration undertakes an ambitious makeover of the federal government that has shed thousands of workers and reexamined the role of FEMA. A recently published letter from current and former FEMA employees warned the cuts could become debilitating if faced with a large-enough disaster. The letter also lamented that the Trump administration has stopped maintaining or removed long-term planning tools focused on extreme weather and disasters.

Shortly after taking office, Trump floated the idea of “getting rid” of FEMA, asserting: “It's very bureaucratic, and it's very slow.”

FEMA's acting chief suggested more recently that states should shoulder more responsibility for disaster recovery, though FEMA thus far has continued to cover three-fourths of the costs of public assistance to local governments, as required under federal law. FEMA pays the full cost of its individual assistance. 

Former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who served during Trump's first term, said the extra scrutiny on requests for disaster declarations is “probably the right thing to do, because I think the declaration process has become the `easy button' for states.”

The tornado that struck Anthony's home in rural Tylertown on March 15 packed winds up to 140 mph (225 km/hr). It was part of a powerful storm system that wrecked homes, businesses and lives across multiple states.

Mississippi's governor requested a federal disaster declaration on April 1. Trump granted that request 50 days later, on May 21, while approving aid for both individuals and public entities. 

On that same day, Trump also approved eight other major disaster declarations for storms, floods or fires in seven other states. In most cases, more than a month had passed since the requests and about two months since the date of those disasters.

On July 22, Trump issued another big batch of major disaster declarations covering seven states. Those included requests related to March storms in Michigan and Oregon that took about two months for governors to submit and an additional two months to approve. 

If a presidential declaration and federal money had come sooner, Anthony said he wouldn't have needed to spend weeks sleeping in a truck before he could afford to rent the trailer where he is now living. His house was uninsured, Anthony said, and FEMA eventually gave him $30,000.




In nearby Jayess, Dana Grimes had insurance but not enough to cover the full value of her damaged home. After the eventual federal declaration, Grimes said FEMA provided about $750 for emergency expenses, but she is now waiting for the agency to determine whether she can receive more. 

“We couldn't figure out why the president took so long to help people in this country,” Grimes said. “I just want to tie up strings and move on. But FEMA — I'm still fooling with FEMA.”

Jonathan Young said he gave up on applying for FEMA aid after the Tylertown tornado killed his 7-year-old son and destroyed their home. The process seemed too difficult, and federal officials wanted paperwork he didn't have, Young said. He made ends meet by working for those cleaning up from the storm.

“It's a therapy for me,” Young said, “to pick up the debris that took my son away from me.”



Historically, presidential disaster declarations containing individual assistance have been approved more quickly than those providing assistance only to public entities, according to the AP's analysis. That remains the case under Trump, though declarations for both types are taking longer. 

About half the major disaster declarations approved by Trump this year have included individual assistance. 

Some people whose homes are damaged turn to shelters hosted by churches or local nonprofit organizations in the initial chaotic days after a disaster. Others stay with friends or family or go to a hotel, if they can afford it. 

But some insist on staying in damaged homes, even if they are unsafe, said Chris Smith, who administered FEMA's individual assistance division under three presidents from 2015-2022. If homes aren't repaired properly, mold can grow, compounding the recovery challenges.

That's why it's critical for FEMA's individual assistance to get approved quickly — ideally, within two weeks of a disaster, said Smith, who's now a disaster consultant for governments and companies.

“You want to keep the people where they are living. You want to ensure those communities are going to continue to be viable and recover,” Smith said. “And the earlier that individual assistance can be delivered ... the earlier recovery can start.”

After the Tylertown tornado, faith-based groups served food and laid tarps on homes while local residents helped each other with power saws to clear downed trees.

“That's the only thing that got us through this storm, neighbors helping neighbors,” said Les Lampton, a volunteer firefighter and insurance agent in Walthall County, where Tylertown is located. “If we waited on the government, we were going to be in bad shape.”



Unlike individual assistance programs that provide cash upfront, FEMA's public assistance programs reimburse governmental entities only after their bills are paid — and only if they followed guidelines for hiring and documenting the work. 

Because that process can take months or years, a delay in a presidential disaster declaration may have little effect on when a local government ultimately gets reimbursed. 

But delayed approvals still can carry consequences. Long waits can stoke uncertainty and lead cost-conscious local officials to pause or scale-back their recovery efforts. 

In Walthall County, officials initially spent about $700,000 cleaning up debris, then suspended the cleanup for more than a month because they couldn't afford to spend more without assurance they would receive federal reimbursement, said Royce McKee, the county emergency manager. Meanwhile, rubble from splintered trees and shattered homes remained piled along the roadside, creating unsafe obstacles for motorists and habitat for snakes and rodents. 

When it received the federal declaration, Walthall County took out a multi-million-dollar loan to pay contractors to resume the cleanup.

“We're going to pay interest and pay that money back until FEMA pays us,” said Byran Martin, an elected county supervisor. “We're hopeful that we'll get some money by the first of the year, but people are telling us that it could be (longer).”

The night before the Tylertown tornado, a twister also tore through Rolla, Missouri, a college town of about 20,000 people. It knocked out electricity for 80% of the municipal utility's customers and damaged 120 power poles.

Crews worked to restore power within a couple weeks, racking up hefty bills paid from the utility's reserve funds. As the wait for a presidential disaster declaration kept growing, “we were getting a little nervous,” said Rodney Bourne, general manager of Rolla Municipal Utilities.

The utility now is seeking FEMA reimbursement for about $1 million, intentionally holding its claim just under the agency's large-project threshold in hopes of expediting the process, he said. 

Delays in federal declarations also can force local officials to choose between needed repairs — perhaps fixing some roads and culverts washed out by floods while delaying other projects, said David Fogerson, a public safety consultant who retired last year as Nevada's emergency management chief.

“For a lot of the smaller states and smaller jurisdictions, when you get that, `Yep, this is a disaster declaration, we've got federal money coming,' it helps you feel better, more confident about spending that money,” he said.

Israel launched a strike on Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they discussed a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, officials said.

Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they considered a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally marked a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages.

Qatar, an energy-rich U.S. ally hosting thousands of American troops, has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas for several years, even before the war.

Qatar's Interior Ministry said Tuesday one of its security personnel was killed in the attack.

The future of the long-stalled ceasefire talks was more uncertain, as Israel gears up for a major offensive aimed at taking over Gaza City. That escalation has been met with heavy international condemnation and opposition within Israel from those who fear it will doom the remaining hostages.

What to know: 



Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the attack targeting Hamas leadership as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.

The ministry said in a statement that Pakistan is in “complete solidarity” with Qatar and urged the international community to hold Israel accountable.

It called the attack “provocative and reckless” and said it shows Israel's “continued disregard for international peace and security.” 

Pakistan reaffirmed its support for Qatar's sovereignty and territorial integrity, vowing to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Gulf nation's leadership and people.

Benjamin Netanyahu told a U.S. Embassy party that Israel acted “wholly independently” and takes “full responsibility.”

“This action can open the door to an end of the war,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump's latest ceasefire proposal could end the war immediately.

Qatar's Interior Ministry said in a statement that a member of Qatar's Internal Security Force was killed.

Other security personnel were hurt, it added.

It did not offer any details about the status of Hamas officials at the site.

After the Israeli attack, the embassy sent an alert telling its staff and all U.S. citizens in the country to shelter-in-place.

It lifted all restrictions hours later, but advised all American staff and visitors in Doha to “remain vigilant.”

Annalena Baerbock called Israel's attack in Qatar an escalation of the conflict in Gaza and “obviously concerning.” 

Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, stressed that all 193 U.N. member nations are required by the U.N. Charter to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country.

She called for intensified diplomatic efforts toward an immediate and permanent ceasefire, improved humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza by the Israeli government, and the release of all hostages held by Hamas.

Baerbock spoke shortly after taking the oath of office to become president of the 80th session of the General Assembly, which ends in September 2026.

The U.S. military did not participate in the Israeli strikes that took place in Doha, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Pentagon has directed questions to the White House, where officials didn't immediately respond.

Syria's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leadership represented “a dangerous escalation that would undermine security and stability in the region.”

The ministry called the attack “a blatant violation of international law and the sovereignty of the sisterly State of Qatar.”

Qatar has been a strong supporter of the interim government in Syria since former Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive in December. 

Israel has been suspicious of Syria's new Islamist-led authorities, and Israeli forces have seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites since Assad's fall.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Israeli strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar. The strike on Tuesday was a further widening of Israel's campaign against the militant group, as negotiations over ending the war in the Gaza Strip appear stalemated before a new military offensive there.



Israel alerted the U.S. ahead of time, according to an Israeli official, a White House official and another person familiar with the matter. The White House official would not say if Washington provided Israel with approval for carrying out the strike, but another U.S. official said the American military did not participate.

All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Pentagon officials referred questions about coordination to the White House. And the White House officials did not respond to request for comment. 

It was not clear how much warning was provided or whether the U.S. expressed approval for the strike.

Congressional leaders appeared caught off guard by Israel's strike.

“I'm not sure about that development,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked about the situation at his weekly press conference Tuesday. “We'll have to reserve judgement.”

Senate leaders Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican John Thune made no mention of the strikes in their opening remarks as the chamber convened.

It was unclear if they had been briefed ahead of the action.

“We have to pray a lot and continue to work and try to insist” on an end to the hostilities, Pope Leo XIV told Italy's RAI television.

“The whole situation is really serious,” Leo said. 

Leo and the Vatican's top diplomats met Israeli President Isaac Herzog last week, when he called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and entry of humanitarian aid to famine-stricken Palestinians there. 

The Vatican told Herzog a two-state solution was the “only way out of the war,” according to a Vatican statement at the time.

The first American pope also said Tuesday that he tried without success to contact the parish priest at the Catholic church in Gaza. The priest decided against evacuating, choosing instead to remain with Palestinians sheltering in the church.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said the Israeli strikes were “part of a series of attacks committed by Israel, demonstrating its insistence on undermining all efforts made to achieve stability and security in the countries of the region and the safety of its people.”

Since a ceasefire nominally put an end to the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November, Israel has continued to launch near-daily strikes in Lebanon.

Aoun urged “the international community to put an end to these Israeli practices that continue to violate all international laws and agreements and obstruct every commendable effort made by the State of Qatar to establish peace in the region and put an end to the suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people.”

The Egyptian presidency said in a statement that the attack “targeted a meeting of Palestinian leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement” in Gaza.

“This attack sets a serious precedent and an unacceptable development, and constitutes a direct assault on the sovereignty of the sisterly State of Qatar, which plays a pivotal role in mediation efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip,” it said.

When asked if the British government had been told, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares, pointed to a statement by Israel's prime minister saying the attack was a solely an Israeli operation.

Pares called Hamas “a vile terrorist organization,” but did not directly criticize the Israeli attack.

“We do not want to see a further escalation in violence which risks further destabilization in the region. Our overarching priority is to see an end to the horrific suffering in Gaza,” he said.

Starmer is scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Wednesday. Pares said the British leader would use the meeting to “raise the intolerable situation in Gaza and the action Israel must take to end the horrific suffering.”

In a phone call with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described Israel's attack on Doha as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law.”

He offered Saudi Arabia's “full solidarity” with Qatar.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the strikes, describing them as “evidence of Israel's expansionist policies and its adoption of terrorism of state strategy.”

The ministry's statement expressed Turkey's solidarity with Qatar and renewed a call on the international community to exert pressure to halt Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories and the wider region.

Omer Celik, the spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party, described the attack as a “barbaric act of terrorism.”

Mohammed al-frah a member of the Houthis' political office, posted his condemnation of the attack on X, saying Israel and the United States are fully responsible.

“This cowardly operation was nothing but a deliberate assassination attempt against the negotiating delegation, a despicable effort to eliminate any prospect for peace, and an execution of any diplomatic hope in the region,” he said.

According to the Houthi-run SABA news agency, Mahdi al-Mashat, head of the Houthis' supreme political council that runs rebel-held areas in Yemen, also commented. 

He said the attack was a “blatant statement that violates the sovereignty of a state ... and sounds the alarm bell for all Arab and Islamic countries, so pay attention before it is too late.”

Iraq's foreign ministry said in a statement that this “cowardly act represents a flagrant violation” of Qatar's sovereignty and poses a threat to its security and stability.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterates Iraq's firm position in standing with the government and people of the sisterly State of Qatar, and fully supporting it in confronting any attacks that undermine its sovereignty or threaten its national security,” the statement read.

Danny Danon defended his country's strike on Hamas' headquarters in Doha, saying “there is no hiding place for terrorists.”

“The precise strike in Doha targeted senior Hamas leaders who planned the October 7 massacre and celebrated while our citizens were abducted,” Danon posted on X. “I commend our security forces for this courageous and precise operation.”

Spain's Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Tuesday that his government is prohibiting the entry of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister, and Bezalel Smotrich, its finance minister.

In a televised address Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Israel's attacks in Gaza an “extermination of a defenseless people.”

Israel banned the entrance of two of Spain's ministers in response to that speech.

Sánchez also announced he was formalizing an arms embargo on Israel and prohibiting ships carrying fuel for Israel's armed forces from using Spanish ports.

“We are just learning about the Israeli attacks in Qatar, a country that has been playing a very positive role to achieve a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,” Guterres told reporters at a press conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York. 

“I condemn this flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” he said, adding “all parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.”

“Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it and Israel takes full responsibility,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

It remains unclear what regional reaction will come from the strike. Immediately afterward, Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan wrote online: “Full solidarity with our dear Qatar.” That comes as the United Arab Emirates has already warned Israel that its possible annexation of the West Bank threatened the Abraham Accords, an agreement by which Abu Dhabi normalized relations with Israel five years ago. 

In a statement, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abou Gheit said the attack violated Qatar's sovereignty.

He said Israel “does not care about the consequences of its shameful actions.”

The assault marks the second time the energy-rich nation has been directly attacked in the nearly two years of war that have gripped the wider Middle East since Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — even as it has served as a key negotiator in efforts to end the conflict. It also calls into question whether any negotiations will immediately continue.

The U.S. Embassy in Qatar said that it had “instituted a shelter-in-place order for their facilities.”

“U.S. citizens are advised to shelter-in-place,” it added.

An official in Egypt, which also has been meditating a potential ceasefire, told the AP that the strike came when a meeting by Hamas officials over the talks had been scheduled for the site. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters.

Earlier this week, Trump said that he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regarding a possible ceasefire, as Arab officials described a new U.S. proposal. A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said that it would discuss the proposal and respond within days.

The proposal, presented by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, calls for a negotiated end of the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza once the hostages are released and a ceasefire is established, according to Egyptian and Hamas officials familiar with the talks, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door discussions.

Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar, officials said, further widening its campaign against the militant group.

Black smoke rose over the skyline of the Qatari capital, Doha, with authorities there acknowledging the strike. It wasn't immediately clear if anyone was hurt in the attack, marking the second time the energy-rich nation has been directly attacked in the nearly two years of war that have gripped the wider Middle East since Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

It wasn't immediately clear how the attack was carried out, though an Israeli military spokesman referred to Israel's air force carrying out the strike. Qatar Airways continued landing in Doha amid the strike, even as at least one Qatari air force aircraft took off on patrol over the country.

A Colorado man died on Sunday after his car went over the edge of the rim at Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park and plunged hundreds of feet, authorities said.

Park rangers learned at around 12:40 p.m. that a car with a single occupant had plunged over the rim near South Kaibab Trailhead, the National Park Service (NPS) said Monday.

Rangers immediately responded and recovered his body 300 feet below the rim.

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — Suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, who was found guilty earlier this year of sexually abusing a minor, was detained by police on Tuesday and admitted into a clinic in the Dominican Republic for mental health issues, according to authorities.

The request to have him detained and admitted came from his family, police spokesman Col. Diego Pesqueira told The Associated Press. He noted that Franco's admittance into a private clinic in his hometown of Baní is not linked to any legal issues.

Last weekend, the 24-year-old player took to social media to denounce that $16,000 had supposedly been stolen from a resort where he was staying.

His attorney, Teodosio Jáquez, later said there was confusion over the incident and that the money was found. Franco, however, rejected his attorney's remarks and insisted the money had been stolen.

In June, Franco was convicted of sexually abusing a minor and was given a two-year suspended sentence.

He had been arrested in 2024 after being accused of having a four-month relationship with a girl who was 14 at the time, and of transferring thousands of dollars to her mother to consent to the illegal relationship.

Franco's future in the MLB is unknown, although he has said he is still training.

In November 2021, Franco signed an 11-year, $182 million contract, but his career was abruptly interrupted in August 2023, when Dominican authorities announced they were investigating him..




Franco was arrested again in November last year following what Dominican authorities called an altercation over a woman's attention. He was charged with illegally carrying a semiautomatic Glock 19 that police said was registered to his uncle.

That case is still pending in court.

Six months after his arrest in 2024, Tampa Bay placed him on the restricted list, which cut off the pay he had been receiving while on administrative leave.

He was placed on that list because he didn't report to the team and would need a new U.S. visa to do so.

Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on ICE launching Operation Midway Blitz targeting criminal illegal immigrants throughout Chicago.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago this week, arresting multiple criminal illegal immigrants as Fox News joined agents for an exclusive ride-along.

On Tuesday, ICE agents arrested a Mexican national on a federal criminal arrest warrant for multiple felony re-entries into the United States. Fox News learned that the individual had been deported twice to Mexico and returned a third time to the U.S. He is also facing charges for assault in a previous case.

Fox News cameras followed agents as they approached the Mexican national outside his home. The individual tried to enter his car to avoid arrest, forcing ICE agents to break its window and extract him from the vehicle. He then appears to continue resisting arrest.

The Mexican national will face federal criminal prosecution before he is deported, potentially spending time in jail, Fox News learned.

On Monday, Fox News followed ICE agents as they apprehended a 43-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico who was convicted last year of forcibly sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13. He remains in custody.

The operation has already resulted in multiple arrests, and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News that they will "continue going after the worst of the worst."

"These criminal aliens have wreaked havoc on the American people for years and that time is over," ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News. "And even when we have pushback from Democratic leadership, that's not going to stop us."

The Department of Homeland Security announced that the operation is being done in honor of 20-yr-old Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk-driving hit-and-run crash in Illinois earlier this year that was caused by an illegal migrant from Guatemala.

Katie's dad, Joe Abraham, appeared on "FOX & Friends" earlier Tuesday, saying he hoped Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and other leaders would work with the Trump administration to keep the state's streets safe.

"My daughter was taken, we are separated, I will never see her again," he said. "She got death, I got a life sentence."

The operation is being carried out with other federal partners, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

The operation is expected to last weeks, like May's Operation Patriot in Boston which resulted in over 1,500 criminal alien apprehensions.

Israel launched a strike on Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they discussed a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, officials said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they considered a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally marked a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages.

Qatar, an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops, has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the 22-month-old war and even before. It condemned what it referred to as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha.

The son of Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas' leader for Gaza and top negotiator, was killed along with the head of al-Hayya's office, said Suheil al-Hindi, a member of Hamas' political bureau, speaking to Al-Jazeera. A member of Qatar's Internal Security Force was killed and others were wounded, Qatar's Interior Ministry said.

Hamas has survived numerous assassinations of top leaders and still shows cohesion in Gaza, despite having suffered major blows in Israel's campaign, triggered by the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

The future of the long-stalled ceasefire talks as more uncertain, as Israel gears up for a major offensive aimed at taking over Gaza City. That escalation has been met with heavy international condemnation and opposition within Israel from those who fear it will doom the remaining hostages.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack, saying “all parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.” 

Israel has long threatened to strike Hamas leaders wherever they are. While it has often welcomed Qatar's role as a mediator, alongside Egypt, it has also accused the Gulf nation of not putting enough pressure on the group.

In contrast to previous Israeli operations against senior militants abroad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to publicly claim the strike, saying: “Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it and Israel takes full responsibility.”

He said the decision was taken Monday after a shooting attack in Jerusalem that killed six people and an attack on Israeli forces in Gaza that killed four soldiers.

Israel alerted the U.S. ahead of time, according to an Israeli official, a White House official and another person familiar with the matter. The White House official would not say if Washington provided Israel with approval for carrying out the strike, but another U.S. official said the American military did not participate.

All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

The Israeli military said it used “precise munitions and additional intelligence” in the strike, without elaborating. It was not immediately clear how it carried out the attack.

Qatar condemned what it referred to as a “cowardly Israeli attack” on Hamas' political headquarters in Doha. Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari called it a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” and said Qatar “will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior.”

Egypt, another key mediator with Hamas, condemned the attack, saying it targeted Palestinian leaders who had met “to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement.” It said the strike was a “direct assault” on Qatar's sovereignty.

The main group representing families of the hostages expressed “deep concern and great fear” after the strike. “The prospect of their return now faces greater uncertainty than ever, with one thing absolutely certain — their time is running out,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.

The U.S. embassy in Qatar briefly instituted a shelter-in-place order for its staff, but later lifted that.

Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regarding a possible ceasefire, as the U.S. advanced a new proposal that Arab officials said included the immediate release of all the hostages.

A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said it would discuss the proposal and respond within days.

An Egyptian official said the strike came when a meeting by Hamas officials over the talks had been scheduled for the site. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters.

The proposal, presented by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, calls for a negotiated end of the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza once the hostages are released and a ceasefire is established. That's according to Egyptian and Hamas officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door discussions.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying the war will continue until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control over Gaza.

Mediators had previously focused on brokering a temporary ceasefire and the release of some hostages, with the two sides then holding talks on a more permanent truce. Witkoff walked away from those talks in July, after which Hamas accepted a proposal that mediators said was almost identical to an earlier one that Israel had approved.

The war in Gaza has already left Israel increasingly isolated internationally, with even many of its Western allies calling for it to end the war and do more to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine.

Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, expressed “full solidarity with our dear Qatar” shortly after the attack. 

The United Arab Emirates recently warned Israel that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would threaten the Abraham Accords, a landmark agreement brokered by Trump during his first term in which the two nations normalized relations.

Trump hopes to expand those accords to include regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, but those prospects have dimmed as the war has ground on.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described the strike as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law” in a phone call with Qatar's ruler.

The Israeli government gave the White House advance notice of its Tuesday morning strike against Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar.

A senior White House official confirmed to the Washington Examiner that Israel gave President Donald Trump and his national security team “advance notice” of the airstrike but did not say if Israel asked Trump to sign off on the operation.

Israeli Foreign Minister Ron Dermer additionally met with Trump's Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and former White House adviser, on Monday in Miami, Florida.

However, Axios reported on Tuesday morning that the notice was given to the White House as the missiles were being launched.

Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA) voiced displeasure to the Washington Examiner that the administration did not immediately communicate to lawmakers that the strike was occurring.

In a statement, the Israeli government referred to the strike as “a wholly independent Israeli operation.”

The Israel Defense Forces did not initially identify the specific targets of Tuesday's strike but said the leaders who were struck “led the terror organization's activities for years and are directly responsible for carrying out the October 7 massacre and managing the war against the State of Israel.”

Hamas leaders reportedly gathered in Qatar, which has been acting as a third-party mediator alongside the United States, to discuss the Trump administration's latest ceasefire proposal and hostage return.

Trump warned on Sunday that he would not tolerate Hamas rejecting another ceasefire.

“Everyone wants the Hostages HOME. Everyone wants this War to end! The Israelis have accepted my Terms,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

The Qatari Embassy in Washington, D.C. sent a letter to Congress Tuesday afternoon claiming that Israel's strike “clearly was designed to undermine the peace negotiations in which the United States and Qatar are collaborating closely.”

ISRAEL TARGETS HAMAS LEADERSHIP IN ‘PRECISE' QATAR STRIKE

“Despite conflicting media accounts, we are confident that this was a unilateral military strike conducted by Israeli forces, without advance consultation of the United States,” the statement reads. “An unprovoked military attack on a sovereign state, a Major Non-NATO ally of the United States that hosts a large presence of American military forces and American civilians, is unacceptable and must be condemned.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demanded that the United States respond to a "brutally savage" Russian strike that he said left more than 20 people dead.

"Directly on people. Ordinary civilians. At the very moment when pensions were being disbursed," Zelenskyy said of the attack in a post on X.

The strike hit the rural town of Yarova in the Donetsk region. While Russia has denied targeting civilians, tens of thousands have been killed since Moscow's February 2022 invasion, Reuters reported.

"The Russians continue destroying lives while avoiding new strong sanctions and new strong blows," Zelenskyy added. "The world must not remain silent. The world must not remain idle... Strong actions are needed to make Russia stop bringing death."

Donetsk Gov. Vadym Filashkin said the strike was not a "military operation," but rather that it was "pure terrorism," according to the Kyiv Independent, which cited his Telegram channel.

Zelenskyy specifically called out the U.S., Europe and the G-20 in his post on X following the strike, which included a graphic video of the carnage.

Notably, Zelenskyy did not name NATO. His demand for action from Europe and the G-20 comes as NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte travels to the United Kingdom, where he will attend a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, according to NATO.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST ATTACK ON UKRAINE THIS MONTH FOLLOWING TRUMP'S MEETINGS WITH PUTIN, ZELENSKYY

The White House has yet to respond to the strike or Zelenskyy's demand. However, the Trump administration has made ending the brutal Russia-Ukraine war a priority, with President Donald Trump meeting with both Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Last month, Trump and Putin met face-to-face in the first meeting between the Russian leader and a U.S. president since 2021. After the high-stakes meeting, Trump and Putin seemed confident that they had made progress toward peace despite not reaching the ceasefire deal that many had hoped for.

ZELENSKYY ACCUSES TRUMP OF GIVING PUTIN 'WHAT HE WANTED' AT ALASKA SUMMIT

Zelenskyy seemed less convinced, and he recently accused Trump of giving Putin "what he wanted" at the Alaska summit.

"It's a pity that Ukraine was not there, because I think President Trump gave Putin what he wanted," Zelenskyy told ABC's Martha Raddatz on Sept. 7.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss the not guilty verdict for Daniel Penny, the Menendez brothers' resentencing, and backlash against liberal district attorneys.

FIRST ON FOX: A little-known consulting firm is quietly steering the policies and messaging of dozens of progressive prosecutors nationwide, according to a searing report exclusively obtained and reviewed by Fox News Digital.

The Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF), a pro-police nonprofit based out of Virginia, is publishing a report Tuesday alleging that a liberal group focused on criminal justice reform called the Wren Collective has helped guide and shape the offices of at least 40 progressive prosecutors across 22 states on their "policies, public communications, and legal decisions," according to the report exclusively obtained by Fox Digital titled, "Outsourcing Justice."

The report outlines the influence — both direct and indirect — that the Wren Collective has allegedly had in both the campaigns and subsequent policy priorities for certain district attorneys, including at least 40, whom the report alleges held cozy relationships with the group, such as joining weekly meetings to talk communication strategy, heeding advice on specific policy issues or even signing a non-disclosure agreement over a DA's professional relationship with the group.

The Wren Collective is a for-profit organization founded in 2020 by Jessica Brand, a Texas-based attorney who serves as the group's executive director. Its aim is to "replace ineffective and often disingenuous solutions to crime and safety with solutions that support victims," according to the website, and is bolstered by a team of policy and legal experts who "design, promote, and defend policies and practices grounded in evidence and compassion."

But the report in question alleges a certain level of influence exerted by the group that goes beyond its stated priorities.

Among other things, the report accuses the group of engaging in an "influence-peddling operation," in part by increasing the access and engagement that certain donors or "well-connected" activists had with the district attorneys' offices in question, arguing that it "demonstrates that these elected prosecutors' actions are shaped not by their own ideas or by those of voters and local stakeholders," but are instead pursued "at the behest" of a certain few.

The LELDF report found that since 2015, there have been roughly 100 progressive district attorneys elected to office across the country, with Wren Collective staffers allegedly "embedded" in at least 40 of the offices, based on documents researchers compiled via Freedom of Information Act requests and other public documents showing a cozy relationship between the group and liberal prosecutors.

The report identified "hatchlings" of the Wren Collective – which LELDF defined as left-wing DAs tied to the consultancy group – such as former San Francisco DA Chesa Boudin, former Los Angeles DA George Gascon, and Travis County, Texas, DA Jose Garza.

"Based on public information requests (totaling over 50,000 pages of emails and text messages), campaign finance filings, and tax documents, this study demonstrates [how] a handful of left-wing social justice organizations, with significant ties to campaign donors, hold immense influence over these prosecutors through The Wren Collective's consulting service," the report alleges.

The report pointed to one email exchange in particular that "explains it all," and shows the alleged cozy ties between the group and the services it can provide to prosecutors.

An email sent in June 2020 by a Wren Collective attorney to Multnomah County (Portland) DA-elect Mike Schmidt and his policy advisor included two justice-related model policies on how to abolish bail and reduce jail populations that the group "wrote for Virginia commonwealth attorneys," as well as a lengthy list of examples of how the group could help the incoming DA.

SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WARNS KAREN READ SUPPORTERS' BEHAVIOR IS 'ANTITHESIS OF JUSTICE'

"In addition to assistance with staffing issues, office organization, and communications support during policy roll-out and in times of crisis, we have written and could help with policies in the following areas:1. Bail2. Diversion/Declination3. Intake4. Probation5. Plea guidelines6. Fines and Fees7. Prosecutions related to policing8. Brady (related to officer misconduct) and "do not call" or exclusion lists9. Conviction integrity or sentencing review units10. Juvenile transfer11. Felony and Misdemeanor case backlog"

The email continued, according to the report, highlighting that the Wren Collective assists DAs in such matters "without any billing or publicity" while adding "these policies will be yours, not ours."

All in, the report includes documents from 23 open records requests, out of a total of 65 requests made, alongside publicly available documents and previous FOIA documents to "cross-reference names and communications to build out a list of 40 progressive prosecutors who themselves or their staff communicated regularly, and substantively directly with The Wren Collective or Jessica Brand on policy, communications, and legal strategy."

Brand defended the Wren Collective's work in an emailed comment to Fox News on Monday when asked about the report, while critiquing LELDF for publishing the report.

LEFT-WING ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE HOT SEAT AS ANTI-ICE RIOTS TRIGGER INVESTIGATION: 'NOT PROTECTED SPEECH'

"Wren has spent five years proudly working with prosecutors and law enforcement on policies that reduce crime and improve community safety. I have not seen the report, but Wren's work is no secret and they could have just gone to our website, which makes clear what we do. Our team is also regularly quoted in major media outlets about our work. It is strange that, when there are major mental health challenges in law enforcement and a recruitment crisis, this organization wants to focus on Wren and what LEDLF surely knows is common practice – among conservative and progressive organizations alike who work with these offices – rather than how to help officers," she said.

Loudoun County Commonwealth's Attorney Buta Biberaj (Loudoun.gov)

On crisis communications, the Wren Collective allegedly helped shape former Loudon County, Virginia, Commonwealth Attorney Buta Biberaj's handling of the high-profile sexual assault case on a female student in an Ashburn high school by a biological male student. The case became national news in 2021 when the girl's father, Scott Smith, railed against the school's failure to protect his daughter during a school board meeting and was subsequently seen in viral footage dragged out of the meeting by law enforcement officials.

A Circuit Court judge booted Biberaj from an appeal case stemming from Smith's arrest due to "concerns" over "impartiality" in September 2022, with the Wren Collective swooping in to assist Biberaj with communication strategy shortly after, documents included in the report allege.

"I hope you're doing okay," a Wren Collective staffer wrote in an email on Sept. 19, 2022, and addressed directly to Biberaj, the LELDF report found. "We saw the news around the Scott Smith case and were wondering if you would like some communication support? Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you at this time."

Biberaj agreed, according to the report, and set up a time to talk with the group. The prosecutor, whose campaign was backed by a PAC funded by liberal donor George Soros, lost her 2023 re-election effort to Republican Bob Anderson.

LOS ANGELES DA DELIVERS SCATHING WARNING TO VIOLENT PROTESTERS CAUSING HAVOC: 'WE'RE COMING FOR YOU'

In another jurisdiction, the LELDF report found that Travis County, Texas, District Attorney Jose Garza's office entered a non-disclosure agreement with the Wren Collective's Jessica Brand in 2022, according to a copy of the document reviewed by Fox Digital and included in the report.

Garza is another Soros-backed DA who has repeatedly come under fire from conservatives and police officers for alleged soft on crime policies, including an alleged "war on cops" that hit a fever pitch last year when an Austin officer was sentenced to two years in prison after fatally shooting a man wielding a knife in 2019.

"This document is executed between the Wren Collective and the Travis County District Attorney's Office. The Wren Collective, an organization fiscally sponsored by the Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs (SEE), contracts with the Travis County District Attorney's Office to provide policy and communications support for the office for a one year period," reads the document, which was signed by Brand and one of Garza's deputies.

"Any information or materials involved in the professional engagement between these parties is confidential, and may not be disclosed by Wren to any third party without the office's permission. Wren agrees to keep all materials provided by the office secure. Wren also acknowledges that, as a consultant of the office, it is governed by the same ethical and professional responsibility rules as is the office," the NDA continued.

Later that year, Brand reportedly led Garza's preparation for a CNN interview, according to email records reported in the report.

The Wren Collective has also taken a role in the campaigns of certain progressive prosecutors and their allied political action committees, which are often tasked with fundraising and reaching out to donors to solicit, either directly or indirectly, large campaign contributions on behalf of certain campaigns.

The report alleges that the group also serves as a campaign consultant for the prosecutors and their allied PACs, including helping provide candidates with "public and media communications," such as press releases, op-eds, and interviews.

Fox News Digital reached out to Garza's office, as well as contacted Biberaj, Schmidt and Boudin in their post-DA roles.

The report concluded that many of the newly minted DAs enter their roles green and are in need of guidance when Wren staffers lend their expertise – but the advice is more than just broad suggestions.  

"Those neophytes – who have never been prosecutors or run an organization before winning their races – turn to outside groups for guidance, including many of the same groups that funded their campaigns," the report found.

Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the murder of Iryna Zarutska by repeat offender Decarlos Brown and why dangerous criminals continue to roam free.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, is facing criticism over her response to the killing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was riding a Blue Line train in the North Carolina city when she was stabbed in a random attack.

In a statement sent by Lyles' representatives to WCNC Charlotte, the mayor started out by offering "thoughts and prayers" to Zarutska's family before discussing possible mental health issues for the suspect, Decarlos Brown, a felon with a lengthy criminal record.

"This is a tragic situation that sheds light on problems with society's safety nets related to mental health care and the systems that should be in place," Lyles said in the statement. "While I do not know the specifics of the man's medical record, what I have come to understand is that he has long struggled with mental health and appears to have suffered a crisis. This was the unfortunate and tragic outcome."

The mayor later added that incidents like the stabbing of Zarutska should "force us to look at what we are doing across our community to address root causes. We will never arrest our way out of issues such as homelessness and mental health."

Fox News Digital reached out to Lyles' office regarding her statement and the resulting criticism but did not immediately receive a response.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy slammed Lyles and accused her of trying to hide "the ugly truth" from the American people.

"This monster had a track record longer than a CVS receipt, including prison time for robbery with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering, and larceny," Duffy wrote in a post on X. "By failing to properly punish him, Charlotte failed Iryna Zarutska and North Carolinians. This is totally unacceptable!"

UKRAINIAN WOMAN WHO FLED WAR STABBED TO DEATH AT CHARLOTTE LIGHT RAIL STATION

Rep. Brenden Jones, a Republican who represents the area, scolded Lyles after she issued a separate statement thanking those in the media for not reposting or sharing footage of the attack out of respect for Zarutska's family.

"Charlotte's Democrat mayor thanking the media for staying quiet about a tragic death shows exactly how Democrats in big cities try to cover up their crime problem," Jones wrote on X.

TRUMP CONDEMNS ‘LUNATIC' IN CHARLOTTE STABBING: ‘IF WE DON'T HANDLE EVIL, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY'

South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican, warned residents of his state to "beware traveling to Charlotte while Mayor Lyles remains in office."

He called for the mayor to resign in the wake of her response to the attack.

"We don't need more 'compassion' for sick and twisted criminals," Norman said in a statement. "They need jail sentences. And this one needs the death penalty. Mayor Lyles should resign. Her statements of concern for this assailant make her unfit to lead a major city."

Lyles was not the only North Carolina leader to face backlash over a statement regarding the murder. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, was scolded by the White House over a statement in which he called for increased police presence. While the Trump administration has pushed to increase law enforcement presence in major cities as a means to combating violent crime, a White House press secretary said Stein was putting the blame on the wrong people.

"He was arrested 14 times. The police did their jobs. You did not. And shame on you for trying to shift the blame," White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson wrote on X in response to Stein's statement.

Lyles appeared to change her messaging on Monday afternoon after scrutiny over her earlier statements. In a letter to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community, Lyles wrote that the attack revealed "a tragic failure by the courts and magistrates."

"Our police officers arrest people only to have them quickly released, which undermines our ability to protect our community and ensure safety. We need a bipartisan solution to address repeat offenders who do not face consequences for their actions and those who cannot get treatment for their mental illness and are allowed to be on the streets. We have partnered before on legislation like North Carolina's pre-trial integrity act, and we stand ready to partner again at the local, state, and federal level," Lyles said.

The mayor also announced that the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) security personnel would be re-deployed for a stronger presence on the platforms of the line on which the deadly attack occurred.

Brown is charged with first-degree murder, according to a Mecklenburg County arrest warrant. The charging text specifies that he "unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did of malice aforethought kill and murder Iryna Zarutska" on Aug. 22, 2025.

Records obtained by Fox News Digital showed that Brown has a history of arrests going back more than a decade, including convictions for larceny and breaking-and-entering in 2013, and a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon that sent him to prison for more than six years.

Brown was released in 2020 but remained on parole until 2021, and subsequent charges against him included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year. Police said Brown and Zarutska did not know each other and that the attack was random.

NEW YORK (AP) — Elizabeth Gilbert's “All the Way to the River,” a memoir that has already stirred up an online conversation, is Oprah Winfrey's new book club pick. 

In Gilbert's book, published this week, the author writes of a consuming love affair with the self-destructive and terminally ill Rayya Elias, a onetime friend for whom the author left her husband. Gilbert already has an influential and well-chronicled history of transformation and telling all — starting with her million-selling phenomenon, “Eat, Pray, Love,” a spiritual journey that ends with Gilbert marrying the man (Jose Nunes) she will divorce to be with Elias. 

“With ‘Eat, Pray, Love,' Elizabeth Gilbert started a movement,” Winfrey, who interviewed Gilbert in 2012 about “Eat, Pray, Love,” said in a statement Tuesday. “This new memoir is just as powerful — raw, unflinching, and deeply healing. She bares her soul, sharing her truth so openly, she offers readers the courage to face their own.”

Winfrey recently interviewed Gilbert at a Starbucks in Seattle; the Starbucks chain is the current presenter of her club. Their conversation can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel and other video outlets.

Gilbert's book was well publicized before Winfrey's endorsement. Last week, New York magazine's The Cut ran an excerpt and The New Yorker released a review by staff critic Jia Tolentino that led to widespread comments on social media, notably about Gilbert's confiding that she thought of killing Elias, whose addictions the author feared would destroy them both. (Elias died in 2018.) 




“Gilbert frames her journey with Rayya as a sort of test strip for the universe: take a love affair for the ages, dip it in an unbelievable amount of mutual suffering, and see what color everything turns,” Tolentino wrote.

Like dozens of book club choices before her, Gilbert learned of the news through an unexpected call from Winfrey. 

“I'd been told by my publisher to expect a phone call at a certain time and date that week, but I thought I was going to be talking to my editor about book business,” Gilbert said in a statement. “There is nothing in the world that can prepare you to receive such a call. I instantly felt like a teenager all over again, watching ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show' after school, and learning that there is a much, much bigger world out there than I knew.”

            France's prime minister has quit after losing a confidence vote that toppled his government, plunging the country into a new political crisis.
    


            François Bayrou submitted his resignation to President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, who accepted it. A day earlier, 364 out of 573 lawmakers had voted against Bayrou's government – well above the 280 needed – after his attempt to force through an unpopular plan to tame France's ballooning budget deficit.
    


            Macron will appoint a successor “in the coming days,” according to the Élysée Palace, his fifth prime minister in less than two years.
    


            Before he was ousted, Bayrou warned that getting rid of him would not resolve France's challenges. “You have the power to bring down the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,” he told lawmakers. “Reality will remain relentless: expenses will continue to rise, and the burden of debt, already unbearable, will grow heavier and more costly.”
    


            Macron now faces the task of steering France out of its financial morass.
    


            The chaos can be traced back to Macron's dramatic decision to call a snap poll last year. Piqued by the remarkable successes of the far-right National Rally (RN) in the European elections in June 2024, the president rolled the dice on a parliamentary vote. The gamble backfired and his centrist bloc lost seats to the far right and far left, leaving France with a divided National Assembly and effectively ungovernable.
    


            But it didn't have to be this way. France's Fifth Republic, founded by President Charles de Gaulle in 1958, was designed to end the chronic instability that had plagued the Third and Fourth Republics earlier in the 20th century. The new constitution gave broad powers to the executive and set up a majority system to avoid short-lived governments. As a result, for decades, two mainstream political parties on the left and right alternated in power.
    


            Macron blew up that order in 2017, by becoming the first president elected without the backing of either of the main established parties. Re-elected in 2022, he soon lost his parliamentary majority as voters flocked to the extremes. Two years of fragile rule followed, with Macron repeatedly forced to invoke Article 49.3 of the constitution – pushing legislation through without a vote, to the increasing displeasure of opposition lawmakers and much of the French public.
    


            In the 2024 snap election, the left won most seats in the second round of voting but still fell short of a majority after the far right dominated the first. But the left's hopes of forming a minority government collapsed when Macron refused to accept their choice of prime minister. Unlike Germany or Italy, France has no tradition of coalition building, instead its politics have been shaped for more than 60 years by a presidency-dominated system.
    


            There's a French saying that goes “Les mêmes causes produisent les mêmes effets” – the same causes produce the same consequences. And for Macron, history does indeed risk repeating itself unless he can find a prime minister able to broker compromise.
    


            The problem is that, after three failed centrist prime ministers whose tenures ranged from between three to nine months, the opposition parties are in no mood to give another one a chance.
    


            So Macron is caught in a political vise, with the far left calling for his resignation, the far right demanding a snap election and the mainstream left and right remain unable to reach consensus.
    


            The frontrunner to replace Bayrou appears to be outgoing Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu. But by choosing a premier from his own ranks Macron risks sounding tone-deaf, a sign that he has yet to fully accept the reality of his snap election defeat.
    


            The logic behind Lecornu is that he might strike a deal with the Socialists to make the budget more palatable, the same compromise that Bayrou used to push through this year's budget with concessions to the left. Yet that path now looks unworkable.
    


            The Socialists want to tax the rich and roll back Macron's tax cuts for businesses, demands that are anathema to the right. Bayrou as a centrist barely managed to walk that tightrope, Lecornu, positioned further to the right, may not be as agile.
    


            One potential saving grace is that neither the left nor the right wants the snap election far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen is pushing for, since both political wings would risk losing seats. This gives them an incentive to cooperate, but not at any price.
    


            Away from politics, wider economic turmoil has rattled French investors. Yields on French government bonds – or the interest rate demanded by investors – have risen above those of Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds, which were once at the heart of the eurozone debt crisis. A possible downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating review Friday would deliver another blow to the country's economic standing in Europe.
    


            Yet, following these turbulent years, the political climate is also bleak. In the event of another snap parliamentary election, a recent Elabe poll suggests that the far-right RN would emerge on top – as the largest single party in the National Assembly – with the left coming in second and Macron's centrist bloc a distant third.
    


            Many in France now assume the far right will eventually take power – if not now, then after the 2027 presidential election – though few believe such an outcome would solve the country's problems.
    


            Public trust in the political class has collapsed and anger is set to spill onto the streets. The far left has called nationwide protests for Wednesday against austerity, under the banner “Bloquons tout” (Let's block everything), and vow to paralyze the country with roadblocks and civil disobedience.
    


            The outgoing interior minister has warned of “intense disruptions.” Trade unions are planning another wave of mobilization on September 18 with strikes expected in hospitals and across rail services.
    


            Dominique Moïsi, a senior analyst at the Paris-based think tank Institut Montaigne, says he cannot recall a moment of such profound deadlock in the Fifth Republic.
    


            “De Gaulle survived assassination attempts, there was the Algerian war, in May '68 the slogan was ‘La France s'ennuie,' (France is bored). But today France is frustrated, furious, full of hatred towards the elite,” he told CNN.
    


            “It sounds as if a regime change is inevitable, yet I can't see how it will come about and who would do the job. We are in a phase of transition between a system that no longer works and a system no one can imagine.”

TYLERTOWN, Miss. (AP) — As an ominous storm approached Buddy Anthony's new home, he took shelter in his Ford F-250 pickup parked under a nearby carport.

Seconds later, a tornado tore apart the one-story brick house and damaged the truck while lifting it partly in the air. Anthony emerged unhurt. But he had to replace his vehicle with a used truck that became his home while waiting for President Donald Trump to issue a major disaster declaration allowing federal money to flow to individuals reeling from loss. That took weeks.

“You wake up in the truck and look out the windshield and see nothing. That's hard. That's hard to swallow,” Anthony said. 

Disaster survivors are having to wait longer to get aid from the federal government, according to a new Associated Press analysis of decades of data. On average, it took less than two weeks for a governor's request for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. It's taking more than a month, on average, so far during Trump's current term, the AP found.

The delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure. The AP collaborated with Mississippi Today and Mississippi Free Press on the effects of these delays for this report. 

“The message that I get in the delay, particularly for the individual assistance, is that the federal government has turned its back on its own people,” said Bob Griffin, dean of the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at the University at Albany in New York. “It's a fundamental shift in the position of this country.”

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Trump is making sure federal tax dollars “are spent wisely to supplement state actions, not replace them,” during disasters. 




“President Trump provides a more thorough review of disaster declaration requests than any Administration has before him,” Jackson said in a statement to the AP. “Gone are the days of rubber stamping FEMA recommendations — that's not a bug, that's a feature.”

Americans expect government help after disasters. About three-fourths of people want the U.S. government to play a major role in providing aid to communities and helping them rebuild after natural disasters, according to a June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency often consults immediately with communities to coordinate their initial disaster response. But direct payments to individuals, nonprofits and local governments must wait for a major disaster declaration from the president, who first must receive a request from a state, territory or tribe. Major disaster declarations are intended only for the most damaging events that are beyond the resources of states and local governments. 

Trump has approved more than two dozen major disaster declarations since taking office in January, with an average wait of almost 34 days after a request. That ranged from a one-day turnaround after July's deadly flash flooding in Texas to a 67-day wait after a request for aid because of a Michigan ice storm. The average wait is up from a 24-day delay during his first term and is nearly four times as long as the average for former Republican President George H.W. Bush, whose term from 1989-1993 coincided with the implementation of a new federal law setting parameters for disaster determinations.

The delays have grown over time, regardless of the party in power. Former Democratic President Joe Biden, in his last year in office, averaged 26 days to declare major disasters — longer than any year under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

FEMA did not respond to the AP's questions about what factors are contributing to the trend.

Others familiar with FEMA noted that its process for assessing and documenting natural disasters has become more complex over time. Disasters have also become more frequent and intense because of climate change, which is mostly caused by the burning of fuels such as gas, coal and oil.

The wait for disaster declarations has spiked as Trump's administration undertakes an ambitious makeover of the federal government that has shed thousands of workers and reexamined the role of FEMA. A recently published letter from current and former FEMA employees warned the cuts could become debilitating if faced with a large-enough disaster. The letter also lamented that the Trump administration has stopped maintaining or removed long-term planning tools focused on extreme weather and disasters.

Shortly after taking office, Trump floated the idea of “getting rid” of FEMA, asserting: “It's very bureaucratic, and it's very slow.”

FEMA's acting chief suggested more recently that states should shoulder more responsibility for disaster recovery, though FEMA thus far has continued to cover three-fourths of the costs of public assistance to local governments, as required under federal law. FEMA pays the full cost of its individual assistance. 

Former FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who served during Trump's first term, said the extra scrutiny on requests for disaster declarations is “probably the right thing to do, because I think the declaration process has become the `easy button' for states.”

The tornado that struck Anthony's home in rural Tylertown on March 15 packed winds up to 140 mph (225 km/hr). It was part of a powerful storm system that wrecked homes, businesses and lives across multiple states.

Mississippi's governor requested a federal disaster declaration on April 1. Trump granted that request 50 days later, on May 21, while approving aid for both individuals and public entities. 

On that same day, Trump also approved eight other major disaster declarations for storms, floods or fires in seven other states. In most cases, more than a month had passed since the requests and about two months since the date of those disasters.

On July 22, Trump issued another big batch of major disaster declarations covering seven states. Those included requests related to March storms in Michigan and Oregon that took about two months for governors to submit and an additional two months to approve. 

If a presidential declaration and federal money had come sooner, Anthony said he wouldn't have needed to spend weeks sleeping in a truck before he could afford to rent the trailer where he is now living. His house was uninsured, Anthony said, and FEMA eventually gave him $30,000.




In nearby Jayess, Dana Grimes had insurance but not enough to cover the full value of her damaged home. After the eventual federal declaration, Grimes said FEMA provided about $750 for emergency expenses, but she is now waiting for the agency to determine whether she can receive more. 

“We couldn't figure out why the president took so long to help people in this country,” Grimes said. “I just want to tie up strings and move on. But FEMA — I'm still fooling with FEMA.”

Jonathan Young said he gave up on applying for FEMA aid after the Tylertown tornado killed his 7-year-old son and destroyed their home. The process seemed too difficult, and federal officials wanted paperwork he didn't have, Young said. He made ends meet by working for those cleaning up from the storm.

“It's a therapy for me,” Young said, “to pick up the debris that took my son away from me.”



Historically, presidential disaster declarations containing individual assistance have been approved more quickly than those providing assistance only to public entities, according to the AP's analysis. That remains the case under Trump, though declarations for both types are taking longer. 

About half the major disaster declarations approved by Trump this year have included individual assistance. 

Some people whose homes are damaged turn to shelters hosted by churches or local nonprofit organizations in the initial chaotic days after a disaster. Others stay with friends or family or go to a hotel, if they can afford it. 

But some insist on staying in damaged homes, even if they are unsafe, said Chris Smith, who administered FEMA's individual assistance division under three presidents from 2015-2022. If homes aren't repaired properly, mold can grow, compounding the recovery challenges.

That's why it's critical for FEMA's individual assistance to get approved quickly — ideally, within two weeks of a disaster, said Smith, who's now a disaster consultant for governments and companies.

“You want to keep the people where they are living. You want to ensure those communities are going to continue to be viable and recover,” Smith said. “And the earlier that individual assistance can be delivered ... the earlier recovery can start.”

After the Tylertown tornado, faith-based groups served food and laid tarps on homes while local residents helped each other with power saws to clear downed trees.

“That's the only thing that got us through this storm, neighbors helping neighbors,” said Les Lampton, a volunteer firefighter and insurance agent in Walthall County, where Tylertown is located. “If we waited on the government, we were going to be in bad shape.”



Unlike individual assistance programs that provide cash upfront, FEMA's public assistance programs reimburse governmental entities only after their bills are paid — and only if they followed guidelines for hiring and documenting the work. 

Because that process can take months or years, a delay in a presidential disaster declaration may have little effect on when a local government ultimately gets reimbursed. 

But delayed approvals still can carry consequences. Long waits can stoke uncertainty and lead cost-conscious local officials to pause or scale-back their recovery efforts. 

In Walthall County, officials initially spent about $700,000 cleaning up debris, then suspended the cleanup for more than a month because they couldn't afford to spend more without assurance they would receive federal reimbursement, said Royce McKee, the county emergency manager. Meanwhile, rubble from splintered trees and shattered homes remained piled along the roadside, creating unsafe obstacles for motorists and habitat for snakes and rodents. 

When it received the federal declaration, Walthall County took out a multi-million-dollar loan to pay contractors to resume the cleanup.

“We're going to pay interest and pay that money back until FEMA pays us,” said Byran Martin, an elected county supervisor. “We're hopeful that we'll get some money by the first of the year, but people are telling us that it could be (longer).”

The night before the Tylertown tornado, a twister also tore through Rolla, Missouri, a college town of about 20,000 people. It knocked out electricity for 80% of the municipal utility's customers and damaged 120 power poles.

Crews worked to restore power within a couple weeks, racking up hefty bills paid from the utility's reserve funds. As the wait for a presidential disaster declaration kept growing, “we were getting a little nervous,” said Rodney Bourne, general manager of Rolla Municipal Utilities.

The utility now is seeking FEMA reimbursement for about $1 million, intentionally holding its claim just under the agency's large-project threshold in hopes of expediting the process, he said. 

Delays in federal declarations also can force local officials to choose between needed repairs — perhaps fixing some roads and culverts washed out by floods while delaying other projects, said David Fogerson, a public safety consultant who retired last year as Nevada's emergency management chief.

“For a lot of the smaller states and smaller jurisdictions, when you get that, `Yep, this is a disaster declaration, we've got federal money coming,' it helps you feel better, more confident about spending that money,” he said.

HEGSETH: ‘THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU': In an unannounced visit to Puerto Rico on Monday, War Secretary Pete Hegseth told U.S. troops they are on the front lines of a coming battle with drug cartels that are “poisoning the American people.”

“Make no mistake about it, what you're doing right now is not training. This is the real-world exercise on behalf of the vital national interest of the United States of America to end the poisoning of the American people,” Hegseth told the sailors and Marines aboard the USS Iwo Jima. “You're trained. You're prepared. You're ready, and you're lethal, and the American people are counting on you. … Narco terrorists and drug traffickers are on notice.”

The short, highly produced video, complete with a dramatic music score and posted on Hegseth's X page, was the only official account of the visit, and no transcript of his remarks has been posted on the Pentagon's webpage. “It's not if, it's when you're on mission,” Hegseth said. “The full power of the American military, used precisely, with a clear mission, will be used to ensure the American people are kept safe.”

Hegseth's pep talk to the troops at an Air National Guard base east of the capital of San Juan, and embarkation on the Iwo Jima, comes as the U.S. reportedly is preparing to move 10 top-of-the-line F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico for the counternarcotics mission. Word of the deployment came after Venezuela flew two aging F-16s over U.S. ships in the Caribbean in response to last week's U.S. drone strike on a speedboat suspected of carrying 11 Venezuelan smugglers from the Tren de Aragua drug cartel.

President Donald Trump warned future flyovers could be met with lethal force on Friday. “If they fly in a dangerous position, I would say that you can, you or your captains can make the decision as to what they want to do,” Trump said in the Oval Office, directing his comments to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine. “If they do put us in a dangerous position, they'll be shot down.”

MADURO: ‘WE HAVE DECLARED MAXIMUM PREPAREDNESS': Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has a $50 million bounty over his head and is charged with narco-terrorism by the U.S. and designated as leader of Cartel of the Suns by the U.S. Treasury Department, has called the buildup of U.S. naval forces off the coast of his country “an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral, and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.”

At a news conference in Caracas last week, Maduro announced he was deploying troops along the coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia. “In the face of this maximum military pressure, we have declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela,” Maduro said.

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on Monday the U.S. was targeting the wrong country, suggesting that its neighbor Colombia was the major drug threat to the U.S. “Those ships that are trying to intimidate Venezuela today should be there in the Pacific if they truly wanted to fight and prevent cocaine from reaching the United States of America,” she said, according to the Associated Press. “They have a GPS location problem. They're where they shouldn't be. They need to calibrate their GPS.”

QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT DRUG BOAT STRIKE: Some legal experts and advocacy groups are raising questions about the justification for the U.S. strike against the small speedboat that was tracked leaving Venezuela and was believed to be carrying drugs bound for the U.S.

“We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented,” Hegseth said the day after the strike on Fox News. “And that was Tren de Aragua, a narco-terrorist organization designated by the United States, trying to poison our country with illicit drugs.”

“The strike, which occurred outside the context of armed conflict, raises serious concerns about human rights, due process, and the rule of law,” the advocacy group Center for Civilians in Conflict said in a statement on Monday. “All people, no matter where they live or what crime they have been accused of, have fundamental human rights, including the rights to life and due process. Using lethal force in this way, outside of any recognizable armed conflict and without due process, is an extrajudicial execution, not an act of war.”

When a critic on X suggested that killing citizens of another nation who are civilians without due process is a war crime, Vice President JD Vance responded, “I don't give a s*** what you call it,” adding in a separate post, “Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.”

That exchange prompted Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) to chime in, “JD ‘I don't give a shit' Vance says killing people he accuses of a crime is the ‘highest and best use of the military.' Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird? Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation??”

“What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,” Paul posted on X.

TRUMP: ‘I DON'T KNOW WHY CHICAGO ISN'T CALLING US': The Department of Homeland Security has begun its crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago, codenamed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

“This operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew @GovPritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them,” the DHS said on X. But so far, the operation involves only Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, with Trump appearing reluctant to dispatch federalized National Guard troops without an invitation from Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL). 

“I don't know why Chicago isn't calling us, saying, ‘Please give us help,'” Trump said in remarks delivered to the White House Religious Liberty Commission on Monday. “When you have over just a short period of time, 50 murders and hundreds of people shot, and then you have a governor that stands up and says how crime is just fine, it's really crazy.”

“With the governor and the mayor, you try and reason with them and it's like you're talking to a wall,” Trump said. “I assume it's just a political ideology. They're not stupid people. Must be an ideology that's just buried in their head and you can't do a damn thing about it. And we'd love to go into Chicago and straighten it out.”

TRUMP INTENSIFIES WAR WITH PRITZKER AS CHICAGO AWAITS IMMINENT DECISION ON FEDERAL TAKEOVER

ABOUT THAT HYUNDAI RAID: It now appears that ICE raid of a Hyundai factory in Georgia last week — in which ICE rounded up 475 workers, chained and shackled them, and loaded them on buses for detention — included about 300 highly trained engineers who were in the country legally on short-term visas because their expertise was needed to get an electric battery plant up and running.

Trump admitted as much Sunday night when he spoke to reporters at Joint Base Andrews. “It's a battery factory,” Trump said. “You know when they're building batteries. If you don't have people in this country right now that know about batteries, maybe we should help them along and let some people come in and train our people.” 

“We're going to look at that whole situation. We have a lot of industries that we don't have anymore, and we're gonna have to train people,” Trump said. “I think we may have learned something because when they come here and there's nobody that can do what they're supposed to be doing, and they bring people, those people can also teach our people. You know, it's complicated stuff. And something very interesting could come out of that. Thank you, everybody.”

A lawyer for several detained South Korean nationals at the Hyundai factory in Georgia told the Associated Press that the engineers and equipment installers were doing work authorized under the B-1 business visitor visa program and that they had planned to be in the U.S. for just a couple of weeks.

“Never longer than 75 days,” he said.

It's blue, the feeling the country has.

If there's one thing a large majority of Americans have consistently agreed on this year, it's that the Democratic Party sucks. Unfavorable views of the party seem to keep rising with every passing month of President Donald Trump's second term and that discontent has reached a new height this summer. More than 60 percent of American adults view the Democrats with derision, according to weekly tracking polls conducted by YouGov.

Looking at this another way, positive views of the Democratic Party have now crumbled to a historic low, with only about one-third of the country seeing them in a good light, per Wall Street Journal polling that shook the political world in July.

It's a broad-based dislike: Republicans, independents, and disaffected Democrats are dragging down the party's brand. But the reasons for this dislike are varied. Since there's no one explanation for why everyone seems to hate the Democrats right now, it's useful to break this question up into a few charts to visualize the complicated position of the Democratic Party in 2025.

The biggest contributor to the negative position of the Democratic Party right now comes from depressed Democrats who are frustrated with their party. Poll after poll shows a unique, historically unusual dynamic where Republicans are very satisfied with the state and performance of their political party while Democrats are significantly less happy with their own side.

A summer Gallup poll summed up this development: 91 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of the GOP — up from 87 percent in October 2024 — while 73 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of their party — down from 92 percent in 2024. It's a highly unusual dynamic, Gallup notes; Republicans tend to be more unfavorable toward their party, so this unity is surprising. Democrats, meanwhile, historically tend to be more supportive of their party.

The first way to think of this difference is to see the associations that Democrats have with their party. For most of the last year, Democratic voters were sending signals to their leaders that they wanted more aggressive resistance and opposition to Trump — something they feel like their party is not doing well.

Consider this chart with responses to a prompt from an August Associated Press-NORC poll. Per the AP, one-third of Democrats have negative views of their party, largely to do with the party's inability to respond to Trump.

“Weak,” “tepid,” “ineffective,” and “broken,” came up the most among Democrats and were used by Democrats to describe their party much more frequently than by Americans in general.

In other words, Democrats dislike their party because they think they are incapable of resisting Trump; other Americans dislike the party for other reasons. This matches other trends. Pew Research Center data from this spring showed an overwhelming majority of Democrats thought it was “extremely” or “very” important that their leaders resist Trump and his policies. That was most pronounced among very liberal Democrats, 85 percent of whom said this resistance was “extremely” important — higher than the response from liberal, conservative, or moderate Democrats. And polling from Strength in Numbers/VeraSight suggests that this cohort of very liberal/progressive Democrats might be the Americans bringing down the party's favorability at the moment.

Ideologically, there's evidence that the party's negative perceptions are motivated, in part, by its members not being united on what direction their party should go. After many pre- and post-election surveys found that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party suffered from being viewed as too radical or too liberal, discussions within the party centered on whether the party needed to ideologically change direction.

Gallup studied this question earlier in the year and found mixed results, but definitive significant changes from four years ago. Democrats, and Democratic-leaning independents, are divided over whether the party should change or not.

More of these partisans want the party to be more moderate than in 2021, but a majority would still prefer it stay the same or move left. This, again, matches trends in other polls and correlates with surveys finding that a majority of Americans think their party is “somewhat” or “very” divided, while Democrats themselves are split in half on that question. Dislike of a political party flows from there. If you think your party should moderate, but is not, you'll probably be upset at it overall. If you think the party should be more liberal, but it's not, the same reasoning applies. Republicans, meanwhile, are pretty happy with their party right now: 43 percent think the party should not change.

Relatedly, a third way to visualize this dislike for the Democratic Party is to see it as a reflection of the unpopularity of its leaders. If the party base, and American voters in general, have strong negative feelings about a party's elite — those spokespeople who stand in for and speak for the party — then it makes sense for those feelings to be applied to the party in general.

Here, Elliot Morris's Strength in Numbers analysis of favorability of political figures is clear. While most politicians and figures are unpopular, Democratic ones are especially unpopular.

A similar dynamic emerges when looking at Democrats in Congress. They are viewed much more negatively in general by their own voters than Republicans are by their own voters. Meanwhile, individual Democratic representatives and Democratic candidates tend to be viewed more favorably than Democrats as a whole or Republican candidates and the Republican Party.

This suggests some degree of voters not wanting to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They like individual Democratic representatives while disliking party leadership and the party brand. This would also explain why Democrats continue to see a modest advantage on the generic congressional ballot — voters are still more likely to vote for a Democrat in next year's midterm elections, even if they dislike the party as a whole.

In addition to these three buckets of explanations, there are some more natural dynamics at play: Partisanship and polarization explain why Republicans still strongly dislike the Democratic Party, while it's normal for a political party to go through a period of wandering in the wilderness after a presidential loss (Democrats were in a similar polling position in 2017 before surging in the fall into 2018). So while Democrats seem to be hated by everyone right now, they aren't doomed yet.

House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin majority is expected to shrink after Tuesday's special election in Virginia, where the Democratic candidate is likely to sail to victory to finish the term of the late Rep. Gerry Connolly.

James Walkinshaw, a Democrat who served as Connolly's chief of staff and is currently a Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member, is likely to defeat Republican Stewart Whitson, a former FBI special agent and Army veteran.

Connolly, a longtime congressman who died in May, won reelection to his district by 34 points in 2024, so the seat is expected to remain in Democratic hands. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report has the race rated a “solid D.”

The current House margin is three seats, with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. If Walkinshaw is victorious, the majority will shrink to a two-seat margin, meaning the speaker can only afford to lose two GOP votes and still pass legislation along party lines.

This is a small but significant blow to Johnson, particularly as the government funding deadline approaches on Sept. 30. Over a dozen conservatives are often against short-term spending deals, or continuing resolutions, so razor-thin margins give Johnson's right flank an easy advantage to prevent any bills they don't like from coming to or passing on the floor.

Other upcoming special elections threaten to narrow Johnson's majority, as well. 

Due to recent deaths in the House Democratic caucus, special elections will be held later this year for the late Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva and the late Texas Rep. Sylvester Turner. Another special election will be held to replace former Republican Rep. Mark Green, which could give the GOP a boost ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Grijalva's special election, set for Sept. 23, won't change the majority if a Democrat wins, due to House numbers. But if a Democrat holds on to Turner's seat, that would shrink Johnson's majority to just a one-vote margin. That election is set for Nov. 4, and Turner's seat is expected to remain blue, given it is a D+21 district.

But a special election in Green's old district, set for Dec. 2, would give Republicans a slight reprieve heading into the new year. A Republican victory would boost Johnson back up to a two-seat margin. 

GOVERNOR'S RACES HEAT UP NATIONALLY WITH VIRGINIA AS EARLY BELLWETHER 

The former congressman has endorsed Matt Van Epps, an Army veteran and the former commissioner of Tennessee's Department of General Services. Van Epps is facing 10 other men vying for the GOP nomination. Democrats have four candidates competing for the nomination. The race also features Bobby Dodge, the first candidate to run under Elon Musk's new America Party.

Democrats have won a majority of special elections in 2025, but President Donald Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024, so the GOP is likely to hang onto this seat.

Emergency response's newfound sluggishness, explained by earthquakes and landslides.

By the time the earthquake struck, flattening mud-brick homes across Afghanistan's eastern mountains last week, many nearby health clinics had already been shuttered for months.

Mushtaq Khan, a senior adviser for the International Rescue Committee, felt his building jolt from all the way in the capital, Kabul, on Sunday night. He woke the next morning to a horrifying death toll slowly trickling in. First, 200 lives lost; then 500; 800; 1,000; and finally, by Thursday, there were over 2,200 confirmed deaths, with some rural villages still unreachable by rescuers.

As his team searched for survivors, he wondered what could have happened if the gutting of the US Agency for International Development hadn't forced four of their clinics in the country's hardest-hit province to close earlier this year, cutting off 60,000 rural Afghans from care.

How many lives could be saved if the emergency aid came rushing in like it did before? If the roads had been built in time, or if the food assistance was at the ready like it used to be, they could have surely reached more people more quickly in the disaster's wake.

“The way we are responding now would've been way different,” he said.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

At the beginning of this year, the US cut almost $1.8 billion worth of aid to Afghanistan. Because of those cuts alone, the country's GDP will likely shrink by a full 5 percent this year, cutting off food, shelter, and medical care for millions of Afghans. In 2022, after a magnitude 6.1 quake hit southeastern Afghanistan the US gave $55 million for food, health, and sanitation supplies. The next year, it gave $12 million in the wake of yet another earthquake. But this time, the US offered nothing.

Globally, we are at risk of unraveling decades of progress in making disasters less deadly, driven by investments in infrastructure, early warning systems, and better coordination between the patchwork of actors and agencies that kicks into gear when crisis strikes. Foreign aid has always been a critical part of that puzzle in low-income countries like Afghanistan. A steady flow of foreign aid helps facilitate the kind of development — the roads and resources — needed to make emergency response truly effective when disaster strikes.

The US isn't alone in slashing aid. As a result of the worldwide retreat in funding lifesaving development programs, every disaster is now deadlier than it needs to be — and every aid worker is left navigating an increasingly dysfunctional system.

“The resources are really, really scarce right now,” Khan said. If the money was there like it used to be, he told Vox that he “would be on the ground working side by side with my team right now. We are really feeling the difference.”

When an earthquake or a cyclone strikes a poor village, what normally happens first is that the country's government puts out a call for international relief.

Then, a hodgepodge of NGOs, United Nations agencies, and foreign governments would spring into action. USAID would typically pledge a few million dollars to the government of the affected country or — as would be the case for an unfriendly ruler like the Taliban — to a United Nations agency or humanitarian organizations like the Red Cross working on the ground.

Sometimes, the US would even lend out one of its highly specialized search and rescue task forces to respond to a disaster overseas, as it did to Haiti, Turkey, Peru, the Bahamas, Nepal, and Japan after earthquakes, flooding, and hurricanes over the past decade.

The coordination would kick in really quickly. Most humanitarian organizations didn't even wait for the contracts to be signed before flying their teams straight into the epicenter to work with local agencies and nonprofits on the ground.

After decades of collaboration, most humanitarian organizations trusted that “the US government would pay its bills” or reimburse them eventually for the costs incurred, said Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran USAID's disaster assistance branch under the Obama administration and now leads the advocacy group Refugees International. By having those relationships at the ready, a response can kick in much faster when disaster strikes. “Sometimes you need the relief to move faster than our grant processes.”

That trust didn't come overnight, nor did USAID's capacity for responding quickly to global disasters, he said. Over time, “it evolved and it grew and iterated,” he said. “It became this really amazing professional operational, deployable machine.”

What makes the most difference in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is not an injection of emergency donations. It's not as simple as crowdfunding a search and rescue team. Instead, long-term infrastructure projects — often fueled by foreign aid — are what really wax the wheels of disaster relief, ensuring that help can come as fast and efficiently as possible.

It's important that the protocols are already in place and the rescuers are already on call to respond effectively by the time disaster strikes. But, it's equally important that the clinics are open, the roads are paved, the water is clean, and the houses are strong enough to withstand some damage.

Achieving those goals through global cooperation has been extremely important for low-income countries, where disasters are still far more deadly than in rich countries, despite efforts to improve early warning systems worldwide.

But, they have made progress, which helps explain why earthquakes, cyclones, and floods used to kill far more people a century ago than they do today, despite there being way more people now, more data reporting, and more disasters tied to climate change than before.

But now, with the death of USAID and plenty of other countries taking sledgehammers to their own aid agencies, everything about disaster relief has gotten a lot more sluggish.

The Taliban, which seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, put out an appeal for aid shortly after the earthquake struck at the end of August. So did the leader of a local rebel group in Sudan last week, after a devastating landslide killed over 1,000 people in a region already ravaged by war and famine.

While a few countries have stepped in to help in the aftermath of the earthquake — including the European Union, China, India, and the United Kingdom — aid workers like Khan say the absence of the US is directly impacting their response. “It's just a complete mess,” Konyndyk said. “As a functional matter, the US government is simply out of the business of disaster aid globally,” and “it's done huge damage.”

Those search and rescue task forces the US used to send? They're still technically on retainer, but in what Konyndyk called an “entirely insane” twist, the Trump administration cancelled the emergency transport contracts that used to get them where they needed to go — meaning that it's now basically impossible to get them overseas, especially on a time crunch.

It took four days to get those task forces to Texas after the floods this summer — the same first responders that made it to Syria and Turkey after the 2023 earthquake in just two days.

The USAID subagency that once handled global disaster logistics has been quietly subsumed into the much smaller office within the Office of Refugee Resettlement as part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Not that it seems to be doing much anyway. After a magnitude 7.7 earthquake killed 3,800 people in Myanmar back in March, the US was mostly absent in the disaster response. The UN's human rights expert for Myanmar recently told the Associated Press that a mixture of aid cuts and the notable absence of US logistical support has severely hampered the country's ability to recover.

Previous earthquakes had led to the deployment of a full US-led rescue team with dozens of rescuers, search dogs, and heavy machinery that could pull people out alive. This time, the US flew in a team of just three aid workers to assess the damage and then promptly fired them all via email mere days after their arrival as they slept in the rubble-strewn streets of the earthquake zone.

The situation in Afghanistan is even worse. After the Taliban's takeover, the US remained the country's largest source of aid by far, sending billions to the poverty-stricken country over the past four years.

The Trump administration's decision to slash the vast majority of aid spending cut the country off from urgent food aid, forced the closure of about 400 humanitarian health clinics — 40 percent of the country's total — and gave girls even fewer options to go to school.

“You just name any crisis — we are seeing it over here,” said Khan, who's especially worried about how damage to water and housing infrastructure could increase the prevalence of disease and make it impossible for families to weather the coming winter. It would be one thing if this were the only crisis on his plate, but the earthquake is only the latest in a series of crises, including a severe drought that has left about one-third of the population facing acute food insecurity and the millions of Afghans forced out of neighboring nations.

“These are very resilient people,” he said. “They just need backing.”

Saving more lives is about more than money for any individual disaster; it's about addressing a brewing logistical nightmare that's making the world less safe and far less prepared to respond to all different kinds of crises.

Take Sudan. Western media didn't even report on the deadly landslide that occurred there — which destroyed an entire village — until two days after the disaster hit. And, the ongoing civil war makes it extremely difficult to get humanitarian aid inside the country anyway, particularly in the region most affected, where many have sought refuge from the violence precisely because the area is so remote.

But almost unthinkably, the destruction of USAID — which funded the bulk of humanitarian relief that did make it into the country — has made things even worse. It ruptured longstanding relationships, unceremoniously firing some of the only people with the logistical expertise needed to navigate such tricky terrain. No matter what comes next, it won't be easy to build back.

“We are facing a huge loss of capacity and trust,” said Patricia McIlreavy, head of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, who has spent decades working in humanitarian aid, including in Sudan.

“There may be others who fill those gaps. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a real unknown,” she said. “How will it look? How will people get support? Will they get support?”

In the meantime, she fears that all of the “cuts in funding, but also cuts in capacity, and cuts in expertise and relationship-building” could have dire consequences long after the dust settles.

“People on the ground in Sudan, people on the ground in Afghanistan, don't have a vote on any of these changes,” she said. “All they know is nothing is coming.”

At the end of the day, natural disasters don't see borders. There's something very human — apolitical, even — in the impulse to support one another in the wake of such tragedies.

Afghanistan offered $100,000 to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Mexico sent dozens of firefighters to Los Angeles when wildfires broke out earlier this year. Hundreds of Canadian workers descended on North Carolina to help restore power after Hurricane Helene.

And with climate change accelerating the pace and intensity of natural disasters around the world — but especially in places like Afghanistan and Sudan — like it or not, we are all in this together.

Granted, the US used to anchor a vast global emergency response infrastructure, and individual donations are absolutely no replacement for that.

But in Sudan — where local volunteer networks have managed to bring lifesaving relief to places that many western donors gave up on years ago — anything is still better than nothing, especially if you choose to support for the long haul. The same is true in Afghanistan, where aid workers have trudged for hours in search of survivors to pull from the rubble.

“We all have a belief that help will come, and when we erode that hope, I think we do something to who we are as people,” McIlreavy said. “How are we advancing together if we can't believe that we are somehow there for each other?”

Boston, a sanctuary city facing a federal lawsuit for its policies obstructing deportation operations, has freed more than 200 criminally accused illegal aliens from police custody in defiance of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests, according to a Washington Examiner review of annual noncompliance reports.

In 2014, the Democrat-dominated Boston City Council passed the Boston Trust Act, directing the Boston Police Department to disregard the ICE detention requests, known as detainers.

ICE detention requests, known as detainers, ask local law enforcement agencies to temporarily keep illegal immigrants who were arrested on criminal charges behind bars for a prolonged period, up to 48 hours beyond typical release times, until immigration agents arrive and can assume custody. As part of the noncompulsory requests, police departments are asked to then hand the suspects over to federal immigration authorities or at least notify ICE in advance of their release should they be bailed out or let go without bond.

Under the city ordinance, BPD officers are forbidden from detaining a person solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer after the suspect becomes eligible to be released, except for a few exemptions, such as when a criminal warrant is issued or the subject was convicted of a violent crime.

Since the signing of the Boston Trust Act in 2014, in accordance with the ordinance, the BPD has refused to honor at least 238 detainer requests.

DOJ SUES BOSTON OVER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT: ‘WORST SANCTUARY OFFENDERS'

In 2024, BPD Commissioner Michael A. Cox reported to the Boston city clerk's office that 15 civil immigration detainers were lodged with the police department during that calendar year.

“DHS has determined that probable cause exists that the subject is a removable alien,” ICE personnel said in each detention petition to the BPD. However, none of the requests were acted upon pursuant to the Boston Trust Act, and zero immigration suspects were further detained by the BPD or transferred over to ICE custody.

Such has been the case for more than a decade in Boston. In 2023, the BPD ignored 19 detainers, 12 in 2022, two in 2021, 107 in 2018, 68 in 2017, and 15 in 2016, either transporting illegal immigrant defendants to court for arraignment, at which point the BPD has no authority to hold them, or outright releasing detainees from jail.

Notably, in 2015, the BPD was a cooperative partner with ICE's enforcement efforts, fulfilling all nine detention requests from federal immigration officers. BPD reports for the years 2019 and 2020, though, could not be located within Legistar, the city's legislative management system.

The BPD's yearly numbers, however, may be undercounts, possibly by wide margins. ICE personnel said they sent 198 detainers to the BPD in 2024, far higher than the commissioner's figures. Accordingly, the city council ordered a hearing to discuss the discrepancy between the requests received, by the BPD's count, and ICE's number.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security indicated to the Washington Examiner that the total number of ICE detainers issued may be more than Boston reported.

According to Cox, the BPD does not maintain a separate database of ICE detainer requests received “to ensure continued compliance with the Boston Trust Act.”

In 2019, the Boston Trust Act was amended to specify that BPD personnel are strictly prohibited from assisting federal immigration enforcement in any form, such as asking about a suspect's immigration status, sharing information with ICE, conducting arrests based on administrative ICE warrants, and turning over detainees to ICE.

According to the updated ordinance, which was unanimously approved by the Boston City Council in response to mass deportations under the first Trump administration, the revisions added a requirement for the BPD to train all officers on these provisions.

On Thursday, the Justice Department launched a lawsuit challenging the Boston Trust Act, saying it instructs BPD “to categorically flout federal immigration detainer requests so that removable aliens can evade ICE apprehension.”

When local law enforcement abides by immigration detainers, federal officers are able to arrest deportable aliens in a secure, controlled environment, such as detention centers, instead of searching for at-large suspects in the community, according to ICE. The latter situation expends scarce government resources and puts public safety and the lives of arresting officers at risk.

According to the federal complaint filed against city leadership, criminal charges often cited in detainers by ICE's Boston field office include homicide, larceny, and sexual offenses. Assault and drug trafficking are the two top charges against suspects ICE seeks to round up, according to the lawsuit. “Due to the Boston Trust Act, many of these criminals were released directly into Boston communities” despite detainers in place.

For example, in January, ICE officers arrested Brauly Aybar-Alcantara, a 25-year-old illegal immigrant from the Dominican Republic who was wanted for a slew of charges, including indecent assault, battery, and gross lewdness. The BPD apprehended him in July 2024, and ICE attempted to facilitate a custodial transfer via detainer request, “but was forced by the noncooperative jurisdiction” to nab Aybar-Alcantara on the streets, not until half a year later.

The sanctuary city showdown brewing in Boston follows months of jabs exchanged between the Trump administration and Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat who was named as a plaintiff in the DOJ lawsuit.

BONDI SAYS DOJ WILL INTENSIFY EFFORTS IN BOSTON AFTER WU SPAT

Late last year, Boston city councilors adopted a resolution reaffirming the Boston Trust Act ahead of President Donald Trump's inauguration. In an August letter, Wu told Attorney General Pam Bondi that “Boston will never back down.”

“Federal lawsuits are certainly one form of leverage that the administration can bring to bear against sanctuary jurisdictions, as we have seen in other places around the country,” Ira Mehlman, the media director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told the Washington Examiner.

More immediately, Mehlman said, ICE could ramp up enforcement actions in Boston.

Over the weekend, ICE officials announced they will crack down on illegal immigration in Boston and beyond through a Massachusetts-based operation, called “Patriot 2.0,” targeting illegal immigrants with criminal records.

BOSTON FACING MASS DEPORTATIONS UNDER ‘OPERATION PATRIOT 2.0'

“All of this, of course, could be easily avoided if Boston and other jurisdictions simply honor detainer requests for deportable aliens who wind up in the custody of local law enforcement,” Mehlman said. “While these sorts of policies may appeal to a small group of political activists, there is no constituency in Boston or anywhere else to protect criminal aliens from removal.”

The Washington Examiner contacted Wu's press office for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI has been investigating the murder of Iryna Zarutska “from day one.”

Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska was murdered in Charlotte, North Carolina, last month, but her fatal stabbing came to widespread attention on Friday after the Charlotte Area Transit System released footage of the attack. After right-wing commentators decried a perceived lack of attention to the matter, Patel said on Monday that the FBI had been investigating the matter from the start.

“The FBI has been investigating the Charlotte train murder from day one,” Patel said. “Stay tuned.”

🚨 The FBI has been investigating the Charlotte train murder from day one. Stay tuned.

Patel didn't immediately provide any details, but the investigation may be related to the judges who released Zarutska's murderer, Decarlos Brown Jr., a schizophrenic homeless man who had been arrested and released 14 previous times.

Zarutska's murder came to Trump's attention after he was asked about the matter by a reporter on Sunday night. He commemorated her in a speech on Monday, when he sent his “love and hope” to Zarutska's family.

“A lunatic just got up and started — it's right on the tape, not really watchable because it's so horrible — but just viciously stabs her. She's just sitting there. So they're evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don't handle that, we don't have a country,” he said.

Trump went further later that day on Truth Social, blaming her death on former Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's crime policies.

“What the hell was he doing riding the train, and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP. The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer's knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail, including Former Disgraced Governor and ‘Wannabe Senator' Roy Cooper,” he added.

The chilling footage immediately preceding and proceeding Zarutska's murder set off a firestorm on social media.

The surveillance footage showed Zarutska, who fled Ukraine in 2022, sitting on the metro in front of Brown, who took out a pocket knife and stabbed Zarutska multiple times, killing her. He then paced around the metro car with her blood dripping off his knife.

TRUMP PINS BLAME FOR MURDER OF IRYNA ZARUTSKA ON SOFT CRIME POLICIES

Brown had an extensive criminal history dating back to 2014, including an armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which he spent eight years in jail. Before he murdered Zarutska, he had been arrested and released at least 14 times and was also diagnosed with schizophrenia.

He was released last time, in January, after giving a written promise that he would return for his court date, according to court documents reviewed by the National News Desk.

This is CNBC's coverage of Apple's biggest launch event of the year, where it announced new iPhones and Apple Watches that will go on sale on Sept. 19.

Everything you need to know about Apple's launch:

Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman said that the iPhone 17 launch comes at a "really tough" moment for Apple as the company is facing questions about its artificial intelligence efforts.

"The problem with Apple is that everything that's showing up today is, in fact, pretty incremental," he told CNBC's "Power Lunch." "Yes, the phone is thinner, and yes, it looks great. We haven't had a big supercycle in four years."

Newman said that last year's promise of Apple Intelligence driving a big cycle didn't really pan out, but the company does have "the longest on-ramp" to get AI right with its massive user base.

Apple revealed the launch date for iOS 26, the latest version of the iPhone operating system that will ship with the new devices next week.

The software, iOS 26, will be released to the public on Monday, Apple said in press releases for the new iPhones.

For most people, the biggest change in iOS 26 will be a complete visual redesign. Apple calls its new iOS look "liquid glass," and has replaced static opaque buttons and menus throughout the operating system with new animations and transparent designs that are intended to flow like water as the user navigates the software. — Kif Leswing

Investors seemed to be indifferent to Apple's latest product announcements, including the new iPhone Air model and Apple Series 11 Watch.

Apple shares were down about 1.5% when the event ended. — Jonathan Vanian

Apple raised the price of its iPhone 17 Pro on Tuesday, as expected, as the company deals with tariffs and geopolitical challenges.

The iPhone 16 Pro started at $999, but this year's model starts at $1099. It comes with more built-in storage, though.

In addition, Apple's mid-range phone, the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, was discontinued. It's been replaced by a $999 iPhone Air.

Apple's entry-level iPhone 17 remains at $799 and up. Meanwhile, Apple's high end Pro Max phones will cost $1,199. — Kif Leswing

Apple said the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models will have the "best camera system we've ever made."

— Chris Eudaily

There were questions about the battery life of the new Air model ahead of today's launch, and now we have the answer, though the announcement was short on specifics.

"Despite being much thinner and lighter, iPhone Air still gets amazing all-day battery life," the company said.

The Air's internal design maximizes battery space and the new operating system, iOS 26, will have new power-saving features that learn your usage patterns and anticipate when you might run low on battery.  

— Chris Eudaily

Apple's iPhone 17 Pro will use aluminum as its case material. Apple's two previous Pro phones used titanium, which is used on this year's Air model. Before that, Apple sold iPhone Pro models with a stainless steel frame, which had heat dissipation and weight tradeoffs — Kif Leswing

Apple's new chip in the iPhone Air and Pro models, called the A19 Pro, has several improvements for artificial intelligence, the company said on Tuesday.

The new chip has a second-generation caching architecture that helps to double its ability to do math, the company said. It also adding parts called "machine learning accelerators" into its graphics processors, or GPUs, which are typically used for AI, in addition to graphics.

Apple's chief marketer Greg Joswiak said the chip will enable its devices to run local large language models.

The company says these updates will allow its new phones to have three times the GPU computation as last year's phones. Apple also said that the phone's computation performance compares to its MacBook Pro laptops. — Kif Leswing

The company said iPhone users took over 500 billion selfies last year, and the new model has a "center stage front camera" that has the largest front camera sensor, almost twice the size of the previous front camera.

The new iPhone 17 features a 48 megapixel dual fusion camera system and has four times the resolution compared to iPhone 16. — Chris Eudaily

Apple has announced its new thin-and-light iPhone, called iPhone Air, as analysts expected.

It's the first major new iPhone design since the iPhone X was introduced in 2017. It's got a titanium frame that Apple says is "space grade." Apple said it is 5.6 millimeters thick and comes in white, gold, black, and sky blue colors.

Apple says the Air is more durable than previous iPhones and uses a chip it calls the A19 Pro.

"Our intention was to make an iPhone that feels like a piece of the future, powerful, yet so thin and light it seems to disappear in your hands," an Apple presenter said. — Kif Leswing

In previous years, one way Apple distinguished its entry-level iPhone from its "Pro" models was a feature it calls ProMotion, or the display's refresh rate, which makes the entire interface smoother.

On Tuesday, Apple said its entry-level iPhone 17 will get the feature, and will also get a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen with smaller bezels. That means the screen is getting bigger, but the size of the phone is staying the same as that of the iPhone 16.

Analysts say that after battery life, display quality is one of the top reasons for users to upgrade to a new iPhone. — Kif Leswing

The iPhone 17 series mobile devices will be available in five colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white and sage. They will also feature "ceramic shield 2," which Apple says will make the devices three times more scratch resistant than earlier models. — Lora Kolodny

Apple announced pricing for its new Apple Watches, which it calls Series 11, and Apple did not raise starting prices for its models, despite speculation from Wall Street analysts that it would have to a result of tariffs.

The company's low end watch, the Apple Watch SE 3, starts at $249. Its main-line Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399, the same as the Series 11, and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 sells for $799 and up, which is also unchanged. — Kif Leswing

Apple's highest-end watch, the Ultra, was introduced in 2022, and updated with minor improvements in 2023, but it didn't get a big update last year — only a new black color.

The company said that it had updated the model and it is now called Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple said it had improved its display, satellite connectivity and added 5G coverage.

It starts at $799, the same price as its predecessor. — Kif Leswing

Apple said the Watch Series 11 is "our thinnest and most comfortable watch."

A ceramic coating on the glass makes it harder and more scratch resistant. The Series 11 also features a new 5G modem and antenna architecture and is more power efficient, using less battery.

— Chris Eudaily

The Apple Series 11 will have a battery that can last 24 hours, and it will come available in colors like jet black, silver, rose gold and a new gray version. — Jonathan Vanian

Apple positions its Apple Watch as a health aid, and its biggest medical improvement this year in its Series 11 models is that it can now monitor people with hypertension, or high blood pressure.

The company said that its algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure in the background, by reviewing data over 30-day periods. Apple said its technology was based on a series of medical studies with 100,000 participants.

"Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond," said Sumbul Desai, Apple's health vice president. However, she warned that it won't detect all instances of hypertension.

Apple says it expects FDA clearance "soon." — Kif Leswing

Apple has announced its first price of the day — and there's no change. Apple's new AirPods will retail for $249, the same price as the current generation AirPods Pro 2. They go on sale on September 19. — Kif Leswing

Along with features like live translation, active noise reduction and a longer battery life, Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 will be available in five sizes. The company calls them the "best-fitting" AirPods ever. — Lora Kolodny

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by announcing the AirPods Pro 3.

The new device will fit people's ears better than previous versions of the AirPods, and they will contain translation features, said Kate Bergeron, Apple vice president of hardware engineering.

The new earbuds also have improved spatial audio features.

"No matter what headphones you've used before, with AirPods 3, you'll have the world's best active noise cancelation of any in ear wireless headphones, transparency enables you to hear your surroundings and now your own voice and people speaking to you will sound more natural than ever," Bergeron said.

Bergeron said there will be longer battery life, and will last 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6 hours previously. Pre-orders for the devices kick off on Tuesday for $249, and the AirPods Pro 3 will ship on Sept. 19. — Jonathan Vanian

Apple's new wireless headphones, called Apple AirPods Pro 3, will be able to translate conversations in foreign languages in real-time.

"It doesn't just translate individual words," Apple's presenter said. "The meaning of each phrase is translated for you. When you need to talk, just speak naturally."

Live translation has emerged as one of the first major consumer features powered by artificial intelligence. Google announced several live translation features, including the ability to automatically translate phone calls in the user's voice, at its event last month. — Kif Leswing

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the launch event with a short speech about how the company thinks about design, saying that it's "at the core of everything we do."

"Design has always been fundamental to who we are and what we do for us," Cook said. "Design goes beyond just how something looks or feels. Design is also how it works."

He said Apple would launch new Apple Watches, iPhones and AirPods on Tuesday.

Apple's most famous designer, Jony Ive, who left the company in 2019, is now working with rival OpenAI on new competing hardware products. — Kif Leswing

Apple streams its launch events on its website and YouTube, which publishes a viewer count. Minutes ahead of the event start time, there were over 650,000 people on the YouTube stream. That figure shows there is still intense consumer demand to learn about the latest Apple products. — Kif Leswing

Investors will be apathetic towards the Apple event if there are no new major hardware updates, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on CNBC's Halftime Report on Tuesday.

He predicts that Apple could raise iPhone prices due to tariffs.

"Probably going to be about $50 to $100 given the tariffs issues," Ives said. — Kif Leswing

Steve Wozniak famously founded Apple alongside the late Steve Jobs in a Cupertino garage. He hasn't been involved on a day-to-day basis in decades, but he's an important inspiration to Apple employees and fans. 

— Kif Leswing

While Apple's AI hasn't lived up to expectations, customers will still upgrade their iPhones to improve battery life, Evercore's Amit Daryanani said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday.

"End of the day, when it comes to iPhones or Apple products, in every survey we have run, the top two reasons people want to buy a new iPhone is: The battery life is very bad or they need a new screen," Daryanani said.

"AI and Apple Intelligence is the fourth or fifth reason why they want to buy," he continued. 

— Kif Leswing

Wall Street Journal tech columnist Joanna Stern said Apple's launch event has to deliver for investors and consumers, but price stability will be a key point of focus.

"In a world of tariffs, in this world of the economy, that's pretty amazing for Tim Cook," Stern told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange." "So I think that's going to be a big thing that investors should be looking at, right. The prices of these phones: Are they inching upwards without any real significant feature increases? That's going to be a tougher sell."

Stern said that without major design overhauls or new types of devices that drive excitement, she expects the launch to be "the same as the last many iPhone events."

"People are going to upgrade because they need a new iPhone, but people are not going to be running out to buy these phones if they don't need a new phone," she said.

It's dark and a cool 67 degrees at Apple's Cupertino headquarters ahead of the iPhone maker's "Awe dropping" launch event.

CNBC's Steve Kovach reports that staff are setting up breakfast before the crowds arrive. The campus will soon be packed for the expected announcement of new iPhones and Apple Watches.

— Chris Eudaily

Andersen Capital Management founder Peter Andersen said he was disappointed in the iPhone maker's lack of attention to software and artificial intelligence ahead of the launch event.

Andersen told CNBC's "Power Lunch" that the focus on hardware was "kind of a head fake and ignoring the elephant in the room, frankly, which is: Where is Siri?"

"As AI continues to develop, they are obviously standing in the background. So they will attempt to focus the fact of new penetration and that the hardware offers new innovations, but in the long run, I do really think they have to focus on the software development," he said.

Even if iPhone users aren't planning to buy one of the new devices the company announces on Tuesday, they should expect their phones to get a drastically different look later this week.

That's because Apple will likely roll out its iOS 26 operating system after its iPhone event, and that software update will include the most drastic visual change to the iPhone's interface in a decade.

Revealed in June, Apple has created a new visual language that it calls Liquid Glass. The new look replaces formerly opaque static buttons throughout the iPhone's operating system with transparent graphics designed by Apple to have detailed, liquid-like animations.

So far, Liquid Glass has had mixed reviews from early adopters who have tried it out in beta versions, but when Apple releases the new software this month, millions of people will experience it for the first time. Apple is hoping that they will find it "delightful." — Kif Leswing

The biggest question Apple investors and customers have about this year's iPhones is how much they will cost.

Consumer products, including apparel, footwear, coffee and game consoles, are seeing price increases driven by tariff costs. Some Wall Street analysts are counting on Apple to follow.

Most analysts expect Apple to raise prices on some of its models as it grapples with the Trump administration's tariffs. The company said in July that tariffs could cost it over $1 billion this quarter.

But if Apple does raise prices on its phones, don't expect the company to blame the change on tariffs. More likely, Apple will highlight the phones' new technology, as well as their chips.

"No one's going to come out and say it's related to tariffs," said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.

It's also possible that Apple might eliminate the entry-level version of some of its phones, forcing users to get more storage at higher starting prices. Apple typically charges $100 more to double the amount of the iPhone's storage from 128GB to 256GB.

One possibility, JPMorgan analysts have said, is that Apple could eliminate the 128GB version of the iPhone Pro, which currently costs $999 for the iPhone 16, meaning consumers would have to pay $1,099 for an iPhone 17 Pro that has more starting-level storage than its predecessor. — Kif Leswing

Apple has released four new phones at its September events since 2020. But not all four iPhone models are equally popular.

Every year, one of Apple's models tends to lag its siblings in terms of sales, according to analysts. This year, it's been Apple's tweener model, the iPhone 16 Plus, which costs $899. That's higher than entry-level models with smaller screens but less than Apple's Pro models that feature higher-quality screens and faster chips.

Before the Plus lagged, Apple offered a "Mini" phone with a smaller screen at its lowest entry-level price. That Mini model also failed to produce strong sales.

This year, analysts have said they expect Apple will mix up its lineup yet again, replacing the "Plus" with a slim model that could be called the "Air," like Apple's thin laptops and iPads.

The idea behind the slim model is that consumers will give up some battery life and features, such as multiple camera lenses, for a more lightweight iPhone. Apple's expected entry into the market comes after rival Samsung released a similar device called the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year.

"While we acknowledge that a thinner device would introduce a relatively new form factor for the iPhone, we think that it will have a muted impact on consumer purchasing decisions," UBS analysts wrote in a Sunday note. — Kif Leswing

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has secured Nasdaq as a strategic investor ahead of its initial public offering this week, CNBC has confirmed.

Nasdaq plans to invest $50 million in the crypto company in a partnership that will allow the stock exchange to offer Gemini's custodial services to its financial institution clients. Gemini will also become a distribution partner for Nasdaq's trade management system known as Calypso.

The investment, first reported by Reuters early Tuesday, is separate from Gemini's planned initial public offering this week. The crypto company plans to raise up to $317 million Friday in its public debut on the Nasdaq.

"We continue to expand our capabilities to serve our institutional clients and the broader investor universe as the regulatory landscape around crypto assets evolves," a Nasdaq spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. "To prepare for future developments while maintaining an open-ecosystem approach to market infrastructure, we will partner with Gemini on a non-exclusive basis as part of a broader strategy to offer multi-custodial and staking services for crypto assets. Additionally, we will work with Gemini as a distribution partner for Nasdaq Calypso, to serve firms seeking to benefit from its collateral management capabilities across traditional and digital assets."

"The investment and partnership structure we have employed with Gemini is consistent with those that we typically structure through Nasdaq Ventures," they added.

The news comes a day after Nasdaq filed a proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking a rule change that would allow for the trading of tokenized stocks and exchange-traded products. While interest in tokenization has grown in recent months, a formal rule change would allow Nasdaq to become the first major traditional stock exchange to allow tokenized securities trading.

In crypto, tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. Holders of tokenized assets don't have outright ownership of the assets themselves.

Gemini was founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2014 and holds more than $21 billion of assets on its platform as of the end of July.

Now that's a thin iPhone.

Apple made some big product announcements during its "Awe dropping" event in Cupertino, introducing an iPhone 17 line-up that included a slimmed-down model called the iPhone Air.

The fall event is Apple's biggest day of the year, as CEO Tim Cook and other executives have a chance to make their annual sales pitch for why customers should upgrade devices.

The new $999 iPhone Air stole the show, clocking in at 5.6 millimeters. Apple also said the Air was its most durable iPhone to date.

While the iPhone Air doesn't feature as powerful a camera system or internal chip as the iPhone 17 Pro, and it packs a smaller battery, the device will likely appeal to early adopters and those looking for a lighter iPhone — or those who want to stand out with a flashy new device.

Wall Street was also closely watching to see if Apple would increase the price of its iPhone lineup.

Spoiler alert: It did, but only for the high-end Pro variant.

While the entry-level iPhone 17 maintained the starting price of the previous iPhone 16 at $799, the starting price of the iPhone 17 Pro increased $100 over the launch price of the iPhone 16 Pro to $1,099 — though Apple increased the base amount of internal storage from 128 GB to 256 GB.

Powering the new lineup will be iOS 26, Apple's revamped operating system featuring its transparent-themed "Liquid Glass" aesthetic touted at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference.

Apple also showed off the new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds with an impressive video demo showcasing two people wearing the headphones and communicating in different languages thanks to its new live-translation feature.

A slew of new Apple Watch models were also introduced, including the Watch Series 11, the budget Apple Watch SE 3, and the more rugged and durable Ultra Watch 3.

Business Insider live-blogged the entire keynote — scroll on for the full play-by-play recap:

As Tim Cook bids people farewell and the fall event comes to a close, Wall Street doesn't appear too happy with what was shown off.

Apple's stock price was down around 1.44% in intraday trading as the event wrapped up.

OK, here's where the rubber meets the road — iPhone pricing!

Spoiler alert: Apple has increased the starting price of the iPhone 17 Pro, but it does come with more storage than the previous iPhone 16 Pro.

Here's the breakdown:

All 4 models will be available to pre-order on Friday and launch in stores on September 19.

Apple has a new material for its iPhone case that it's calling "TechWoven" — a departure from the poorly reviewed "FineWoven" cases it previously debuted and then quietly appeared to discontinue.

Apple says the new woven textile is crafted with a process that uses multiple yarn colors to create "a sophisticated look, while a protective coating provides resistance to scratches and stains.

All three rear cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro are 48 megapixels for the very first time, Apple says, and they're also all fusion cameras.

The new rear camera module includes a sensor that is 56% larger than the previous generation, which improves sharpness in bright light and provides better detail.

Apple says the iPhone 17 Pro is the equivalent of eight professional lenses in your pocket.

Apple says it filmed its event using the iPhone 17 Pro.

Apple says it's been able to "grow the battery significantly" on the Pro 17 model, thanks in part to the new camera plateau.

The iPhone 17 Pro is capable of up to 39 hours of video playback, the company says.

Apple says that at the heart of the new thermal management system is an Apple-designed vapor chamber that carries deionized water to move heat away from the components, allowing for higher sustained performance.

"It also delivers a dramatic leap in performance that makes this the most powerful iPhone ever, by far, and it starts with an entirely new approach to thermal management," Apple says.

Cook says it's the most advanced iPhone ever.

While the iPhone Air is Apple's thinnest iPhone, the Pro model is its most powerful, carrying its most powerful mobile chip.

The rear camera plateau gives it a new look that expands past the previous camera bump module.

Apple says it features a new approach to thermal management.

There's also a new color: "Cosmic Orange."

No physical SIM cards in the iPhone Air — it sounds like there isn't room. It's only eSIM.

With iOS 26, the iPhone Air gets new power-saving features like adaptive power mode, which learns your usage patterns and anticipates when you might run low on battery, to know when to conserve your battery.

Apple made a new, lower-profile MagSafe battery add-on for those looking to get extra battery life. Apple says the compatible MagSafe battery is slim enough to fit in your pocket while charging your iPhone Air.

The iPhone Air features the 48-megapixel fusion camera that Apple touts as an advanced system that puts four lenses in your pocket.

A dual-camera feature will also be available, allowing users to record video from both the front and back cameras simultaneously.

The iPhone Air is launching in four colors: space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue.

Apple says the new thinner iPhone Air fits on a fingertip and combines "strength, lightness, and durability."

To introduce us to the iPhone Air, Apple shows the new phone, coming in at 5.6 millimeters, surviving a fall.

Apple says both the front and back of the new phone are covered in the protective Ceramic Shield. It's also the first device we've seen with the new "plateau" that houses the back camera and more.

It's the most durable iPhone yet, according to Apple.

Apple shows off the front-facing camera system on the iPhone 17, which it says has improved selfies.

Apple says the new technology combines the capabilities of two cameras in one with the main camera.

The main rear camera delivers 48 megapixels of resolution for capturing fine details, Apple says.

The first iPhone model shown off is the base-level iPhone 17.

Apple says the iPhone 17 display is its "best yet," with a larger 6.3-inch screen. The exterior also introduces the "Ceramic Shield 2," which Apple says will protect the improved Always-On display from scratching.

It comes with an advanced A19 Apple silicon that the company says is engineered to power Apple Intelligence.

Apple says 10 minutes of charge gets you up to 8 hours of video playback.

Here we go, the main event!

Apple says the new Ultra 3 has the "largest display" of an Apple Watch, with an always-on display that won't affect battery life. It gets up to 42 hours of battery life, and features satellite connectivity.

The Apple Watch SE 3 starts at just $249; Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399, and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 starts at $799. You can pre-order all the new models today, and they will be available starting September 19.

The new Apple Watch SE will have an always-on display, 18-hour battery life, and fast-charging (two times faster than the previous model). It will also include health features like sleep score, temperature sensing, and sleep apnea detection.

Apple says it developed a "ground-breaking" feature that can detect high blood pressure using an algorithm to identify hypertension in users.

For sleep, Apple introduces sleep scores to measure the "quality" of rest for users can track their sleep data more closely.

The Series 11 will have 24 hours of battery life.

Next is the Apple Watch Series 11.

Apple says the 11th generation of the watch is two times more scratch-resistant than its predecessor and comes with 5G. It will run on WatchOS 26 and have the new "Liquid Glass" design aeshetic.

Apple is playing a video of people's experiences with the Apple Watch, set to uplifting music. We're seeing people explain how the Apple Watch helped them hit fitness goals or in emergency health or rescue events.

Apple says the new AirPods Pro 3 come with a $249 price tag, the same price point as the previous model, and have eight hours of battery life from a single charge.

That's up from six hours previously. If you're using the hearing-aid features in transparency mode, that extends to 10 hours.

AirPods Pro 3 will have the ability to monitor your heart rate during a workout, using what Apple calls its "smallest heart rate sensor." It'll also become more integrated into Apple's fitness features to track workouts.

Apple says its new AirPods are engineered to widen the sound stage and offer twice the noise cancellation of the previous generation. For those with the original AirPods Pro, Apple says it's a night and day difference, with up to 4x improved active noise cancellation.

The new earphones will also aid in Live Translation using Apple Intelligence when triggered by a gesture.

Two people wearing the AirPods Pro 3 will be able to communicate in different languages while Live Translation seamlessly translates, Apple says.

Apple also says they're the "best-fitting AirPods ever."

Apple CEO Tim Cook shouts out Liquid Glass right away and hints at big iPhone news.

Liquid Glass, the software design that Apple showed off at WWDC earlier this year, is a key part of the upcoming iOS 26.

And as for iPhone, Cook says Apple is taking the "biggest leap ever."

The event begins with an opening video of quick cuts showing various Apple products and features.

We're only 5 minutes away from Tim Cook's keynote kicking off.

You can also watch the event along with us.

While Apple's stock price has seen some recent gains (it's up 2.86% this month), shares are still trading down 5.79% since the start of the year.

As Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI race, a strong showing from its iPhone 17 slate could provide a much-needed lift, especially if Wall Street analysts end up impressed by the expected thinner Air model's potential to drive upgrades.

Apple shares are trading down a little less than 1% heading into Tim Cook's 1 p.m. ET keynote.

One big question about the rumored "Air" model is how popular it will prove to be.

The anticipated slimmer iPhone model isn't expected to be as powerful as the "Pro" variants, and it's not expected to have as good a camera either. So that begs the question: Who will choose it over the cheaper entry-level iPhone 17 or the high-end Pro?

I suspect early adopters (like me) will lead the charge. I've got an iPhone 13 Pro and haven't seen much reason to personally upgrade to previous models, but I'm intrigued by the idea of having a significantly thinner phone in my pocket — even if the camera isn't quite as crisp as the Pro.

The Air will likely also appeal to those who simply want to broadcast they have the latest iPhone — something that visibly stands out when they use it at school, around friends, or on the subway to work.

The potential issue there is that signaling becomes a lot harder to do when you have a protective case on your phone, which adds bulk. And if you choose to risk it and go case-less, be prepared to pay more for Apple Care + so accidental drop damage repairs aren't as pricey.

-Steven Tweedie

Apple's invitees are arriving at Apple Park with their colorful badges in hand ahead of the 1 p.m. ET keynote kickoff. They're being served light bites before the main event kicks off on campus.

The iPhone's new operating system was a major talking point at this year's WWDC, and today's event unveils the devices it was built to serve. In June, Apple showed off its new "Liquid Glass" design language within iOS 26 that redesigns the iPhone's software aesthetic to a more transparent layout for toolbars and apps on the Home Screen.

For iPhone users, expect to jump from iOS 18 to iOS 26 as Apple brings together its operating systems and aligns them with the years to come.

Apps like the Phone app are also getting overhauled. In the new version, voicemails, recents, and favorites are combined. There's also a new Call Screening feature that will allow Apple to silently answer unknown calls and give you info to know if it's worth answering.

If you don't end up upgrading to the latest iPhone 17, you'll still be able to update to iOS 26 at some point soon — you just might not have access to all of its AI features.

Analysts say they aren't expecting any major surprises today.

With rumors about the new features of the iPhone 17 swirling, analysts expect the announcements to largely fall in line with the reports we've seen of new camera features, the thinner iPhone 17 Air, and new accessories. They'll also be keeping an ear out for price hikes between $50 and $100 on new iPhone models, as EMARKETER writes that tariffs could lead to an iPhone that's "even more expensive than before."

One topic that they don't expect to get much airtime is Apple Intelligence or the delayed AI-powered Siri overhaul. Analysts from Morgan Stanley predict that Apple won't focus on AI as much at the event — which typically highlights new gadgets since Apple spotlighted its new software earlier this year at WWDC.

There's always the chance there will be some surprises, though. After all, Apple loves to highlight "one more thing" at the tail-end of its events.

Some Wall Street analysts are predicting higher price tags for the iPhone 17 family, estimating some models could cost $50 to $100 more than previous versions.

The rumored iPhone 17 "Air" is expected to replace the "Plus" model in the lineup and Bank of America analysts wrote in August that it could cost about $100 more — making the price around $999.

As for the iPhone 17 Pro, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted the 128 GB storage model would be eliminated, effectively making Pro models start at $1,099 for the 256 GB version.

Of course, Apple could always choose to eat any cost increases, but it typically likes to try to preserve its famously high margins.

After a bruising start to the year that saw Apple make the rare move to delay the AI-overhauled Siri, Tim Cook has scored some recent wins.

Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales in its most recent earnings report. During the first week of August, Cook visited the White House, where Apple received praise from President Donald Trump for being among companies that are "building in the United States." As a result, the president signaled that Apple would be treated well in future trade agreements.

In the courtroom, a US Customs ruling allowed the company to bring a blood-oxygen monitoring feature back to some Apple Watches after a previous ban. The US also backed the iPhone maker in its fight against a UK order that would make encrypted user data accessible to the British government.

And in September, a judge decided that Google's search deals with tech giants like Apple could continue — boosting Apple's stock price.

Cook posted his signature sunrise picture over the Apple campus to let followers know he's up and ready for the event.

"Days like today are some of the most exciting moments at Apple," Cook captioned the X post.

This is CNBC's coverage of Apple's biggest launch event of the year, where it is expected to announce new iPhones and Apple Watches that will go on sale later this month. This blog will be updated with live updates during the event.

What you need to know:

Apple's highest-end watch, the Ultra, was introduced in 2022, and updated with minor improvements in 2023, but it didn't get a big update last year — only a new black color.

The company said that it had updated the model and it is now called Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple said it had improved its display, satellite connectivity and added 5G coverage.

It starts at $799, the same price as its predecessor. -- Kif Leswing

Apple said the Watch Series 11 is "our thinnest and most comfortable watch."

A ceramic coating on the glass makes it harder and more scratch resistant. The Series 11 also features a new 5G modem and antenna architecture and is more power efficient, using less battery.

— Chris Eudaily

The Apple Series 11 will have a battery that can last 24 hours, and it will come available in colors like jet black, silver, rose gold and a new gray version. -- Jonathan Vanian

Apple positions its Apple Watch as a health aid, and its biggest medical improvement this year in its Series 11 models is that it can now monitor people with hypertension, or high blood pressure.

The company said that its algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure in the background, by reviewing data over 30-day periods. Apple said its technology was based on a series of medical studies with 100,000 participants.

"Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond," said Sumbul Desai, Apple's health vice president. However, she warned that it won't detect all instances of hypertension.

Apple says it expects FDA clearance "soon." — Kif Leswing

Apple has announced its first price of the day — and there's no change. Apple's new AirPods will retail for $249, the same price as the current generation AirPods Pro 2. They go on sale on September 19. — Kif Leswing

Along with features like live translation, active noise reduction and a longer battery life, Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 will be available in five sizes. The company calls them the "best-fitting" AirPods ever. -- Lora Kolodny

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event by announcing the AirPods Pro 3. 

The new device will fit people's ears better than previous versions of the AirPods, and they will contain translation features, said Kate Bergeron, Apple vice president of hardware engineering.

The new earbuds also have improved spatial audio features.

"No matter what headphones you've used before, with AirPods 3, you'll have the world's best active noise cancelation of any in ear wireless headphones, transparency enables you to hear your surroundings and now your own voice and people speaking to you will sound more natural than ever," Bergeron said.

Bergeron said there will be longer battery life, and will last 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6 hours previously. Pre-orders for the devices kick off on Tuesday for $249, and the AirPods Pro 3 will ship on Sept. 19. -- Jonathan Vanian

Apple's new wireless headphones, called Apple AirPods Pro 3, will be able to translate conversations in foreign languages in real-time.

"It doesn't just translate individual words," Apple's presenter said. "The meaning of each phrase is translated for you. When you need to talk, just speak naturally."

Live translation has emerged as one of the first major consumer features powered by artificial intelligence. Google announced several live translation features, including the ability to automatically translate phone calls in the user's voice, at its event last month. — Kif Leswing

Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the launch event with a short speech about how the company thinks about design, saying that it's "at the core of everything we do."

"Design has always been fundamental to who we are and what we do for us," Cook said. "Design goes beyond just how something looks or feels. Design is also how it works."

He said Apple would launch new Apple Watches, iPhones and AirPods on Tuesday.

Apple's most famous designer, Jony Ive, who left the company in 2019, is now working with rival OpenAI on new competing hardware products. — Kif Leswing

Apple streams its launch events on its website and YouTube, which publishes a viewer count. Minutes ahead of the event start time, there were over 650,000 people on the YouTube stream. That figure shows there is still intense consumer demand to learn about the latest Apple products. — Kif Leswing

Investors will be apathetic towards the Apple event if there are no new major hardware updates, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on CNBC's Halftime Report on Tuesday.

He predicts that Apple could raise iPhone prices due to tariffs.

"Probably going to be about $50 to $100 given the tariffs issues," Ives said. — Kif Leswing

Steve Wozniak famously founded Apple alongside the late Steve Jobs in a Cupertino garage. He hasn't been involved on a day-to-day basis in decades, but he's an important inspiration to Apple employees and fans. 

— Kif Leswing

While Apple's AI hasn't lived up to expectations, customers will still upgrade their iPhones to improve battery life, Evercore's Amit Daryanani said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday.

"End of the day, when it comes to iPhones or Apple products, in every survey we have run, the top two reasons people want to buy a new iPhone is: The battery life is very bad or they need a new screen," Daryanani said.

"AI and Apple Intelligence is the fourth or fifth reason why they want to buy," he continued. 

— Kif Leswing

Wall Street Journal tech columnist Joanna Stern said Apple's launch event has to deliver for investors and consumers, but price stability will be a key point of focus.

"In a world of tariffs, in this world of the economy, that's pretty amazing for Tim Cook," Stern told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange." "So I think that's going to be a big thing that investors should be looking at, right. The prices of these phones: Are they inching upwards without any real significant feature increases? That's going to be a tougher sell."

Stern said that without major design overhauls or new types of devices that drive excitement, she expects the launch to be "the same as the last many iPhone events."

"People are going to upgrade because they need a new iPhone, but people are not going to be running out to buy these phones if they don't need a new phone," she said.

— Chris Eudaily

Apple CEO Tim Cook always posts a photo from Apple Park, in Cupertino California, on launch days. 

— Kif Leswing

It's dark and a cool 67 degrees at Apple's Cupertino headquarters ahead of the iPhone maker's "Awe dropping" launch event.

CNBC's Steve Kovach reports that staff are setting up breakfast before the crowds arrive. The campus will soon be packed for the expected announcement of new iPhones and Apple Watches.

— Chris Eudaily

Andersen Capital Management founder Peter Andersen said he was disappointed in the iPhone maker's lack of attention to software and artificial intelligence ahead of the launch event.

Andersen told CNBC's "Power Lunch" that the focus on hardware was "kind of a head fake and ignoring the elephant in the room, frankly, which is: Where is Siri?"

"As AI continues to develop, they are obviously standing in the background. So they will attempt to focus the fact of new penetration and that the hardware offers new innovations, but in the long run, I do really think they have to focus on the software development," he said.

Even if iPhone users aren't planning to buy one of the new devices the company announces on Tuesday, they should expect their phones to get a drastically different look later this week.

That's because Apple will likely roll out its iOS 26 operating system after its iPhone event, and that software update will include the most drastic visual change to the iPhone's interface in a decade.

Revealed in June, Apple has created a new visual language that it calls Liquid Glass. The new look replaces formerly opaque static buttons throughout the iPhone's operating system with transparent graphics designed by Apple to have detailed, liquid-like animations.

So far, Liquid Glass has had mixed reviews from early adopters who have tried it out in beta versions, but when Apple releases the new software this month, millions of people will experience it for the first time. Apple is hoping that they will find it "delightful." — Kif Leswing

The biggest question Apple investors and customers have about this year's iPhones is how much they will cost.

Consumer products, including apparel, footwear, coffee and game consoles, are seeing price increases driven by tariff costs. Some Wall Street analysts are counting on Apple to follow.

Most analysts expect Apple to raise prices on some of its models as it grapples with the Trump administration's tariffs. The company said in July that tariffs could cost it over $1 billion this quarter.

But if Apple does raise prices on its phones, don't expect the company to blame the change on tariffs. More likely, Apple will highlight the phones' new technology, as well as their chips.

"No one's going to come out and say it's related to tariffs," said IDC analyst Nabila Popal.

It's also possible that Apple might eliminate the entry-level version of some of its phones, forcing users to get more storage at higher starting prices. Apple typically charges $100 more to double the amount of the iPhone's storage from 128GB to 256GB.

One possibility, JPMorgan analysts have said, is that Apple could eliminate the 128GB version of the iPhone Pro, which currently costs $999 for the iPhone 16, meaning consumers would have to pay $1,099 for an iPhone 17 Pro that has more starting-level storage than its predecessor. — Kif Leswing

Apple has released four new phones at its September events since 2020. But not all four iPhone models are equally popular.

Every year, one of Apple's models tends to lag its siblings in terms of sales, according to analysts. This year, it's been Apple's tweener model, the iPhone 16 Plus, which costs $899. That's higher than entry-level models with smaller screens but less than Apple's Pro models that feature higher-quality screens and faster chips.

Before the Plus lagged, Apple offered a "Mini" phone with a smaller screen at its lowest entry-level price. That Mini model also failed to produce strong sales.

This year, analysts have said they expect Apple will mix up its lineup yet again, replacing the "Plus" with a slim model that could be called the "Air," like Apple's thin laptops and iPads.

The idea behind the slim model is that consumers will give up some battery life and features, such as multiple camera lenses, for a more lightweight iPhone. Apple's expected entry into the market comes after rival Samsung released a similar device called the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year.

"While we acknowledge that a thinner device would introduce a relatively new form factor for the iPhone, we think that it will have a muted impact on consumer purchasing decisions," UBS analysts wrote in a Sunday note. — Kif Leswing

Microsoft just set a new return-to-office mandate, and an internal document shows it's rolling out an even stricter policy for employees who work within its Microsoft AI organization under the group's CEO, Mustafa Suleyman.

Effective January 26, Microsoft AI employees who live within 25 or 50 miles of an office (depending on location) "are required to be in the office 4 days a week," the document states.

The policy applies to those who live within:

Any exception must be approved by an executive who reports to Suleyman directly, according to the document, and any exceptions will be reviewed annually.

Microsoft on Tuesday notified employees via an internal email from HR chief Amy Coleman that the company is mandating employees to work from offices at least three days a week. That email, viewed by Business Insider, stated, "Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations."

Other teams working on AI have comparatively less strict guidelines. Executive Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organization has no org-specific return to office guidelines or considerations, according to the documents, and Jay Parikh's Core AI group will apply the three-day-a-week guidance for all offices in February, with the exception of GitHub.

The new mandate for the AI organization comes as Microsoft tries to become more competitive in luring AI talent amid the talent wars with OpenAI, Meta, Google, and others. Suleyman's organization has a special recruiting team to handle competitive offers, and the company is trying to poach AI engineers and researchers with multimillion-dollar pay packages from its AI rivals.

The White House used revised jobs data released Tuesday as fodder to criticize three frequent targets of President Donald Trump: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, former President Joe Biden and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

"Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

"This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS's data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions," she said.

"Much like the BLS has failed the American people, so has Jerome 'Too Late' Powell – who has officially run out of excuses and must cut the rates now."

The Labor Department report showed that the U.S. economy created fewer jobs than had been initially reported in the year that began in March 2024. 

Annual revisions to nonfarm payrolls data for the year showed a reduction of 911,000 from initial estimates, according to the initial report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

The BLS has been the target of a coordinated campaign to undermine faith its data, orchestrated by the White House. 

Trump abruptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, just hours after BLS released initial employment data for July that included two months' of downward revisions to job growth data from earlier in the year.

Trump argued that those revisions — which are common in jobs reports — showed that the BLS was manipulating employment data for political purposes. His firing of McEntarfer drew sharp rebuke from economists and some lawmakers.

Powell was nominated by Trump in 2017 to serve as chair of the central bank. 

But ever since the start of Trump's second term, the chairman has become a frequent target of the White House, as the president's frustration has grown over Powell's refusal to lower interest rates. 

In August, however, Powell said that uncertainty in the U.S. economy may warrant interest rate cuts later this month.

One of Big Tech's last remaining RTO holdouts is officially sending employees back to the office.

Microsoft is mandating employees work from offices at least three days a week, according to an internal email the company sent to staff on Tuesday.

The mandate will happen in three phases, beginning at the end of February 2026, with Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office. It will then expand to other US offices and eventually internationally, according to the email from Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. February 23 was one of the start dates Microsoft considered, but it hasn't been decided yet.

Employees can request an exception by September 19. Coleman's email didn't include details about how such exceptions may work.

Business Insider reported in August that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy mandating three days a week in the office.

Microsoft sells software that enables remote work, such as its popular Teams workplace chat and meeting app. It remained relatively lax compared to some other Big Tech companies when it comes to RTO, especially cross-town rival Amazon. Even Zoom sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.

Microsoft first introduced a flexible work policy when it brought employees back to the office in late 2020 after pandemic-forced closures. That policy officially allowed employees to work from home at least half of the time without approval, but in practice it was even more flexible and most employees worked remotely most of the time.

Now its policy is evolving to be similar to guidelines at Meta and Google, which generally require most employees to work in offices three days a week.

Microsoft's new approach is the latest sign of the company increasing performance pressure on employees. It has fired thousands of employees deemed low performers this year and introduced a new performance improvement plan meant to exit low performers more quickly.

While working on the new RTO policy, Microsoft appears to have scrubbed a blog post that once heralded the benefits of remote work for retaining employees and boosting their productivity.

"Hybrid work is more than a change in technology—it's a change in mindset, a change in culture, and a change in the way you think about physical and virtual spaces to enable an inclusive and productive environment for all," Microsoft wrote, according to a snapshot of the blog retained by the Internet Archive. "The change isn't easy, but it's worth it. If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away. And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do."

The link to that blog post now redirects to one published on July 31 calling out how "hybrid work created new challenges for employee engagement" and how AI can solve them.

"How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.

In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.

We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.

With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.

We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.

Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.

For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.

What you need to know:

Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.

Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.

All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.

Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.

As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.

Thank you,

Amy"

NBCUniversal just gave its staffers an ultimatum: return to the office four days a week in 2026, or take a severance package.

Business Insider first published NBCU's return-to-office memo, and now we have exclusive details about the company's "voluntary exit assistance package."

NBCU employees were instructed to contact their HR manager if they aren't willing to work in the company's offices from Monday to Thursday, starting January 5.

According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, those who ask their manager about the severance package by October 3 will get the following offer: eight weeks of their base salary and continued healthcare coverage (medical, dental, and vision) for three months after their exit. Plus, they'll remain eligible for their full bonus.

This severance offer is available for NBCU employees VP level or below who are based in the US and UK and are working hybrid. They will have to remain on the active payroll through December 31 and work to transition their responsibilities to other employees as directed by their manager. (Possible exceptions include those on employment contracts, those based outside of the US and UK, and those on a collective bargaining agreement, the company told employees.)

NBCU's divisions include the NBC broadcast network, the Peacock streaming service, Universal Studios, and the Bravo cable network. NBCU's parent company, Comcast, is spinning off most of its cable networks — including MSNBC and CNBC — into a new company called Versant by the end of the year. Employees designated for the spinoff, who still work for NBCU as of now, didn't get this new RTO mandate or severance offer, two current employees said.

Notably, NBCU's severance offer isn't based on an employee's length of employment. Severance packages are often based on the number of years an employee has worked.

The timing of the RTO order "coincides with the Versant spin-off," an internal Q&A document viewed by Business Insider said.

"We want to ensure employees who continue with us in 2026 will comply and are aligned with our collective goal of fostering more in-person collaboration," this document said.

An NBCU spokesperson declined to comment on internal communications and policies.

RTO orders have become increasingly common across corporate America.

Paramount's new CEO, David Ellison, just called his employees back in person five days a week, and major companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan have previously done the same.

Some of these in-person directives may be "a stealth alternative to layoffs," Business Insider's Aki Ito wrote earlier this year. The rise of AI may tempt companies to get by with smaller workforces.

NBCU's chief operating officer, Adam Miller, said in a memo that its decision was about improving collaboration across teams.

"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections," Miller said.

Stablecoin issuer Figure Technologies is increasing the size and upping the price of its initial public offering as retail investors bid up crypto-related stocks, a person familiar with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The company is considering a new IPO price range of $20-$22 a share — from $18-$20 a share — and raising the number of shares to 31.5 million from around 26 million, this person said, asking not to be identified because the information isn't public yet.

The new pricing will raise roughly $693 million, up from $526 million. The exact amounts were still in flux late Monday night and could be adjusted again before its IPO on Thursday, this person said, cautioning that the decision to revise the IPO plan wasn't yet final.

Figure didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The blockchain firm, which initially targeted a valuation of $4.1 billion, is scheduled to start trading on the NASDAQ on Thursday under the symbol FIGR.

The Trump administration's embrace of the crypto industry has prompted investors to pour money into digital assets, especially following the successful debuts of crypto exchange Bullish, and stablecoin issuer Circle in recent weeks.

Co-founded in 2018 by technology entrepreneur Mike Cagney, Figure operates a blockchain-native platform for lending, trading and investing in consumer credit and digital assets.

The company says it funds home equity loans in just 10 days, compared to the industry average of 42 days.

It swung to a profit of $29 million for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $13 million in the same period a year earlier.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Attention turns to Cupertino today, with Apple's launch event taking place at the company's California headquarters at 1 p.m. ET. Investors, analysts and consumers alike will be watching for the latest releases from the tech titan.

Here's what to know:

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged to a fresh all-time closing high yesterday, and the good vibes didn't stop there: The Dow and S&P 500 also both posted gains.

The moves come as investors await the release of closely followed inflation data on Wednesday and Thursday, which could help determine the Federal Reserve's course of action when it meets next week. While Fed funds futures are largely pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut, CNBC's Jeff Cox reports that there's a small chance of a larger, half-point decrease.

We're also watching for annual revisions to employment data, which will come out at 10 a.m. The revisions will likely garner heightened attention following President Donald Trump's removal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner in August. The revisions will entail the 12-month period preceding March 2025.

It's been one year since Brian Niccol took the helm at Starbucks, setting into motion his broad plan to revamp the embattled coffee chain. Niccol discussed his turnaround effort in an interview with CNBC's Kate Rogers, saying he's seen signs that Starbucks is "doing the right things." 

"What we're really excited about is we're seeing both non-Rewards customers come back in a big way, as well as Rewards customers. That is, to me, the sign that we're doing the right things, both in the store and outside of the store," he told Rogers.

Watch the full interview here.

StubHub is revealing new details about its plans to go public via IPO.

The ticket-selling platform said in a filling yesterday that it is looking to raise as much as $851 million, meaning its valuation could rise as high as $9.2 billion. The company plans to sell more than 34 million shares priced in a range of $22 and $25.

StubHub's updates aren't the only IPO news this week. Buy-now-pay-later loan provider Klarna and crypto firm Gemini are both set to make their public market debuts this week.

A new challenger in the global artificial intelligence race has entered the ring.

The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), an AI-focused research university established by the United Arab Emirates, announced on Tuesday the release of a new, low-cost reasoning model to rival OpenAI and DeepSeek.

It comes after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, earlier this year shocked the world with the release of a reasoning model called R1 which it said could outperform OpenAI but with far less training costs.

At just 32 billion parameters, MBZUAI's model, dubbed K2 Think, is much smaller than competing systems from OpenAI and DeepSeek. It was built on top of Alibaba's open-source Qwen 2.5 model and is run and tested on hardware provided by AI chipmaker Cerebas.

For context, DeepSeek's R1 has a total of 671 billion parameters, which is essentially another term for the variables that an AI language model learns to understand and generate language. OpenAI doesn't disclose the parameter counts of its AI models.

K2 Think was developed in partnership with G42, the buzzy UAE-based AI firm backed by U.S. tech giant Microsoft. The researchers behind it say it delivers performance on par with the flagship reasoning models of OpenAI and DeepSeek — despite being a fraction of the size.

They cited the benchmarks AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25 and OMNI-Math-HARD, which relate to math, coding benchmark LiveCodeBenchv5 and science benchmark GPQA-Diamond.

Hector Liu, director of MBZUAI's Institute of Foundation Models, told CNBC the team behind K2 Think were able to achieve such high levels of performance by using a number of methods.

They include long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning — a method of step-by-step reasoning — as well as so-called test-time scaling, which is a technique for improving performance by allocating extra computing resources during "inferencing" — or, applying learned knowledge to data it's never seen before.

"What was special about our model is we treat it more like a system than just a model," Liu told CNBC. "So, unlike a regular open-source model where we can just release the model, we actually deploy the model and see how we can improve the model over time."

"If you ask me which one of the single steps is the most important, it's very hard to say. It's more like a system method work where all these methods combined delivered the final result," he added.

There are two countries on the world stage that stand out as the forerunners in the AI race: the U.S. and China.

America's tech giants and startups like OpenAI led the early momentum with so-called foundation models, which aim to fulfill a wide range of tasks by relying on vast amounts of training data. However, DeepSeek's breakthrough with R1 earlier this year reinforced China's position as a formidable AI player in its own right.

More recently, the UAE has sought to position itself as a global leader in AI in a bid to enhance its geopolitical influence and diversify its economy beyond crude oil dependency.

The region can point to its AI development firm G42 as an example of how it's gaining ground in the space. However, it faces fierce competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is looking to develop full-stack AI capabilities via Humain, a company launched under the Public Investment Fund in May.

Beyond that, there are also geopolitical complexities that shroud the UAE's AI ambitions. Microsoft's investment and partnership with G42 last year attracted a great deal of scrutiny in the U.S. related to the company's relationship with China.

More broadly, the UAE's AI industry still has a long way to go to reach the scale of its U.S. and Chinese counterparts. OpenAI and the Big Tech players have enjoyed a good head start with their respective foundation AI models, while Beijing has long considered AI a strategic priority.

While K2 Think demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI, the system's developers say the aim is not to build a chatbot like ChatGPT. Richard Morton, managing director for MBZUAI's Institute of Foundation Models, explains the model is intended to serve specific uses in fields like math and science.

"The fact is that the fundamental reasoning of the human brain is the cornerstone of all the thinking process," Morton told CNBC.

"With this particular application, instead of taking 1,000, 2,000 human beings five years to think through a particular question, or go through a particular set of clinical trials or something like that, this vastly condenses that period."

It could also expand the reach of advanced AI technologies in regions that don't have access to the kind of capital and infrastructure U.S. firms possess.

"What we're discovering is that you can do a lot more with less," Morton said.

Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) aims to increase its European electric car sales 17-fold over the next two years, becoming the latest Chinese player to take on the region's traditional automakers through aggressive expansion.

The entrance of the Chinese state-owned carmaker will exacerbate competition in the already intense European market that has recently seen interest from players from the world's second largest economy, from BYD to Xpeng.

GAC's presence will likely further add pressure on European giants — such as BMW and Mercedes — that have looked to fend off Chinese entrants with their own electric vehicles.

"Europe is one of our five major markets. It is a strategic market. We hope Europe will account for a major portion of our overseas market in the future," Wei Haigang, president of GAC International, told CNBC in an interview at the IAA Mobility auto show in Munich on Monday.

Wei said GAC hopes to sell around 3,000 cars in Europe this year, before boosting this target to 15,000 in 2026 and at least 50,000 units by 2027.

GAC showed off its Aion V and Aion UT fully electric cars at the IAA show this week. Wei said the company is also looking to launch a plug-in hybrid car in Europe in the future.

The targets are aggressive, but come as Chinese companies continue to make inroads into Europe's electric vehicle market. The market share of Chinese car brands in the first half of the year in Europe almost doubled from the same period last year, according to Jato Dynamics. While the market share remains small at just over 5%, it has notched rapid growth.

GAC is setting sights on expansion despite the European Union's tariffs on China-made EVs, with the company saying it is looking at local manufacturing in Europe.

"We are hoping the Chinese government and the European Union can negotiate further to bring the tariffs down," Wei said. "In the future, we hope to accelerate the manufacturing localization. So that, in the future, we [can] build up manufacturing capability in Europe for Europe, to better serve the European markets."

As workers head back into offices, many are encountering the same frustrations they did pre-pandemic: endless stretches of fluorescently lit cubicles, limited space for hybrid meetings, and generally depressing design.

Annie Dean, formerly Facebook's first director of remote work and Atlassian's VP of future of work and workplace, says workers — and businesses — deserve better.

"People and companies know that offices are changing and that offices need to start feeling maybe a little bit more like hotels, with great service, seamless technology, inspiring design, and workplaces that create a true sense of place," Dean told Business Insider. "When offices are positioned and built to draw people in, then community develops. And that's really important for business — among other things."

Dean made a name for herself studying flexible work. Until recently, she oversaw Atlassian's real estate and workplace experience teams, as well as a research lab investigating new ways of working.

Last week, however, Dean started a new, decidedly in-person role: chief strategy officer for the building operations and experience division at CBRE, the world's biggest commercial real-estate services firm.

In this role, Dean will oversee a new project, called the CBRExIndustrious Building Experience Lab, which the company announced Tuesday.

The lab will partner with client companies to collect data about how workplaces are being used and then create research and products to advance "how workplaces operate for the people and teams that use them," said Dean.

CBRE manages two billion square feet of office space, including 65 million square feet of offices that Brookfield Properties owns, and many of the Deutsche Bank offices around the world.

Forty million people come into an office every day run by CBRE, the real-estate services firm said. That means there's a huge amount of potential data to collect through partnerships.

The goal is for successful companies to be able to take the same level of rigor that they use to run their businesses and apply that data-driven approach to how they run their workplaces, said Dean.

CBRE's lab is launching at a time when more companies are requiring employees to return to the office, whether employees are on board — or not. In July, foot traffic data indicated more US employees were working from an office than at any point since the pandemic.

"How do you make that work? How do you make it effective? How do you make it so people don't feel resentful of their employers?" Jamie Hodari, CEO of CBRE's building operations and experience division and chief commercial officer, told Business Insider. "It's very easy to position this as coercive and coming from employers, but we are also in a cultural moment, I think, where people are feeling disconnected."

Employers are looking to ensure offices create opportunities for collaboration, said Hodari, who cofounded flexible coworking space Industrious, which was acquired by CBRE in January.

"There's a mixture of things that make for an amazing team; that make for cohesive teams; that make for people who really feel fulfilled in their work. And some part of that mix is being in-person together," he said.

Dean, who got her start as a real-estate lending attorney, said that her new job feels like a natural fit, even after her time researching distributed and flexible models of working.

"Real estate has been a really big part of my career and life," said Dean, whose father was an architect. "I'm just really interested in what buildings mean for people."

Hodari, who Dean reports to, says the plan is to identify a few partner companies and launch the lab's first collaborations by the end of the year.

"We have an opportunity to build a world that's better for people," said Dean. "Flexible work is clearly part of that, and it's also clearly now the norm. But the next challenge incumbent on us is to take these physical spaces and to make them live up to the promise of what an office can and should be."

The list of the world's wealthiest people mostly comprises the biggest shareholders of the largest companies on the planet. So why does the cofounder and CEO of the world's most valuable company rank just 10th?

As of Monday's close, Nvidia's Jensen Huang had a net worth of $147 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

That puts him just behind Warren Buffett, who has a $148 billion fortune, even though Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is worth about a quarter as much as Nvidia, and Buffett has gifted more than half of his Berkshire stock to foundations since 2006.

Bernard Arnault ranks eighth with a $164 billion fortune, despite LVMH being worth under $300 billion, or less than a 10th of Nvidia.

Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has an estimated net worth of $383 billion and could extend his lead if his proposed $1 trillion pay package is approved. That's striking as the two companies that make up the lion's share of Musk's wealth, Tesla and SpaceX, are together valued around $1.6 trillion — less than 40% of Nvidia's market value.

There's one reason Huang, who cofounded Nvidia in 1993 and has been the chipmaker's CEO ever since, isn't richer: dilution.

Ahead of Nvidia's IPO in 1999, Huang owned 12.8% of the company. That stake would be worth over $500 billion today.

While it's typical for founders to sell shares and see their ownership diluted when their companies go public, Huang has seen a far more significant and prolonged decline in his stake. It fell to 9.9% in 1999, 7.1% in 2003, 4.4% in 2010, then stabilized between 3.5% and 4% from 2020 through this summer, filings show.

For comparison, Buffett owns about 14% of Berkshire, Arnault owns roughly half of LVMH, and Musk owns around 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX.

Huang's percentage ownership has dropped by more than two-thirds primarily because Nvidia has issued vast amounts of shares to provide equity for its employees. The company reported a hefty $14 billion of unearned stock-based compensation as of July 27, much of which it expected to recognize in around two years' time.

Nvidia has offset some of the dilution through stock buybacks, but its outstanding shares have surged from a split-adjusted 1.7 billion when it went public, to north of 23 billion now — a roughly 14-fold increase.

Many companies, especially in the tech space, award employees with stock or stock options to incentivize them to increase the value of the company and its stock, while discouraging them from decamping to rivals. It's a way to attract and retain talent without spending cash.

Huang's stake has also shrunk because he's sold shares, including a prearranged trading plan to dispose of up to 6 million shares this year, worth about $1 billion at Nvidia's current stock price.

The rich list changes as companies' market caps fluctuate, but Huang's smaller stake means he's unlikely to top it anytime soon.

ByteDance believes it is worth more than Chevron, General Electric, and Coca-Cola. One of the world's biggest investors thinks it's even more valuable than that.

Fidelity, which invested in TikTok's parent company in 2020 through its massive Contrafund, valued the company at more than $385 billion at the end of July, filings show. That is nearly 17% more than ByteDance's self-valuation of $330 billion.

According to reports in late August, ByteDance is offering a share buyback program for employees looking for liquidity and valued itself at more than $330 billion, a 5.5% increase from earlier this year, when the company marked itself at $315 billion.

It's a lofty valuation for a company that struggles to make profits despite tens of billions of dollars in quarterly revenues. But for $6.4 trillion Fidelity, the Chinese company's valuation of itself is low. Fidelity's valuation of the company considers ByteDance more valuable than public companies such as defense tech firm Palantir and Wall Street staple Bank of America.

Fidelity declined to comment. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There are plenty of reasons why the company might depress its valuation when offering buybacks to employees, primarily to accumulate its own equity at a discount in case it is needed for fundraising down the line.

The company has a looming deadline that would materially change its standing. President Donald Trump's June executive order postponed the date by which ByteDance would need to sell its US TikTok operations to September 17, though he has hinted at that deadline being extended.

The app briefly went dark in the US in January to comply with the original divest-or-sell deadline before Trump directed his Attorney General not to enforce the law, which was passed by the Senate. The White House made its own TikTok account last month, when Trump said he was a fan of the app.

He floated the government taking a 50% stake in TikTok, similar to the deal the government struck to take 10% of Intel, though he did not give additional details on what the joint venture would look like.

Tesla just did the first major refresh of its best-selling Model Y more than five years after the compact SUV was announced in 2019.

Since then, the Model Y has fended off challenges from major automakers like Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia to become one of the top-selling vehicles in the world.

Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million vehicles last year, and the automaker has an ambitious target of 20-30% sales growth this year. A refreshed $45,000 Model Y could help it hit that lofty target as its remaining lineup begins to show its age.

The EV market is now getting much more crowded, with a parade of new competitors, including crossover SUVs, every few months.

In 2003, Ghislaine Maxwell gifted Jeffrey Epstein a scrapbook for his 50th birthday.

In between memorabilia from childhood friends, heartfelt letters from family, and photos of nude women, some of the world's wealthiest men and most prominent business leaders wished Epstein a happy birthday.

Leon Black wrote a poem and signed it "love and kisses." Les Wexner doodled a woman's chest. Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive and associate of Bill Gates, sent several photos of animals having sex and with erect penises.

A copy of the book, which spans over 200 pages, was released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday after it was obtained from Epstein's estate.

The book includes apparent messages from now-President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as from childhood friends and family members.

Wide swaths of it are redacted under sections titled "Girlfriends," "Children," and "Girl-friends."

Inclusion in the book is not an indication of wrongdoing. Palm Beach police didn't start investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of girls until several years after Epstein received the book, in a case that culminated in a 2008 guilty plea on prostitution charges.

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for far more serious rape and sex-trafficking allegations. A jury later found Maxwell guilty of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex, and she's serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the book in July, writing that it included a "bawdy" letter from Trump with a cryptic message that said "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," bracketed with an outline of a naked woman and the now-president's signature in the place of pubic hair.

Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against The Journal over the publication of its story and called the letter "fake." The Journal has stood by its reporting. On Monday, a White House spokesperson said Trump didn't write the letter.

Here's a look at what eight business leaders wrote in Epstein's birthday card, according to the copy of the book published by the House Oversight Committee.

The former Apollo Global Management CEO — and one of Epstein's only known financial clients — wrote a handwritten poem in Epstein's honor in the "friends" section.

"A Liver, a Lover, a Jeff, a Jeffrey," reads one sample verse. "Let's all give a cheer, for today he's Fifty!"

Another rhyme reads "Blonde, Red or Brunette, spread out geographically" followed by "With this net of fish, Jeff's now 'The Old Man and The Sea,'" with "Old Man" underlined.

A spokesperson for Black declined to comment to Business Insider.

Black has previously said he regrets his association with Epstein and wasn't aware of any sexual misconduct.

An Apollo-commissioned investigation found that Black paid Epstein over $150 million between 2012 and 2017 for financial advice, including for tax maneuvers that saved him around $600 million. An investigation from US Sen. Ron Wyden put Black's payments to Epstein at closer to $170 million.

Black's 2003 letter appears to reference Epstein's forte with taxes: "Green eyeshades, schemes and plans, a unique tax strategy," it reads.

According to the copy of the book published by the House Oversight Committee, Trump's birthday note appears to be an imaginary dialogue between him and Epstein about "having everything." The words are bracketed by the outline of a nude woman, with ink strokes representing breasts. It appears in the "friends" section.

"Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?" Trump muses in the exchange.

"As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you," Epstein replies.

"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," Trump says.

Trump's lawyers described the letter as "nonexistent" in a defamation lawsuit against the Journal after it published its story in July. The Journal has stood by its reporting.

On Monday, a representative for Trump's personal legal team directed Business Insider to a statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who described reporting about the letter as a "hatchet job."

"As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it," Leavitt wrote.

Trump's lawsuit against The Journal is ongoing.

Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, wrote a brief note to Epstein in honor of his 50th birthday, the card shows.

"I wanted to get you what you want… so here it is…" Wexner wrote.

Underneath that text is an illustration of what appears to be a woman's breasts, followed by Wexner's signature. His note was published in the "friends" part of the book.

A spokesperson for Wexner declined to comment to Business Insider for this story.

Wexner was one of Epstein's biggest and earliest financial clients, paying him tens of millions of dollars between the 1980s and the 2000s to manage the billionaire's personal financial life.

Wexner said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007, amid a Florida law enforcement investigation into his sexual abuse of girls. In the process, Wexner said, he learned that Epstein "had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family."

William Elkus, the founder of the venture capital firm Clearstone, was connected to Epstein through the latter's J. Epstein Foundation. Elkus was a trustee at the organization's founding in 1991.

In his note to Epstein, Elkus recounted a time in 1988 when Epstein visited him in Fairfield, Iowa, where he said he was managing the money of a wealthy local family. The note appeared in the "friends" section.

"It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women," Elkus wrote. "But not many people know that he can create them out of thin air."

In that corner of Iowa, he added, "there's more than a little truth to the saying that it's hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs."

In an email on Tuesday, Elkus told Business Insider the event he recalled in the birthday letter was "long before any articles ever came out about Epstein, good or bad" and that the reference to girls and hogs jokingly cited an "old folk saying."

Elkus recounted in his letter that, while visiting a local bookstore, "a spectacular tall blonde woman" approached Epstein, who then "did his magic, and she ended up going home with him to New York for the weekend."

"I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow arranged the whole episode through some long-distance escort service" before being proven wrong after meeting the woman in Manhattan a week later, Elkus wrote.

Elkus wrote in his email to Business Insider that the story referenced in the letter was not meant to be viewed nefariously.

"I did not say that Epstein did anything inappropriate (and he didn't do anything inappropriate that I could see then or at any time before or after this incident)," Elkus wrote. "This was a mature woman who was a sales rep, not a young student. I was highlighting his charisma."

One of the many lewd entries was from Nathan Myhrvold, who was listed as a friend of Epstein.

At the time, Myhrvold had retired from his role as Microsoft's chief technology officer and was working as the CEO of Intellectual Ventures, a firm that incubates and markets inventions. He would go on to found the global health organizations Global Good and the Institute for Disease Modeling with Bill Gates.

In an introductory letter published in the "friends" part of the book, Myhrvold wrote that he "agonized long and hard about what to write." He wrote that he decided to eschew the "philosophical" or "silly and salacious." Instead, he included a series of photos that he said he took on a trip to Africa.

"They seemed more appropriate than anything I could put in words," he wrote.

The wildlife photos depict animals in various suggestive ways, including a pair of lions mating, a zebra with a large penis, and a monkey with an erection.

A representative for Mhyrvold did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. A spokesman previously told The Wall Street Journal that Mhyrvoid didn't recall the submission and "regularly shares photos of and writes about animal behavior."

The former CEO of Bear Stearns, Alan "Ace" Greenberg, who died in 2014, was one of the bank's leaders during Epstein's stint in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

"Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure, and watching his meteoric success has given me many vicarious thrills," Greenberg wrote in his note, which was included in the book's considerably less scandalous "business" section.

Kathryn Olson Greenberg, Greenberg's widow, told Business Insider that Epstein and Greenberg did not have a relationship beyond Epstein's time at Bear Stearns. She said that her husband "would never say no" if he were asked to write a birthday message.

Another former Bear Stearns CEO, James "Jimmy" Cayne, handwrote a brief note to Epstein. Like Greenberg's note, it was published in the "business" section.

The finance exec wished him a happy birthday and added what seems to be an inside joke: "From a 'six' to another 'six.'"

Cayne died in 2021. His daughter did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Zuckerman, the billionaire media and real estate mogul, wrote an apparently satirical letter saying he found extensive records of Epstein in the archives of The New York Daily News, which Zuckerman owned at the time.

"It shows his vital statistics, his birthday (23rd), his date of birth (July 11), his country of birth (Lichtenstein), his family life (wife, 3 children), and his profession," Zuckerman wrote.

In reality, Epstein's birthday was January 20, and he was born in Brooklyn, according to a copy of the birth certificate included elsewhere in the birthday book. At the time of his death, he had no publicly known wife or children.

The note is followed by a photo of then-President George W. Bush with his face blurred out, as well as a mock tabloid article headlined "International funny man of history revealed as alien in disguise."

Epstein and Zuckerman briefly worked together on different media ventures. The pair, along with Harvey Weinstein and other investors, led a failed bid to buy New York Magazine in the early 2000s. Epstein and Zuckerman later briefly financed the celebrity magazine Radar.

Zuckerman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the birthday letter or his relationship with Epstein. Representatives for US News & World Report, where he is the editor in chief, and Boston Properties, where he is the chairman, did not respond to requests for comment either.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Karen Hastie, the 60-year-old founder of the Chamber Perks App in Ontario, Canada. It has been edited for length and clarity.

Retirement was never really in my vocabulary — not in the way people expect.

I turned 60 this year. I never thought I'd be launching a tech company at this stage in my life, but here I am, building a startup I love, working 60 to 70 hours a week, and feeling more fulfilled than ever.

After graduating, I started my first business in the fitness industry, a fitness store that expanded throughout Northern Ontario. I ran that company for over 30 years. When the pandemic hit, I sold it in a seven-figure deal and made enough to retire comfortably.

Everyone assumed I'd do that. My daughter had just given birth to my granddaughter, and I'd wrapped up a decadeslong business. However, it just didn't feel right. I knew I still had more to give.

I asked myself, "What do I really want to do with this next chapter?" I've always been passionate about helping small businesses, so I began consulting and mentoring entrepreneurs in my community.

I started working with one of the local Chambers of Commerce. That eventually led to the idea for my new venture, the Chamber Perks App, which helps the Chambers of Commerce deliver more value to their members. It felt like the perfect next step: solving a real problem, supporting small businesses, and doing it on my terms.

I know what I bring to the table: decades of experience running and growing a successful business. I also know you don't have to do it all yourself; you just need the right people around you.

I built a strong and capable team from scratch. My CTO, who has experience working in Silicon Valley with tech startups and unicorn companies, is based in Calgary, and my daughter's company handles all our marketing. She's been in social media marketing for years, so it's a natural fit for us to work together.

Tech is dominated by younger people, so I hired accordingly for my account manager and developers. Some challenges I've faced while working with younger employees include adjusting my work habits to accommodate their needs, learning to respect their work-life balance, and avoiding micromanagement.

When I pitch our app, I'm doing what I've always loved: talking to people, solving problems, and creating value. My clients are Chambers of Commerce and Boards of Trade around the world, starting with 400 in Canada and 7,500 in the US. I start my day at 8 a.m. by meeting with clients, speaking at conferences, and working with my team.

I enjoy what I do, so it doesn't seem like work. My daughter's generation prioritizes work-life balance differently than mine. I'll easily work a 60 to 70-hour workweek and not consider that long, but when you love what you do, it's enriching.

I love to golf and travel, but that isn't fulfilling for me. I need purpose. For me, retirement means having the freedom to do work you love without the pressure of providing for your family.

That's the most significant gift of building my first business: I don't have to stress about money anymore. I'm doing this because it matters to me. The company was bootstrapped and has no debt. All the money we've made for the past 2 ½ years has been reinvested into the company.

We're now launching the second suite of services, a CRM for chambers called Chamber Member Pro. These two services are expected to grow over the next year, and I'll then provide myself with a salary. The long-term goal is to grow, scale, and sell.

Whenever I mentor small-business owners, the first question I ask is, "What's your exit strategy?" Most don't have one. With Chamber Perks, I'm already thinking ahead.

This isn't another 30-year run for me — God willing, I'll still be around at 90, but the plan is to position the company for an acquisition or a more hands-off role for me within the next few years.

My advice to anyone thinking about launching a business later in life is to find something you love, surround yourself with people who complement your skills, and don't be afraid to take the leap.

The AI boom has lit a fuse under San Francisco's housing market, with prices and rents inflamed by a tech workforce increasingly returning to the office, and as the AI talent wars push salaries to dizzying highs.

Tech workers are flocking to the Bay Area to work at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Nvidia after the region was dealt a massive blow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Real estate agents say RTO is fueling the resurgence, with AI being particularly synonymous with in-person work and hardcore culture. What's more, tech workers, especially those working in AI, are commanding massive salaries, including multimillion-dollar compensation packages.

The salary needed to afford a home in the San Jose metro area — which encompasses Silicon Valley and the headquarters for Meta, Google, and Nvidia — crossed the $400,000 threshold for the first time in April 2024, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist — "an inconceivable amount of money unless you work in AI, and those salaries are probably more common." This makes it the most expensive metro area in the US. Home prices in the San Jose metro area are up 3% year-over-year, according to Redfin.

While big AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic aren't public, employees can tap equity during stock sales on the private market.

One former OpenAI employee, who requested anonymity to speak about personal matters, told Business Insider they purchased a home in San Francisco during the company's last tender and knew of at least four others who did the same.

"It's definitely the popular move, and people are talking about it again," they said.

The luxury housing market in San Francisco is also setting records. More homes sold above $20 million in the city last year than ever before, according to Sotheby's 2025 Mid-Year Luxury Outlook report, which its international realty chief marketing officer, A. Bradley Nelson, attributed largely to AI's rise.

Another Bay Area county, San Mateo County, nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is seeing record prices for single-family homes — $2.6 million on average this year, according to MLS data. This boom is fueled by both the rise of AI and the strength of the stock market, said Raziel Ungar, a San Mateo County real estate agent who has worked with Big Tech buyers working at Oracle, Google, and Apple.

"There's been so much wealth that's been created in the last few years, in particular in the Valley, that it's pushed our prices higher," Ungar said.

San Francisco real estate agent Ruth Krishnan has worked with several OpenAI employees who have cashed out during tender offers to make down payments on homes, she said.

Krishnan likened the current "level of frenzy" to the period before Facebook's IPO in 2012, with homebuying anticipation fueling rapid transactions and swaths of competitive offers on each property.

With news of OpenAI's latest $10.3 billion secondary share sale, "it's going to rain money in SF," she said.

AI workers are quickly adapting to newfound wealth. A second former OpenAI employee said that when they first moved to San Francisco, they lived in a group house and paid roughly $1,200 a month in rent. Now, former colleagues frequent Michelin-starred restaurants and wear luxury goods.

"They have massive bag collections, they have upgraded their houses, and everything," the second former employee said. "It feels more like a normal tech company or even kind of like finance in some ways."

The rental market is also rocketing. Rents across the San Francisco metro area are up about 5% since last year — double the pace of national growth, a Zillow representative told Business Insider.

Apartment hunters are handing out "tenant résumés" at packed showings, making offers site unseen, offering several months of rent in advance, or coming in at thousands of dollars over the asking price, The San Francisco Standard previously reported.

In terms of specific San Francisco neighborhoods, Mission Bay is central to AI activity, Krishnan said, while the Hayes Valley neighborhood has been dubbed "Cerebral Valley."

Other desirable neighborhoods for those in the field include South Beach, Dogpatch, Potrero Hill, the Mission, Noe Valley, and Bernal Heights, Krishnan said.

Despite their eye-popping salaries, the average AI homebuyer tends to be more pragmatic, real estate agents said.

They're "data-driven and decisive," said San Francisco real estate agent Danielle Lazier, adding that many clients "model payments, taxes, and micro-market evaluations with large language models before touring."

While the single-family home market is "on fire" and condos are "perking up," Lazier said a full pre-COVID recovery hasn't yet been attained.

Krishnan agreed that buyers in AI aren't "going crazy," adding that a typical purchase ranges from $2 million to $4 million — still a relatively staggering sum. The AI wave is nascent, and while many of her clients are young, they're aware of past tech busts, she said.

"They're being very cautious about what if this doesn't last forever," she said.

"They've heard of people who thought that they had all this money that then disappeared, and it seems to be top of mind for them, actually. So they're not overspending. They're cautiously spending."

This article is part of "The Business of Sports," a series on the teams, leagues, and brands turning competition into big business.

We're in the midst of a golf renaissance in the United States. Americans played a record 545 million rounds in 2025, according to the National Golf Foundation. Gen Z is picking up on what was long considered an old-money, old-people sport. The golf polo has become a status symbol among a certain type of striving guy. Golf courses and clubs are capitalizing on the links revival in a number of ways, and one of the most profitable is their merch. They know some of their logos are a hot commodity among those in the know, and the more exclusive, the better. They're catering to golfers who are seeking a lovely 18-hole day and looking to grab a collectible or 10 to commemorate it.

"It's a little trophy," says Greg Nathan, the president and CEO of the National Golf Foundation, a trade association for the golf business. And a lucrative one at that.

Historically, a golf course's pro — the person who manages much of the facility and provides lessons — typically owned and ran its retail operation, hence calling it a "pro shop." Revenue from the store was part of the pro's compensation. From the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s, a lot of golf courses were built around the US, and the market became oversupplied by the time the Great Recession hit, adding to the economic turmoil. So some clubs went looking for ways to make money.

Over the past couple of decades, courses have taken over the pro shops themselves and brought in retail professionals to handle the business of selling their stuff. Even clubs that weren't hurting picked up on how lucrative the business is. The Association of Golf Merchandisers estimates golf shops generate annual sales of over $1 billion a year.

"Today, with everything being so much driven by online shopping, having a physical shop at a club, I think, still provides that hands-on, touchy-feely experience that people enjoy," says Patrick Casey, the president of the Association of Golf Merchandisers and the founder of Casey's Club Consulting.

Retail operations aren't the end-all, be-all of golf club revenue. Membership dues, daily fees, food, beverage, and cart fees all rank above it, says Jeffrey Davis, the managing director of Fairway Advisors, a golf course brokerage and advisory firm. But it doesn't mean they're not important, from a sales perspective and a marketing one.

"People that are building new courses today are cognizant of their logo and the impact it would have on spreading the word about the club," he says. For clubs and courses that don't put time and energy into merchandise, it can be a "missed opportunity." And some clubs that have changed logos have gone back to their original ones, to reclaim some historical mystique.

But as more courses get in on the merch game, gear from all of them is not created equal. There are some 16,000 golf courses in the United States, and the real juice, clout-wise, is with the top 500 or so private clubs and resorts.

"Those 500 courses, they do some very serious revenue because it's very logo-driven," Nathan says.

When golf courses renovate — as many of them are doing right now — they often look at the internal facilities, too, including their shops. A well-appointed shop is a place for members at private clubs to pick up gear for themselves (often at a friendly price) and show off to their guests, who can also pick up stuff (at a not-as-friendly price). The markups on branded items and general gear can be quite large, given how exclusive the logos are and the fact that the customer is a little trapped. If you forgot golf balls for the day, the ones at the course are going to cost you.

As logo collecting has become more of a thing among golfers, clubs are figuring out new ways to capitalize. For example, some are leaning into e-commerce so that they don't have to stock all of their merchandise, and if people come to play for a day and don't have time for shopping, they can pick up gear online. (This may open up some breaches of the unwritten rule that people can't wear logos of courses they haven't played, but we'll leave that for another day.) For the courses and clubs that do merch right, "it's like found money," Davis says.

"It's a very positive time for the golf industry right now," Nathan says. Logo-mania is part of it. The more popular the sport becomes, the more the merch matters — at least for those in the know. "It's like going to Disney," he says. "You're going to get some souvenirs."

Nvidia-backed Mistral AI clinched a 11.7 billion-euro ($13.8 billion) valuation in a in a Series C funding round that saw Dutch chip equipment maker ASML secure a major stake in the French firm.

ASML pumped 1.3 billion euros in Mistral AI's 1.7 billion-euro funding round as lead investor, gaining a 11% shareholding in the French company on a fully diluted basis.

Other participants in the round included existing investors Nvidia, DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Bpifrance, General Catalyst, Index Ventures and Lightspeed.

The investment round, which was previously reported by Reuters, more than doubles Mistral's 5.8-billion-euro valuation achieved during a 600-million-euro funding round last year, as swathes of cash continue to pour into the booming AI industry. The fundraising round turns ASML into one of Mistral's top shareholders.

Mistral, one of Europe's most competitive tech startups and widely seen as a regional rival of Sam Altman's OpenAI, has been building large language models that form the foundation of AI applications, such as chatbots. AI firms frequently require vast amounts of investments in infrastructure to support this development.

At the start of summer, Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal during London Tech Week that the company is launching its first reasoning model — touted as "great at mathematics [and] great at coding" — to compete with OpenAI and China's DeepSeek. Yet there is still a wide gap to cover, with OpenAI's $10.3-billion secondary share sale lifting the company's valuation to $500 billion, nearly 36 times that of Mistral.

Lithographer ASML produces equipment allowing major companies, such as Samsung, Intel and Apple, to produce advanced chips critical for their products. 

ASML's investment and shareholding, which the Dutch firm billed as a "first-of-its-kind partnership," critically arms the two-year-old Mistral with tools to lessen its reliance on Silicon Valley, at a time when the European Union is pushing for its AI movement to stand on its own feet and faces the protectionist trade measures of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

ASML Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen will assume a seat at Mistral's strategic committee board, as part of the company's investment.

Labubu, Clairo, feminist literature, matcha lattes, wired headphones.

What sounds like a sentence straight out of internet brainrot is the recipe for the perfect performative male, a satirical TikTok trend that mocks men who "perform" in a way that appeals to women.

Performative male dress-up competitions have popped up worldwide, from colleges like USC and UC Berkeley to parks and cafés in Berlin and Toronto.

In a recent such event in Singapore, participants dressed in oversize jeans and vests, cried out slogans like "We must stop period cramps," threw sanitary pads in the air, burned sage, and played songs by singers like Clairo and Beebadoobee.

Amanda Massi, a luxury personal stylist based in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, said that the performative male aesthetic has become a joke because of the numerous memes about it.

But beyond that, she said, "there's a significant, deeper psychological and cultural narrative at play."

"The performative male aesthetic is a fascinating intersection of identity, intention, and cultural signaling," Massi said.

She said the trend "blends elements traditionally associated with progressive values, intellectual engagement, and a casual yet cultivated masculinity."

Here's what goes into looking the part.

The performative male trend is not a safe space for skinny jeans lovers.

The biggest giveaway of someone jumping on the performative male trend is his baggy, slouchy jeans or jorts, often high-waisted and thrifted. Extra points if they are light-wash denim.

Massi, the stylist, said denim shorts or jorts convey a "nostalgic yet deliberately retro vibe."

If you're trying to nail the look, you'll want to pair that pair of jeans with an oversize cotton T-shirt or vintage-inspired graphic tee to signal effortless cool, she said. Then accessorize with a light-colored tote bag.

The overall color palette is muted and earthy.

"Think sage greens, oatmeal beige, faded indigos, and warm terracotta," Massi said. "These shades suggest a closeness to nature and understated elegance without screaming for attention."

You are what you drink, and performative males drink matcha lattes. At least, according to TikTok.

Massi said the trend called for "artisanal or niche beverages like matcha lattes."

Many participants of the performative male contests carried around a disposable cup of iced matcha, which they balanced in one hand while toting a book of feminist literature in the other — more on that later.

Matcha, a tea made almost exclusively in Japan from green tea leaves, has exploded in popularity around the world and become a TikTok obsession.

In Singapore, where sober parties are taking off, matcha raves have become a thing.

An interesting addition to the performative male outfit is a Labubu plush doll attached to jeans with a carabiner, per videos on TikTok.

The Labubu doll, made by Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, has exploded in popularity over the past year. Carrying a Labubu isn't exclusive to the performative male look, though. People around the world, from US and South Korean celebrities to athletes, have been adorning their bags with the toothy dolls.

This part of the look brings to mind another TikTok-famous fashion trend — bag charms.

"It's adornment, sure, but also a way of sharing oneself with others," Carol Davidson, an NYC-based stylist, told Business Insider in April.

"A cluster of charms gives others a snapshot of how someone sees themselves and how they want others to see them," Davidson added.

According to TikTok, a performative male shuns wireless headphones, opting for wired ones instead.

While some go the easy route by using Apple's old wired ones, others wear bulkier over-the-ear wired headphones — think the square-shaped headphones by Marshall.

Massi said wired headphones are part of the trend's accessories, which include minimalist leather sandals or sneakers, retro eyewear, and artisanal jewelry like handmade silver rings over leather bracelets.

"Stylistically, this aesthetic draws from streetwear, vintage fashion, and normcore influences, yet it also incorporates subtle luxury or artisanal cues conveying discernment and refinement, such as handmade jewelry or sustainable brands," Massi added.

Wired headphones have been cool for years, and not just in the performative male sphere. Bella Hadid, Zoë Kravitz, Lily-Rose Depp, and others have been spotted listening to music the old-fashioned way.

Last but not least, the performative male trend is incomplete without a book of feminist literature — think "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen or "The Bell Jar" by Sylvia Plath.

"There's an intentional nod to feminist literature or other socially conscious media, suggesting intellectual and ethical awareness," Massi said.

Massi said part of the trend involves very vocally aligning yourself with "culturally 'hip' or ethically aware communities" to boost social capital.

It's all (mostly) a joke. And Massi said the performative elements make one question the sincerity of the trend.

However, she said, "they also open the door to richer, more diverse narratives around who men are and how they present themselves to the world."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Timothy Wang, 64, the former head of Fidelity Taiwan. The following has been translated and edited for length and clarity.

I remember exactly when it hit me.

I was reading a report about young people who had moved to Taipei for work. They described feeling hopeless about their futures because of unaffordable housing.

That word "hopeless" really got to me. I remember feeling incredibly sad.

When I was 30 and working at Citibank — where I started my financial career — I didn't feel this sense of despair.

My generation lived through a more affordable time. Housing wasn't cheap, but it also wasn't as expensive as it is now.

Over the past 20 to 30 years, housing prices have surged, while salaries have barely grown.

I called Andy Chang, the secretary-general of Believe in Next Generation, the nonprofit association I had founded, and said, "We should do something about this."

That was during the pandemic in 2021, several years after I retired from my last job as the head of Taiwan at Fidelity.

We started scouting livable apartments and matched them with young tenants. In the first year, I personally covered a quarter of the rent — about 500,000 Taiwan dollars.

Today, we run 10 such youth apartments across Taipei. The tenants apply for government subsidies and partner with landlords willing to accept these tenants in exchange for tax incentives.

In return, tenants in these co-living apartments run community programs.

One tenant taught Japanese to elderly people. Another — Tseng Chih Wei, a performance artist — has organized community theater projects and workshops for people living with HIV.

Not every tenant runs programs perfectly, but we want to give them a chance to try. For us, these projects are meant to be empowering opportunities — not charity.

Community work has always been close to my heart.

Years ago, when I was at Citibank, I visited a small bakery in the city of Kaohsiung that left a lasting impression. It was run by young people with intellectual disabilities.

When I came back to Taipei, I asked my boss whether we could support that organization. He said yes.

We helped them launch a similar bakery in the capital, which grew into one of Taiwan's earliest social enterprises.

That experience taught me something important: When you take the first step, you often discover that there are many like-minded people who would support your cause.

I feel very lucky to have spent more than 30 years in finance.

Because the industry gave me so much, I feel I should give more back.

After all, for the same one hour we spent doing our jobs, we tend to be compensated much more generously in finance than in many other industries.

When I turned 50 in 2011, I started a community space in my disused and rundown childhood home in a military village in Taipei. The renovation cost me 2 million Taiwan dollars.

For years, I gathered with young people at the space we call University Café. The meetings were informal — concerts, reading groups, and discussions.

In 2017, while I was traveling abroad, I got a call from my wife: my mother had suffered a brain hemorrhage.

On the flight back to Taipei, I told myself that if she made it through this, I would step back from my career and spend more time with her.

She did, and I left Fidelity the next year.

After that, I lived with her. I made lunch for her every day, and my wife made dinner. That went on for years.

She passed away last year, but I deeply cherish that time. This was the life I wanted.

I changed my life for two reasons: to spend more time with my family, and to empower the younger generation.

In 2019, the University Café community went on two study trips to Japan, where we saw many people stepping up for their cities, such as in post-earthquake recovery work.

They inspired us to think that we, too, should do something for the cities we live in.

That was when I decided to make our community a formal association. The young people came up with the name: Believe in Next Generation.

Andy joined us that year. I first met him when he interviewed for an internship at Fidelity. Many college students said they wanted to go to Hong Kong, Singapore, or Wall Street. But Andy said he wanted to travel the Silk Road.

I thought he wanted to write his own story, and that left a deep impression.

Andy didn't get the internship, but joined a Fidelity study group I organized. After his graduation and travel, we reconnected, and I invited him to visit our community space. He stayed.

Beyond housing, we hosted a 2023 artist residency where a young playwright created a piece about intergenerational conflict in a family.

The play struck a chord in Taipei and was later translated into Korean and performed in South Korea.

That was a defining moment — for the playwright, and for me. Back in finance, I wanted to help young Taiwanese go abroad. Now, even after leaving finance, I can still help young talent step onto the international stage.

My path had changed, but the purpose was the same.

Every year brings new projects that reshape how investors view the market for token presales. 2025 is already seeing strong activity, with fresh projects gaining attention among traders and gaming communities alike.

One name rising quickly on the crypto presale list is Based Eggman ($GGs). Positioned within the best crypto presales to buy right now, it blends meme culture, gaming, and Web3 streaming into a single platform.

As the search for the best crypto presale continues, $GGs shows how new token presales are not just about speculation but about building ecosystems where people play, stream, and trade.



Based Eggman ($GGs) is a presale cryptocurrency project combining the speed of Base with a new gaming and streaming network. It is a utility-driven memecoin that supports multiple features, from live gaming integration to on-chain community events. With more than 38,490 USDT raised and over 4.8 million $GGs presale crypto tokens already sold at 0.006389 each, the project is gaining early traction.

The ecosystem focuses on creating a space where players can game, stream, and trade in one environment. Based Eggman brings together social-fi, gaming, and trading through its native presale token. The $GGs token has several uses including:

Buying presale crypto through $GGs is straightforward. Users connect a Web3 wallet, fund it with supported assets, and select “Buy $GGs” to confirm. With this process, newcomers to token presales can join without unnecessary complications.

The platform also introduces staking for holders, encouraging steady participation and value circulation within the ecosystem. For many following cryptocurrency presales, Based Eggman highlights how gaming and culture intersect in modern token presales.

Among the top crypto presales of 2025, Based Eggman has secured its place with consistent progress and a growing community. Its integration of Web3 gaming makes it different from many traditional presale crypto coins that rely solely on hype.

While most crypto presales focus on trading, $GGs builds a digital ecosystem where streaming, gaming, and culture work together. This design puts it in a unique position within the crypto presale projects category, as it expands both entertainment and utility.

By appearing alongside the best crypto presales to buy right now, $GGs stands out as a pre sale cryptocurrency with more than one application, placing it firmly on the radar of those following the latest token presales.



Whales in the market often indicate where serious interest is moving, and many reports show XRP, ETH, and ADA capital rotating into new token presales like $GGs. For long-term investors, tracking whale moves has always been part of following crypto ICO presales.

Based Eggman, now listed among the top presale crypto projects, is capturing this trend. Its Web3 crypto presale is attracting traders looking for exposure beyond established assets, while its design appeals to communities centered on gaming and culture.

As capital shifts from traditional assets to presale crypto coins, Based Eggman becomes part of a larger story about diversification and evolving interest in new token presale ecosystems.

This rotation illustrates how pre sale cryptocurrency markets are drawing attention beyond speculation, toward projects with integrated utility.



The market for presale cryptocurrencies continues to grow, with token presales becoming a defining part of crypto culture. Among the best crypto presales, Based Eggman ($GGs) has introduced a mix of gaming, streaming, and token utility that positions it differently from many projects.

For those exploring crypto presales, $GGs highlights how a new presale coin can merge entertainment and technology. Its focus on community, ease of access, and real-time participation through gaming and streaming demonstrates how the best crypto presale tokens evolve.

As cryptocurrency presales remain central to innovation, Based Eggman shows how new token presales are shaping 2025. It is not just another presale crypto project but a sign that culture, creativity, and blockchain can operate in the same space.

Christie's is shutting down its digital art division—a significant pivot for the auction house, which helped ignite the art world's nonfungible token (NFT) craze four years ago.

“Christie's has made a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales,” a spokesperson tells Now Media's Matt Medved. “The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20th- and 21st-century art category.”

Two digital art staffers were let go as part of the shake-up, which comes under the leadership of Christie's new CEO, Bonnie Brennan, who was appointed in February. A digital art specialist will stay on staff at Christie's, Now Media reports.

The news comes four years after Christie's sold its first NFT, a digital certificate that lives on a blockchain, “a digital record of transactions distributed across a decentralized network of computers,” in the words of Marina Isgro, a curator at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and proves ownership over a work of digital art. As Isgro explained during a 2021 online panel, an NFT is “a unique piece of data registered on a blockchain that can serve as a surrogate or certificate of authenticity for various kinds of objects in the digital and real worlds.”

In 2021, Christie's facilitated the sale of the NFT associated with Everydays: The First 5,000 Days, a digital artwork by the artist known as Beeple. Going under the hammer for $69.3 million, Everydays is still the most expensive NFT ever sold.

The sale helped kick off an NFT fad in the art world that lasted roughly a year. Christie's went on to invest in the space further, launching its own NFT auction platform.

But the digital art gold rush was short-lived. Between 2021 and 2022, Christie's reported a 96 percent decline in NFT sales, as M.K. Manoylov reported for the Block in 2022. More recently, a 2024 report from NFTevening found that 96 percent of NFTs are effectively “dead,” or not valuable.

The shuttering of Christie's digital art division comes two years after Sotheby's, another renowned auction house, laid off numerous employees in its NFT division, as ARTnews' Shanti Escalante-De Mattei and Angelica Villa reported in 2023.

Weighing in on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, digital art adviser Fanny Lakoubay says Christie's decision is “probably tied to the current art market contraction.”

“Auction houses can't justify a whole department when it brings in less revenue than the others (even with some recent successful sales),” Lakoubay adds.

Earlier this year, the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report found that sales in the international art market overall declined by 12 percent in 2024. “Decline in value was driven by cooling at the top end,” the report stated, describing 2024 as “a year of continuing geopolitical tensions, economic volatility and trade fragmentation.”

The Christie's news is “definitely not a great public signal,” Lakoubay writes. “But we should also remember: Auction houses only focus on secondary sales of already well-known artists and brands. It's still too early for that model to really work/scale with digital art.”

Christie's is not pulling away from digital tender entirely. Earlier this year, the auction house debuted a crypto real estate division, which allows buyers to purchase properties with digital currencies.

 A record-breaking US jobs revision set the stage for the Federal Reserve to cut rates, a move which could supercharge the next Bitcoin price breakout. 

Key takeaways:

The US Labor Department revised payrolls down by 911,000 jobs, the largest cut in history, signaling deep labor market weakness.

The revision strengthens expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut even though inflation is still elevated.

Bitcoin may mirror gold's rally and regain momentum toward new highs in Q4.

Bitcoin (BTC) could be set to benefit price-wise in the coming weeks as the US Labor Department delivered the largest payroll revision in history, wiping 911,000 jobs from previously reported data for the 12 months ending March 2025. That's an average of 76,000 jobs overstated per month, officially larger than the 2009 revision at the peak of the global financial crisis.

According to the Kobeissi newsletter, losses were concentrated in consumer-driven categories, including −176,000 jobs in Leisure and Hospitality and −226,000 in Trade, Transportation, and Utilities. Total private hiring was overstated by 880,000 jobs, a scale of weakness not seen outside the Great Depression and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

The revisions add to a concerning trend. Last month, the US cut 258,000 jobs from the May and June reports. Yesterday's revision tacked on another 27,000, marking the largest two-month net revision in modern history outside of 2020. Alongside August's weak 22,000-job gain, the data all but lock in a Federal Reserve rate cut at next week's meeting.

Gold, the traditional store of value, has surged 40% this year, with gold miners nearly doubling returns, nearly 10 times that of the S&P 500. Investors have long bet that a weakening labor market would force the Fed to act, despite the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) back above 3% and growth near 3%.

For Bitcoin, the implications may be even more powerful. Bitwise Strategist André Dragosch captured it succinctly in an X post, stating,

With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in eight days, it will mark the first cut in history with inflation still hot, stocks at record highs and GDP strong. That combination signals one thing: The central bank is prioritizing labor weakness over inflation, creating a “dovish but cautious” tone.

The advantage remains clear for Bitcoin. Just as gold rallied months ahead of policy confirmation, Bitcoin's lean positioning and historical sensitivity to liquidity cycles could transform this rare policy mix into a powerful upside catalyst, potentially reviving momentum toward new highs in Q4.

Decentralized finance protocol Ethena ENA$0.8257 submitted Tuesday a proposal to issue Hyperliquid's upcoming stablecoin, joining a bidding race that has already attracted a slew of companies like Paxos, Sky, Frax and Agora.

The token would be fully backed by Ethena's USDtb, a stablecoin issued with federally chartered bank Anchorage Digital and fully backed by BUIDL, the tokenized money market fund by asset management giant BlackRock and Securitize.

"We are excited to enable Ethena's USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users," said Robert Mitchnick, Blackrock's head of digital assets, in the proposal.

If adopted, Ethena pledged that 95% of net revenue from USDH reserves would flow back to the Hyperliquid ecosystem, the proposal said. Ethena also said it would cover the costs of migrating existing USDC trading pairs on Hyperliquid to USDH to ease adoption.

The proposal comes as competition to win the issuance of Hyperliquid's USDH stablecoin is intensifies. The decentralized exchange executed almost $400 billion in perpetuals trading volume last month, making it an attractive market for stablecoin providers to corner. Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Paxos, Sky, Frax, Agora and Native Markets threw their hat in the ring. Validators are set to vote on proposals on September 14.

Altcoins may be on the cusp of an explosive move, as Global Macro Investor founder Raoul Pal shares a bullish outlook for the XRP-led TOTAL3 market cap.

“You can't help but stare at this chart,” Pal shared in his X post today. The market veteran's chart indicates that the TOTAL3 market cap looks very bullish, as an imminent breakout could send the altcoin market into a frenzy.

For the uninitiated, the TOTAL3 market cap represents the valuation of the global cryptocurrency market, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notably, their exclusion puts XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, in the lead. At the time of writing, the TOTAL3 index stood at $1.09 trillion, up 3% since the start of this week.

Meanwhile, Pal highlighted its bullishness in his post today, particularly as it nears the upper resistance of an inverted descending triangle. The index has been consolidating within the structure since peaking at $1.13 trillion in November 2021.

It attempted to break out during the Trump-inspired late 2024 rally but succumbed to the resistance when it topped at $1.16 trillion in December. With the TOTAL3 market cap now trending near the top again, it could have a ripple effect on the broader altcoin market if it defies the years-long supply neckline.

Moreover, this optimism is clearly based on the market impact during the last breakout in May 2020. The TOTAL3 market cap broke out of a descending triangle at the time, sparking a rally from around $65 billion to November 2021's peak of $1.13 trillion.

Notably, this break sent altcoins soaring, as capital shifted from Bitcoin and Ethereum to mid and low-cap tokens, sparking multiple new all-time highs. A similar outcome would finally usher in the long-awaited altseason, where other cryptocurrencies like XRP would dominate BTC and Ether.

Meanwhile, the decline in Bitcoin's dominance further fuels the bullish outlook for altcoins. Since its peak at 66% in June, Bitcoin's market share has dropped 11.8%, with altcoin leader Ethereum leading the sector's rebound.

After recovering over the last two weeks, Bitcoin's dominance has resumed its downtrend this week, further raising the enthusiasm that altcoins would continue to gain weight against the pioneering cryptocurrency. It currently trends at 58.20% and is on course for its third consecutive downtrend day.

Notably, these converging factors align with Pal's earlier assertion that the market would see a similar rally from the 2017 bull cycle. He mentioned the weakening dollar as a catalyst, with the recently highlighted bullish chart development also fueling these sentiments.

When the rally does start, the market analyst is specifically rooting for XRP to fly. He shared this outlook in August, insisting that XRP will full port to unprecedented prices.

Cboe Global Markets CBOE said on Tuesday it would launch so-called continuous futures for bitcoin and ether starting November 10, as the derivatives exchange looks to expand its crypto offerings. 

Exchanges have been pushing to expand digital asset offerings amid a more crypto-friendly environment under the Trump administration.

While traditional futures contracts can require periodic rolling, Cboe's continuous futures are planned to be single, long-dated contracts with a 10-year expiration. That can help simplify position management for traders, according to the exchange.    

Futures contracts allow traders to bet or hedge against the future price of an asset, without owning it. Cboe's move would give U.S. traders an option to gain long-term market exposure to digital assets in a regulated framework.   

Cboe has been looking to expand its futures product suite, which includes its flagship Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures, to serve all types of market participants.

The new product suite could help Cboe bolster its presence among the growing segment of retail traders seeking access to crypto derivatives. 

The long-dated crypto futures will be cleared through Cboe Clear U.S., a CFTC-regulated derivatives clearing firm.

Is the US preparing a debt escape plan hidden as Putin's adviser suggests — one that could devalue trillions and force the world to adjust?

Table of Contents

During the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Sep. 6, Anton Kobyakov, senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, gave a sharp view on how the U.S. may be attempting to manage its $35 trillion national debt.

He claimed that Washington is exploring a strategy to transfer part of its liabilities into cryptocurrencies, specifically stablecoins, which he described as a kind of “crypto cloud.”

In his view, such a move could allow the U.S. to devalue its obligations and trigger a rapid financial reset, once again pushing economic risk outward onto the global system.

Kobyakov presented gold and digital currencies as increasingly viable alternatives to traditional government-backed money. He argued that these instruments could be used to ease domestic fiscal strain while reshaping the global financial order.

To back his claim, he pointed to earlier turning points in American monetary history, including the 1930s abandonment of the gold standard and the 1971 exit from the Bretton Woods agreement.

Both episodes, he said, reshaped global monetary dynamics and shifted the costs of adjustment onto other nations. He also suggested that a similar transition today could unfold within 3 to 5 years.

Let's try to understand what may be occurring behind the scenes and examine whether these claims stand up to the current realities of global finance.

Historical records show that the U.S. has, at key moments, altered its monetary system in ways that allowed it to manage debt pressures without defaulting in formal terms.

While domestic reasons such as deflation, reserve imbalances, or inflation control were cited as triggers, the outcomes frequently involved global ripple effects that supported U.S. solvency at the expense of creditors.

The first instance unfolded between 1933 and 1934 during the Great Depression. Faced with plunging prices and widespread bank failures, the Roosevelt administration moved quickly to break the dollar's link to gold.

Laws were passed to seize gold holdings, nullify gold-payment clauses in both public and private contracts, and revalue gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce.

That change alone created nearly $2.8 billion in paper profits, which seeded the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, a vehicle used to influence currency markets with minimal Congressional oversight.

These measures not only lifted domestic prices but also reduced the real weight of dollar-denominated debt, in part because contracts once tied to fixed gold weights were now settled in paper currency that had already declined in real terms.

The Supreme Court upheld these changes in 1935, effectively insulating the U.S. from legal challenges to the re-denomination of obligations.

Nearly four decades later, a second transformation took place. The Bretton Woods system had anchored the global monetary order since the 1940s, with the dollar convertible to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce.

But in the 1960s, rising external liabilities and insufficient U.S. gold reserves created doubts about that commitment. Stopgap measures such as the London Gold Pool and the introduction of IMF Special Drawing Rights delayed but did not resolve the imbalance.

In 1971, President Nixon suspended gold convertibility for foreign governments and imposed domestic price controls. The move unilaterally ended the dollar's gold backing and forced the rest of the world to absorb a floating fiat regime.

In 1973, global currencies were no longer anchored to gold, and the dollar's value was now shaped by market forces rather than metal parity.

These two episodes are widely studied for their effects on debt dynamics. After each shift, U.S. inflation accelerated. In the 1970s, consumer prices rose more than 13% annually at their peak while interest rates often lagged behind, resulting in negative real returns.

That meant creditors holding fixed-rate claims, whether pension funds, savers, or foreign central banks, saw the real value of those assets shrink. In economic terms, the government reduced its debt burden through inflation and currency devaluation without missing a payment.

Viewed from this perspective, Kobyakov's argument is not without precedent. In both cases, the 1930s and early 1970s, the U.S. changed core monetary rules in response to internal pressures while the financial cost of adjustment was partially absorbed by external creditors.

That distinction forms the basis of what critics have long described as an asymmetry embedded in the dollar system.

The phrase “exorbitant privilege,” coined in the 1960s by French finance minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, captured this frustration by pointing to the ability of the U.S. to borrow in its own currency, rewrite rules when necessary, and leave others to adjust.

In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins and opening a new chapter in how crypto finance connects with government debt. Sovereign debt refers to the money the U.S. borrows through bonds and Treasuries.

The law sets strict requirements for issuers. Stablecoins must be backed fully by cash or short-term U.S. Treasuries; issuers must publish monthly reserve disclosures, follow anti-money laundering rules, and obtain direct federal licenses.

Its passage comes at a time when stablecoin reserves are already becoming intertwined with the U.S. public debt market.

Leading issuers such as Tether and Circle back their tokens with short-dated government securities and repo instruments. Repo instruments are short-term loans secured by Treasuries. That practice creates a direct link between crypto platforms and government funding.

As of Sep. 9, the combined supply of stablecoins stands near $300 billion. Tether (USDT) accounts for roughly $169 billion, while USD Coin (USDC) is close to $72 billion.

The figure remains small compared to the $35 trillion national debt, yet the reserves behind these tokens represent a steady source of demand for Treasury bills. Crypto platforms are now tied into the short-term borrowing system Washington relies on to keep its financing running.

Concentration risk adds another layer. Tether's most recent attestation showed holdings of more than $127 billion in Treasuries, an amount comparable to a mid-size sovereign nation's creditor position.

Tether is based offshore and serves a global user base, so its inflows and redemptions follow international market conditions rather than U.S. domestic cycles. Sudden changes in activity can shift demand for Treasury bills and ripple into the broader market's liquidity.

The connection matters because stablecoin reserves do not reduce federal liabilities, but they influence how those liabilities are financed.

Continuous demand for Treasury bills helps anchor the short end of the yield curve, pushing yields lower and reducing government borrowing costs.

When inflation runs above those yields, the real value of debt shrinks over time. The burden is not eliminated but instead transferred onto global holders of tokenized cash, ranging from everyday users to large institutions in crypto markets.

The pattern recalls earlier U.S. moves that reshaped debt repayment terms without outright default. Whether deliberate or emergent, the stablecoin structure now makes it possible to ease the real weight of federal debt while leaving existing contracts formally intact.

The issue raised by Kobyakov is not whether the U.S. can erase $35 trillion in liabilities through stablecoins. The more pressing question is whether the global financial system can withstand another shift in U.S. monetary rules without breaking trust in the dollar.

The dollar has anchored international finance since the mid-20th century, and its importance was never only about convertibility or trade. It was also about consistency.

After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the dollar remained dominant. Its share of global reserves peaked around 85% and still stands near 58 to 59% today, according to IMF data.

That share is no longer fixed. Central banks have been steadily diversifying their reserves. IMF reports show more allocations to the euro, gold, and smaller currency baskets that include the Chinese yuan.

The World Gold Council reported record levels of official gold buying in 2023 and 2024. Central banks in China, Turkey, and India added hundreds of tonnes combined, pushing gold's share of global reserves closer to 24%.

Alternative systems are also growing. China and Russia have expanded cross-border settlement in local currencies. Trials of China's digital yuan have processed billions in volume, and Russia's central bank is running pilot programs for a digital ruble.

That environment makes U.S. stablecoin legislation more complicated in its effects. On one hand, the GENIUS Act and the participation of large asset managers in tokenized funds expand the reach of the dollar into digital finance.

On the other hand, the structure brings more users and institutions into a system where U.S. policy choices directly shape their returns.

That broader participation changes how risk is spread. In the past, monetary shifts were absorbed mainly by foreign governments or large institutional creditors. The stablecoin era creates a much wider base.

The concept of a “crypto cloud” does not remove debt from view. It spreads the consequences across a larger pool of holders, many of whom may not realize the part they play in carrying that burden.

The U.S. preliminary benchmark payrolls revision revealed a downward adjustment of 911,000 jobs for the one-year period ending March 2025, the largest on record.

The news suggests the labor market was far weaker than previously suggested by the government's monthly Nonfarm Payrolls reports. Those very closely watched reports are responsible for tens of billions of capital allocation decisions, not to mention playing a major factor in Federal Reserve monetary policy.

Had those numbers been previously available, it's highly likely that the Fed would have been trimming rates all through 2025. At the moment, the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates for the first time this year at its meeting next week. This news could put a 50 basis point rate cut on the table as opposed to the forecast 25.

Traders in rate-sensitive assets like crypto, gold and long-dated bonds lodged another entry in the long history of "buy the rumor, sell the news."

In the minutes prior to the report, gold futures surged past $3,700 for the first time ever, while spot gold set a new all time high above $3,670. Just following the data, though, gold futures gave back their morning gains, now flat for the day at $3,679.

Bitcoin BTC$110,972.55, meanwhile, swiftly pulled back from the $113,000 level to $111,600 at press time, down 1% over the past 24 hours.

And U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, threatening to dip below 4% for the first time since February, rose to 4.07%.

Ubunini bw'ikibanza ibikorwa vyo kwubaka vyariko biberamwo ni bwo bwabanje kumera nk'igitangaza kuri uyu mu enjeniyeri (ingenieur) akiri muto.

Moges Yeshiwas yari afise imyaka 27 igihe muri 2012 yashika muri ako karere kari kure mu misozi mu burengero bwa Ethiopia, aho yari yizeye kwungukira ubumenyi n'uburambe mu mwuga wiwe. Gushikana ku musozo uwu mugambi  bigiye guhindura igihugu ciwe, vyahinduye kandi ubuzima bwiwe.

Kuri uwu wa kabiri, umushikiranganji wa mbere Abiy Ahmed yuguruye icese urwo rugomero rutura ruzwi nka Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Gerd) ruzofasha mu kuronsa umuyagankuba iki gihugu n'akarere.

Urukuta rw'urwo rugomero rureha  na 1,78 km ujanye akabande rukagira na 145 m  mu maduga – rwubakishijwe metero cube zigera kuri miriyoni 11 z'ibeto (beton).

Ariko kuri Ethiopia urugomero Gerd rwabaye nk'ikimenyetso c'iteka  ry'igihugu, mbere ku bwa Abiy, rwashimangiye ikibanza c'igihugu mu makungu. 

Ku ruhande rwiwe, Moges, ubu afise imyaka 40, nawe nyene yarishimiye kuba ari mu baranguye uwo mugambi.

"Gukurikirana ku musi ku musi ingene urugomero ruduga vyari bihimbaye rwose. Naje ndondera akazi, ariko harageze igihe ivyo kwiyumvamwo ko ari akazi bihera. Umugambi narawiyumvisemwo gushika n'aho numva ndawufitiye impungenge za kazoza nk'uko umengo wari uwanje".

Ingorane ntizari zibuze.

"Gutandukana n'umuryango igihe kirekire ntivyari vyoroshe", ni ko yabwiye BBC.

Uwo mugabo yashobora gutaha muhira i Bahir Dar – urugendo rwa 400 km – kabiri gusa mu mwaka.

Kuba ikibanza cubakwamwo urugomero cari kure cane, hakaba ubushuhe burenze – rimwe rimwe bukanashika kuri 45 C – na vyo nyene vyaratera ingorane. Vyongeye, n'amasaha y'akazi yari menshi.

"Twakora kuva isaha imwe y'igitondo gushika imwe y'ijoro, tukaruhuka isaha imwe gusa kugira dufungure. Twaca dukorerwa mu ngata n'uwundi mugwi wakora ijoro, kuko mu bisanzwe imirimo yategerezwa kubandanya amasaha 24 kuri 24", ni ko Moges yavuze.

Akazi kiwe kwari ugusuzuma ubukomere bw'inyubako no kwihweza nimba ibisabwa mu bwubatsi vyose vyariko birakurikizwa.

Umugambi Gerd wari nk'inguvu zinywanisha z'imbonekarimwe, mu gihe mu myaka 10 iheze kino gihugu co mw'ihembe rya Afrika casinzikajwe n'indyane za politike hamwe n'iz'amoko.

Mu gihe bamwe, nk'uwo mu-enjeniyeri, bakoze kuri uwo uwo mugambi, abandi banya-Ethiopie baharurwa muri za miriyoni bawushizemwo uburyo.

Abanyagihugu bava mu mice itandukanye baraterereye mu kwubaka uru rugomero biciye mu gutanga uburyo canke bagashigikira ibikorwa vyo kwegeranya uburyo vyategurwa na reta.

N'ubwo umukuru wa Amerika Donald Trump avuga ko uburyo bwubatse runo rugomero bwatanzwe n'igihugu ciwe, reta ya Ethiopia yo ibandanya yemeza ko rwubatswe ku buryo bw'imbere mu gihugu gusa.

N'ubwo yamuka mu karere ka Tigray kasinzikajwe n'intambara y'imyaka ibiri, yaraterera ukwo ashoboye mw'iyubakwa ry'urugomero kuva umugambi ugitangazwa mu mwaka wa 2011.

Avuga ko yatanze uburyo muri reta incuro zirenga 100 – n'ubwo yaciye abanza guhagarika igihe c'intambara kubera vyinshi harimwo amabanki vyari vyahagaze muri Tigray.

Kiros avuga ko inguvu yazikura mu mpanuro bari bahawe n'umushikiranganji wa mbere Meles Zenawi yatanguje icese umugambi, aho yatangaje ko abanya Ethiopia bose bategerezwa kuja hamwe kugira bashigikire urwo rugomero.

"Nariyemeje ubwanje gukora ivyo nari nshoboye vyose kugira mfashe ushike [umugambi] ku musozo", ni ko uwo muvyeyi w'abana batanu yabwiye BBC.

Ubu rero urugomero ruriko rurakora, bamwe n'abandi biyumvira akarusho rushobora kuzanira Ethiopia.

Rwuzuye neza, rushobora gutanga 5.100 vya Megawatt (MW) – ni incuro zibiri zirenga z'umuyagankuba iki gihugu gisanzwe gitanga urwo rugomero rutarimwo. Urakwiye kugira amamiriyoni n'amamiriyoni y'iyindi mihana ironswe umuyagankuba mu gihugu.

Ariko ivyo bivana n'uburyo hamwe n'imihora izoba yashizweho kugira ishoboze kuwushikana mu burere butandukanye bw'igihugu.

Umushikiranganji w'amazi n'amasoko ntanganguvu Habtamu Ifeta yabwiye BBC ko hafi igice c'imiriyoni 135 z'abanyagihugu b'ico gihugu badafise umuyagankuba.

"Ni vyo dukeneye kugabanya mu myaka itanu iza. Intumbero ni uko gushika muri 2030, n'imiburiburi 90 kw'ijana y'abanyagihugu bacu boba bafise umuyagankuba", ni ko yavuze.

Ku bwa Getenesh, asanzwe rimwe rimwe yikora ku muco udashemeye w'agaterefone k'umugabo wiwe iyo bwije, indoto ziwe ni uko boronka umuyagankuba kugira habone mw'ijoro.

A closely watched technical setup is emerging across the altcoin market, and traders believe it could signal the start of a powerful new rally.

According to analyst Merlijn The Trader, the combined market capitalization of altcoins is shaping a classic cup-and-handle pattern, a formation often seen as a prelude to major breakouts.

“The cup was built in pain, and the handle is being built in disbelief,” Merlijn noted. The idea is that long corrective phases (the “cup”) are followed by a smaller consolidation (the “handle”), paving the way for renewed upside momentum. Once the pattern completes, traders typically anticipate an acceleration in buying pressure.



For altcoins, that breakout target could be extraordinary. The analyst suggested that a surge toward a $3 trillion total market cap is within reach if the structure plays out.

At present, the altcoin market cap (excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) sits around $1.09 trillion. Despite setbacks through 2022 and 2023, the recovery in 2024–2025 has brought valuations back into a range where technical patterns like this gain relevance.

Historically, cup-and-handle setups have led to sustained bullish phases across both traditional equities and crypto markets. While not guaranteed, the symmetry of the current formation has caught traders' attention, with some calling it “too clean to fade.”

If the pattern confirms, a rally toward new highs would likely drive capital rotation from Bitcoin and Ethereum into mid- and lower-cap tokens. This could mirror past market cycles where altcoins dramatically outperformed once confidence returned.

Still, risks remain. Global liquidity conditions, regulatory decisions, and macroeconomic pressures could disrupt the setup. But with sentiment slowly improving, the possibility of a $3 trillion altcoin market is becoming harder for traders to ignore.







Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as traders point to historical patterns and on-chain signals that suggest a major rally could be brewing.

Cboe Global Markets has unveiled plans to roll out Continuous futures contracts for Bitcoin and Ether on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) starting November 10, 2025, pending regulatory approval.

Fresh analysis from Alphractal suggests that the momentum story for Bitcoin and Ethereum is starting to diverge.

The GameFi sector delivered a mixed performance this week, with overall market cap steady at $18.79 billion while trading volume plunged 30.7% to $2.6 billion.

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a notable shift in capital flows as Bitcoin's market dominance has dropped to 61.6%, marking a 2.36% decrease.

The general crypto market has been volatile in the past week following the Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook for 2025 to arrest inflation.

Altcoins may be heading for deeper losses against Bitcoin, according to crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen, who sees no signs of reversal in the broader trend.

CoinShares, a prominent crypto asset management and research firm, reported a significant rebound in institutional investment last week, with millions of dollars flowing into altcoin products.

Market dynamics are shifting, and these digital assets could reach unprecedented levels. Insights from advanced analysis point to certain coins that might reshape the crypto landscape. Investors and enthusiasts may find these emerging opportunities worth watching closely. 

After weeks of leading the charge, Bitcoin's dominance is showing cracks—creating space for altcoins to reemerge with strength.

Altcoins have struggled to perform as expected in the current market cycle, raising questions about whether this period will follow the traditional altseason pattern.

As November draws near, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about which digital coins could deliver astronomical returns.

Many cryptocurrencies with real promise are stumbling over new regulations. Yet, an unexpected player in the meme coin arena might break through these barriers.

Altcoin Vector has outlined the conditions for a potential altseason, noting that while the framework is forming, the final confirmation has yet to arrive.

A bipartisan push on Capitol Hill is giving America's biggest merchants a new reason to dabble in blockchain.

Amazon shareholders are gearing up for a pivotal decision at their annual meeting next year: whether the company should explore incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into its corporate treasury.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to rise, fueled by developments such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the return of pro-crypto policies under Donald Trump's leadership.

Amazon briefly sparked political controversy after exploring the idea of showing shoppers how tariffs are impacting product prices—a move that quickly drew fire from President Trump's team.

A U.S. city is raising alarms about the negative impact of a nearby Bitcoin mining operation.

Following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, shares of Trump Media (DJT) surged approximately 70% in premarket trading on the first trading day following the incident.

Worksport, a US-based manufacturer, is making strides into the cryptocurrency space by incorporating Bitcoin and XRP into its corporate treasury strategy.

A pastor from Washington state, Francier Obando Pinillo, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding over 1,500 people through a cryptocurrency scheme called Solano Fi.

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) has introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act, a landmark bill that seeks to modernize federal home loan underwriting by including digital assets in mortgage eligibility assessments.

 Trump Media announced that users who earn gems by participating in Trump Media activities will be able to convert them into Cronos. 

Trump Media and Technology Group has updated its Truth Social platform to connect its digital rewards program with cryptocurrency.

The company announced on Tuesday that Truth Social users subscribed to its Patriot Package, a paid version of its Truth+ streaming platform, will gain access to premium features like the “Truth gems,” as part of its upgraded rewards program. 

The gems can be earned through activities across Trump Media's platforms and converted into Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com, using the exchange's wallet infrastructure.

Cointelegraph reached out to Crypto.com for more information, but did not receive a response by publication. 

The move to integrate CRO signals a pivot from the company's earlier remarks about exploring the launch of its own utility token. 

In April, Trump Media said it was exploring the launch of a proprietary token and digital wallet to support its Truth+ streaming platform. In an April 29 letter to shareholders, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said the company is exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet.  

Nunes said the token can initially be used to pay for subscription costs and be applied to other products within the ecosystem. He added that the token will also be part of a rewards program that Trump Media is exploring across services. 

In May, rumors of a Truth Social memecoin launching circulated on social media. However, Truth Social denied that it was planning to launch a memecoin. Donald Trump Jr., the US president's eldest son, said that there was “no truth” to the rumors.

This is not the first time that Trump Media has collaborated with Crypto.com. Earlier this year, the company partnered with the platform to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking digital assets and securities “with a Made in America focus.” 

The funds will launch through Truth.Fi and will be available through Crypto.com's broker-dealer, Foris Capital. The ETFs are expected to go live later in 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. 

Trump Media has also entered a major agreement with Crypto.com to acquire 684.4 million CRO tokens, worth roughly $105 million, as part of a broader $6.4 billion digital-asset treasury strategy. The tokens will be acquired through a mix of stock and cash and held in Crypto.com's institutional custody, potentially allowing Trump Media to stake them for additional yield.

OpenSea committed $1 million to a flagship NFT reserve while teasing its SEA token launch, blending cultural preservation with new user rewards. 

Non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea has unveiled its first NFT reserve, pledging $1 million to digital art through a curated Flagship Collection.

OpenSea said the initiative aims to showcase NFTs with lasting cultural relevance, not as a financial investment but as a “living museum” of digital art and innovation.

CryptoPunk #5273, purchased for about $282,000, will be the collection's first acquisition to symbolize the early ethos of the NFT movement.

The NFT platform also shared an update about its upcoming SEA Token Generation Event expected as early as next month.

Starting September 15, OpenSea will allocate 50% of platform fees to a prize vault loaded with $1 million worth of Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) tokens to reward users via a gamified system linked to completing tasks and platform engagement.

“SEA being engineered with thoughtful mechanics, clear reasons to hold, and long-term sustainability baked in from the start,” said OpenSea CMO Adam Hollander on X.

Ethereum could trade as high as $250,000 if Bitcoin hits the widely predicted $1 million mark, according to financial research firm Fundstrat.

​

Fundstrat investment chief Tom Lee shared a table on Tuesday outlining the firm's Ethereum price targets at various Bitcoin milestones. The table was based on ETH's historical value relative to BTC. According to the table, If Bitcoin reaches $1 million, Ethereum could range from $48,000, based on its eight-year average of 0.0479 BTC, to over $87,000 if ETH matches its 2021 high relative value of 0.0873 BTC.

​

But Lee said Fundstrat expected Ethereum to surpass its 2021 high and eventually trade as high as 0.25 BTC. In this scenario, ETH trades at $250,000 if Bitcoin hits $1 million.

​

Applying the same approach to Fundstrat's $250,000 year-end Bitcoin target, Ethereum is forecast to be worth about $12,000 in the base case, $22,000 in a medium bull case, and $62,500 in an ultra-bullish case. But from a technical perspective, Fundstrat has a more conservative Ethereum short-term outlook. According to Fundstrat Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton, ETH could trade at $5,500 in September and $9,000 in January.

​

Still, even this conservative outlook is significantly bullish. Ethereum is currently trading around $4,500.

​

Fundstrat's bullishness on Ethereum is based on the expectation that Wall Street and real-world assets will move on-chain, driven by growing regulatory clarity. The firm believes that Ethereum will be the winner of this tokenization wave.

​

Lee compared the potential shift to the U.S.'s move away from a gold-backed dollar in 1971. He said Wall Street was the big winner of the shift to what he called a synthetic dollar. He said that with the shift came innovation on Wall Street to help people overcome the devaluation that resulted from moving away from the gold-backed currency system.

​"Ethereum is having its 1971 moment, where the real-world assets are becoming synthetic or tokenized," Lee said. "What is Wall Street going to do to innovate on the blockchain over the next 10, 15, years? Well, they're going to build stablecoins, tokenize equities, credit, tokenize real estate. They're going to monetize reputation, even monetize an intellectual property. And a lot of this is happening on Ethereum."

​

Lee has staked his reputation on Ethereum's success. He took the helm of the Ethereum treasury company Bitmine (NYSE:BMNR) in June. In just over a month, the firm acquired nearly 2 million ETH, worth over $8 billion, which accounts for approximately 1.5% of the total supply. The firm has set its sights on taking that figure to 5%.

The crypto market thrives on both established coins and fresh token presales. Investors look for projects that mix stability with innovation, making it essential to track both sides of the spectrum.

The best crypto presale to buy right now often combines culture with function, while altcoins like Ethereum and Avalanche deliver proven ecosystems. New crypto presale projects like Based Eggman $GGs bring a playful yet practical layer of gaming and community into the mix. 

Together, they shape the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency presales and token presales in 2025.



Based Eggman $GGs positions itself at the center of crypto gaming and meme culture. It belongs to the category of new crypto token presales but adds deeper functionality than many presale coins. The token is used for gaming rewards, streaming integration, payments, and liquidity.

The project's mission is straightforward: make $GGs the home of gaming and memes within Web3. Unlike many presale crypto tokens, $GGs directly embeds itself into culture, taking inspiration from the universal gaming phrase “Good Games.” This connection creates immediate recognition across communities.

Its role in the Based Eggman ecosystem combines entertainment with blockchain technology, placing it among the top crypto presales of 2025. By uniting gamers, meme creators, and traders, it emphasizes accessibility and shared participation. 

With a structured token supply and expansion plans across multiple blockchains, Based Eggman $GGs offers an example of how presale crypto projects can create ecosystems rather than isolated assets.



Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications and smart contracts, even as it consolidates after reaching an all-time high of $4,957 in August. Following the rally, ETH has corrected and now tests critical support levels.

Institutional interest continues to fuel attention toward Ethereum, supported by record inflows into stablecoins and a strong developer base. Technical signals currently show a neutral-to-bearish bias, suggesting the market is waiting for clear direction.

For those comparing crypto coins on presale with established leaders, Ethereum represents maturity and scale. While presale crypto tokens attract early excitement, ETH illustrates the resilience of long-standing assets on any crypto presale list.

Avalanche, trading in the mid-$24 range, is showing consolidation after a period of caution. Early September revealed a double-top pattern and bearish divergences, but recent activity points to a more neutral outlook.

The blockchain continues to see steady network growth and adoption, supported by institutional interest in its scaling capabilities. While short-term technicals highlight uncertainty, longer-term sentiment remains cautiously optimistic.

When evaluating top presale crypto opportunities alongside altcoins, AVAX shows how emerging networks can build lasting ecosystems. Its position between growth and consolidation makes it a relevant asset to compare with cryptocurrency presales and new token presales entering the market.



The balance between altcoins and token presales defines much of today's crypto conversation. Ethereum and Avalanche show how established ecosystems mature with steady development. Meanwhile, Based Eggman $GGs highlights how presale crypto projects use culture and gaming to create new communities.

For investors, the best crypto presale to buy right now often depends on recognizing where innovation meets usability. Established assets provide resilience, while new crypto presale tokens deliver opportunities for early adoption. Together, they drive growth across decentralized networks.

As 2025 progresses, tracking both established altcoins and new presale crypto projects like $GGs will remain key to understanding the evolving crypto market.

Oops, something went wrong

By Echo Wang

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stablecoin issuer Figure Technologies increased the size and raised the price range of its initial public offering on Tuesday as retail investors bid up crypto-related stocks, confirming a Reuters report.

The company is now marketing the IPO at a price range of $20 to $22 a share – up from its previous range of $18 to $20 a share. It also raised the number of shares to 31.5 million from around 26 million.

At the top end of the new pricing range, Figure's IPO will raise roughly $693 million and value the company at $4.66 billion.

Figure's IPO initially would have raised as much as $526 million and valued the company at $4.1 billion. The blockchain firm is scheduled to start trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol FIGR.

The Trump administration's embrace of the crypto industry has prompted investors to pour money into digital assets, especially following the successful debuts of crypto exchange Bullish and stablecoin issuer Circle in recent weeks.

Co-founded in 2018 by technology entrepreneur Mike Cagney, Figure operates a blockchain-native platform for lending, trading and investing in consumer credit and digital assets.

The company says it funds home equity loans in just 10 days, compared to the industry average of 42 days.

It swung to a profit of $29 million for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $13 million in the same period a year earlier.

Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are the joint lead bookrunning managers for Figure's IPO.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office has indicated interest in buying up to $50 million worth of shares from Figure's offering.

The confusion and commotion over cryptocurrency often reminds me of the 19th-century German drama Faust. In Goethe's masterpiece, the devil Mephistopheles offers an emperor the tantalising vision of limitless wealth through the printing of paper money.

The emperor grasps the idea (unheard of at the time the play is set), and the magical wealth which paper creates brings brief prosperity to his troubled dominion.

But what appeared to be an inexhaustible source of value soon proves illusory. A combination of misunderstanding and hype leads to economic and moral corruption, and the empire descends into chaos.

It is a tale which could well have parallels for digital currencies now. People use them despite not fully understanding how they work, sometimes to their financial loss.

And history shows us that we should be wary of the idea that currency systems always change for the better, following some sort of natural evolutionary path. In fact, new currency systems don't always succeed, and even when they do, monetary regime change can be a long and arduous process.

Coins and tokens were used more than 2,000 years ago, and continued through to the 19th century before paper finally dominated. Rather than a clean, irreversible shift from coins to notes, nations often alternated between the two systems.

There were failed experiments with paper money in 14th-century China, 17th-century Sweden and 18th-century France, to mention just a few.

Research on these problematic attempts suggests that social division also makes new currency shifts especially vulnerable.

During the American war of independence for example, a currency (the “continental dollar”) was briefly introduced in 1775. It was later abandoned due to mismanagement and misunderstanding, but had also served to sharpen political tensions between the patriots who supported it, and the loyalists to Britain, who detested it.

Similarly, in the 1750s and 1760s, the Swedish government issued non-redeemable paper money to pay its war debts. The consequent extreme inflation coincided with intense social division and led to a period of political chaos.

In 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, a paper form of government bond was issued, which rapidly lost its value. Seven years later, the “assignat” had become virtually worthless.

Britain fared slightly better, as I explore in my book The Age of Paper. Its departure from the metal standard in 1797, amid the financial pressures of the Anglo–French war, did not produce a collapse of the nation's paper currency.

But the paper-based regime came to a halt in 1819, a year of bitter class conflicts, which culminated in the Peterloo massacre, where at least 18 people were killed and hundreds wounded by the cavalry at a peaceful rally for democratic reform. The public had come to detest Bank of England notes, which became a symbol of economic depression and political oppression.

Britain then followed the pattern of other nations, reverting to a traditional monetary system that rested on the solid value of precious metals.

These cases of failed paper currencies – and there are many more – show that the general acceptance of currency ultimately requires shared values and social solidarity. Paper currency works when people trust it, knowing that it has been valued and accepted by others in the past, and will be valued and accepted in the future.

It would otherwise be unlikely for a piece of paper to become a reliable means of payment and value. Once such shared values are lost, there is usually a downward cycle of currency depreciation.

In the 21st-century, cryptocurrencies challenge the conventional idea of money as something of value – or at least linked to something of value, like gold. And as something that is issued and managed by a trusted central authority.

For cryptocurrencies exist only in the realm of blockchain technology. Their value is created and maintained not by central banks, but by complex computer algorithms.

To many, all of these abstract computational processes make cryptocurrencies as mysterious as Mephistopheles' dark magic in Faust.

Even so, with Donald Trump's strong support, cryptocurrencies are enjoying a surge in popularity. This trend will undoubtedly be reinforced by further deregulation which means requirements for transparency will be relaxed, and safeguards for consumer protection weakened.

The rise in popularity has coincided with the US government's apparent preference for weakening the dollar in the international currency markets as a way of boosting US exports by pushing down the prices of US goods abroad.

These events may lead to a profound transformation in the monetary system on a global scale. As the US dollar loses value and crypto regulations are relaxed, countries and investors around the world may be enticed to diversify their assets and increase their holdings of cryptocurrency.

But the combination of social division and rapid expansion may not be a positive sign for the future of cryptocurrency. Far from establishing it as a dominant medium of exchange in a new decentralised regime, history suggests that its rapid growth in a fractured society might instead accelerate its self-destruction.

Christie's is shutting down its NFT department. Yeah, you heard that right. The iconic auction house is doing away with its dedicated NFT section as part of a larger strategy to blend digital and traditional art. This is all happening in a tough market where art sales have dropped by about 12% since 2024. 

Let's be honest, the NFT market has been a wild ride. At first, it was the shiny new thing, capturing both collectors' and investors' imaginations. Crazy record sales, everyone from 20-somethings to grandmas wanting in. But now? Well, now the winds are shifting, and it seems like everyone is hitting the brakes. Christie's move to close its NFT department is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle.

What does this actually mean for the future of NFT sales? The closure signals a shift towards a hybrid model, where digital art is no longer a separate category but part of the broader 20th and 21st-century art market. Fanny Lakoubay, a digital art adviser, thinks this is a response to the current market contraction, making it hard for auction houses to justify keeping separate departments when the revenue isn't matching that of traditional art.

For artists and collectors, this raises questions about the sustainability of NFT sales moving forward. There's a clear need for solid business models that can handle volatility and changing consumer sentiment. 

Newer digital art platforms can learn a thing or two from Christie's experience. A hybrid business model that combines both physical and digital art sales could be the way to go. By investing in better digital infrastructure and partnerships, these platforms can create an engaging and accessible environment for collectors. Plus, blockchain tech for provenance and ownership? That could bring a whole new level of transparency and trust to the table.

As we look ahead, the future of NFT auctions might hinge on a few key trends and innovations. Integrating blockchain tech could facilitate secure and transparent transactions, and smart contracts could automate the bidding process. This would cut down on the need for middlemen and make the whole thing a lot more user-friendly.

Hybrid auction formats that combine physical and online experiences could also help. This way, they can pull in both in-person and remote bidders. More participation means more excitement around NFT sales. 

And let's not forget data-driven personalization and AI recommendations. By analyzing bidder behavior and preferences, auction houses could tailor their marketing to identify potential high-value bidders, ultimately boosting engagement and sales.

Christie's closing its NFT department is just the tip of the iceberg. It shows that the market is changing, and digital art sales are becoming more integrated with traditional art. The future of this space will require all of us—artists, collectors, and auction houses—to adapt to new dynamics, hybrid models, and tech innovations. 

If we play our cards right, maybe digital art can continue to flourish in the years to come.

Ethereum (ETH) whales have flipped bullish on the native token of decentralized perpetuals exchange Hyperliquid (HYPE), according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain.

Lookonchain says that four addresses have acquired HYPE tokens worth approximately $24.03 million within hours of each other.

“Whales are bullish on HYPE.

qianbaidu.eth bought 260,900 HYPE ($13 million) in the past 16 hours via 2 wallets.

0xe0f0 opened a long position of 136,906 HYPE ($6.9 million) in the past 6 hours.

0x328B bought 43,415 HYPE ($2.13 million) in the past 12 hours.

0x23fA bought and staked 42,161 HYPE ($2 million) 7 hours ago.”

Hyperliquid is trading at $50.57 at time of writing. Since the crypto market correction in April that saw HYPE fall to $9.50, HYPE is up by around 430%.

The change in sentiment by whales comes amid plans by Hyperliquid to launch its own stablecoin. Last week, Hyperliquid announced plans to launch a “Hyperliquid-aligned, compliant stablecoin” pegged to the US dollar for its ecosystem. According to the announcement, the stablecoin will bear the ticker USDH. Entities interested in deploying the proposed USDH stablecoin will be required to submit proposals. The winner will be decided by Hyperliquid validators.

Blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos Labs has already declared interest in issuing the USDH stablecoin. Paxos Labs says it will offer incentives designed to ensure that a portion of the revenues generated from the USDH stablecoin flow back to the ecosystem.

“Paxos will allocate 95% of interest from reserves backing USDH to buy back HYPE and redistribute it back to ecosystem initiatives, partners and users.”

      It is high time the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government got around to making greater use of India's central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-rupee. Capital flows in and out of securities markets, whether from or to external jurisdictions, would become instantaneous if these make use of e-rupee wallets—enabling wide compliance with the mandated speed of settlement, post transaction. 


     
      Right now, one hitch in expanding the e-rupee's retail use is the ubiquity of digital payments done via the Unified Payments  Interface (UPI). Recently, the number of daily UPI transactions exceeded 700 million. When we have UPI, why do we need an e-rupee?  


     
      This platform transfers funds from one bank account to another instantly, which suits  users who routinely access funds in their own accounts online, but not everyone. For India's vast migrant population, hailing from remote corners of the country where bank branches and automated cash dispensers are a rarity, UPI transfers are not enough. 


     
      For them, e-rupee wallets in the hands—or rather, phones—of family members offer a cheap, quick and secure way to remit funds back home. Notably, welfare transfers could also be done this way.


     
      Delays in reaching the nearest cash dispenser, difficulty in using one and the risk of finding a machine out of notes to dispense—all such problems are overcome if money comes into a CBDC wallet in a handheld device. From this, payments could be made to bank accounts  or other wallets, including ones that change  e-rupees into paper cash. Government transfers to such wallets, meanwhile, would do away with middlemen.


     
      In other words, India's CBDC can subserve financial inclusion in ways that UPI cannot. As the e-rupee exists on a blockchain, a distributed ledger, it allows transactions to be traced. While this raises privacy concerns, it also offers an advantage in cases where authorities have a legitimate reason to track flows, such as benefit transfers for specific purposes and indirect tax payments.


     
      For taxation, especially, traceability is desirable. Input tax credit fraud in GST over the last five years has been estimated at almost  ₹1.8 trillion. Were all GST payments to be made with the e-rupee, such fraud would likely vanish. Since the destination of despatched goods—complete with details of their value, tax paid and consignee—would be available on the online ledger, there would be no need for e-way bills and physical stoppage of haulage for inspection. 


     
      Given how CBDC technology permits ‘programmed' or preset flows  of money, it could ease tax compliance on the whole. And, as the long history of money has shown, tax mop-ups in a particular currency are an effective way to promote its wider use.


     
      We also have compelling reasons to use the e-rupee for cross-border flows—such as speed, security and cost savings. India is the world's largest recipient of remittances. From many countries, money can be sent easily, but not from all. The use of e-rupee wallets at both ends, with spot conversions, would make such transfers simple. Moreover, the US dollar's status as the global anchor currency may not last forever. Should an alternative arise, perhaps in the form of a stablecoin pegged to a basket of currencies, the e-rupee must be ready to integrate with such a blockchain.


     
      What a CBDC in economy-wide use could imply for banking, both central and otherwise, needs some discussion. But if we get its privacy settings right, its tech enablers suggest it's the future of money. Let's stay at the front edge of its evolution.

A ‘Make America Healthy Again' Report Goes Easy on the Food Industry



A childhood health report led by RFK, Jr., links poor diet, chemicals, inactivity and “overmedicalization” to worsening U.S. pediatric health

Criticisms of the food industry have gone mute in a second White House report on improving childhood health—where they have been replaced by a lengthy list of research questions on the problem and calls for deregulating small farms. Widely anticipated since the May publication of an initial “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report on the subject, White House revisions had delayed the new version.

Released on September 9, this “Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy” report comes from a commission that has been led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and has included White House officials and other agency heads. It cites poor diet, chemicals, inactivity and “overmedicalization” to explain a decline in U.S. children's health.

In its introduction, the 20-page report says that it “outlines a strategic approach for executive actions to address the childhood chronic disease crisis through advancing research, realigning incentives, increasing public awareness, and fostering private sector collaborations.”

Initially, the report offers a litany of 23 suggested research programs, ranging from studies on the effects of electromagnetic radiation and on the use of artificial intelligence for detecting cancer in young people to a research program on vaccine injuries. It also includes a list of some 35 policy changes, ranging from developing “MAHA Boxes” of food for participants of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to improving “regulatory processes” for over-the-counter sunscreen, all described in a few sentences. It then calls for the deregulation of whole-milk sales in schools, mobile grocery stores and small farms, among other agency actions. Finally, it calls for public awareness campaigns on childhood health, better exercise and nutrition, among other topics.

“The report has a lot of ideas for actions that really could improve health but is short on specifics and weak on regulatory action,” says New York University nutrition expert Marion Nestle. “Its overriding message is still ‘more research needed.' It does not say nearly enough about what needs to be done to improve the diets of America's children.”

The first MAHA report similarly blamed increasing U.S. childhood obesity, diabetes and autism rates—as well as other ailments—on unhealthy foods, chemicals, excessive screen time and overmedication. Notably, it blamed the food, chemical-manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries for these problems. It also initially backed its claims with citations to multiple nonexistent studies and frequently misstated real study findings (in a manner redolent of artificial intelligence authorship). “Discovery of the fake citations also came just days after President Donald Trump unveiled an executive order that called for ‘Restoring Gold Science Standards' to government activities,” Science magazine noted in May.

The new report takes a different tack, describing current pesticide review standards as “robust” and calling for further study of “overprescription trends” in medicine. Farm industry groups such as the American Soybean Association had complained about “erroneous representations” in the May MAHA report. Rather than railing against “ultra-processed foods,” the new report calls for the distant goal of defining them. And as noted above, the dairy industry gains a call for the removal of restrictions on whole-fat milk in schools. The September report also calls for improving the application process for farm-to-school grants without noting that, for this year, the Trump administration canceled such grants and eliminated a program to provide schools with food from local farms.

“In a sense the results were preordained and don't differ from leaked drafts very much,” says Peter Lurie of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The report is “a collection of the secretary [of HHS]'s pet peeves and half-baked science that doesn't really get at the root causes of poor health in children.” Each of the policy changes or research programs proposed in the report deserves its own year or more of careful analysis, Lurie says, rather than presentation in a hastily assembled grab bag of ideas. “Scientifically, I think this report will soon be forgotten,” he adds. “Politically, it will live on.”

Ironically, the report echoes a 2010 effort led by then first lady Michelle Obama, Nestle notes. That campaign was, she adds, “greeted by outrage and disdain for ‘nanny-statism.' So here's the RFK, Jr., version of the nanny state.”

This breakthrough method optimizes complex computations like never before.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Physicists are now using principles from quantum mechanics to build a new model of the abstract concept of pi. Or, more accurately, they built a new model that happens to include a great new representation of pi. But what does that mean, and why do we need different representations of pi?

Because quantum mechanics looks at the tiniest particles, one at a time, even simple questions can have complex answers that require massive computing power. Rendering high-tech video games and movies like Avatar can take days or more, and that's still not at the level of reality. In this paper, published in the peer-reviewed journal Physical Review Letters, physicists Arnab Priya Saha and Aninda Sinha describe their new version of a quantum model that reduces complexity, but maintains accuracy.

This is called optimization. Think of the way early internet video buffered in chunks of similar colors, or how classic animators painted static bodies with individual moving parts on top. Heck, think of how people cut the corners of squared-off walking paths until they make a dirt-path shortcut. We're surrounded by optimization and optimizing behaviors.

As detailed in their paper, Saha and Sinha combined two existing ideas from math and science: the Feynman diagram of particle scattering and the Euler beta function for scattering in string theory. What results is a series—something represented in math by the Greek letter Σ surrounded by parameters.

Series can end up generalizing into overall equations or expressions, but they don't have to. And while some series diverge—meaning that the terms continue to alternate away from each other—others converge on one approximate, concrete result. That's where pi comes in. The digits of pi extend into infinity, and pi is itself an irrational number, meaning it can't be truly represented by an integer fraction (the one we often learn in school, 22/7, is not very accurate by 2024 standards).

But it can be represented pretty quickly and well by a series. That's because a series can continue to build out values well into the tiniest digits. If a mathematician compiles a series' terms, they can use the resulting abstraction to do math that isn't possible with an approximation of pi that's cut off at 10 digits by a standard desk calculator. A sophisticated approximation enables the kind of nanoscopic particle work that inspired these scientists in the first place.

 “In the early 1970s,” Sinha said in a statement from the Indian Institute of Science, “scientists briefly examined this line of research, but quickly abandoned it since it was too complicated.”

But math analysis like this has come a long way since the 1970s. Today, Sinha and Saha are able to analyze an existing model and remodel it with altered terms. They're able to build a sequence and see that it converges on the value of pi within far fewer terms than expected, making it easier for scientists to run the series and then use that for further work.

All of that requires decades of foundational work in the field and large bodies of work showing that certain mathematical moves work where other ones don't. It's a comment on the ongoing and collaborative nature of math theory, even when what results is a working model that might help scientists. Our ability to meaningfully approximate has grown in tandem with our ability to solve complex problems outright.

“Doing this kind of work, although it may not see an immediate application in daily life, gives the pure pleasure of doing theory for the sake of doing it,” Sinha said in the statement.

Reality may be bigger than length, width, and height combined.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

We move through three dimensions. Or do we? String theorists believe our world encompasses more than three dimensions. Without experiential evidence, the mathematical theory of space and time as a fourth dimension has remained just that since the days of Albert Einstein: a theory. 

But in a new video from Big Think, Brian Greene, a string theorist from Columbia University, offers up a relatively simple explanation of just what a fourth dimension could entail—and where it could be. 

In the clip, Greene says that while “math suggests a real possibility there may be more dimensions than the ones we directly experience,” our minds have trouble comprehending just where they could be. Already, we move through three dimensions—left-right, back-forth, up-down—so how is there any room left? 

“That's really the point,” Greene says. “They are new places that our experience doesn't allow us to access directly, but according to these theoretical ideas, might be there.”

Greene offers up a garden hose as a good example of what the fourth dimension looks like. From far away, this garden hose may look one-dimensional to the naked eye. From a distance, we simply can't see the circular nature of the rubber. But if we use a pair of binoculars, Greene says, we can see the circular part. 

This example shows that dimensions can be big. They could be so big we see them with our eyes, or they could curl up and become tiny and more difficult to detect, as is the case with the garden hose. 

“This idea might apply to space itself,” Greene says. Maybe the left-right, back-forth, up-down dimensions are simply the big, easy dimensions for us to see. “But just as the hose has a curled-up dimension, maybe space itself has curled up dimensions all around us, just curled up to such a fantastically small size we can't see them with our eyes,” he says. “We can't see them even with today's most powerful microscopes.”

Cannabis consumption and legalization is increasing globally, raising concerns about its impact on fertility. In humans, we previously demonstrated that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites reach the ovarian follicle. An extensive body of literature describes THC's impact on sperm, however no such studies have determined its effects on the oocyte. Herein, we investigate the impact of THC on human female fertility through both a clinical and in vitro analysis. In a case-control study, we show that follicular fluid THC concentration is positively correlated with oocyte maturation and THC-positive patients exhibit significantly lower embryo euploid rates than their matched controls. In vitro, we observe a similar, but non-significant, increased oocyte maturation rate following THC exposure and altered expression of key genes implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and chromosome segregation. Furthermore, THC induces oocyte chromosome segregation errors and increases abnormal spindle morphology. Finally, this study highlights potential risks associated with cannabis use for female fertility.

Cannabis consumption for both medicinal and recreational use and legalization have been rising globally1. Cannabis contains several classes of chemicals with cannabinoids being the most prominent; among these, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive compound and the most studied2. Notably, the concentration of THC in cannabis products has increased significantly, from an average of 3% (by weight) in the 1980s to around 15% in 2020, with some strains reaching 30% of THC2. The increase in frequency, ease of availability, and escalation in potency raises concerns about broader impacts on global human health, including reproductive health. Indeed, the main apprehension regarding THC and reproductive health stems from the importance of the endocannabinoid system in human reproduction3. Endocannabinoids, including N-arachidonoylethanolamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, are endogenous cannabinoids that play a central role in both male and female reproduction3, whereas THC is an exogenous cannabinoid. Extensive research has documented the effects of THC on male reproduction, highlighting an impact on sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation4,5,6,7 and sperm parameters8 including sperm concentration9,10,11, morphology12,13,14 and motility14. As for female health, literature reports the impact of cannabis use during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes15,16,17,18, placental development18,19,20 and offspring health18,20,21,22. However, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated the impact of cannabis on the human female gamete, the oocyte, a gap partly due to the challenge associated with obtaining these samples.

During in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, exogenous gonadotropins are administered in a process called “controlled ovarian hyperstimulation” which recruits multiple follicles and induces follicle growth. These recruited follicles, each containing an oocyte, are then collected by a physician in a procedure called oocyte retrieval. Oocytes are collected along with their surrounding microenvironment, including follicular fluid (FF) and supportive somatic cells (granulosa cells). The oocytes are isolated, and mature oocytes are used for subsequent in vitro fertilization. Using FF, our group has previously quantified Δ9-THC and its metabolites, 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC23,24, demonstrating that these compounds could reach the follicular niche. This is significant as it suggests that THC may directly alter the microenvironment where the oocyte matures. Furthermore, our group has shown that THC exposure altered human granulosa cell methylation in a concentration dependent manner23, and in vitro exposure modulated cannabinoid receptor dynamics in granulosa cells24. However, no human studies and only a few animal model studies have investigated the impact of cannabis directly on oocyte development with conflicting results25,26,27,28,29.

Maturation of the oocyte is a unique and highly specialized process beginning in utero during fetal development. It is widely accepted that female neonates are born with a finite number of oocytes, which, following menarche, are recruited to mature in cohorts with each menstrual cycle30. Although oocytes are protected in the ovary by the blood-follicle-barrier, they remain highly sensitive to environmental factors31. Given their essential role in reproduction, any perturbations in their development and maturation could have profound effects on fertility and on future generations. Thus, understanding the impact of THC on oocyte health is critical for providing informed guidance and counseling to patients of the potential risks to their fertility and future offspring.

In this study, we determine the impact of physiologically relevant concentrations of THC on oocyte maturation, elucidate the transcriptomic changes induced by THC exposure and its effect on chromosome segregation, and compare our findings with a retrospective cohort study. Our investigation will aid in bridging the knowledge gap in our understanding of the sex-specific reproductive consequences of cannabis use and contribute to more effective and evidence-based patient counseling.

Using a retrospective case-control design and mass spectrometry, we quantified the concentration of Δ9-THC and its metabolites,11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC, in the FF of patients undergoing IVF treatment to determine the reproductive consequences of THC consumption. Figure 1a illustrates the proportion of THC and its metabolites measured in all samples (n = 1059). Positivity rate was defined by the presence of 11-COOH-THC in the follicular fluid (62/1059, 6%). 11-COOH-THC was found alone in 13% of the samples (8/62) while Δ9-THC was co-detected in 37% of the samples (23/62) and 11-OH-THC co-detected in 2% (1/62). All three compounds were measured in 48% of the samples (30/62). Among the positive patients, 73% did not disclose their THC consumption on the patient intake questionnaire. The distribution of Δ9-THC and its metabolites showed a predominance of 11-COOH-THC (mean = 28.8 ng/mL), followed by Δ9-THC (mean = 7.5 ng/mL), with 11-OH-THC being the least abundant (mean = 1.7 ng/mL) (Fig. 1b). Notably, concentrations of these metabolites did not differ between FF and matched serum samples obtained at the time of oocyte retrieval (Fig. 1c).

A Spearman correlation analysis identified significant correlations between THC metabolite concentrations and various clinical and biochemical parameters (Fig. 1d). Specifically, concentrations of Δ9-THC, 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC were positively correlated with oocyte maturation rate in the THC-positive group (Δ9-THC: ⍴ = 0.370, p = 0.003; 11-OH-THC: ⍴ = 0.309, p = 0.014 and 11-COOH-THC: ⍴ = 0.295, p = 0.020). Interestingly, Δ9-THC levels were negatively correlated with a patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) (⍴ = −0.539, p = 0.000053).

Patients undergoing IVF treatment and oocyte retrieval who consented for the collection of IVF waste material (immature oocytes, somatic cells and FF) and de-identified clinical data were included in this study. For each patient, a minimum of three immature oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage were collected following the removal of somatic cells. GV oocytes were cultured using our standard in vitro maturation (IVM) protocol for 24h32 (control group (Ctrl), n = 96) or with the addition of THC (treatment groups). Oocytes were treated with either a physiologically relevant (THC1, n = 95, 25 ng/mL Δ9-THC, 5 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, 50 ng/mL 11-COOH-THC) or a supraphysiologic (THC2, n = 93, 100 ng/mL Δ9-THC, 50 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, 200 ng/mL 11-COOH-THC) concentration where THC1 is based on the concentration of Δ9-THC and its metabolites measured in the follicular fluid of IVF patients and THC2 is based on previously reported concentrations in animal studies23,25,29. Subsequently, oocytes were classified based on their progression through key maturation checkpoints: germinal vesicle (GV) and Metaphase-I (MI) (after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and before polar body extrusion) were considered immature oocytes, while Metaphase-II (MII) oocytes (after visible polar body extrusion) were considered mature (Fig. 2a). Maturation rate was then calculated per treatment group.

Oocytes treated with THC1 showed no significant change in maturation rate (49/95, 52%, p = 0.6704), while THC2 exhibited a non-significant trend toward increased maturation (54/93, 58%, p = 0.1098), compared to Ctrl (44/96, 46%) (Fig. 2b). Utilizing timelapse imaging, oocyte morphology assessments were performed pre-IVM (Ctrl: n = 92, THC1: n = 89 and THC2: n = 85) and post-IVM (Ctrl: n = 91, THC1: n = 88, and THC2: n = 83), and key maturation events were recorded: GVBD (Ctrl: n = 71, THC1: n = 72 and THC2: n = 64) and extrusion of the first polar body (Ctrl: n = 28, THC1: n = 30 and THC2: n = 31). Examples of timelapse IVM images are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 and corresponding videos are provided as Supplementary videos (Ctrl-Supplementary video 1, THC1-Supplementary video 2 and THC2- Supplementary video 3). There were no significant differences in oocyte diameter between treatment groups either before (Ctrl: 110.6 μm, THC1: 109.6 μm, p = 0.2120 and THC2: 109.6 μm, p = 0.2120) (Fig. 2c) or after 24 h of culture (Ctrl: 110.2 μm, THC1: 110.0 μm, p = 0.7416 and THC2: 108.8 μm, p = 0.1066). (Fig. 2d). Similarly, the timing of GVBD (Fig. 2e) and polar body extrusion (Fig. 2f) remained unaffected by THC exposure. Demographic data of patients included in these analyses can be found in Supplementary Information - Supplementary Table 1.

Single MII oocytes with good morphology and normal developmental progression were sequenced using our optimized ultra-low input RNA sequencing pipeline33 (n = 24 patients/n = 86 metaphase-II (MII) oocytes (28 Ctrl, 27 THC1 and 31 THC2). Differential expression analysis revealed 89 genes up-regulated and 227 genes down-regulated greater than 2-fold (|log2FC| > 1) and p < 0.05 (Fig. 3a) when assessing the impact of the THC1 vs Ctrl (Supplementary Data 1). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified that upregulated genes were principally associated with positive regulation of synaptic transmission, axonemal dynein complex assembly, and glutamate receptor signaling pathway, while the downregulated genes were associated with protein synthesis, expression regulation of SLITS and ROBOS and inflammatory processes (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 3). THC2 exposure induced a greater magnitude of transcriptomic dysregulation, with 402 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated genes identified (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Data 2). The upregulated genes were associated with the immune system and apoptotic pathways while downregulated genes were associated with attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and inflammatory processes (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Data 3). As illustrated by the Venn diagram (Fig. 3e), THC1 exposure had 266 specific DEGs, while THC2 exposure had 414, with 50 being common to both treatment groups (gene lists are available in Supplementary Data 4). Of these 50 common DEGs, 32 were protein-coding, 19 were up-regulated (EPYC, RGS5, N4BP2L1, KRT19, PRR20G, KL, KCND3, ALDH3A1, SLC1A3, TSPAN8, PLAU, COL8A2, TFAP2E, SPTSSB, BRINP3, VANGL2, RGS18, RXFP1, and KCNMB3), 10 were down-regulated (OR4F15, MMP9, PRRX2, IRS4, INFG, CCIN, IL33, NEUROD1, MT1HL1, and MT1H), and 3 displayed bidirectional changes (S100B, ACTA1, and ARHGEF19) (Fig. 3f) (Detailed information available in Supplementary Data 5). Demographic data of patients included in these analyses can be found in Supplementary Information - Supplementary Table 2 and Sequencing Quality Control metrics can be found in Supplementary Data 6.

DEGs were defined by p < 0.05 (twp-sided Wald test resulting in unadjusted p-values) and log2fold change (|log2FC)| > 1, n = 24 patients/n = 86 metaphase-II (MII) oocytes (28 Ctrl, 27 THC1 and 31 THC2). Significant pathways were defined as having a normalized enrichment score (|NES|) > 1.5 and p < 0.05 (two-sided permutation test resulting in unadjusted p-values).

Subsets of MII oocytes from both the control and THC-treatment groups were used to assess polar body ploidy status (18 Ctrl, 21 THC1, and 21 THC2) and for spindle morphology (12 Ctrl, 12 THC1, and 12 THC2). Removal of the zona pellucida (ZP) and subsequent polar body biopsy (Supplementary Fig. 2) allowed for some oocytes to be used for ploidy determination by low-pass whole genome Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) aneuploidy using VeriSeq PGT-A which is specialized in detecting aneuploidy in reproductive samples21,34 (Supplementary Fig. 3) and meiotic spindle organization by confocal microscopy allowing for precise visualization of spindle organization and chromosome alignment (Fig. 4a). Both THC1 and THC2 treatment led to a 9% increase in aneuploidy (Ctrl: 39%, THC1 and THC2: 48%, p = 0.7479) (Fig. 4b) and a higher proportion of complex aneuploidy, defined by the gain or loss of more than three chromosomes35 (Ctrl: 0%, THC1 and THC2: 42%, p = 0.1029) (Fig. 4c). Figure 4d reports a subset of oocytes where both ploidy status and spindle morphology were assessed (n = 17), without stratifying by treatment group. The majority of oocytes that completed meiosis I displayed normal spindle morphology (euploid: n = 8/13, 62% and aneuploid: n = 3/4, 75%, p > 0.9999) (Fig. 4d), but not all. The hallmark characteristics of “normal” meiotic spindles include bipolar barrel-shaped microtubules with the chromosomes aligned on the metaphase plate36. Whereas “abnormal” spindles are varied in their morphology and may include multipolar spindles, alterations in microtubule organization, and misaligned chromosomes36. Spindle disorganization and chromosome misalignment are shown by representative images in Fig. 4e, where oocytes were classified as having either “normal” or “abnormal” spindles. The proportion of oocytes with abnormal spindles was higher in the THC exposed groups compared to control (Ctrl (5/12), THC1 8/12), and THC2 (11/12), with a significant increase in THC2 (Ctrl: 42% and THC2: 92%, p = 0.0272) (Fig. 4f).

Following pairwise case-control matching, where each THC-positive sample was matched to two THC-negative samples, a significant decrease in embryo euploidy rate was observed in the THC-positive group (n = 51, 60.0%), compared to the THC-negative group (n = 101, 67.0%, p = 0.0245) (Table 1). There was no significant change in maturation, fertilization and blastocyst rates (Table 1).

To further evaluate the likelihood of adverse IVF outcomes, we conducted multiple logistic regression analyses, focusing on clinically relevant IVF outcome thresholds37: maturation rate (80%), fertilization rate (70%), blastocyst rate (50%) and euploidy rate (60%). We utilized backward stepwise logistic regression, including the following covariates: oocyte age, participant body mass index (BMI), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), day 2/3 luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), (estradiol) E2 on trigger, and total gonadotropin (GT) dose. The final model for both blastulation and euploidy rates retained THC status as a significant explanatory variable, with oocyte age being a significant covariate. In this pairwise matched cohort, THC positivity significantly decreased the odds of reaching a 50% blastulation rate or above (odds ratio: 0.45, p = 0.018) and the odds of achieving a euploidy rate above 60% (odds ratio: 0.47, p = 0.038) (Table 2). Age was also found to significantly impact blastulation and euploidy rates, with an odds ratio of 0.9144 (p = 0.0010) and 0.9150 (p = 0.0024), respectively. The models for predicting blastulation rate (>50%) and euploidy rate (>60%) demonstrated positive predictive power, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.68 and 0.67, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Understanding the impact of environmental factors and lifestyle choices on female fertility is crucial for proper patient counseling. With cannabis being one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in the world1, it is critical to holistically evaluate its impact on mental and general health, in addition to reproductive health. This study, using donated human oocytes and an integrated multidisciplinary approach, reveals that exposure to THC affects oocyte maturation, transcriptome, and induces meiotic chromosomal imbalances associated with altered spindle morphology. Moreover, our retrospective analysis revealed that exposure to THC was associated with significantly lower embryo euploidy rate, likely partially explained by an altered chromosomal organization as demonstrated in the in vitro matured MII oocytes.

In our retrospective study, we measured THC concentrations in 1059 follicular fluid samples from patients undergoing IVF treatment at CReATe Fertility Centre (Toronto, Canada) in a retrospective matched case-control cohort. Sixty-two samples tested positive for 11-COOH-THC, resulting in a 6% positivity rate (Fig. 1a). This rate is considerably lower than what was reported by a recent Health Canada survey where 23% of females reported recreational cannabis consumption within 1 year of being surveyed38. However, these patients were counseled pre-treatment not to use recreational drugs while undergoing IVF. The relative concentrations of Δ9-THC, 11-OH-THC, and 11-COOH-THC are consistent with metabolism of THC in the liver (Fig. 1b). Δ9-THC (half-life 1.3–10 days) is metabolized to 11-OH-THC (half-life 20 min–2 h) and 11-OH-THC is rapidly metabolized to 11-COOH-THC (half-life 3–5 days), which remains in the circulation for up to 30 days39. The consistent concentrations of THC metabolites in both the follicular fluid and serum suggests passive diffusion or transudation from the bloodstream into follicular fluid rather than active transport into or out of the follicle (Fig. 1c).

In a clinical IVF setting, embryologists and physicians assess mature oocytes based on the extrusion of the first polar body30,40. This process, known as nuclear maturation, marks the oocyte's progression to metaphase-II and is considered the final stage of oocyte maturation30,41. When we compiled the IVF outcomes of our retrospective cohort, we observed a positive correlation between THC metabolites and oocyte maturation (Fig. 1d). This suggests that the levels of THC and its metabolites present in this cohort may support nuclear maturation through an unknown mechanism.

Parallel to our clinical retrospective study, we treated pairwise-matched immature oocytes from patients who were negative for THC (naive GVs) with THC in vitro and we observed an increased proportion of oocytes which achieved the MII stage (Fig. 2b). Given that factors such as oocyte diameter have been previously reported to influence nuclear maturation42, we confirmed that there were no differences in oocyte size distribution across the three groups (Ctrl, THC1 and THC2) before and after culture for 24 h (Fig. 2c, d). Finally, we also monitored and recorded the timing of key maturation events using timelapse imaging technology and showed that the GVBD occurred slightly faster in THC treated oocytes (Fig. 2e), but this did not reach significance, and there were no differences in the timing of the first polar body extrusion between THC-exposed and Ctrl groups (Fig. 2f). Previous animal studies investigated the impact of THC on oocyte maturation using bovine oocytes29, which is considered a better proxy to human oocyte maturation when compared to murine model due to similar temporal dynamics. López-Cardona et al. reported a 15% increase in maturation rate after treating oocytes with 0.1 µM (31.45 ng/mL) Δ9-THC for 12 h (n = 30/group)29. In contrast, a more recent and larger study (n = 164/group) concluded that a 24 h treatment with ‘recreational cannabis doses' of 0.32 µM (100.63 ng/mL) and 3.2 µM (1,006.30 ng/mL) of Δ9-THC significantly reduced oocyte maturation from 80.1% to 65.3% and 60.1%, respectively25. Of note, the latter study used higher doses of Δ9-THC than what is measured in the FF of our patients but neither study examined the combined effects of Δ9-THC and its metabolites, which might alter its effect on the growing oocyte. Collectively, our results suggest that THC exposure, at both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations, appears to accelerate oocyte maturation speed and completion, consistent with results from the Lόpez-Cardona bovine study29 and previous mouse studies26.

Oocytes must not only successfully progress through meiosis II to reach metaphase-II but also need sufficient time to reach cytoplasmic maturity to support early embryo development30,41. This process involves the precise and faithful packaging of various components, including maternal mRNA transcripts. mRNA production and storage in the ooplasm is critical, since, following establishment of the germinal vesicle, chromatin is condensed, and transcription is halted43,44. These transcripts are critical not only for meiosis resumption and fertilization, but also during the first 3 days of embryonic development45, since the early embryo remains transcriptionally silent, relying entirely on maternally inherited mRNA from the ooplasm to drive cellular processes prior to embryonic genome activation46. The selection and enrichment of critical transcripts in the ooplasm have been described in the literature and are regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. These complex processes involve a sophisticated network of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), polyadenylation factors and RNA translational and degradation machinery, which all regulate the storage, translation, and degradation of oocyte mRNAs46.

To understand how THC affects stored maternal mRNA during oocyte maturation, we identified genes associated with transcripts that were differentially expressed following THC exposure (Fig. 3a, c). Focusing on the common protein-coding transcripts, 32 genes were identified and grouped into nine principal functions: G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, extracellular matrix regulation, embryogenesis, cell-cell communication, inflammation, cytoskeleton, detoxification, transcription factor and ion channels (Supplementary Data 5).

Among these, MMP9 was significantly downregulated in both THC treatment groups. MMP9 encodes for matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) essential for local proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and leukocyte migration47,48,49. In animal models, MMP-9 has well-established role in ovulation and follicle rupture50,51,52, and in mice, protein expression in blastocyst and early embryo is critical for implantation53,54,55,56,57,58. In humans, several studies have investigated its role in implantation using various trophoblast and implantation models59,60,61. Dysregulation of its expression and activity is associated with pregnancy complications and recurrent pregnancy loss62,63,64,65. Moreover, THC has also been shown to decrease MMP-9 expression in human amniotic epithelium66 and endothelial cancer cells67. Thus, downregulation of MMP9 in the ooplasm may negatively contribute to key ovulation events needed for fertilization, embryo development, and implantation.

G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling was also dysregulated following exposure to THC. GPCR signaling is crucial for oocyte growth and maturation, and many GPCRs are present at the oocyte surface, including the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2)27,68. Genes coding for Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS), RGS5 and RGS18, were significantly upregulated following THC treatment in our study. These regulators are known modulate GPCR signal transduction69. RGS5 and RGS18 belong to the RGS R4 family and have been shown to bind with the Gα proteins, thus reducing their inhibitory activity70,71. They have been shown to have a crucial role in the cell processing of the signal coming from the GPCRs72. Although the exact role of RGS5 and RGS18 in oocyte maturation is poorly understood, their upregulation suggests a potential impact on GPCR signaling pathways in response to THC stimulation.

Immune pathways were also overrepresented in both treatment groups compared to controls. For instance, IFNG and IL33 were both significantly downregulated in THC exposed groups. It is well established that tight regulation of inflammatory processes is critical for implantation of the embryo in the endometrium73. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a cytokine widely known for its role in inflammation and the activation of macrophages74. Although its role during oocyte maturation is unclear, IFNγ secretion by the conceptus is essential for implantation in animal models75. On the other hand, Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a cytokine that belongs to the IL-1 family, binds to the ST2 (IL-1RL1) receptor76. In mice, IL-33 was found to be expressed in the oocyte and ST2 in granulosa cells and the uterus77. In humans, altered levels or expression of IL-33 or ST2 in various tissue and sample types were associated with pregnancy complications like preeclampsia78,79,80, preterm birth81,82,83, intrauterine growth restriction84, and miscarriage85. The downregulation of IL-33 we observed in THC-exposed oocytes suggests there may be potential disruption in the inflammatory processes necessary for successful pregnancy.

A significant number of DEGs in THC-exposed oocytes are involved in the cytoskeletal function, including KRT19, COL8A2, ACTA1 and ARHGEF19 (Supplementary Data 5). In addition to these transcriptomic changes, we observed significant alterations to cytoskeleton machinery throughout this study. Indeed, the oocyte's cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment, segregation, and polarity establishment86 and without appropriate formation and regulation of key cytoskeletal functions, the oocyte is vulnerable to chromosomal abnormalities. However, the cytoskeleton-associated DEGs identified in this study have not been previously characterized in oocyte development and thus require further investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of THC on these processes.

Taken together, THC exposure seems to impact critical transcripts involved in key oocyte maturation processes, fertilization, early embryo development and implantation. While these transcriptomic alterations likely result from post-transcriptional processes, the specific mechanisms by which THC affects these processes in human oocytes remains unknown46.

Given the observed increase in nuclear maturation rate and the altered transcriptomic profiles related to chromosome organization, we next investigated the impact of THC on chromosome segregation. Indeed, errors in chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division is the most frequent cause of embryo aneuploidy87, making the faithful establishment of chromosome segregation machinery a critical bottleneck in the production of a chromosomally normal embryo88,89. To investigate oocyte ploidy, we performed polar body biopsy and low-pass whole genome sequencing. Notably, we observed that THC exposure led to a 9% increase in aneuploidy rates (Fig. 4b). Additionally, we observed an increase in the proportion of oocytes with complex aneuploidies (defined as a gain or a loss of 3 or more chromosomes)35 in the THC-treated group compared to controls (Fig. 4c). Aneuploidies are associated with implantation failure, miscarriage, and are incompatible with life90. It has been postulated that most aneuploidies arise from errors in maternal meiosis I91,92,93,94,95,96, but our data suggest that meiosis II may also be sensitive to perturbations as 38% of the euploid oocytes had abnormal spindle morphology (Fig. 4d) determining using confocal microscopy. We assessed spindle morphology after 24 h incubation of oocytes with and without THC. A normal spindle configuration is barrel shaped with chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate, while ‘abnormal' configurations include multipolar spindles and misaligned chromosomes97 (Fig. 4e). In this study, we demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of oocytes with normal spindle morphology following THC exposure (Fig. 4f). Correct chromosome segregation during oocyte maturation is essential for producing euploid embryos, which have the highest chance of establishing a healthy pregnancy98.

To address the primary clinical question regarding THC's impact on IVF outcomes, we used a pairwise case-control matching strategy, where each positive sample was matched to two negative samples based on demographic data, and we compiled the resulting matched cohort's IVF outcomes (Table 1). THC exposure was associated with a marginal increase in maturation rate (Table 1), concordant with what was obtained in our in vitro experimentations (Fig. 2b). Further, a significant decrease in embryo euploidy rate (Table 1) and reduced odds of obtaining a euploidy rate above 60% was observed (Table 2). These results indicate that THC-positive patients may have fewer euploid embryos from their IVF cycle and may experience a longer time to pregnancy.

To deepen our understanding of our findings, we must extrapolate what is known about THC interactions and pathways from other cell types. THC primarily elicits its functions through binding the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors (CB1 and CB2), which are expressed at all stages of oocyte maturation68. CB1 and CB2 are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are capable of inhibiting adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Activation of the CB receptors, through stimulation by THC, could thus lead to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase, resulting in lowering ooplasm cAMP levels99. Adenylate cyclase activity and the constant and high production of cAMP is critical to prevent premature meiotic resumption100. Here, we propose a hypothetical model of action of THC wherein THC binds to CB1/2 activating them, which in turn inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, reducing ooplasm cAMP concentration. Releasing the inhibition of meiotic resumption, would then result in premature resumption of meiosis. This untimely and premature resumption may increase the likelihood of aneuploidy arising in the oocyte and resulting embryo due to the premature separation of chromosomes misaligned on the metaphase plate and an asymmetrical division of the chromosomes into the first polar body. This hypothesis aligns with the correlation between THC concentrations and oocyte maturation rate observed in the retrospective cohort (Fig. 1d) and the increased oocyte maturation rate in vitro, as well as the associated reduction in euploid oocytes (Fig. 4b) and euploid embryo rates (Table 1) we observed. Further investigations are underway to dive deeper into THC signaling in the oocyte and better refine this hypothetical model.

To conclude, this study comprehensively investigates and demonstrate the impact of THC on the human oocyte. Herein, our findings reveal significant effects on oocyte maturation, transcriptomic profiles, meiotic spindle organization, and oocyte ploidy. Collectively, this data presents compelling evidence that cannabis consumption may negatively impact female fertility. Our integrated and multi-faceted in vitro approach, utilizing multiple techniques and endpoints to assess chromosome segregation, is a major strength of this study. However, it was limited by the usage of immature GV oocytes following ovarian hyperstimulation, which are considered suboptimal for reproductive purposes, since they did not mature following initial stimulation. Furthermore, we acknowledge the importance of patient age on the oocyte ability to mature in vitro, but this study was not statistically powered to analyze results based on patient age. This limitation arose because the majority of GV oocytes were retrieved from patients younger than 37 years old (81%). Also, our study focused on identifying changes in the abundance of the pre-stored transcripts in response to THC exposure, rather than de novo transcription, limiting our ability to speculate on the impact of THC on gene expression before the GV stage.

On the other hand, our retrospective cohort objectively measured THC and its metabolites to determine the impact of THC on IVF outcomes, overcoming biases inherent in self-reporting101. Indeed, 73% of our patients positive for THC did not report cannabis use when completing their patient intake questionnaire, potentially due to the persistent stigma of recreational drug consumption. A limitation of our retrospective study is the lack of data on cannabis consumption habits (e.g. frequency, timing, dosage, route of consumption), and our cohort is likely not representative of the general population, as all patients were undergoing IVF for fertility treatment or to altruistically donate their oocytes to intended parents. In addition, FF was not measured for the presence of other drugs, and even though none of the patients reported concomitant use of other drugs, self-reporting alone cannot rule out the exposure of the follicle to these substances. The limitations associated with the retrospective aspect of this study and the other potential contributors (e.g. lifestyle habits) to the observed outcomes are compensated by our in vitro study that used at least three oocytes (one in each exposure group) per patient.

Finally, these findings underscore the need for increased awareness and caution among people with ovaries, particularly those undergoing fertility treatments. Our study highlights the importance of informing patients about the potential risks associated with cannabis consumption and provides a basis for regulatory bodies, medical professional societies, and public health organizations to establish recommendations and guidelines regarding cannabis consumption during fertility treatment.

All patients undergoing ART procedures were provided with the opportunity to participate in the collection, and future use, of biological waste material for research purposes. Patients were provided with an Independent Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent package containing information regarding the types of material that would be collected following consent as well as examples of projects this material may be used for. Patients did not receive compensation or financial benefit for their participation in the collection of biological waste material. All patients included in this study provided informed consent for the donation of their biological waste material, which included follicular fluid (FF) and immature (GV) oocytes as well as associated de-identified demographic and clinical information, including age, Body Mass Index (BMI), ovarian reserve metrics and treatment regimens (Veritas IRB Approval #16487). To be included in the assessment of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on in vitro maturation (IVM), patients must have had 10 or more MII oocytes after stripping and a minimum of 3 GV oocytes in order to have at least one GV oocyte per treatment group. Last, all patients included in the assessment of THC on IVM were confirmed to be negative for THC by LC-MS/MS (described below). Patients were excluded if: they did not meet inclusion criteria, had low oocyte yield (<16 oocytes), low oocyte maturation rate (<62.5%), a previous cycle with poor fertilization rate (<75%) and/or blastulation rate (<40%), severe male factor, advanced maternal age (>40 years old), or who were undergoing fertility preservation (oncofertility and/or social egg freezing). Moreover, if a patient was consented for the donation of their biological waste material but the physician and embryologist deemed rescue-IVM (rIVM) was indicated for their clinical care, no oocytes would be collected for research purposes and patients would be informed of the addition of rIVM to their clinical treatment by the physician or another healthcare professional. All GV oocytes included in this study were collected and underwent IVM between July 2022 and January 2024. The request and use of samples and de-identified demographic and clinical data for this study was approved by Veritas IRB Approval #16518. For the retrospective analysis, FF was collected from all consenting patients undergoing IVF treatment between June 2016 and March 2023. All samples in this study were considered “female” as they are human oocytes which are chromosomally “XX”. Gender, race, ethnicity or other socially relevant groupings were not considered in this study. The purchase, storage and use of Δ9-THC and its metabolites for research purposes was approved by Health Canada and all procedures were conducted in accordance with the ‘Cannabis Act' and ‘Cannabis Regulations' (License #LIC-A4MUR820SB-2020).

Measurements of Δ9-THC, 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC in FF were performed for every patient who donated GV oocytes, as previously described, to exclude patients consuming cannabis for the IVM investigation23. For the retrospective study, FF and matched serum were measured using the same procedure. Briefly, proteins were precipitated using methanol (1:1 v/v), and the supernatants were assessed by LC-MS/MS using a QTRAP 5500 (SCIEZ, Concord, CA, USA) and Agilent 1290 HPLC (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with a calibration curve (0.001–200 ng) of known amount of the molecules of interest. Samples above the lower limit of quantification were considered positive. Cannabinol (CBN) and Cannabidiol (CBD) were also measured in the samples but were undetectable.

GV oocytes were received from consenting patients, randomly split into three groups, and cultured using standard clinical IVM media (SAGE One-step (CooperSurgical, Canada) + 7.5 IU/mL of Menopur (Ferring, Canada)): Ctrl (n = 96, only IVM media), THC1 (n = 95, treated with a physiological concentration of cannabis based on previous measurements of cannabis in FF23: 25 ng/mL Δ9-THC (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada), 5 ng/mL 11-OH-THC (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada), 50 ng/mL 11-COOH-THC (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada)) and THC2 (n = 94, treated with THC at a concentration based on previous animal studies25,27,29: 100 ng/mL Δ9-THC, 50 ng/mL 11-OH-THC, 200 ng/mL 11-COOH-THC). Oocytes were obtained from 24 patients, and their demographic data are reported in the Supplementary Table 1. Images using an inverted bright field microscope were taken prior and following incubation to assess oocyte morphology. Oocytes were cultured for 24 h using the EVOS FL Auto 2 (ThermoFisher, Canada) imaging system or cell culture incubator (5% CO2 and 37 °C). Timelapse images were taken every 15 min and used for the assessment of GVBD and polar body extrusion (Ctrl: Supplementary video 1, THC1: Supplementary video 2 and THC2: Supplementary video 3). After 24 h of culture, oocytes were processed according to the specific endpoint (RNAseq or immunostaining/polar body biopsies).

Oocytes destined for single-cell RNASeq were further stripped of any residual cumulus cells and snap-frozen in 0.2 mL tubes in less than 1 µL phosphate-buffered saline (1 X PBS). To reduce inter-sample variability, we selected patients with similar demographics and stimulation parameters (Supplementary Table 2). A total of 86 oocytes from 24 patients were selected for RNASeq, 28 in Ctrl, 27 in THC1 and 31 in THC2. cDNA from single oocytes were synthesized using the SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). The amplified cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) and eluted. The purified cDNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay (ThermoFisher, Canada) and length and molarity were assessed using the DNF-474 HS NGS Fragment Kit (1-6000 bp) with the Fragment Analyzer 5200 (Agilent Technologies, USA). The amplified cDNA (0.2 ng) was used to construct sequencing libraries using a modified and miniaturized Nextera XT library preparation protocol (Illumina, Canada) developed for the use with the Mosquito HV liquid handling robot (SPT labtech, Boston, USA). The quality of the libraries was assessed using the same Fragment Analyzer kit DNF-474 HS NGS Fragment Kit (1–6000 bp), quantified using Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay (ThermoFisher), normalized and pooled. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S2 flow cell (Illumina, Canada) at Princess Margaret Genomics Centre (2 × 150 bp) (Toronto, Canada). The sequencing quality control metrics are compiled in the Supplementary Data 6.

Raw sequencing reads were trimmed based on read quality (Phred > 28) and aligned and quantified to hg38 using STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference; v2.7.8a)102. Low abundant transcripts were excluded (maximum <20) and normalized using the default normalization method built into DESeq2 (v3.5)103. We conducted differential expression (DE) using DESeq2 comparing THC1 vs. Ctrl and THC2 vs. Ctrl. Significantly differentially expressed genes were defined as p-value  <  0.05 and |log2fold change (FC)| of >1. The complete list of DE genes is available in the Supplementary data 1 (THC1 vs Ctrl) and the Supplementary data 2 (THC2 vs Ctrl)). This analysis was conducted in Partek Flow (version 11.0.23.1004). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)104,105 was conducted to determine what gene sets were impacted by exposure to THC. The resulting pathway list was cross referenced with a custom gene set created and supported by the Bader Lab (University of Toronto) which is comprised of all GO database, KEGG, Reactome, and Wiki pathways gene sets (v2024-01-01) (http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/)106 (Supplementary Data 3) Significant pathways were defined as having a |Normalized Enrichment Score (NES)| > 1.5 and p-value < 0.05.

After 24 h in culture, the zona pellucida (ZP) was removed by incubating (30 s–2 min) with EmbryoMax® Acidic Tyrode's Solution (Millipore Sigma, CA) and polar bodies were mechanically separated from the oocytes. Oocytes were immediately fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PHEM (PIPES 12 mM, HEPES 5 mM, EGTA 2 mM and MgSO4・7H2O 0.8 mM, pH 6.9) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and then permeabilized in PHEM + 0.25% Triton-X for 15 min at RT. After permeabilization, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 0.05% Tween-20 in 1X PBS). On the next day, the plate was brought to RT before transferring the oocytes in the primary antibody solution for 1 h at 37 °C (mouse anti-ɑ-Tubulin (1:250), T6199, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Then, the oocytes were washed three times in the wash solution (0.5% BSA + 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) at RT and moved in the secondary antibody solution for 2 h at 37 °C (goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (1:200), A-11001, Invitrogen, USA and Phalloidin AlexaFluor 555 (1:500) (A34055, Invitrogen, USA). After secondary antibody solution, the oocytes were washed three times in the wash solution and transferred into Hoechst 33342 (1:500) for 30 min. Finally, the oocytes were transferred into 1.5 µL drops in an imaging dish (Nunc Glass Bottom Dish, ThermoScientific, CA) covered with paraffin oil and 0.2 µm z-stacks were captured using Leica SP8 confocal microscope using the 63× objective with oil and a zoom factor set at 8 at the Advanced Optical Microscopy Facility (Toronto, Canada). Deconvolution was applied on the images using Huygens software version 23.10 (https://svi.nl/Huygens-Software) and images were visualized using ImarisViewer 10.1.1. Negative controls consisted of GV oocytes to observe the absence of spindle structure and stained MII-oocytes without the mouse anti-ɑ-Tubulin primary antibody (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Polar bodies were separated from the oocytes after removal of the ZP eliminating possible somatic cell contamination (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 3). Polar bodies were individually snap-frozen at −80 °C in less than 2 µL and blinded samples were sent for whole genome chromosome copy number variation assessment (CNV) to the CReATe Reproductive Genetics sequencing platform. CNV analysis was performed by low-pass whole genome Next Generation Sequencing using validated clinical workflow on Illumina platform. Briefly, gDNA was amplified using SurePlex Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) (Illumina, CA), according to manufacturer's instructions. Amplified gDNA was then tagmented and indexed using Nextera XT (Illumina, CA). The indexed libraries were purified using AMPure XP beads (1:1 ratio) and normalized using magnetic beads. The normalized libraries were pooled, denatured, and sequenced on a NextSeq 550 (paired end, 2 × 75 bp). NxClinical version 6.0 (Bionano, CA) was used for chromosome CNV analysis and data visualization according to our standard clinical procedure (2 million reads/sample, CNV resolution of >10 Mb). Optimization experimentations demonstrated the concordance between polar body chromosome numbers and its sister oocyte (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Datasets were first assessed for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Statistical significance was determined using two-sided Fisher's exact test for contingency analysis (maturation rate, spindle morphology and euploid rates), One-way ANOVA with a two-sided Holm–Sidak's multiple comparison test for continuous normally distributed datasets (oocyte diameter), or Kruskal–Wallis with a two-sided Dunn's multiple comparison test for continuous non-normally distributed datasets. The specific statistical test is indicated throughout table and figure legends. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. For the retrospective analysis, we performed pairwise case-control matching, where each THC-positive sample was matched to two THC-negative samples, as determined by the presence/absence of 11-COOH-THC in the FF. Matching was conducted using the FUZZY matching command in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS-v29) based on the following covariates: oocyte age, participant body mass index (BMI), anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), day 2/3 luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), (estradiol) E2 on trigger, and total gonadotropin (GT) dose. AMH, LH, FSH and E2 were quantified during the clinical assessment using the Cobas e411 instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Matching success was determined using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric distribution. Statistical significance of the IVF outcomes was determined using two-tailed Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric distribution (fertilization and euploid rates) and unpaired two-tailed t-test for parametric distribution (maturation and blastocyst rates) using GraphPad Prism 10.2.3. Numbers in parentheses in each figure legends represent distinct samples and not repeated measures.

Our brains seem to respond to specific colours in a similar way. Credit: Hispanolistic/Getty

Is the colour you see the same as what I see? It's a question that has puzzled both philosophers and neuroscientists for decades, but has proved notoriously difficult to answer.

Now, a study that recorded patterns of brain activity in 15 participants suggests that colours are represented and processed in the same way in the brains of different people. The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience on 8 September1.

“Now we know that when you see red or green or whatever colour, that it activates your brain very similarly to my brain,” says study co-author Andreas Bartels, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Tubingen and the Max Planck Institute, both in Tubingen, Germany. “Even at a very low level, things are represented similarly across different brains, and that is a fundamentally new discovery.”

Bartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is across different people.

The pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of participants while they viewed different colours. This allowed them to create a map of brain activity that showed how each hue was represented neurologically. They then trained a machine learning model called a linear classifier on this data, and used it to predict which colours were being viewed by members of a second group of study participants, on the basis of their brain activity.

Phenotype-driven approaches identify disease-counteracting compounds by analysing the phenotypic signatures that distinguish diseased from healthy states. Here we introduce PDGrapher, a causally inspired graph neural network model that predicts combinatorial perturbagens (sets of therapeutic targets) capable of reversing disease phenotypes. Unlike methods that learn how perturbations alter phenotypes, PDGrapher solves the inverse problem and predicts the perturbagens needed to achieve a desired response by embedding disease cell states into networks, learning a latent representation of these states, and identifying optimal combinatorial perturbations. In experiments in nine cell lines with chemical perturbations, PDGrapher identifies effective perturbagens in more testing samples than competing methods. It also shows competitive performance on ten genetic perturbation datasets. An advantage of PDGrapher is its direct prediction, in contrast to the indirect and computationally intensive approach common in phenotype-driven models. It trains up to 25× faster than existing methods, providing a fast approach for identifying therapeutic perturbations and advancing phenotype-driven drug discovery.

Target-driven drug discovery, which has been the dominant approach since the 1990s, focuses on designing highly specific compounds to act against targets, such as proteins or enzymes, that are implicated in disease, often through genetic evidence1,2,3. An example of target-driven drug discovery is the development of small molecule kinase inhibitors like imatinib. Imatinib stops the progression of chronic myeloid leukaemia by inhibiting BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, a mutated protein involved in uncontrolled proliferation of leukocytes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia4. Other notable examples include monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab, which specifically targets the HER2 receptor, a protein overexpressed in certain types of breast cancer. Trastuzumab inhibits cell proliferation while engaging the body's immune system to initiate an anti-cancer response5. These examples illustrate the success of target-driven drug discovery, yet the past decade has seen a revival of phenotype-driven approaches. This shift has been fuelled by the observation that many first-in-class drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1999 and 2008 were discovered without a drug target hypothesis6. Instead of the ‘one drug, one gene, one disease' model of target-driven approaches, phenotype-driven drug discovery focuses on identifying compounds or, more broadly, perturbagens—combinations of therapeutic targets—that reverse disease phenotypes as measured by assays without predefined targets1,7. Ivacaftor illustrates how these approaches can intersect. Although ivacaftor was developed through a target-driven strategy to modulate the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein in individuals with specific mutations, its development relied on phenotypic assays to confirm functional improvements, such as increased chloride transport8,9,10.

Phenotype-driven drug discovery has been bolstered by the advent of chemical and genetic libraries such as the Connectivity Map (CMap)11 and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)12. CMap and LINCS contain gene expression profiles of dozens of cell lines treated with thousands of genetic and chemical perturbagens. CMap introduced connectivity scores to quantify similarities between compound responses and disease gene expression signatures. Identifying compounds with gene expression signatures either similar to those of known disease-treating drugs or that counter disease signatures can help in selecting therapeutic leads13,14,15,16. These strategies have successfully identified drugs with high in vitro efficacy16 across a range of diseases17,18,19.

Deep learning methods have been used for lead discovery by predicting gene expression responses to perturbagens, including perturbagens that were not yet experimentally tested20,21,22,23. However, these approaches rely on chemical and genetic libraries, meaning that they select perturbagens from predefined libraries and cannot identify perturbagens as new combinations of drug targets. Further, they are perturbation response methods that predict changes in phenotypes upon perturbations. Thus, they can identify perturbagens by exhaustively predicting responses to all perturbations in the library and then searching for perturbagens with the desired response. Unlike existing methods that learn responses to perturbations, phenotype-based approaches need to solve the inverse problem, which is to infer perturbagens necessary to achieve a specific response—that is, directly predicting perturbagens by learning which perturbations elicit a desired response.

In causal discovery, the problem of identifying which elements of a system should be perturbed to achieve a desired state is referred to as optimal intervention design24,25,26. Using insights from causal discovery and geometric deep learning, here we introduce PDGrapher, an approach for the combinatorial prediction of therapeutic targets that can shift gene expression from an initial diseased state to a desired treated state. PDGrapher is formulated using a causal model in which genes represent the nodes in a causal graph and structural causal equations define their causal relationships. Given a genetic or chemical intervention dataset, PDGrapher pinpoints a set of genes that a perturbagen should target to facilitate the transition of node states from diseased to treated. PDGrapher uses protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks or gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as approximations of the causal graph, operating under the assumption of no unobserved confounders. PDGrapher tackles the optimal intervention design using representation learning, using a graph neural network (GNN) to represent structural equations.

PDGrapher is trained on a dataset of disease–treated sample pairs to predict therapeutic gene targets that can shift the gene expression phenotype from a diseased to a healthy or treated state. Once trained, PDGrapher processes a new diseased sample and outputs a perturbagen—a set of therapeutic targets—predicted to counteract the disease effects in that specific sample. We evaluate PDGrapher across 19 datasets, comprising genetic and chemical interventions across 11 cancer types and two proxy causal graphs. We also consider different evaluation set-ups, including settings where held-out folds contain new samples in the same cell line with the training samples, and settings where held-out folds contain new samples from a cancer type that PDGrapher has never encountered during training. In held-out folds that contain new samples, PDGrapher detects up to 13.37% and 1.09% more ground-truth therapeutic targets in chemical and genetic intervention datasets, respectively, than existing methods. We also find that in chemical intervention datasets, candidate therapeutic targets predicted by PDGrapher are on average up to 11.58% closer to ground-truth therapeutic targets in the gene–gene interaction network than what would be expected by chance. Even in held-out folds containing new samples from a previously unseen cancer type, PDGrapher maintains robust performance. Unlike methods that indirectly identify perturbagens by predicting cell responses, PDGrapher directly predicts perturbagens that can shift gene expression from diseased to treated states. This feature of PDGrapher enables model training up to 25× faster than indirect prediction methods, such as scGen22 and CellOT27. As these approaches build a separate model for each perturbation, they become increasingly ineffective when applied to datasets with a large number of perturbagens. For example, with its default settings, CellOT needs 10 h to train for a single perturbagen in a cell line from the LINCS dataset.

PDGrapher can aid in elucidating the mechanism of action of chemical perturbagens (Supplementary Fig. 3), which we show in the case of vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor used to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used in the treatment of several types of cancer (Supplementary Note 1). PDGrapher can also suggest potential anti-cancer therapeutic targets: it highlighted kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) as a top predicted target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; see ‘ PDGrapher identifies therapeutic targets validated through clinical and biological evidence' in Results). It identified associated drugs—vandetanib, sorafenib, catequentinib and rivoceranib—that inhibit the kinase activity of the protein encoded by KDR. These drugs block VEGF signalling, suppressing endothelial cell proliferation, migration and blood vessel formation, which tumours rely on for growth and metastasis28,29. By predicting combinatorial therapeutic targets based on phenotypic transitions, PDGrapher provides a scalable approach to phenotype-driven perturbation modelling.

We evaluate our method across a total of 38 preprocessed datasets that span 2 types of intervention (genetic and chemical), 11 cancer types (lung, breast, prostate, colon, skin, cervical, head and neck, pancreatic, stomach, brain and ovarian), and 2 types of proxy causal graph: PPI networks and GRNs. Each dataset is uniquely defined by a combination of intervention type, causal graph type, cancer type, and cell line, and is denoted in the format: treatment type-graph type-cancer type-cell line. The chemical-PPI datasets include cell lines A549 (lung); MCF7, MDAMB231 and BT20 (breast); PC3 and VCAP (prostate); HT29 (colon); A375 (skin); and HELA (cervix). The genetic-PPI datasets include A549 (lung), MCF7 (breast), PC3 (prostate), HT29 (colon), A375 (skin), ES2 (ovary), BICR6 (head and neck), YAPC (pancreas), AGS (stomach) and U251MG (brain). Similarly, the chemical-GRN and genetic-GRN datasets span the same combinations of cancer types and cell lines as their PPI counterparts. This comprehensive collection of datasets enables systematic benchmarking of our model across diverse perturbation modalities, biological contexts and graph structures. Genetic interventions are single-gene knockout experiments by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockouts, while chemical interventions are multiple-gene treatments induced using chemical compounds. We use a PPI network from BIOGRID that has 10,716 nodes and 151,839 undirected edges. We additionally construct GRNs for each disease-treatment type pair using GENIE3 (ref. 30) (Supplementary Note 3), with GRNs on average having 10,000 nodes and 500,000 directed edges. The training data for PDGrapher consist of two components: disease intervention data and treatment intervention data. Disease intervention data include paired healthy and diseased gene expression profiles, along with associated disease genes; however, these data are only available for cell lines corresponding to lung, breast and prostate cancers. In contrast, the treatment intervention data comprise paired diseased and treated gene expression samples, along with genetic or chemical perturbagens, and are available across all datasets. Supplementary Tables 11 and 12 summarize the number of samples for each cell line and intervention datasets.

Given a diseased cell state (gene expression profile), the goal of PDGrapher is to predict the genes that, if targeted by a perturbagen, would shift the cell to a treated state (Fig. 1a). Unlike methods for learning the response of cells to a given perturbation22,27,31,32, PDGrapher focuses on the inverse problem by learning which perturbation elicits a desired response. PDGrapher predicts perturbagens that shift cellular states under the assumption that an optimal perturbagen is one that alters the gene expression profile of a cell to closely match a desired target state. Our approach comprises two modules (Fig. 1a–c). First, a perturbagen discovery module ƒp takes the initial and desired cell states and outputs a candidate perturbagen as a set of therapeutic targets \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) (Fig. 1a). Then, a response prediction module ƒr takes the initial state and the predicted perturbagen \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) and predicts the cell response upon perturbing genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) (Fig. 1b). Our response prediction and perturbagen discovery modules are GNN models that operate on a proxy causal graph, where edge mutilations, or edge removals, represent the effects of interventions on the graph (Fig. 1c).

a, Given a paired diseased and treated gene expression sample and a proxy causal graph, PDGrapher's perturbagen discovery module, ƒp, predicts a candidate set of therapeutic targets to shift cell gene expression from a diseased to a treated state. b, Given a disease sample's gene expression, a proxy causal graph and a set of perturbagens, PDGrapher's response prediction module, ƒr, predicts the gene expression response of the sample to each perturbagen. ƒr represents perturbagen's effects in the graph as edge mutilations. c, ƒp is optimized using two losses: a cross-entropy cycle loss to predict a perturbagen \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) that aims to shift the diseased cell state closely approximating the treated state, \({\rm{CE}}\left({{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}},\,{f}_{\rm{r}}({{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},\,{f}_{\rm{p}}({{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},\,{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}}))\right)\,\,({\rm{with}}\,{f}_{\rm{r}}\,{\rm{frozen}})\), and a cross-entropy supervision loss that directly supervises the prediction of \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\), \({\rm{CE}}\left({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{f}_{\rm{p}}({{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},\,{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}})\right)\) (see Methods for more details). d, Both ƒr and ƒp follow the standard message-passing framework, where node representations are updated by aggregating the information from neighbours in the graph. GEX, gene expression.

PDGrapher is trained using an objective function with two components, one for each module, ƒr and ƒp. The response prediction module ƒr is trained using disease and treatment intervention data on cell state transitions so that the predicted cell states are close to the known perturbed cell states upon interventions. The perturbagen discovery module ƒp is trained only using the treatment intervention data; given a diseased cell state, ƒp predicts the set of therapeutic targets \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) that caused the corresponding treated cell state. The objective function for the perturbagen discovery module consists of two elements: (1) a cycle loss that optimizes the parameters of ƒp such that the response upon intervening on the predicted genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\), as measured by ƒr, closely approximates the actual treated cellular state; and (2) a supervision loss on the therapeutic target set \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) that directly pushes PDGrapher to predict the correct perturbagen. Both models are trained simultaneously using early stopping independently so that each model finishes training upon convergence.

When trained, PDGrapher predicts perturbagens—as sets of candidate target genes—to shift cells from diseased to treated. Given a pair of diseased and treated samples, PDGrapher directly predicts perturbagens by learning which perturbations elicit target responses. In contrast, existing approaches are perturbation response methods that predict changes in phenotype that occur upon perturbation; thus, they can only indirectly predict perturbagens (Fig. 2a). Given a disease–treated sample pair, a response prediction module (such as scGen22, ChemCPA23, Biolord33, GEARS34 or CellOT27) is used to predict the response of the diseased sample to a library of perturbagens. The predicted perturbagen is the one that produces a response that is the most similar to the treated sample. We evaluate PDGrapher's performance in two separate settings (Fig. 2b,c): (1) a random splitting setting, where the samples are split randomly between training and test sets within a cell line (denoted as random for convenience); and (2) a leave-cell-out setting, where PDGrapher is trained in one cell line, and its performance is evaluated in a cell line the model never encountered during training to test how well the model generalizes to a new disease. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 show the numbers of unseen perturbagens in chemical perturbation datasets in the random and leave-cell-out splits, respectively; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 show the number of unseen perturbagens in genetic perturbation datasets in the random and leave-cell-out splits, respectively.

a, Given a dataset with paired diseased and treated samples and a set of perturbagens, PDGrapher makes a direct prediction of candidate perturbagens that shift gene expression from a diseased to a treated state for each disease–treated sample pair. The direct prediction means that PDGrapher directly infers the perturbation necessary to achieve a specific response. In contrast to direct prediction of perturbagens, existing methods predict perturbagens only indirectly through a two-stage approach. For a given diseased sample, the model learns the response to each candidate perturbagen from an existing library and identifies the perturbagen whose induced response most closely approximates the desired treated state. Existing methods learn the response of cells to a given perturbation22,27,31,32, whereas PDGrapher focuses on the inverse problem by learning which perturbagen elicits a given response, even in the most challenging cases when the combinatorial composition of perturbagen was never seen before. b,c, We evaluate PDGrapher's performance across two settings: given a cell line, randomly splitting samples between training and testing set (b), and by splitting samples based on cell lines, where the model is trained on one cell line and evaluated on a different, previously unseen cell line to assess PDGrapher's generalization performance (c).

In the random splitting setting, we assess the ability of PDGrapher for combinatorial prediction of therapeutic targets across chemical PPI datasets (chemical-PPI-lung-A549, chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7, chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231, chemical-PPI-breast-BT20, chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3, chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP, chemical-PPI-colon-HT29, chemical-PPI-skin-A375 and chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA). Specifically, we measure whether, given paired diseased–treated gene expression samples, PDGrapher can predict the set of therapeutic genes targeted by the chemical compound in the diseased sample to generate the treated sample. Given paired diseased–treated gene expression samples, PDGrapher ranks genes in the dataset according to their likelihood of being therapeutic targets.

We quantify the ranking quality using normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), where the gain reflects the ranking accuracy of the model. An nDCG value close to one indicates highly accurate predictions, with the top ranked gene targets closely matching the ground-truth targets, whereas lower nDCG values indicate poorer ranking performance. This metric provides a normalized and scalable measure of ranking quality, enabling consistent comparison across different datasets and models. PDGrapher outperforms competing methods in all cell lines, achieving nDCG values that are higher than the second-best competing method by 0.02 (chemical-PPI-lung-A549), 0.13 (chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231), 0.03 (chemical-PPI-breast-BT20), 0.004 (chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7), 0.07 (chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP), 0.005 (chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3), 0.03 (chemical-PPI-skin-A375), 0.06 (chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA) and 0.001 (chemical-PPI-colon-HT29) (Fig. 3b). In addition to evaluating the entire predicted target rank, it is even more practically crucial to assess the accuracy of the top ranked predicted targets. As perturbagens target multiple genes, we measure the fraction of samples in the test set for which we obtain a partially accurate prediction, where at least one of the top N predicted gene targets corresponds to an actual gene target (denoted as the percentage of accurately predicted samples). Here, N represents the number of known target genes of a perturbagen. PDGrapher consistently provides accurate predictions for more samples in the test set than competing methods. Specifically, it outperforms the second-best competing method by predicting ground-truth targets in an additional 7.73% (chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7), 9.32% (chemical-PPI-lung-A549), 13.37% (chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231), 4.50% (chemical-PPI-breast-BT20), 7.88% (chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3), 11.53% (chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP), 7.56% (chemical-PPI-colon-HT29), 9.55% (chemical-PPI-skin-A375) and 8.41% (chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA) of samples (Fig. 3a). We also evaluate the performance of PDGrapher using recall@1, recall@10 and recall@100, which calculate the ratio of true target genes included in the top 1, top 10 and top 100 predicted gene targets, respectively. Although the absolute recall values are modest due to the inherent difficulty of the task, PDGrapher consistently outperforms all competing methods, showing its relative strength and robustness. Specifically, PDGrapher outperforms the second-best method in all the recall metrics with the averaged margin being 3.31% (chemical-PPI-lung-MCF7), 3.28% (chemical-PPI-lung-A549), 11.65% (chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231), 7.27% (chemical-PPI-breast-BT20), 2.50% (chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3), 9.53% (chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP), 3.08% (chemical-PPI-colon-HT29), 2.87% (chemical-PPI-skin-A375) and 5.13% (chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA) (Fig. 3c). We then consolidated the results using the rankings from experiments across different cell lines and metrics for each method. PDGrapher achieved the best overall rankings, with a median significantly higher than all competing methods (Fig. 3d). P values of the chemical perturbagen discovery tests are provided in the Source data.

a,b, PDGrapher shows improved performance across nine chemical perturbation datasets with various diseases, yielding up to 13.37% more accurately predicted samples in the testing sets compared with the second-best model (for example, for chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231, 20.43% versus 7.05% (a)) and up to 0.13 higher nDCG than the second-best model (for chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231, 0.31 versus 0.18 (b)). In a and b, the bars show the average performance across five cross-validation test splits for each of the nine chemical datasets. The overlaid points represent performance values from individual data splits (n = 5 per cell line). Each data split contains 20% of samples in the dataset, with each sample corresponding to a perturbation-response instance. Where replicates exist for a given drug, they are treated as independent inputs during training and evaluation. c, PDGrapher recovers ground-truth therapeutic targets at higher rates (evaluated by recall 1–100) compared with competing methods for chemical-PPI datasets. d, Box plots show the distribution of average model rankings across 9 cell lines (n = 9); each dot corresponds to the aggregated ranking value across cross-validation splits and across all metrics for a distinct cell line. A higher value indicates better performance. The central line inside the box represents the median, while the top and bottom edges correspond to the first and third quartiles. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5× the interquartile range from the quartiles. Each dot represents a data point for a specific cell line. P values from the statistical tests are provided in the Source data. e, Shown is the difference of shortest-path distances between ground-truth therapeutic genes and predicted genes by PDGrapher and a random reference across nine cell lines. Predominantly negative values indicate that PDGrapher predicts sets of therapeutic genes that are closer in the network to ground-truth therapeutic genes compared with what would be expected by chance (average shortest-path distances across cell lines for PDGrapher versus reference = 2.77 versus 3.11).

Source data

PDGrapher not only provides accurate predictions for a larger proportion of samples and consistently predicts ground-truth therapeutic targets close to the top of the ranked list but it also predicts gene targets that are closer in the network (measured by the shortest-path distance) to ground-truth targets compared with what would be expected by chance (Fig. 3e). In all cell lines, the ground-truth therapeutic targets predicted by PDGrapher are significantly closer to the ground-truth targets compared with what would be expected by chance (Supplementary Table 6). For example, for chemical-PPI-lung-A549, the median distance between the predicted and ground-truth therapeutic targets is 3.0 for both PDGrapher and the random reference. However, the distributions show a statistically significant difference, with a 1-sided Mann–Whitney U-test that yields P < 0.001, an effect size (rank-biserial correlation) of 0.3531 (95% confidence interval (CI), [0.3515, 0.3549]) and a U-statistic of 1.29 × 1011. Similarly, for chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7, the median distance is 3.0 for both groups, yet the distributions are significantly different (P < 0.001, effect size = 0.2160 (95% CI, [0.2146, 0.2174]), U-statistic = 3.91 × 1011) (Supplementary Table 6). This finding suggests that PDGrapher predicts targets in a manner that reflects PPI network structure32. According to the local network hypothesis, which posits that genes in closer network proximity tend to be more functionally similar, PDGrapher's predictions are more functionally related to ground-truth targets than would be expected by chance35,36,37.

PDGrapher also shows strong performance across genetic datasets, specifically genetic-PPI-lung-A549, genetic-PPI-breast-MCF7, genetic-PPI-prostate-PC3, genetic-PPI-skin-A375, genetic-PPI-colon-HT29, genetic-PPI-ovary-ES2, genetic-PPI-head-BICR6, genetic-PPI-pancreas-YAPC, genetic-PPI-stomach-AGS and genetic-PPI-brain-U251MG (Extended Data Fig. 2). Briefly, PDGrapher successfully detected ground-truth targets in 0.87% (genetic-PPI-lung-A549), 0.50% (genetic-PPI-breast-MCF7), 0.24% (genetic-PPI-prostate-PC3), 0.38% (genetic-PPI-skin-A375), 0.36% (genetic-PPI-colon-HT29), 1.09% (genetic-PPI-ovary-ES2), 0.54% (genetic-PPI-head-BICR6), 0.11% (genetic-PPI-pancreas-YAPC) and 0.92% (genetic-PPI-brain-U251MG) more samples compared with the second-best competing method (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Its ability to effectively predict targets at the top of the ranks is further supported by the metrics recall@1 and recall@10 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). PDGrapher achieves the second-best overall rankings (Extended Data Fig. 2d), closely following scGEN, which obtained the highest nDCG values (Extended Data Fig. 2b) but showed weaker performance when evaluating only the top-ranked predicted targets (partially accurate prediction and recall@1). P values of the genetic perturbagen discovery tests are provided in the Source data. PDGrapher and competing methods perform worse on genetic data than on chemical data. This may be due to knockout interventions generating weaker phenotypic signals than small molecule interventions. While gene knockouts are essential for understanding gene function, single-gene knockout studies can offer limited insights into complex cellular processes due to compensatory mechanisms38,39,40. Despite the modest performance in genetic intervention datasets, PDGrapher outperforms competing methods in the combinatorial prediction of therapeutic targets.

PDGrapher achieves the best performance in response prediction for both chemical (Extended Data Fig. 1) and genetic perturbation (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). P values of the response prediction tests are provided in the Source data. When using GRNs as proxy causal graphs, PDGrapher has comparable performance with GRNs and PPI networks across both genetic and chemical intervention datasets (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). One difference is that GRNs were constructed individually for each cell line, which makes leave-cell-out splitting setting prediction particularly challenging. Therefore, we only conducted random splitting setting experiments for GRN datasets. We also used PDGrapher to clarify the mode of action of the chemical perturbagens vorinostat and sorafenib in chemical-PPI-lung-A549 (Supplementary Note 1).

PDGrapher shows consistently strong performance on chemical intervention datasets in the leave-cell-out setting (Fig. 4). In this setting, we use the trained models in the random splitting setting for each cell line to predict therapeutic targets in the remaining cell lines. PDGrapher successfully predicts perturbagens that describe the cellular dynamics and shift gene expression phenotypes from a diseased to a treated state in 7.16% (chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7), 6.50% (chemical-PPI-lung-A549), 5.00% (chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231), 8.67% (chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3), 7.72% (chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP), 7.31% (chemical-PPI-skin-A375), 7.08% (chemical-PPI-colon-HT29) and 7.13% (chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA) additional testing samples compared with the second-best competing method (Fig. 4a). PDGrapher also outperforms the competing methods in 8 of 9 cell lines by predicting nDCG values that are 0.02 (chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7), 0.01 (chemical-PPI-lung-A549), 0.01 (chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231), 0.03 (chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3), 0.02 (chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP), 0.01 (chemical-PPI-skin-A375), 0.03 (chemical-PPI-colon-HT29) and 0.02 (chemical-PPI-cervix-HELA) higher than those of the second-best competing method (Fig. 4b). Its strong performance is further supported by the recall metrics, particularly recall@10 (Fig. 4c). Considering the overall performance across different cell lines and metrics, PDGrapher achieves the highest rank, with a median surpassing competing methods (Fig. 4d). Combinations of therapeutic targets predicted by PDGrapher in chemical datasets are closer to ground-truth targets than expected by chance (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 7). For example, for chemical-PPI-lung-A549, the median distance between predicted and ground-truth therapeutic targets is 3.0 for both PDGrapher and the random reference. However, the distributions show a statistically significant difference, with a 1-sided Mann–Whitney U-test yielding P < 0.001, an effect size (rank-biserial correlation) of 0.2191 (95% CI, [0.2182, 0.2200]) and a U-statistic of 2.46 × 1012. Similarly, for chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7, the median distance is 3.0 for both groups, yet the distributions are significantly different (P < 0.001, effect size = 0.2457 (95% CI, [0.2451, 0.2464]), U-statistic = 6.07 × 1012) (Supplementary Table 7). PDGrapher also outperforms existing methods in genetic perturbagen prediction across cell lines, as measured by the top targets on the predicted gene ranks (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). PDGrapher also shows superior performance in response prediction for both chemical (Supplementary Fig. 1) and genetic (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g) datasets. The P values of the leave-cell-out perturbagen discovery tests and response prediction tests are provided in the Source data.

a,b, PDGrapher shows improved performance when trained on nine chemical perturbation datasets spanning various diseases and evaluated on the remaining eight cell lines. It achieves up to 8.67% more accurately predicted samples in the testing sets compared with the second-best baseline (for example, when trained on chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3, 12.81% versus 4.13% (a)) and an nDCG value of up to 0.03 higher than the second-best baseline (for example, when trained on chemical-PPI-colon-HT29, 0.19 versus 0.16 (b)). In a and b, the bars show the average performance across five cross-validation test splits for each of the nine chemical datasets. The overlaid points represent performance values from individual data splits (n = 5 per cell line). Each data split contains 20% samples in the dataset, with each sample corresponding to a perturbation-response instance. Where replicates exist for a given drug, they are treated as independent inputs during training and evaluation. c, PDGrapher recovers ground-truth therapeutic targets at higher rates (evaluated by recall 1–100) compared with competing methods for chemical-PPI datasets. d, Box plots show the distribution of average model rankings across 9 cell lines (n = 9); each dot corresponds to the aggregated ranking value across cross-validation splits, train cell lines and across all metrics for a distinct cell line. A higher value indicates better performance. The central line inside the box represents the median, while the top and bottom edges correspond to the first and third quartiles. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5× the interquartile range from the quartiles. Each dot represents a data point for a specific cell line and metrics. P values from the statistical tests are provided in the Source data. e, Shown is the difference of shortest-path distances between ground-truth therapeutic genes and predicted genes by PDGrapher and a random reference across nine cell lines. Predominantly negative values indicate that PDGrapher predicts sets of therapeutic genes that are closer in the network to ground-truth therapeutic genes compared with what would be expected by chance (average shortest-path distances across cell lines for PDGrapher versus random reference = 2.75 versus 3.11).

Source data

Approaches that train individual models for each perturbagen (such as scGen and CellOT) generally achieve a better perturbagen prediction performance than those that use a single model for all perturbagens (Biolord, GEARS and ChemCPA). However, training individual models becomes infeasible for large-scale datasets with many perturbagens. For example, without parallelization, scGen would require about 8 years to complete the leave-cell-out experiments on the chemical and genetic perturbation data used in this study. PDGrapher addresses this scalability challenge. Its training is up to 25× faster than scGen and more than 100× faster than CellOT when using the default setting of 100,000 epochs, substantially reducing computational costs. This efficiency highlights a key advantage of PDGrapher. This improved efficiency is due to PDGrapher's approach. Existing methods predict phenotypic responses to perturbations and identify perturbagens indirectly by searching through predicted responses for all candidates. In contrast, PDGrapher directly infers the perturbagen needed to achieve a specific response, learning which perturbations elicit a desired effect.

We examined PDGrapher's ability to predict targets of anti-cancer drugs that were not encountered by the model during training time using chemical cell lines with matched healthy data: chemical-PPI-lung-A549, chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7, chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231, chemical-PPI-breast-BT20, chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3 and chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP. PDGrapher was used to predict gene targets to shift these diseased cell lines into their healthy states. Figure 5a shows the recovery of targets of FDA-approved drugs for varying values of K (where K represents the number of predicted target genes considered in the predicted ranked list), indicating that PDGrapher can identify targets of approved anti-cancer drugs not seen during training among the top predictions.

Individual data points represent individual cell lines (n = 6). b, Performance of sensitivity analyses evaluated by the percentage of accurately predicted samples for cell lines MDAMB231 and MCF7 under chemical and genetic perturbations, respectively. The PPI network used here is from STRING (string-db.org) with a confidence score for each edge. The edges are filtered by the 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 quantiles of the confidence scores as cut-offs, resulting in 5 PPI networks with 625,818, 582,305, 516,683, 443,051 and 296,451 edges, respectively.

We analysed lung cancer by comparing the targets predicted by PDGrapher for lung cancer cell lines with the targets of candidate drugs in clinical development, curated from the Open Targets Platform41. This evaluation tested PDGrapher's ability to predict combinatorial chemical perturbagens. We compared the top ten targets predicted by PDGrapher for the A549 lung cancer cell line to ten randomly selected genes. The predicted targets had significantly higher Open Targets scores and more supporting resources than the random genes (Extended Data Fig. 7). Using an Open Targets evidence cut-off score of 0.5, 8 of 10 predicted targets had evidence supporting their association with lung cancer, compared with only 2 of 10 in the random gene set. Four drugs, tacedinaline (DrugBank:DB12291; clinical trial identifier, NCT00005093), selpercatinib (DrugBank:DB15685), pralsetinib (DrugBank:DB15822) and dexmedetomidine (DrugBank:DB00633; ref. 42), targeting these predicted genes were not included in the training set but have been identified as potential treatments for NSCLC.

We then evaluated PDGrapher's predictions by examining FDA-approved drugs that were not present in the training set of PDGrapher. Specifically, we assessed PDGrapher's performance using the chemical-PPI-lung-A549 dataset, focusing initially on pralsetinib, a targeted cancer therapy primarily used to treat NSCLC43. Pralsetinib is a selective Ret proto-oncogene (RET) kinase inhibitor designed to block the activity of RET proteins that have become aberrantly active due to mutations or fusions. Pralsetinib is known to target 11 key proteins: RET, DDR1, NTRK3, fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), JAK1, JAK2, NTRK1, KDR, platelet derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGFR2 (ref. 44). RET, the gene encoding pralsetinib's primary target, was ranked 11th of 10,716 genes in the predicted list. Half of the genes encoding pralsetinib's targets (5 of 11) were ranked within the top 100 predicted targets by PDGrapher, including KDR (ranked at 3), FLT3 (ranked at 10), RET (ranked at 11), PDGFRB (ranked at 14) and FGFR2 (ranked at 81). This substantial overlap highlights the potential of the candidate targets identified by PDGrapher for pralsetinib-based lung cancer treatment, given that pralsetinib was not included in the training set of PDGrapher.

Next, we examined KDR as a therapeutic target for lung cancer. KDR, also known as VEGFR2, has been identified as a critical therapeutic target in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. These cells express KDR at both mRNA and protein levels, facilitating autocrine signalling that promotes tumour cell survival and proliferation28. Activation of KDR enhances tumour angiogenesis and growth by upregulating oncogenic factors such as enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), which is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration. Inhibiting KDR has showed promising therapeutic effects, including reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. For instance, KDR inhibitors have been shown to decrease the malignant potential of lung adenocarcinoma cells by downregulating EZH2 expression and increasing sensitivity to chemotherapy29. These findings underscore the importance of KDR as a therapeutic target in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, highlighting its role in tumour progression and the potential benefits of its inhibition in cancer treatment strategies. Importantly, PDGrapher has successfully identified KDR among the top 20 predicted targets in chemical-PPI-lung-A549, validating its precision in detecting key therapeutic targets for lung cancer.

Given that Open Targets offers more comprehensive evidence for targets currently under development, we conducted a second series of case studies using Open Targets data to evaluate PDGrapher's capability to identify candidate therapeutic targets and drugs. This analysis aims to identify targets for lung cancer. Figure 6a presents a bubble graph that illustrates the union of the top 10 predicted targets to transition cell states from diseased to healthy in the six cell lines of three types of cancer that have available healthy controls. In the plot, the colour intensity and size of the bubbles represent the number of evidence sources and the association scores for each type of evidence. Most predicted targets are supported by drugs, pathology and systemic biology, and somatic mutation databases, which were considered strong evidence sources. Two unique targets, DNA topoisomerase II-α (TOP2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), are predicted exclusively for the lung cancer cell line (Extended Data Fig. 8). TOP2A is ranked as the top predicted target by PDGrapher. This gene encodes a crucial decatenating enzyme that alters DNA topology by binding to two double-stranded DNA molecules, introducing a double-strand break, passing the intact strand through the break, and repairing the broken strand. This mechanism is vital for DNA replication and repair processes. TOP2A could be a potential therapeutic target for anti-metastatic therapy of NSCLC because it promotes metastasis of NSCLC by stimulating the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition45. Using the predicted target of TOP2A, PDGrapher then identified three drugs, aldoxorubicin, vosaroxin and doxorubicin hydrochloride, as candidate drugs. These drugs were not part of the training dataset of PDGrapher and are in the early stages of clinical development: aldoxorubicin and vosaroxin are in phase II trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), and doxorubicin hydrochloride is in phase I trials but has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic or surgically unresectable uterine or soft tissue leiomyosarcoma46.

a, Union of the top 10 targets predicted by PDGrapher in lung, breast and prostate cancer. The colour intensity and size of the bubbles represent the number of evidence sources and the association scores for each type of evidence, respectively. Red, blue and green dots represent breast, lung and prostate cancer, respectively. The details of the scoring system are provided in Supplementary Note 2. b, Predicted target rank from PDGrapher in 5 ranges, 1–10, 11–20, 51–60, 101–110, and 1,001–1,010 for lung cancer (chemical-PPI-lung-A549). The colour intensity and size of the bubbles represent the number of evidence sources and the global scores of targets from Open Targets, respectively.

Source data

Given that PDGrapher can rank all genes based on PPI network or GRN data, we assessed two questions: whether top-ranked genes have stronger evidence from Open Targets compared with lower-ranked genes, and what rank threshold should be used to identify reliably predicted genes. Figure 6b shows the number of sources of evidence and the global scores for the predicted target genes within the rank ranges of 1–10, 11–20, 51–60, 101–110 and 1,001–1,010 for lung cancer (chemical-PPI-lung-A549). The analysis revealed a clear trend: both the number of supporting evidence sources and global scores decrease with increasing rank, validating the predictive accuracy of PDGrapher. Most targets ranked within the top 100 have strong evidence from Open Targets, indicating that a rank threshold of 100 could serve as a cut-off for selecting candidate targets.

We conducted an ablation study to evaluate the components of PDGrapher's objective function using chemical datasets. We trained PDGrapher under three configurations: with only the cycle loss (PDGrapher-Cycle), only the supervision loss (PDGrapher-Super) and with both losses combined (PDGrapher-SuperCycle). The experiments were performed in the random splitting setting across all nine PPI chemical datasets. We assessed performance using several metrics, including the percentage of accurately predicted samples (Fig. 5c), nDCG (Supplementary Fig. 8a), recall values (Supplementary Fig. 8b) and strength of evidence (Extended Data Fig. 9). The results showed that PDGrapher-Super achieves the highest performance in predicting correct perturbagens but performs the worst in reconstructing treated samples. In contrast, PDGrapher-Cycle performs poorly in identifying correct perturbagens but shows improved performance in predicting (reconstructing) held-out treated samples. PDGrapher-SuperCycle (the configuration used throughout this study) strikes a balance between these two objectives, achieving competitive performance in predicting therapeutic genes while showing the best performance in reconstructing treated samples from diseased samples after intervening on the predicted genes. This makes PDGrapher-SuperCycle the most effective choice for balancing accuracy in perturbagen prediction with reconstruction fidelity. The findings show that supervision loss is essential for PDGrapher's overall performance. The PDGrapher-Cycle model consistently underperforms in all cell lines and metrics. Although PDGrapher-Super often excels in ranking performance, including cycle loss (in PDGrapher-SuperCycle) proves its value by moderately improving top prediction metrics such as recall@1 and recall@10. In addition, when healthy cell line data are available, the top predictions of PDGrapher-SuperCycle show stronger evidence compared with those of PDGrapher-Super in more than half (four of six) of the cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 9). We chose PDGrapher-SuperCycle for this work because it provides accurate target gene predictions from the top-ranked genes in the predicted list and bases its predictions on the changes they would induce in diseased samples.

Recognizing the role of biological pathways in disease phenotypes, PDGrapher-SuperCycle can identify alternative gene targets with close network proximity that may produce similar phenotypic outcomes. The organization of genes with similar functions, where each gene contributes to specific biochemical processes or signalling cascades, allows perturbations in different genes to yield analogous effects47. This function-based interconnectivity implies that targeting different genes with similar functions can achieve therapeutic outcomes, as these genes collectively influence cellular phenotypic states48. Although PDGrapher-SuperCycle shows slightly lower performance than PDGrapher-Super in pinpointing targets (Fig. 5c), it excels in identifying sets of gene targets capable of transitioning cell states from diseased to treated conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8b and Extended Data Fig. 9).

We conducted four analyses to test the sensitivity of PDGrapher to the causal graph. The first analysis uses five PPI networks constructed with varying edge confidence cut-offs. The PPI network was obtained from STRING (https://string-db.org/)49, which assigns a confidence score to each edge. To create networks with different levels of confidence, we filtered edges based on the quantiles 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 of the confidence scores, resulting in 5 networks with decreasing numbers of edges. For this analysis, we selected two cell lines: chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231 and genetic-PPI-breast-MCF7. The LINCS perturbation data for each cell line were processed using the five PPI networks (Supplementary Note 3). We trained PDGrapher with one, two and three GNN layers, selecting the best configuration based on the performance of the validation set. As shown in Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 3, PDGrapher performs robustly at all levels of confidence in PPI networks. It maintains stable performance on both chemical and genetic intervention datasets, even as an increasing number of edges is removed from the PPI networks. The second to fourth analyses are based on the synthetic graphs. We created two sparse PPI networks using different edge removal strategies and one synthetic gene expression dataset with increasing levels of latent confounders. We applied two edge removal strategies to the PPI network: removing increasing numbers of either bridge edges or random edges. Details of the data generation process are provided in the Methods. Results from the edge removal experiments indicate that although bridge edges are structurally critical, their limited number in the PPI graph reduces their overall impact on model predictions (Extended Data Fig. 5). In contrast, the removal of random edges, which include both high-confidence and redundant connections, has a more pronounced effect on performance, highlighting the model's sensitivity to network perturbations (Extended Data Fig. 6). The fourth dataset introduces latent confounders in the gene expression data. PDGrapher showed stable performance in perturbagen prediction, with only a slight decrease in performance as stronger confounders were introduced (Extended Data Fig. 4).

We then evaluated whether PDGrapher can maintain robust performance in the absence of disease intervention data. In our training datasets, some cell lines lacked associated healthy control samples from disease-relevant tissues and cell types. These cell lines contained only treatment intervention data (diseased cell state, perturbagen and treated cell state) without disease intervention data (healthy cell state, disease mutations or diseased cell state) for model training and inference. For cell lines with healthy controls, we trained the response prediction module using both intervention datasets. For cell lines without healthy controls, we trained PDGrapher using only treatment intervention data. To evaluate PDGrapher's dependency on healthy control data, we trained the model on cell lines with available disease intervention data under two conditions: one using the disease intervention data for training and one excluding it. This evaluation was conducted on six chemical perturbation datasets (chemical-PPI-lung-A549, chemical-PPI-breast-MCF7, chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231, chemical-PPI-breast-BT20, chemical-PPI-prostate-PC3 and chemical-PPI-prostate-VCAP) and three genetic perturbation datasets (genetic-PPI-lung-A549, genetic-PPI-breast-MCF7 and genetic-PPI-prostate-PC3). The results indicated that the two versions of PDGrapher perform consistently across cell types and data types (chemical and genetic; Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). In half of the cell lines (four of nine), the model trained without disease intervention data outperformed the model trained with it. This shows that PDGrapher has a weak dependency on healthy control data and can perform well even when such data are unavailable.

We formulate phenotype-driven lead discovery as a combinatorial prediction problem for therapeutic targets. Given a diseased sample, the goal is to identify genes that a genetic or chemical perturbagen should target to reverse disease effects and shift the sample towards a treated state that matches the distribution of a healthy state. This requires predicting a combination of gene targets, framing the task as combinatorial prediction. To address this, we introduce PDGrapher. Using a diseased cell state represented by a gene expression signature and a proxy causal graph of gene–gene interactions, PDGrapher predicts candidate target genes to transition cells to the desired treated state. PDGrapher includes two modules: a perturbagen discovery module that proposes a set of therapeutic targets based on the diseased and treated states, and a response prediction module that evaluates the effect of applying the predicted perturbagen to the diseased state. Both modules are GNN models that operate on gene–gene networks, which serve as approximations of noisy causal graphs. We use PPI networks and GRNs as two representations of these noisy causal graphs. PDGrapher predicts perturbagens that shift gene expression from diseased to treated states across 2 evaluation settings (random and leave-cell-out) and 19 datasets involving genetic and chemical interventions. Unlike alternative response prediction methods, which rely on indirect prediction to identify perturbagens, PDGrapher selects candidate gene targets to achieve the desired transformation36,37,50,51,52.

PDGrapher has the potential to improve therapeutic lead design and expand the search space for perturbagens. It leverages large datasets of genetic and chemical interventions to identify sets of candidate targets that can shift cell line gene expression from diseased to treated states. By selecting sets of therapeutic targets for intervention instead of a single perturbagen, PDGrapher enhances phenotype-driven lead discovery. PDGrapher's approach to identifying therapeutic targets can enable personalized therapies by tailoring treatments to individual gene expression profiles. Its ability to output multiple genes is particularly relevant for diseases where dependencies among several genes affect treatment efficacy and safety.

PDGrapher operates under the assumption that there are no unobserved confounders, a stringent condition that is challenging to validate empirically. Future work could focus on re-evaluating and relaxing this assumption. Another limitation lies in the reliance on PPI networks and GRNs as proxies for causal gene networks, as these networks are inherently noisy and incomplete53,54,55. PDGrapher posits that representation learning can overcome incomplete causal graph approximations. A valuable research direction is to theoretically examine the impact of such approximations, focusing on how they influence the accuracy and reliability of predicted likelihoods. Such analyses could uncover high-level causal variables with therapeutic effects from low-level observations and contribute to reconciling structural causality and representation learning approaches, which generally lack any causal understanding56. We performed two experiments to evaluate the robustness of PDGrapher. First, we tested PDGrapher on a PPI network with weighted edges, progressively removing low-confidence edges to assess its performance under increasing network sparsity. Second, we applied PDGrapher to synthetic datasets with varying levels of missing graph components and confounding factors in gene expression data. In both experiments, PDGrapher maintained stable performance. PDGrapher also showed robust performance across PPI networks with different numbers of edges.

Phenotype-driven drug discovery using PDGrapher faces certain limitations, one of which is its reliance on transcriptomic data. Although transcriptomics is broadly applicable, including other data modalities, such as cell morphology screens, could produce more comprehensive models. Cell morphology screens, including cell painting, capture cellular responses by staining organelles and cytoskeletal components, generating image profiles that capture the effects of genetic or chemical perturbations57,58. These screens allow identification of phenotypic signatures that correlate with compound activity, mechanisms of action and potential off-target effects. The recent release of the JUMP Cell Painting dataset59 exemplifies how high-content morphological profiling can complement databases such as CMap and LINCS, creating integrated datasets for phenotype-driven discovery. By integrating multimodal data, including phenotypic layers from transcriptomic and image data, it becomes possible to uncover more comprehensive patterns of compound effects60. Such integration would broaden the scope of PDGrapher, allowing it to capture wider mechanistic insights and support more effective therapeutic discovery61,62.

A limitation of our study is the use of NL20 as a control cell line for A549 (refs. 63,64,65). Although NL20 is a normal human bronchial epithelial cell line and A549 is a human lung carcinoma cell line derived from the alveolar region, the two cell lines differ in anatomical origin and molecular characteristics. This mismatch could introduce biases in comparative analyses due to variations in baseline gene expression profiles and cellular behaviours. To mitigate this concern, we evaluate PDGrapher's performance across datasets with and without healthy control data. PDGrapher performs consistently regardless of the inclusion of healthy controls, indicating that its predictions are robust to the absence of matched control cells. Ablation analyses showed that incorporating cycle loss improved PDGrapher's performance in top target predictions for five of nine cell lines. On the basis of this improvement, we included the cycle loss in all experiments. Cycle loss helps maintain the robustness and biological relevance of model predictions. PDGrapher learns to predict drug targets that shift cells from a diseased state to a healthy or treated state. It then uses the diseased gene expression profile and the predicted targets to estimate the gene expression after treatment. This bidirectional approach enforces the fidelity of predicted targets as they must contain sufficient information to reconstruct state B from state A. Cycle loss also serves as a regularizer that penalizes discrepancies between the original input and its reconstruction66.

PDGrapher is a GNN approach for combinatorial prediction of perturbations that transition diseased cells to treated states. By leveraging causal reasoning and representation learning on gene networks, PDGrapher identifies perturbagens necessary to achieve specific phenotypic changes. This approach enables the direct prediction of therapeutic targets that can reverse disease phenotypes, bypassing the need for exhaustive response simulations across large perturbation libraries. Its design and evaluation lay the groundwork for future advances in phenotype-based modeling of therapeutic perturbations by improving the precision and scalability of perturbation prediction methods.

A calligraphic letter \({\mathcal{X}}\) indicates a set, an italic uppercase letter X denotes a graph, uppercase X denotes a matrix, lowercase x denotes a vector, and a monospaced letter X indicates a tuple. Uppercase letter \({\mathsf{X}}\) indicates a random variable, and lowercase letter \({\mathsf{x}}\) indicates its corresponding value; bold uppercase \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}}\) denotes a set of random variables, and lowercase letter \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{x}}}\) indicates its corresponding values. We denote \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}})\) as a probability distribution over a set of random variables \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}}\) and \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}}={\boldsymbol{\mathsf{x}}})\) as the probability of \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}}\) that is equal to the value of \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{x}}}\) under the distribution \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}})\). For simplicity, \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{X}}}={\boldsymbol{\mathsf{x}}})\) is abbreviated as \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{x}}})\). This section uses terminology and concepts from the framework of casual inference67.

Intuitively, given a diseased cell line sample, we would like to predict the set of therapeutic genes that need to be targeted to reverse the effects of disease, that is, the genes that need to be perturbed to shift the cell gene expression state as close as possible to the healthy state. Next, we formalize our problem formulation. Let \({\mathtt{M}}= < {\boldsymbol{\mathsf{E}}},{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}},{\mathcal{F}},P(\boldsymbol{{\mathsf{E}}}) >\) be a structural causal model (SCM; see the description of related works in Supplementary Note 4) associated with causal graph G, where \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{E}}}\) is a set of exogenous variables affecting the system, \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}}\) are the system variables, \({\mathcal{F}}\) are structural equations encoding causal relations between variables and \(P({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{E}}})\) is a probability distribution over exogenous variables. Let \({\mathcal{T}}=\{{{\mathtt{T}}}_{1},\ldots ,{{\mathtt{T}}}_{m}\}\) be a dataset of paired healthy and diseased samples (namely, disease intervention data), where each element is a triplet \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{h}},{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}},{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{d}} >\) with \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{h}}\in {[0,1]}^{N}\) being normalized gene expression values of a healthy cell line (variable states before perturbation), \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}}}_{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}\) being the disease-causing perturbed variable (gene) set in \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}}\), and \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{d}}\in {[0,1]}^{N}\) being gene expression values of a diseased cell line (variable states after perturbation). Our goal is to find, for each sample \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{h}},{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}},{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{d}} >\), the variable set \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }\) with the highest likelihood of shifting variable states from diseased \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{d}}\) to healthy \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{h}}\) state. To increase generality, we refer to the desired variable states as treated (\({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{v}}}}^{\rm{t}}\)). Our goal can then be expressed as:

where \({P}^{\;{G}^{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}}\) represents the probability on the graph G mutilated by perturbations in variables in \({\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}\). Under the assumption of no unobserved confounders, the above interventional probability can be expressed as a conditional probability on the mutilated graph \({G}^{{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }}\):

which under the causal Markov condition is:

where \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{Pa}}}}_{{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{V}}}}_{i}}\) represents parents of variable \({{{\mathsf{V}}}}_{i}\) according to graph \({G}^{{{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }}\) (that is, the mutilated graph upon intervening on variables in \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }\)). Here state of a variable \({{\mathsf{V}}}_{j}\in {{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{Pa}}}}_{{{{\mathsf{V}}}}_{i}}\) will be equal to an arbitrary value \({{\mathsf{v}}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\) if \({{\mathsf{V}}}_{j}\in {{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }\). Therefore, intervening on the variable set \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }\) modifies the graph used to obtain conditional probabilities and determine the state of variables in \({{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{U}}}}^{{\prime} }\).

In the previous section, we drew on the SCM framework to introduce a generic formulation for the task of combinatorial prediction of therapeutic targets. Instead of approaching the problem from a purely causal inference perspective, we draw upon representation learning to approximate the queries of interest to address the limiting real-world setting of a noisy and incomplete causal graph. Formulating our problem using the SCM framework allows for explicit modelling of interventions and formulation of interventional queries (see the description of related works in Supplementary Note 4). Inspired by this principled problem formulation, we next introduce the problem formulation using a representation learning paradigm.

We let \(G=({\mathcal{V}},{\mathcal{E}})\) denote a graph with \(| {\mathcal{V}}| =n\) nodes and \(| {\mathcal{E}}|\) edges, which contains partial information on causal relationships between nodes in \({\mathcal{V}}\) and some noisy relationships. We refer to this graph as a proxy causal graph. Let \({\mathcal{T}}=\{{{\mathtt{T}}}_{1},\ldots ,{{\mathtt{T}}}_{{\mathsf{M}}}\}\) be a dataset with an individual sample being a triplet \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{h}},{\mathcal{U}},{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}} >\) with xh ∈ [0, 1]n being the node states (attributes) of a healthy cell sample (before perturbation), \({\mathcal{U}}\) being the set of disease-causing perturbed nodes in \({\mathcal{V}}\), and xd ∈ [0, 1]n being the node states (attributes) of a diseased cell sample (after perturbation). We denote by \({G}^{{\mathcal{U}}}=({\mathcal{V}},{{\mathcal{E}}}^{{\mathcal{U}}})\) the graph resulting from the mutilation of edges in G as a result of perturbing nodes in \({\mathcal{U}}\) (one graph per perturbagen; we avoid using superindices for simplicity). Here again we refer to the desired variable states as treated (xt). Our goal is then to learn a function:

That, given the graph \({G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}\), the diseased node states xd and treated node states xt, predicts the combinatorial set of nodes \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) that if perturbed have the highest chance of shifting the node states to the treated state xt. We note here that \({P}^{{G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}}\) represents probabilities over graph \({G}^{{\mathcal{U}}}\) mutilated upon perturbations in nodes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\). Under causal Markov condition, we can factorize \({P}^{{G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}}\) over graph \({G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}\):

that is, the probability of each node i depending only on its parents \({{\mathcal{PA}}}_{i}\) in graph \({G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}\).

We assume (1) real-valued node states, (2) G is fixed and given, and (3) atomic and non-atomic perturbagens (intervening on individual nodes or sets of nodes). Given that the value of each node should depend only on its parents in the graph \({G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}\), a message-passing framework appears especially suited to compute the factorized probabilities P.

In the SCM framework, the conditional probabilities in equation (3) are computed recursively on the graph, each being an expectation over exogenous variables \(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{E}}\). Therefore, node states of the previous time point are not necessary. To translate this query into the representation learning realm, we discard the existence of noise variables and directly try to learn a function encoding the transition from an initial state to a desired state. An exhaustive approach to solving equation (5) would be to search the space of all potential sets of therapeutic targets \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) and score how effective each is in achieving the desired treated state. This is, how many cell response prediction approaches can be used for perturbagen discovery22,23,68. However, with moderately sized graphs, this is highly computationally expensive, if not intractable. Instead, we propose to search for potential perturbagens efficiently with a perturbagen discovery module (ƒp) and a way to score each potential perturbagen with a response prediction module (ƒr).

Given that the prediction for each variable is dependent only on its parents in a graph, GNNs appear especially suited for this problem. We can formulate the query of interest under a graph representation learning paradigm as follows: given a graph \(G=({\mathcal{V}},{\mathcal{E}})\), paired sets of node attributes \({\mathcal{X}}=\{{{\bf{X}}}_{1},{{\bf{X}}}_{2},\ldots ,{{\bf{X}}}_{m}\}\) and node labels \({\mathcal{Y}}=\{{{\bf{Y}}}_{1},{{\bf{Y}}}_{2},\ldots ,{{\bf{Y}}}_{m}\}\), where each Y = {y1, …, yn}, with yi ∈ [0, 1], we aim at training a neural message-passing architecture that given node attributes Xi predicts the corresponding node labels Yi. There are, however, differences between our problem formulation and the conventional graph prediction tasks, namely, graph and node classification (summarized in Supplementary Table 13).

In node classification, a single graph G is paired with node attributes X, and the task is to predict the node labels Y. Our formulation differs in that we have m paired sets of node attributes \({\mathcal{X}}\) and labels \({\mathcal{Y}}\) instead of a single set, yet they are similar in that there is a single graph in which GNNs operate. In graph classification, a set of graphs \({\mathcal{G}}=\{{G}_{1},\ldots ,{G}_{m}\}\) is paired with a set of node attributes \({\mathcal{X}}=\{{{\bf{X}}}_{1},{{\bf{X}}}_{2},\ldots ,{{\bf{X}}}_{m}\}\) and the task is to predict a label for each graph Y = {y1, …, ym}. Here graphs have a varying structure, and both the topological information and node attributes predict graph labels. In our formulation, a single graph is combined with each node attribute Xi, and the goal is to predict a label for each node, not for the whole graph.

PDGrapher is an approach for combinatorial prediction of therapeutic targets composed of two modules. First, a perturbagen discovery module ƒp searches the space of potential gene sets to predict a suitable candidate \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\). Next, a response prediction module ƒr checks the goodness of the predicted set \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\), that is, how effective intervening on variables in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) is to shift node states to the desired treated state xt.

We optimize our response prediction module ƒr using cross-entropy (CE) loss on known triplets of disease intervention \(< {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{h}},{\mathcal{U}},{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}} >\) and treatment intervention \(< {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\):

We optimize our intervention discovery module ƒp using a cycle loss, ensuring that the response to the predicted intervention set \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) closely matches the desired treated state (the first part of equation (7)). In addition, we provide a supervisory signal for predicting \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\) in the form of cross-entropy loss (the second part of equation (7)). So, the total loss is defined as:

We train ƒp and ƒr in parallel and implement early stopping separately (see ‘Experimental set-up' for more details). Trained module ƒp is then used to predict, for each diseased cell sample, which nodes should be perturbed (\({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\)) to achieve a desired treated state (Fig. 1a).

Our response prediction module ƒr should learn to map pre-perturbagen node values to post-perturbagen node values through learning relationships between connected nodes (equivalent to learning structural equations in SCMs) and propagating the effects of perturbations downstream in the graph (analogous to the recursive nature of query computations in SCMs).

Given a disease intervention triplet \(< {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{h}},{\mathcal{U}},{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}} >\), we propose a neural model operating on a mutilated graph, \({G}^{{\mathcal{U}}}\), where the node attributes are the concatenation of xh and \({{\bf{x}}}_{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\), predicting diseased node values xd. The first element is its gene expression value \({{\bf{x}}}_{i}^{\rm{h}}\) and the second is a perturbation flag, a binary label indicating whether a perturbation occurs at node i. So, each node i has a two-dimensional attribute vector \({{\bf{d}}}_{i}=[{{\bf{x}}}_{i}^{\rm{h}}\,| | \,{{\bf{x}}}_{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }]\). In practice, we embed each node feature into a high-dimensional continuous space by assigning learnable embeddings to each node based on the value of each input feature dimension. Specifically, for each node, we use the binary perturbation flag to assign a d-dimensional learnable embedding, which is different between nodes but shared across samples for each node. To embed the gene expression value \({{\bf{x}}}_{i}^{\rm{h}}\in [0,1]\), we first calculate thresholds using quantiles to assign the gene expression value into one of the B bins. We use the bin index to assign a d-dimensional learnable embedding, which is different between nodes but shared across samples for each node. To increase our model's representation power, we concatenate a d-dimensional positional embedding (a d-dimensional vector initialized randomly following a normal distribution). Concatenating these three embeddings results in an input node representation of dimensionality 3d. For each node \(i\in {\mathcal{V}}\), an embedding zi is computed using a GNN operating on the node's neighbours' attributes. The most general formulation of a GNN layer is:

where \({{\bf{h}}}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) represents the updated information of node i, and hi represents the information of node i in the previous layer, with embedded di being the input to the first layer. ψ is a message function, ⨁ a permutation-invariant aggregate function, and ϕ is an update function. We obtain an embedding zi for node i by stacking K GNN layers. The node embedding \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}\in {\mathbb{R}}\) is then passed to a multilayer feedforward neural network to obtain an estimate of the values of the post-perturbation nodes xd.

Our perturbagen prediction module ƒp should learn the nodes in the graph that should be perturbed to shift the node states (attributes) from diseased xd to the desired treated state xt. Given a triplet \(< {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), we propose a neural model operating on graph \({G}^{{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }}\) with node features xd and xt that predicts a ranking for each node, where the top P ranked nodes should be predicted as the nodes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\). Each node i has a two-dimensional attribute vector: \({{\bf{d}}}_{i}=[{{\bf{x}}}_{i}^{\rm{d}}\,| | \,{{\bf{x}}}_{i}^{\rm{t}}]\). In practice, we represent these binary features in a continuous space using the same approach as described for our response prediction module ƒr.

For each node \(i\in {\mathcal{V}}\), an embedding zi is computed using a GNN operating on the node's neighbours' attributes. We obtain an embedding zi for node i by stacking K GNN layers. The node embedding \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}\in {\mathbb{R}}\) is then passed to a multilayer feedforward neural network to predict a real-valued number for node i.

We implement PDGrapher using PyTorch 1.10.1 (ref. 69) and the Torch Geometric 2.0.4 Library70. The implemented architecture yields a neural network with the following hyperparameters: number of GNN layers and number of prediction layers. We set the number of prediction layers to two and performed a grid search over the number of GNN layers (one to three layers). We train our model using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy and report PDGrapher's performance resulting from the best-performing hyperparameter setting.

We next outline the evaluation set-up, baseline models and statistical tests used to evaluate PDGrapher. We evaluate the performance of PDGrapher against the following existing methods:

Random reference: Given a sample \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), the random reference baseline returns N random genes as the prediction of target genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\), where N is the number of genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\).

Cancer genes: Given a sample \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), the cancer genes baseline returns the top N genes from an ordered list where the first M genes are disease associated (cancer-driver genes). The remaining genes are ranked randomly, and N is the number of genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\). The processing of cancer genes is described in ‘Disease-genes information' in Supplementary Note 3.

Cancer drug targets: Given a sample \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), the cancer targets baseline returns the top N genes from an ordered list where the first M genes are cancer drug targets and the remaining genes are ranked randomly, and N is the number of genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\). The processing of drug target information is described in ‘Drug-targets information' and ‘Cancer drug and target information' in Supplementary Note 3.

Perturbed genes: Given a sample \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), the perturbed genes baseline returns the top N genes from an ordered list where the first M genes are all perturbed genes in the training set and the remaining genes are ranked randomly, and N is the number of genes in \({{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} }\).

scGen22: scGen is a widely used gold-standard latent variable model for response prediction71,72,73,74. Given a set of observed cell types in control and perturbed states, scGen predicts the response of a new cell type to the perturbagen seen in training. To use scGen as a baseline, we first fit it to our LINCS gene expression data for each dataset type to predict response to perturbagens, training one model per perturbagen (chemical or genetic). Then, given a sample of paired diseased-treated cell line states, \({\mathtt{T}}= < {{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{d}},{{\mathcal{U}}}^{{\prime} },{{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}} >\), we compute the response of the cell line with gene expression \({{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{d}}^{{\prime} }}\) to all perturbagens. The predicted perturbagen is that whose predicted response is closest to xt in R2 score, which quantifies the proportion of variance in treated state explained by the prediction. As scGen trains one model per perturbagen, it needs an exhaustively long training time for datasets with a large number of perturbagens, especially in the leave-cell-out setting. Therefore, we set the maximum training epochs to 100 and only conducted leave-cell-out tests for one split of data for scGen.

Biolord33: Biolord can predict perturbagen response for both chemical and genetic datasets. We followed the official tutorial from the Biolord GitHub repository (https://github.com/nitzanlab/biolord), using the recommended parameters. To prevent memory and quota errors, we implemented two filtering steps: (1) instead of storing the entire response gene expression (rGEX) matrix of all input (control) cells for each perturbagen, we only store a vector of the averaged rGEX of the input cells per perturbagen, which is necessary for calculating R2 for evaluation; and (2) during prediction, if the number of control cells exceeds 10,000, we randomly downsample the control cells to 10,000. Similar to scGen, we predict the responses gene expression \({{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{d}}^{{\prime} }}\) for all perturbagens and use them to calculate R2 to get the rank of predicted perturbagens.

ChemCPA23: ChemCPA is specifically designed for chemical perturbation. We followed the official tutorials on GitHub for running this model (https://github.com/theislab/chemCPA), with all parameters set following the authors' recommendations. Data processing was also conducted using the provided scripts. We constructed drug embedding using RDKit with canonical SMILES sequences, as this is the default setting in the model and the tutorial. As the original ChemCPA model lacks functionality to obtain the predicted rGEX for each drug (averaging over the dosages), we developed a custom script to perform this task. These predictions, \({{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{d}}^{{\prime} }}\), were subsequently used for calculating R2 to get the rank of predicted perturbagens.

GEARS34: GEARS is capable of predicting perturbagen responses for genetic perturbation datasets, specifically for predicting the rGEX to unseen perturbagens. However, it is limited to predicting only those genes that are present in the gene network used as prior knowledge for model training. In addition, GEARS cannot process perturbagens with only one sample, so we filtered the data accordingly. We followed the official tutorial from the GEARS GitHub repository (https://github.com/snap-stanford/GEARS), using the recommended parameters. After confirming with the authors, we established that GEARS is suitable only for within-cell-line prediction. Consequently, our experiments with GEARS were conducted exclusively within this scenario.

CellOT27: CellOT is capable of working with both chemical and genetic datasets. We ran this model by following the official tutorial from GitHub (https://github.com/bunnech/cellot), ensuring that all parameters were set according to the provided guidelines. Due to CellOT's limitation in processing perturbagens with small sample sizes, we filtered the data to retain only those perturbagens with more than five samples or cells. We then used the predicted rGEX \({{\bf{x}}}^{{\rm{d}}^{{\prime} }}\) to calculate R2 and the predicted perturbagen ranks. Similar to scGen, CellOT trains one model per perturbagen, which results in an exhaustively long training time for datasets with a large number of perturbagens. This issue becomes even more pronounced when doing leave-cell-out evaluations. Therefore, for this method, we set the maximum training epochs to 100 and only conduct one split in leave-cell-out tests.

We evaluate PDGrapher and competing methods on two different settings.

For each cell line, the dataset is split randomly into train and test sets to measure our model performance in an independent and identically distributed setting.

To measure model performance on unseen cell lines, we train our model with random splits on one cell line and test on a new cell line. Specifically, for chemical perturbation data, we train a model for each random split per cell line and test it on the entire dataset of the remaining eight cell lines. For genetic data, we train a model for each random split per cell line and test it on the entire dataset of the remaining nine cell lines. For example, with nine cell lines with chemical perturbation (A549, MDAMB231, BT20, VCAP, MCF7, PC3, A375, HT29 and HELA), we conducted an experiment where each split of cell line A549 was used as the training set, and the trained model was tested on the remaining eight cell lines (MDAMB231, BT20, VCAP, MCF7, PC3, A375, HT29 and HELA). Similarly, for cell line MDAMB231, we trained the model on each split of it and tested the model on the other eight cell lines (A549, BT20, VCAP, MCF7, PC3, A375, HT29 and HELA). This process was repeated for all cell lines, providing a comprehensive evaluation of PDGrapher and all competing methods.

For all dataset split settings, our model is trained using 5-fold cross-validation, and metrics are reported as the average on the test set. Within each fold, we further split the training set into training and validation sets (8:2) to perform early stopping. We train the model on the training set until the validation loss has not decreased at least 10−5 for 15 continuous epochs.

We report average sample-wise R2 score and average perturbagen-wise R2 score to measure performance in the prediction of xt. The sample-wise R2 score is computed as the square of the Pearson correlation between the predicted sample \({\hat{{\bf{x}}}}^{\rm{t}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\) and real sample \({{\bf{x}}}^{\rm{t}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N}\). The perturbagen-wise R2 score is adopted from scGen. It is computed as the square of the Pearson correlation of a linear least-squares regression between a set of predicted treated samples \({\hat{{\bf{X}}}}^{\rm{t}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N\times S}\) and a set of real treated samples \({{\bf{X}}}^{\rm{t}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{N\times S}\) for the same perturbagen. Here, S indicates the size of the sets. Higher values indicate better performance in predicting the treated sample xt given the diseased sample xd and predicted perturbagen. This is used for evaluating the performance of response prediction. For evaluating perturbagen discovery, when the competing methods cannot predict perturbagen ranks for chemical perturbation data, we first calculate the rank of drugs based on the R2 score. We then build a target gene rank from the drug rank by substituting the drugs with their target genes acquired from DrugBank75 (accessed in November 2022; see details in Supplementary Note 3). A single drug can have multiple target genes, which we place in the rank in random order. As some methods cannot predict unseen drugs, their predicted target gene lists are often short, introducing bias in evaluation. To address this, we shuffle the missing target genes and attach them to the predicted ranks to create a complete rank. For genetic perturbation data, we directly obtain the target gene rank from the results and then attach the shuffled missing genes to the rank.

To evaluate the performance of our model in ranking predicted therapeutic targets, we use the nDCG, a widely used metric in information retrieval adapted for our setting. The raw DCG score is computed by summing the relevance of each correct target based on its rank in the predicted list, with relevance weighted by a logarithmic discount factor to prioritize higher-ranked interventions. The gain function is defined as 1 − ranking/N, ensuring that the score reflects the quality of the ranking relative to the total number of nodes in the system. To ensure comparability across datasets or experiments with different numbers of correct interventions, DCG is normalized by the ideal DCG, which represents the maximum possible score for a perfect ranking. This results in nDCG values in the range [0, 1], where higher values indicate better ranking performance and alignment with the ground truth. This metric is particularly suited for our task as it emphasizes the accuracy of top-ranked interventions while accounting for the diminishing importance of lower-ranked predictions.

In addition, we report the proportion of test samples for which the predicted therapeutic targets set has at least one overlapping gene with the ground-truth therapeutic targets set (denoted as the percentage of accurately predicted samples). We also calculated the ratio of correct therapeutic targets that appeared in the top 1, top 10 and top 100 predicted therapeutic targets in the predicted rank, denoted as recall@1, recall@10 and recall@100, respectively.

To assess the overall performance across all experiments and metrics, we calculated an aggregated metric, averaging all metric values for each method.

In the benchmarking experiments, we performed a one-tailed pairwise t-test to evaluate whether PDGrapher significantly outperforms the competing methods. For other experiments, such as ablation studies, we used a two-tailed t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference in performance between the two models. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used for all tests. P values of perturbagen discovery and response prediction tests are presented in the Source data.

In the ablation study, we evaluated PDGrapher by optimizing it with only the supervision loss (PDGrapher-Super) and with only the cycle loss (PDGrapher-Cycle) across all chemical datasets. We then compared the perturbagen prediction performance of these submodels with that of PDGrapher (PDGrapher-SuperCycle). To train PDGrapher-Super and PDGrapher-Cycle, for each cell line, we set the number of layers to that which was found optimal for the validation set in the random splitting setting for PDGrapher-SuperCycle.

To test the sensitivity of PDGrapher on PPI networks, we used data from STRING (string-db.org), which provides a confidence score for each edge. The method for acquiring and preprocessing the PPI networks from STRING is detailed in Supplementary Note 3. For the sensitivity tests, we selected two cell lines: the chemical dataset MDAMB231 and the genetic dataset MCF7. For each cell line, we processed the data using the five PPI networks described in Supplementary Note 3. We optimized PDGrapher using 5-fold cross-validation as described in ‘Evaluation set-up' and optimized the number of GNN layers using the validation set in each split.

We generated three synthetic datasets:

Dataset with missing components removing bridge edges: this dataset is generated by progressively removing bridge edges from the existing PPI network. Bridge edges are those whose removal disconnects parts of the network. We vary the fraction of bridge edges removed in increments (from zero to one) and, for each fraction, we create a new edge list representing the modified network (Supplementary Table 5). This process ensures that different levels of network sparsity are introduced, affecting the overall structure and connectivity. We pair these networks with gene expression data from chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231.

Dataset with missing components removing random edges: this dataset is generated by progressively removing random edges from the existing PPI network. We vary the fraction of bridge edges removed in increments ([0, 0.1, … 0.6]) and, for each fraction, we create a new edge list representing the modified network. The number of remaining directed edges in the network upon random edge removal are 273,319, 242,912, 212,525, 182,177, 151,811 and 121,472.

Dataset with latent confounder noise: our starting point is the chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231 dataset. The synthetic datasets were constructed with varying levels of confounding bias introduced into the gene expression data. To simulate latent confounder effects, Gaussian noise with distinct means and variances was progressively added to random subsets of genes. Genes were grouped into 50 predefined subsets, each representing a latent confounder group. For each group, a Gaussian distribution was defined, with the mean drawn randomly from a uniform distribution in the range [0.5, 0.5] and the standard deviation [0.1, 0.5]. A fraction ([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]) of these subsets was randomly selected for perturbation and, for each gene in these subsets, its expression value was incremented by a value sampled from the respective Gaussian distribution. The perturbed gene expression values were then clamped between zero and one to ensure validity. This strategy ensures that different latent biases are introduced globally to gene expression patterns while maintaining controlled variability. We pair the noisy version of the gene expression data with the global unperturbed PPI network.

Let \({\mathcal{P}}\) be the set of predicted therapeutic targets, \({\mathcal{R}}\) be the set of ground-truth therapeutic targets, and spd(p, r) be the shortest-path distance between nodes in \({\mathcal{P}}\) and \({\mathcal{R}}\). We measure the closest distance between \({\mathcal{P}}\) and \({\mathcal{R}}\) as:

As part of our performance analyses, we measure the network proximity of PDGrapher and competing methods. We compared the distributions of network proximity values using a Mann–Whitney U-test, along with a rank-biserial correlation to measure effect size. To assess the uncertainty of effect sizes, we performed bootstrapping with 1,000 resamples to estimate 95% CIs.

The R2 values are calculated between the predicted and actual gene expression for the top 20 (a), 40 (b), and 80 (c) differentially expressed genes per cell line. Dotted lines represent the average performance across cell lines, dots indicate individual data points, and bars represent the average R2 across five data splits.

Source data

(a) PDGrapher provides accurate predictions for up to 1.09% more samples in the test set compared to the second-best baseline across Genetic-PPI datasets (genetic-PPI-ovary-ES2: 1.37% vs 0.28%). (b) scGen takes the leading position in nDCG across genetic-PPI datasets. (c) PDGrapher recovers ground-truth therapeutic targets at comparable rates as competing methods for genetic-PPI datasets. (d) PDGrapher has the best overall performance in perturbagen prediction within each cell line, evaluated by the averaged rank over multiple cell lines and metrics. The central line inside the box represents the median, while the top and bottom edges correspond to the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the quartiles. (e-g) Shown is the R2 of the response prediction module of PDGrapher compared to competing baselines for the top 20 (e), 40 (f), and 80 (g) differentially expressed (DE) genes.

Source data

Performance of sensitivity analyses evaluated by nDCG (a) and recalls (b-d) for datasets genetic-PPI-breast-MCF7 (left) and chemical-PPI-breast-MDAMB231 (right). The PPI used here is from STRING (string-db.org), which includes a confidence score for each edge. The edges are filtered by the 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 quantiles of the confidence scores as cutoffs, resulting in five PPI networks with 625,818, 582,305, 516,683, 443,051, and 296,451 edges, respectively. The results of the percentage of accurately predicted samples are shown in Figure 5b.

Source data

Performance of simulation analyses evaluated by percentage of accurately predicted samples (a) and nDCG (b) for the synthetic datasets with varying levels (0 to 1) of confounding bias introduced into the gene expression data. Gaussian noise, with distinct means and variances, was added progressively to random subsets of genes, simulating latent confounder effects in the treated gene expression data. The intensity of the confounding bias increases as more gene groups (representing network communities) are affected. This approach creates global, controlled variability in the gene expression data, paired with an unperturbed PPI network, allowing for the evaluation of algorithmic performance across different degrees of confounder noise. See Online Methods for more details on data generation.

Source data

Performance of simulation analyses evaluated by percentage of accurately predicted samples (a) and nDCG (b) for the synthetic datasets with a [0, 0.1, …, 1] fraction of bridge edges removed in the simulated PPI. Bridge edges are those with high connectivity in the network, which, if removed, increase the number of disconnected communities. The number of connected components in the network upon bridge edge removal is [90, 179, 268, 358,447, 536, 626, 715, 804, 894]. See more information in Supplementary Table S5.

Source data

Performance in ablation studies evaluated by percentage of accurately predicted samples (a) and nDCG (b) for the synthetic datasets with a [0, 0.1, … 0.6] fraction of random edges removed in the PPI. The number of remaining edges in the network upon random edge removal are [273,319; 242,912; 212,525; 182,177; 151,811; 121,472]. See the Method section for more details.

Source data

Boxplots display the evidence strength (a) and the number of evidence sources (b) for the top 10 predicted targets from PDGrapher versus 10 randomly selected genes. The central line inside the box represents the median, while the top and bottom edges correspond to the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the quartiles.

Source data

The Venn diagram (a) shows the number and ratio of unique and common predicted targets, while the bubble plot (b) shows the strength of evidence and the number of evidence sources for each cell line. The evidence strengths are the global association scores and overall evidence sources provided by Open Targets. Details of the scoring system are in Supplementary Note 2.

Source data

The strength of evidence in the cell lines with healthy control data is shown in the box plots. The strength of the evidence is the global association scores, which are based on all evidence sources provided by Open Targets. See details of the scoring system in Supplementary Note 2. The central line inside the box represents the median, while the top and bottom edges correspond to the first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the quartile.

Beyond their classical functions as redox cofactors, recent fundamental and clinical research has expanded our understanding of the diverse roles of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and energy homeostasis. Moreover, NAD and NADP influence numerous diseases as well as the processes of aging, and are emerging as targets for clinical intervention. Here, we summarize safety, bioavailability and efficacy data from NAD+-related clinical trials, focusing on aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the established NAD+ precursors nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, newer compounds such as nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, and emerging precursors. We also discuss technological advances including in industrial-scale production and real-time detection, which are facilitating NAD+ research and clinical translation. Finally, we emphasize the need for further large-scale studies to determine optimal dose, administration routes and frequency, as well as long-term safety and interindividual variability in response.

Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are effective targeted therapeutics but are limited in their ability to incorporate less-potent payloads, varied drug mechanisms of action, different drug release mechanisms and tunable drug-to-antibody ratios. Here we introduce a technology to overcome these limitations called ‘antibody–bottlebrush prodrug conjugates' (ABCs). An ABC consists of an IgG1 monoclonal antibody covalently conjugated to the terminus of a compact bivalent bottlebrush prodrug that has payloads bound through cleavable linkers and polyethylene glycol branches. This design enables the synthesis of ABCs with tunable average drug-to-antibody ratios up to two orders of magnitude greater than those of traditional ADCs. We demonstrate the functional flexibility and manufacturing efficiency of this technology by synthesizing more than 10 different ABCs targeting either HER2 or MUC1 using drugs with potencies spanning several orders of magnitude as well as imaging agents for ABC visualization and photocatalysts for proximity-based labeling of the ABC interactome. ABCs display high target engagement, high cell uptake and improved efficacy in tumor models compared to conventional HER2-targeted ADCs, suggesting promise for clinical translation.

Quantification of cell uptake based on mean fluorescence intensity from flow cytometry (n = 3 biological replicates). e. and f. Flow cytometry histograms (The x-axis represents the Cy5.5 fluorescence intensity) and quantification, respectively, for cell uptake studies comparing site-specific Cy5.5-HER2 to stochastically functionalized lysine-based Cy5.5-HER2 ABC with BAR of 1 (BT474 cells, 20 µg/mL, 60 min incubation). Both ABCs have the same 5% Cy5.5 concentration. ABCK is the lysine-conjugated Cy5.5-HER2 ABC prepared from commercial Trastuzumab. We note that this ABC was stored at 4 °C for ~1.5 years prior to this study, demonstrating excellent long-term storage stability. T-ABCK is a stochastic Lys conjugate prepared using the engineered Trastuzumab designed for cysteine conjugation; this construct is designed to rule out differences in cell uptake between Lys-conjugated commercial Trastuzumab and the engineered antibody. Finally, T-ABCC is the site-specific cysteine conjugate Cy5.5-HER2. Results are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3 biological replicates). Statistical analysis was done using a 2-tailed t-test. For these statistical tests, NS denotes non-significant; **, P < 0.01.

Confocal fluorescence images of BT-474 cells incubated with “theranostic” ABC SN38-Cy5.5-HER2 (50 μg/mL) for different times. White arrows point to cell nuclei where SN38 has localized following release from the ABC. In panels a and b, 4 h + 24 h and 4 h + 72 h mean that the cells were incubated with Cy5.5-HER2 or SN38-Cy5.5-HER2, respectively, for 4 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS buffer three times and further incubated for an additional 24 h or 72 h before imaging. Two independent experiments were performed with similar results.

First, ABCs bind to the cell surface through antibody-antigen interactions (upper left). Then, bound ABCs enter the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the endosome or lysosome, covalently attached payloads are released and subsequently diffuse to regions of the cell (for example, the nucleus or cytosol) to perform their MoA.

No sign of toxicity was observed in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, supporting a good safety profile. b. Xenografts with different magnifications. Tumor cells were only visible in the PBS, MMAE-BP, and MMAE-IgG1 groups. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with MMAE-based constructs (5 mg/kg mAb; 1.7 mg/kg MMAE per dose). Mice were dosed once a week for a total of 4 doses as illustrated via green arrows in panel a of Fig. 3. Scale bar = 300 μm. For each representative histology image, tissue sections from 4 mice were analyzed independently, with 3 slices examined per mouse, yielding similar results across all samples.

Download episode two of Self Correction

In 2016, Brian Wansink wrote a blog post that prompted scientific sleuths to investigate his work. They found evidence of data manipulation, and, after several news articles and two investigations by his institution, he was found to have committed misconduct, as defined by Cornell University. His work had been used to inform US policy around food, much of which has now been thrown into question.

Cases like this are rare, but science is not immune to misconduct. The rise in ‘paper mills' — organizations that produce questionable or fake papers that they sell authorships on — has led some to worry that misconduct is on the rise and that a proportion of the scientific literature cannot be trusted.

In episode two of Self Correction, we explore how researchers are responding to the problem of research misconduct. We discuss how difficult it is to determine the prevalence of misconduct, and how sleuths, journalists and research-integrity institutions are fighting back.

Global social-media platform LinkedIn is used by scientists to make connections and advance their careers. Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty

“I'm not looking to go viral,” says Sharon Obasi of her use of LinkedIn. “I'm looking just to be authentic, make connections and see how other people are approaching similar topics.”

Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, started using the global professional social-networking site more in the past few years as she took on extra administrative responsibilities in her department. “It was really a chance for me to find people who are in similar roles, in small institutions — a way to find community. But once I started posting and interacting, I realized it was much more than that,” she says. “I call it my 24/7, 365 scientific conference. It's a really great way to engage in science and scholarship in a much more public way.”

Obasi is one of around one billion registered users of LinkedIn, which turned 22 years old in May. The platform is becoming increasingly popular, with some attributing its recent growth to the decline of the social-media platform X, which shed 11 million users in the European Union alone between October 2024 and March 2025.

Nature's Careers team spoke to Obasi and seven other researchers about why they love LinkedIn, and how other scientists can use it to their advantage.

Teaching researchers how to use LinkedIn is part of Hannah Roberts's role as a careers coach in Macclesfield, UK. She specializes in helping women who work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, many of whom have little time to focus on career-development activities, she says. Roberts, who completed a PhD in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Manchester, UK, surveyed 3,000 women about their careers and found that 85% could benefit from using LinkedIn more. To use it to its full potential, Roberts says, people should have more than 1,000 contacts, and to get there, they need to be “intentional about evolving their network”.

To do so, Roberts recommends that researchers devote an hour per week to career-development activities, and make a special effort on LinkedIn as part of this (see ‘Six LinkedIn lessons from those in the know'). She suggests: “Set a timer for 15 minutes and connect with ten relevant people for your next job step”, whether that be making partnerships, finding collaborators or raising your profile to help secure future roles.

Seasoned users offer their top tips for getting the best out of the professional-networking platform.

“Pick a strategy for the next six months,” advises science-careers coach Hannah Roberts, who is based in Macclesfield, UK. Maybe it's to get a job or to find collaborators. You don't have to stick with it forever, just choose what feels right for now.

Your personal page on LinkedIn is what potential collaborators and employers will see. “Ensure that all the sections of your LinkedIn profile are complete and up to date,” says Roberts.

Follow people who are relevant to your line of work, but be judicious about who you connect with, says Ruth Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Those connections determine what shows up in your feed, she says, “If I'm randomly connecting with people, that's a problem — because garbage in, garbage out.”

Investing time on the site will pay dividends. For some, this means scheduling posts to ensure a regular output. For Elena Hoffer, who runs a professional-resources business in Stockholm, it means wading into conversations on her posts. “Don't post and ghost,” she suggests. “When I post, I always comment in the first hour, just to get the discussion going.”

“Putting yourself out there” is key on LinkedIn, says Sharon Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney — although this is something scientists aren't always trained to do. Remember that your input is valuable, even in discussions with luminaries in your field. “You might have a perspective that is not amplified or not centred — you might have an unusual take.”

When connecting with someone you don't know, try to build a relationship before asking for anything. “I get a lot of direct messages from people who I have no rapport with. Nothing has been built up, and instantly they will ping me a message about something that's irrelevant, or ask me for a job,” says Roberts. “It's a bit like jumping to ‘will you marry me?' before we've even exchanged a word.”

She also suggests commenting on five posts each week, so that “people see your name, your picture and your LinkedIn headline”, adding: “If you're employing that strategy every time you go on LinkedIn, you can massively extend that network in a short space of time. Consistency of action makes a big change.”

Once you've built up a strong network of connections, Roberts says that more behind-the-scenes networking can begin, including informal conversations and making yourself known to organizations that interest you the most.

Some people take a less-formal approach. Elena Hoffer co-founded the firm Alma.Me, in Stockholm, to help early-career researchers to transition out of academia. Hoffer, who has a PhD in medical sciences from the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and more than 100,000 LinkedIn followers says: “I always say, ‘do what fits you'. I never plan my content... I just need to feel it, you know?”

Ruth Gotian, whose 2022 book The Success Factor investigates how to achieve peak business performance based on her discussions with astronauts and Nobel laureates, doesn't recommend setting yourself targets for LinkedIn activity. Instead, she suggests fitting it in where you can around your existing work: “I tell people to definitely do it during their non-peak performance hours,” says Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

“Networking is so weird, because it's awkward,” says Vanesa Ayala-Núñez, an oncology researcher at the St Gallen branch of Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. “It's not so easy to connect with someone who you don't know.” To get around this, Ayala-Núñez sought common ground. As a Mexican, she says, speaking to other Europe-based Latin American women at science conferences and networking events “opened a lot of doors for me, because immediately you create a connection with this person — we have a lot of things in common. We have gone through a lot of similar experiences”.

She mirrored this approach on LinkedIn, being guided by people's names, or where they studied. Writing messages to potential connections in Spanish and highlighting the things they had in common helped Ayala-Núñez to build a strong professional network. “You never know who can eventually help you,” she says.

Gotian's approach is similar. “To me, LinkedIn is like air,” she says. “I use it all the time. If I'm going to meet with someone, I need some background information, and the first place I go to is LinkedIn, because what I want to do immediately is establish a connection with someone.” She might find common ground on the basis of someone's education, hometown or work history, “and that just kicks the conversation off”.

Gotian emphasizes that developing personal connections is key to professional networking. When approaching people, “you don't want to sound like a salesperson, and you certainly don't want to sound transactional. You want to build a relationship. People like to work with those who they know, like and trust”.

Gotian recommends the ‘24/7/30 networking model': “Twenty-four hours after you meet someone, you connect with them, and you do it as a personal connection. ‘It was so great chatting with you. I hope you have a great time on that ski holiday you talked about.' Seven days later, you connect again with a thoughtful comment.” This could be sending an article about something you discussed when you met, for example.

“Then 30 days later, you're following up”, sending your new connection an article or a podcast or mentioning a discussion you had that made you think of them. “You're always circling back to that conversation. You have not asked for a thing. You're just building up the ‘know, like and trust' factor, and then obviously engaging with their content in a thoughtful way.”

This direct approach might make some researchers uncomfortable, but Gotian says it's just like building a friendship. “Remember you're not asking for anything. If anything, you're helping the other person.”

Gotian cautions against using an overly serious tone. “Because if you make it too formal and stuffy, transactional and get right to business, it's a real turn off.”

So now that you're using LinkedIn regularly, how should you act when you're there? “You want to come through as authentically as possible,” says Lucy Lawrence, who works in science communication in London. She advises researchers to adopt a confident attitude and not to copy others' approaches too closely. “Just because it's working well for someone else on LinkedIn, it doesn't mean it's going to translate for you.” For Lawrence, who switched to science communication after completing a biomedical science degree at Nottingham Trent University, UK, in 2015, her authenticity comes from a genuine enthusiasm for the science that she writes about.

“I'm a yapper and I just really like speaking to people,” she says. Posting on her blog and on LinkedIn gave her an opportunity to talk publicly about science that she found inspiring.

“I grew my account to about 14,000 followers in three years just by being me and talking about things that I think are really interesting. Almost as if I'm talking to one of my friends: ‘Oh my God, this is really cool. Have you heard about this?'”

Being passionate about his research area also helped electrochemist Jyotisman Rath to reap benefits on LinkedIn. Rath posted daily for 100 days on topics ranging from a battery trivia challenge to sustainability, climate change, energy and the broader field of electrochemistry during his master's degree at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, hoping that the daily target would help him stick to posting.

The task revealed to him just how many scientists are active on LinkedIn. “Perhaps they don't post a lot or comment a lot, but they do definitely read people's posts,” says Rath, who is now doing a PhD at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Daily posting enabled him to initiate conversations in comments and private messages, prompting discussion by asking others their opinions on the things he was posting about.

Rath communicated with senior figures in his research field, as well as raising his profile, which resulted in an internship with a start-up company working on innovative battery materials, something he attributes to his frequent posts. “I was able to contact them during my challenge, then they saw what I'm doing and my ideas,” he says.

Rath was also selected to join the Indian cohort of the ten-week LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022. It offers a small stipend and training on how to build engaged communities.

For some, being authentic means being open about your personal life, even on a platform that is considered more professional than, say, X or Instagram.

Siddharth Kankaria, a social-sciences researcher and science communicator in Kolkata, India, says LinkedIn is now his “primary social-media outlet”, making him inclined to share personal content there.

What do children's building blocks and quantum computing have in common? The answer is modularity. It is difficult for scientists to build quantum computers monolithically - that is, as a single large unit. Quantum computing relies on the manipulation of millions of information units called qubits, but these qubits are difficult to assemble. The solution? Finding modular ways to construct quantum computers. Like plastic children's bricks that lock together to create larger, more intricate structures, scientists can build smaller, higher quality modules and string them together to form a comprehensive system.

Recognizing the potential of these modular systems, researchers from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have presented an enhanced approach to scalable quantum computing by demonstrating a viable and high-performance modular architecture for superconducting quantum processors. Their work, published in Nature Electronics, expands on previous modular designs and paves the way toward scalable, fault-tolerant and reconfigurable quantum computing systems.

Monolithic superconducting quantum systems are limited in size and fidelity, which predicts scientists' rate of success in performing logical operations. A fidelity of one signifies no mistakes; as such, researchers want to achieve a fidelity as close to one as possible. Compared to these limited monolithic systems, modularity enables system scalability, hardware upgrades, and tolerance to variability, making it a more attractive option for building system networks.

"We've created an engineering-friendly way of achieving modularity with superconducting qubits," said Wolfgang Pfaff, an assistant professor of physics and the senior author of the paper. "Can I build a system that I can bring together, allowing me to manipulate two qubits jointly so as to create entanglement or gate operations between them? Can we do that at a very high quality? And can we also have it such that we can take it apart and put it back together? Typically, we only find out that something went wrong after putting it together. So we would really like to have the ability to reconfigure the system later."

By constructing a system where two devices are connected with superconducting coaxial cables to link qubits across modules, Pfaff's team demonstrated ~99% SWAP gate fidelity, representing less than 1% loss. Their ability to connect and reconfigure separate devices with a cable while retaining high quality provides novel insight to the field in designing communication protocols.

"Finding an approach that works has taken a while for our field," Pfaff said. "Many groups have figured out that what we really want is this ability to stitch bigger and bigger things together through cables, and at the same time reach numbers that are good enough to justify scaling. The problem was just finding the right combination of tools."

Moving forward, the Grainger engineers will turn their focus toward scalability, attempting to connect more than two devices together while retaining the ability to check for errors.

"We have good performance," Pfaff said. "Now we need to put it to the test and say, is it really going forward? Does it really make sense?"

As every bodybuilder knows, a deep, restful sleep boosts levels of growth hormone to build strong muscle and bone and burn fat. And as every teenager should know, they won't reach their full height potential without adequate growth hormone from a full night's sleep.

But why lack of sleep -- in particular the early, deep phase called non-REM sleep -- lowers levels of growth hormone has been a mystery.

In a study published in the current issue of the journal Cell, researchers from University of California, Berkeley, dissect the brain circuits that control growth hormone release during sleep and report a novel feedback mechanism in the brain that keeps growth hormone levels finely balanced.

The findings provide a map for understanding how sleep and hormone regulation interact. The new feedback mechanism could open avenues for treating people with sleep disorders tied to metabolic conditions like diabetes, as well as degenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," said study first author Xinlu Ding, a postdoctoral fellow in UC Berkeley's Department of Neuroscience and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. "We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."

Because growth hormone regulates glucose and fat metabolism, insufficient sleep can also worsen risks for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The sleep-wake cycle

The neurons that orchestrate growth hormone release during the sleep-wake cycle -- growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons and two types of somatostatin neurons -- are buried deep in the hypothalamus, an ancient brain hub conserved in all mammals. Once released, growth hormone increases the activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus, an area in the brainstem involved in arousal, attention, cognition and novelty seeking. Dysregulation of locus coeruleus neurons is implicated in numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders.

"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," said Daniel Silverman, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow and study co-author. "There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type. This circuit could be a novel handle to try to dial back the excitability of the locus coeruleus, which hasn't been talked about before."

The researchers, working in the lab of Yang Dan, a professor of neuroscience and of molecular and cell biology, explored the neuroendocrine circuit by inserting electrodes in the brains of mice and measuring changes in activity after stimulating neurons in the hypothalamus with light. Mice sleep for short periods -- several minutes at a time -- throughout the day and night, providing many opportunities to study growth hormone changes during sleep-wake cycles.

Using state-of-the-art circuit tracing, the team found that the two small-peptide hormones that control the release of growth hormone in the brain -- GHRH, which promotes release, and somatostatin, which inhibits release -- operate differently during REM and non-REM sleep. Somatostatin and GHRH surge during REM sleep to boost growth hormone, but somatostatin decreases and GHRH increases only moderately during non-REM sleep to boost growth hormone.

Released growth hormone regulates locus coeruleus activity, as a feedback mechanism to help create a homeostatic yin-yang effect. During sleep, growth hormone slowly accumulates to stimulate the locus coeruleus and promote wakefulness, the new study found. But when the locus coeruleus becomes overexcited, it paradoxically promotes sleepiness, as Silverman showed in a study published earlier this year.

"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system: Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness," Silverman said. "Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair and metabolic health."

Because growth hormone acts in part through the locus coeruleus, which governs overall brain arousal during wakefulness, a proper balance could have a broader impact on attention and thinking.

"Growth hormone not only helps you build your muscle and bones and reduce your fat tissue, but may also have cognitive benefits, promoting your overall arousal level when you wake up," Ding said.

The work was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which until this year supported Dan as an HHMI investigator, and the Pivotal Life Sciences Chancellor's Chair fund. Dan is the Pivotal Life Sciences Chancellor's Chair in Neuroscience. Other co-authors of the paper are Peng Zhong, Bing Li, Chenyan Ma, Lihui Lu, Grace Jiang, Zhe Zhang, Xiaolin Huang, Xun Tu and Zhiyu Melissa Tian of UC Berkeley; and Fuu-Jiun Hwang and Jun Ding of Stanford University.

Mass General Brigham researchers identified seven molecules in the blood linked to excessive daytime sleepiness, including factors related to diet and hormones.

Approximately one in three Americans reports experiencing overwhelming drowsiness during the day -- a condition known as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). EDS is linked to an increased risk of serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center identifies several molecules in the blood, known as metabolites, that are linked to EDS. Findings suggest that risk of the condition may be influenced by both internal body processes, such as hormone levels, and external factors such as diet. Results are published in Lancet eBioMedicine.

"Our study suggests diet and genetics may play an important role in EDS," said lead author Tariq Faquih, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. "As we learn what's happening biologically, we are beginning to understand how and why EDS occurs, the early signs that someone might have it, and what we can do to help patients."

Researchers collected data on 877 metabolites, naturally occurring molecules in the body influenced by diet and hormones. The team used blood samples from 6,000 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. The team also used data from a questionnaire that assesses how often a person dozes off during the day in various scenarios. The team replicated the findings in The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study and studies in the UK and Finland.

They identified seven metabolites associated with EDS. An additional three metabolites were identified that varied by sex. The team found that omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are commonly found in foods that make up Mediterranean-like diets, were associated with lower risk of EDS. Other metabolites, such as tyramine, which is found in fermented and overripe foods, were associated with increased daytime sleepiness, particularly in men. Sex steroid metabolites, such as progesterone, were associated with sleep-related processes such as melatonin production.

Researchers note that the results suggest potential treatment targets for EDS and that dietary changes or medications may lead to better treatment. They also note some limitations to the study, including difficulty in interpreting exact values of metabolites and using a sleep questionnaire instead of bringing participants into a sleep lab for tests.

Future directions could include conducting a clinical trial to see if dietary changes or supplements can help reduce daytime sleepiness. Additionally, the authors identified some unknown metabolites that they plan to explore further.

"Conducting a clinical trial would be a big next step and could help us understand if omega-3s and omega-6s obtained from diet could help lower risk of EDS," said Faquih.

Authorship: In addition to Faquih, MGB authors include Kaitlin S. Potts, Pavithra Nagarajan, Hanna M. Ollila, Tianyi Huang, Clary B. Clish, Susan Redline, Tamar Sofer, and Heming Wang.

REDMOND, Wash. — AI will transform healthcare in the next 1-2 years by connecting directly to personal medical records to give patients new levels of health insights.

That was one of the key predictions from a session with former Microsoft executive Terry Myerson and current Microsoft Health & Life Sciences leader Mary Varghese Presti on Tuesday morning at the Microsoft Alumni Connect 2025 conference in Redmond, hosted by the Microsoft Alumni Network. 

People will be able to connect their personal medical records to AI and “have a conversation that includes all of the knowledge of the published literature,” predicted Myerson, a former Microsoft Windows and Exchange leader who is now CEO of Seattle-area health data technology company Truveta. 

For example, Myerson said, when faced with a decision about a surgery, a patient could use the technology to understand the potential outcomes based on data from other people with similar profiles. 

“I think a lot of things are going to change,” Myerson said. “That empowerment of the individual just seems so righteous to me. … I think that's single-digit years away.”

Varghese Presti said she shared that optimism, explaining that while the healthcare industry has tried to solve its data challenges for many years, today's artificial intelligence models finally make that transformation possible. 

“Where I do get optimistic is that the AI models these days are ubiquitous. They're accessible. They're making really non-linear improvements in terms of what's possible,” she said.

However, both speakers acknowledged the immense challenges created by the structural complexity of healthcare. 

Varghese Presti drew a sharp contrast with other sectors: “In every other industry, the value chain is super clean. In healthcare, it's so discombobulated.” With health systems operating on thin margins, she said, any new technology must have an ROI that is “so obvious, because they don't have a lot of money.”

Myerson credited Apple for making real progress in giving people access to their personal medical records on their phones. He said the company has been funding lobbying, creating the necessary APIs, and pressuring API providers to make health data more accessible through its Apple Health app.

Myerson said that Truveta's platform provides a crucial missing piece: data on actual patient outcomes. He explained that the company was founded to address the critical data shortages exposed during the pandemic by creating a massive dataset for research.

Truveta works with its healthcare system partners to gather clinical data from the medical records of roughly one in three Americans. This data, he said, is completely de-identified to protect patient privacy before it is used to help fill critical knowledge gaps in patient care.

Varghese Presti, who has spent 30 years in healthcare, joined Microsoft through the acquisition of Nuance Communications, which included the well-known Dragon Medical speech-to-text software. The idea is to give physicians a chance to have more natural, face-to-face interactions with patients. 

Microsoft has expanded this as part of the Dragon Copilot, an ambient AI that listens to the doctor-patient conversation, intelligently filters the dialogue, and automatically creates the clinical notes by the end of the visit. Microsoft is now expanding this AI technology to help bedside nurses.

Myerson said Microsoft has an advantage over rivals in at least one respect: it is not a direct competitor to the healthcare systems it serves. He contrasted the Redmond company in this way with Google, which is often seen as a consumer company, and Amazon, which is viewed as a direct healthcare competitor through Amazon One Medical and other initiatives.

At yet another splashy event, Apple on Tuesday introduced its latest lineup of iPhones: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a new slimmer version dubbed the iPhone Air. The “Air” branding is meant to bring to mind other lightweight — and sometimes less expensive — Apple products like the MacBook Air and iPad Air. But it also recalls a time when smartphone makers were chasing an ever-thinner phone. In the AI era, however, it's not necessarily the device's size that matters; it's what the software it runs can do.

On this front, Apple has lagged its competitors. 

At its iPhone 17 event, the company only referenced AI technology a few times: to rehash some updates announced in June at WWDC, like Visual Intelligence and its on-device models, and in some aspects of its camera upgrades, like the iPhone 17's front camera, which it calls Center Stage.

The most compelling use of AI wasn't even introduced as a phone upgrade; it was the AI-powered Live Translation feature coming to Apple's AirPods 3.

There was no mention of Siri at all, AI-powered or otherwise. 

Much has been made about how Apple's miscalculation on AI could negatively affect its industry standing and future success. Meanwhile, Google last month rolled out its latest release of an AI-powered Android phone with its Pixel 10, as iPhone owners still await an AI Siri that's been delayed until 2026.

Until now, Apple has only released what could be considered baseline AI features for its devices, like AI writing tools, summarization, generative AI images (which some complain are not very good), live translation, visual search, and Genmoji, among others. Yet a digital assistant that understands a wide range of questions — without deferring to ChatGPT — or one that can provide further context from your iPhone apps remains overdue.

Recently, it was reported that Apple is looking to third parties to help it catch up in the AI race. An AI-enhanced Siri could be running some other technology — like Google Gemini — under the hood. 

At first glance, this delay, combined with the decision to rely on a third party — or even, possibly a sizable acquisition — seems like it could spell bad news for Apple. However, Apple's decision to outsource some of the phone's AI technology could actually become a selling point for consumers. 

Today's iPhone owners often swap out Apple's technology for Google's by opting for Gmail, Google Drive and Docs, Google Maps, and Chrome over Apple's own apps like Mail, its iWork suite, Apple Maps, and Safari, for example. When people search the web, they turn to Google's Search app, not Apple's built-in Spotlight search, despite its many integrations over the years to offer basic facts and answers, leveraging sources like Wikipedia. Why, then, shouldn't they be able to use Google's AI technology, too?

If Apple does proceed with a third-party deal to integrate AI into its devices, it may work out to be an even bigger win for iPhone owners. It would mean that high-performing AI technology would be integrated into the device more natively. It would feel more seamless, more a part of the iPhone experience itself than simply running an AI app. And Apple could get there without having to invest as heavily in the infrastructure required to compete in the AI race, which is good for the company's (already healthy) bottom line. 

Plus, given the speed with which AI technology has been evolving, this design would leave room for Apple to swap out models or expand support to include others, as AI companies edge themselves ahead of others.

The result for consumers would be the best of both worlds: the aesthetics and hardware quality (thinness and all!) of the iPhone, with Google's technology (or Anthropic's or OpenAI's) powering some of the key AI components. That could also be beneficial to Apple's overall brand.

It also means that the look-and-feel of updated iPhones themselves and their hardware advances will continue to drive sales and upgrades, allowing Apple to do what it does best: focus on build quality, camera improvements, privacy-preserving tech, intentional software design changes like Liquid Glass — and yes, super thin phones.

Apple could continue to market itself as a best-in-class hardware maker first, not an AI device maker; customers could still long for the latest iPhones, as always, without having to sacrifice the latest technology advances when they make the choice to buy a phone from Apple.

Of course, this scenario only plays out if and when Apple opts to launch a version of Siri that runs a third-party's AI technology to enhance its own. (Or if it buys an AI company). But if Apple decides to only rely on its Apple Intelligence offerings without getting them up to speed quickly, the outcome could be much different.

Apple Watches don't change much year to year, although the last few updates have left users without landmark blood oxygen sensing tech for months. It was a change in the wrong direction, but at least it didn't last for long. At its Tuesday “Awe Dropping” product showcase, Apple seemed to suggest that with Apple Watch Series 11, wearables fans can hope both past and all-new health monitoring features will stick around for good.

The Series 10 Apple Watches were based on new, slightly thinner frames with redesigned internals and a new display. The new Series 11 smartwatch is more of a refresh (even if last year's update didn't feel quite as significant as some hoped for). The square-shaped watch still comes in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm. Those looking for a little more flair on their wrist could opt for the gold, silver, and slate colors, plus all the various sport and fabric band options. The Nike Sport Loop also now has a version with yarn woven into the fabric, as if your grandmother came along and blinged out your new smartwatch.

Less than a month ago, Apple brought back its blood oxygen sensing technology to the latest Apple watches. Apple removed the feature in January 2024, following a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo. Apple's heart rate feature monitors for hypertension—AKA high blood pressure—and offers alerts in case the watch spots any abnormalities. The hypertension monitor works in the background, and it isn't designed to be a foolproof way of catching every potential instance of hypertension. Apple is still awaiting full clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The watch also includes a new sleep score feature that will let you know how well you've been snoozing, then offers advice for how to improve your slumber.

If you had to stare real hard to identify the tiny size differences between the Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10, you'd have a much harder time spotting distinctions between last year's and this year's wearables. The major upgrades on the surface are improved scratch resistance and a better battery, promising 24 hours of battery life. Those models with a titanium frame will still use a sapphire front crystal material, which should be even more resistant than the base model's “Ion-X” glass.

While the Cupertino, California tech giant didn't have much to share about the new watch's internals, the big news is the introduction of a new modem for 5G connectivity. Apple said it redesigned its cellular antenna to hopefully increase coverage across more bands. If you want the Apple Watch Series 11, you'll have to pony up $400 for the cellular version or $500 for the watch with 5G capabilities. The Titanium version starts at $700 and comes with both GPS and cellular.

The Apple Watch Series 11, in both 42mm and 46mm, is available for preorder starting Tuesday and should be on store shelves starting Sept. 19.

Apple announced a suite of four new iPhones today, and with them, new processors to power the devices. Additionally, the company also has new networking and cellular chips.The phones include the iPhone 17, iPhone Air (a new 5.6-mm thin design), iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The base iPhone 17 will be powered by the A19 system on a chip, while the rest of the lineup relies on the more powerful A19 Pro. These chips are likely built on TSMC's latest N3P process node, which is also expected to be used for Apple's upcoming M5 chips for iPads and Macs.

The A19 boasts six CPU cores and five GPU cores. The processor has four efficiency cores and two performance cores, while the GPU continues advancements in hardware-accelerated ray tracing, mesh shading, and MetalFX upscaling.

The A19 Pro will power the new iPhone Air alongside the iPhone 17 Pro line. Like the A19, its six-core CPU utilizes two performance and four efficiency cores. The performance cores have better branch prediction and increased front-end bandwidth, while the new efficiency cores have a 50% increase in last-level cache.

On the iPhone Air, there's a five-core GPU with the second generation of Apple's Dynamic Caching, with faster floating point math and better image compression. Each GPU core has its own Neural Accelerators, which Apple claimed allows for MacBook Pro-level performance in an iPhone.

The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max get a more powerful 6-core GPU. Apple is promising a 40% increase in sustained performance over the previous generation.

 




On the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, the chip will be cooled by a new thermal system in a unibody design. This should help disperse heat and avoid the problems that iPhone 15 Pro users remember from launch in 2023.The thermal system utilizes a vapor chamber filled with deionized water, which directs heat throughout the system. Apple says the aluminum unibody is 20 times better at cooling than the titanium used in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro. Unsurprisingly, Apple didn't compare the A19 Pro in the iPhone Air to the version in the 17 Pro and Pro Max, which have the vapor chamber and additional GPU core.

Apple is continuing its expansion into all of the chips in its phones. On the iPhone Air, Apple has built its own networking chip, N1. This chip will allow for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth connections, and Thread. The new N1 chip is found on all of Apple's latest iPhones.Complementing the iPhone Air's new A19 Pro is a new Apple-designed N1 chip. This chip takes over wireless duties, including Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support. Apple states that this integrated chip design will yield performance and efficiency benefits for functions such as AirDrop and Personal Hotspot.

Apple also announced an update to its in-house C1 modem, which was first introduced with the iPhone 16e. The new C1X modem promises up to a 2x boost in performance, but it still doesn't include high-bandwidth, high-capacity mmWave technology. The iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models still feature Qualcomm 5G modems, so they retain mmWave support. Apple also boasts of an improvement in efficiency with the C1X.

 




All of the iPhones will see pre-orders on Friday, with availability beginning on September 19. The iPhone 17 will start at $799, while the iPhone Air will begin at $999. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will start at $1,099 and $1,199, respectively. All of the phones will start with 256GB of storage. For the first time, the 17 Pro Max will also offer a 2TB option.

In addition to the iPhones, Apple today also announced the AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, And Apple Watch Ultra 3.

While the world focuses on Apple's latest slew of new products, we are taking a moment for the last bastion of Apple's proprietary past—the one remaining product with a Lightning connector that, somehow, Apple still sells.

We have previously lamented Apple's drawn-out transition to USB-C. It's been far from quick and far from straightforward, leaving a mess of dongles and confusion in its wake.

It was last year, at its September 2024 “Glowtime” event, that Apple made the move to change that, transitioning all of its newest products to USB-C. The following month, it—somewhat quietly—moved the remaining current-generation accessories, including the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad, over to USB-C.

By February this year, it had stopped selling the remaining Lightning-supporting iPhones—the iPhone SE (3rd Gen) and the iPhone 14 family—following the EU's ruling for all of its devices to move to a nonproprietary connector by 2025.

But one solitary device is still hanging on as the final Lightning product that Apple sells. That product is the Apple Pencil (1st Gen)—a product that was released 10 years ago, in 2015.

The decade-old Gen 1 Apple Pencil is the last product that Apple sells sporting the Lightning connector.

The Apple Pencil strategy has been pretty complicated, with Apple selling no less than four different models. The absence of backward compatibility of newer Pencils has kept the Gen 1 Pencil in the lineup to service the older Lightning-touting iPads—as well as being compatible with the 10th- and 11th-Gen USB-C iPads, for anyone who upgraded.

Apple generally supports its hardware with OS updates for five to seven years. Even though it no longer sells these products, Apple has confirmed that iPadOS 26 will be compatible with the iPad Air (3rd Gen) and iPad Mini (5th Gen), both released in 2019, and the iPad (8th and 9th Gen), released in 2020 and 2021, respectively. All of these only support the Apple Pencil (1st Gen), and none of the other Pencils above it, meaning it's seemingly a hard product for Apple to get rid of—despite its desperately aging connector.

Based on that five-to-seven-year timeline, that could mean the Lightning still has as many as three years left in Apple's inventory. Unless, of course, it makes the call to leave older iPad owners to the second-hand Pencil market, and finally retires Lightning for good.

Why spend more than $300 for an Apple Watch? Apple may have its wearables fans asking that question with the new Apple Watch SE. The third-gen update brings a host of upgrades, including a new screen and better performance from a new chip. It may not have all the health tracking features of the mainline wearables, but that may simply make it a better option for most people.

The last SE (2nd-gen) arrived in 2022 alongside the Apple Watch Series 8 and the first Apple Watch Ultra. The revised edition revealed Tuesday at Apple's “Awe Dropping” event may look closer to the regular Apple Watch Series 11 than the older 2020s-era wearables. The new smartwatch sports an aluminum frame, so it's closer to the premium feel of the other models. On the other hand, this new SE also supports the same 5G capabilities as the Apple Watch Series 11. The new SE is even closer to replacing a regular Apple Watch with an on-device Siri voice assistant and an always-on display.

With the upgraded chip, Apple promised the new device would be faster than the one from 2022 thanks to last year's S10 SiP, or system in a package. The device will still have the sleep apnea and sleep score features found on last year's Apple Watch and the Series 11, respectively. Better yet, it will have fast charging, promising 15 minutes of charging to get 8 hours of battery life. It includes temperature sensing and some of the “wrist flick” gestures for shuffling through apps or music.

You don't have to worry about a price bump like we saw from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 16e. The device starts at $250 for the 40mm version with GPS and comes in both a “midnight” and silver “starlight” aluminum case.

The Apple Watch SE starts at $250 for the 40mm and will be available for preorder Tuesday. It should start shipping by Sept 19.

This is a developing story.

Nature shows tend to have horror baked in. Sure, we watch them to be educated, but also for the alarmingly gasp-inducing, uncomfortably emotional moments: killer whales gobbling adorable baby seals, furious lions battling each other for supremacy, uncomfortably large spiders just being themselves… you know how it goes. Horror studio Blumhouse is leaning hard into that idea with Nightmares of Nature, a new documentary series coming to Netflix.

A joint production of Blumhouse Television and Plimsoll Productions, Nightmares of Nature has a Netflix-familiar narrator in Stranger Things‘ Maya Hawke. A press release teases it as a “natural history and horror series,” and further emphasizes the peril by noting “each season follows three animal characters facing all the horrors and monsters nature can throw at them.” Two seasons are arriving soon, each consisting of three 45-minute episodes.

Here's a trailer, followed by more details about the seasons: A Cabin in the Woods (we see what in the Evil Dead you did there, Blumhouse) and Lost in the Jungle.

Season one, A Cabin in the Woods, premieres September 30 and is “set in the perfectly haunting world of the North American woods. Our three characters (a soon-to-be-mother mouse, a young bachelor raccoon, and a froglet who has seen terrible things) quickly discover how scary the woods truly are and find themselves in search of sanctuary. They stumble upon an old cabin in the woods, thinking it a safe haven, they soon discover their nightmares have really only just begun…”

Hopefully, nobody gets trapped in a Deadite-infested basement. Then, October 28 brings season two, Lost in the Jungle. These episodes are “set deep in the creepy Central American rainforest, a place with more creative ways to die than anywhere else on Earth. For our three characters (a young opossum, a newly hatched iguana, and a feisty jumping spider) the nightmare of staying alive in the jungle escalates fast when they discover an abandoned laboratory deep in the jungle. And before they know it, lost in this unnatural labyrinth, with a new monster hiding behind every corner, they are in the struggle of their lives to get out before it is too late…”

I was already nervous about the spider element, but an abandoned laboratory? That is never good.

What do you think about Nightmares of Nature—intriguing, or a little bit over-gimmicky? The first season arrives September 30, followed by the second on October 28.

No more iPhone 17 leaks. At its annual fall Apple Event today, Apple announced the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max, running iOS 26 with Liquid Glass. The company also introduced the super-thin iPhone Air (yep, it's not called iPhone 17 Air) alongside new AirPods Pro 3. As part of the bonanza of new products, we also got several new Apple Watches: the Watch Series 11, new Watch SE, and Watch Ultra 3.

The iPhone 17 is on its own this year; there's no “17 Plus” to accompany it. Compared to the iPhone 16, Apple increased the display from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, matching the screen real estate of the iPhone 16 Pro. The screen can reach 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The glass on the display is made of “Ceramic Shield 2,” which Apple says is 3x more scratch-resistant than previous iPhones.

As the regular iPhone 17, there's again only two cameras on the rear instead of three—a 48-megapixel main camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide. The 18-megapixel front-facing camera has a new feature called Center Stage that lets you take horizontal selfies while holding the phone vertically.

Under the hood, the iPhone 17 is powered by the new A19 chip, which Apple says is… more powerful. Because, of course, it's more powerful. The device starts with 256GB of storage.

It'll be available in several colors, including a new lavender.

Apple says it's increased battery life—up to 8 hours longer than the iPhone 16—thanks to the A19 chip.

The iPhone 17 starts at $799 for 256GB of storage.

As you'd expect, Apple's top-of-the-line smartphones—the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max—are even more “pro” this time around, with an emphasis on beefed-up cameras and battery life.

Apple has ditched the titanium frame of the last two generations of iPhones for an aluminum one. The metal may not sound or feel as premium, but it has several advantages: it's a lighter material, a better thermal conductor, and easier to anodize for more vibrant colors. Although the iPhone 17 Pros are slightly thicker than the iPhone 16 Pros, they should run cooler because of a new vapor chamber cooling system afforded by the aluminum body. Optically, the aluminum frame means we have more fun colors this year, like Cosmic orange and blue.

There's also a new cutout on the back that's made of Ceramic Shield. This is for wireless charging. The front glass uses the more durable Ceramic Shield 2, just like iPhone Air.

The biggest upgrade to the iPhone 17 Pros is to the camera systems on the now considerably larger rectangular island that now occupies the backside's top. All three cameras now sport 48-megapixel resolutions, with the telephoto lens finally going high-res. Apple also bumped up the optical zoom for the telephoto cameras on both models from 5x to 8x, giving you more reach when zooming in from afar.  The Fusion Telephoto system can also zoom up to 40x digitally. Just like the iPhone 16 family of devices, the iPhone 17 Pros all have a touch-sensitive Camera Control button below the power button for controlling the camera. Like the iPhone 17, the 17 Pros also have a higher-resolution 18-megapixel selfie camera.

The screens on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are the same as before: 6.3 and 6.9 inches with 120Hz “ProMotion.” Powering the iPhone 17 Pros is the A19 Pro chip, Apple's most powerful phone chip to date. It's the same chip inside the new iPhone Air.

The iPhone 17 Pros come in three colors and start at $1,099 for 256GB of storage for the 17 Pro; the 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 for the same storage. Preorders start today with availability starting on Sept. 19.

Apple debuted the third-generation AirPods Pro at the “Awe-dropping” event on Tuesday, featuring heart-rate tracking, improved audio, and a smaller, more interactive charging case. 

It's been three years since Apple refreshed the AirPods Pro line, releasing the Pro 2 model in 2022. The new AirPods Pro are available for preorder today at a cost of $249. The headphones will arrive in stores on September 19.

One of the standout features of the AirPods Pro 3 is its heart-rate sensing capability, a first for the AirPods line. This addition will operate similarly to the Powerbeats Pro 2, using LED sensors to provide precise measurements. The collected data will sync with Apple's Fitness app.

The active noise cancellation, which reduces external noise, has been significantly improved. Apple says it removes twice the noise compared to Pro 2.

A noteworthy upcoming feature is a live translation capability, thanks to Apple's iOS 26 software update. This lets you have conversations in different languages, using your iPhone to translate while the phone plays one language and the AirPods handle the other.

Other notable updates include smaller, more comfortable earbuds. Apple now offers foam ear tips in five different sizes, and the company claims it's “the best-fitting AirPods.”

Although the current model represents a solid improvement, considerable speculation has circulated before the event about the potential release of a second version of the AirPods Pro 3.

This rumored high-end variant is expected to have a higher price point than the other version, with the significant hardware upgrade being an infrared camera capable of detecting hand gestures and delivering an improved spatial audio experience when used with Apple's Vision Pro headset. 

The second version of the Pro 3 model is predicted to launch in 2026.

Tesla is updating its utility-scale Megapack batteries as it seeks to stem the decline of its lucrative energy storage business.

The new battery product known as Megapack 3, which Tesla revealed late Monday, are a bid to lure utilities and data center developers that are desperate for power. Megapack 3 stores around 1 megawatt-hour more electricity than Tesla's largest existing offering and promises a longer lifespan.

Tesla also introduced Megablock, a grouping of four Megapack 3 units that can store 20 megawatt-hours, enough to run around 4,000 homes for four hours, the length of time such batteries are frequently used. The grouping should reduce installation times by 23% and construction times by up to 40%, the company said. Cells for the battery packs will be sourced from the U.S., Southeast Asia, and China.

By updating the thermal management system, Megapack 3 will be able to operate from –40˚ F to 140˚ F, specs that should cover just about everywhere on Earth.

Investors will have to wait a while to see any impact on Tesla's balance sheet, though. Both products will be manufactured in Tesla's Megafactory near Houston and won't enter production until the latter half of 2026. 

Tesla's energy storage business could use a shot in the arm after reporting two consecutive quarters of declining numbers this year. The company was the leading supplier of battery energy storage systems in 2024, though its lead was slipping even then, according to Wood Mackenzie. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the energy storage industry has been growing swiftly.

The new Houston factory will be capable of producing up to 50 gigawatt-hours per year of Megapack 3 and Megablock units. Last quarter, Tesla installed 9.6 gigawatt hours of stationary energy storage.

Tesla's solar and energy storage businesses would seem to have a built-in customer in CEO Elon Musk's other company, xAI. The AI company has added 168 Megapacks at its data center in South Memphis, Tennessee, though it's apparently exploring the addition of more dozens more gas turbines. No new battery additions have been reported.

Both the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D represent the pinnacle of AMD's desktop processor engineering, built on the sophisticated Zen 5 architecture fabbed on TSMC's advanced 4nm manufacturing process. These processors share the same foundational architecture but differ significantly in their core configurations and target use cases.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The 9950X3D is a dual-CCD powerhouse featuring 16 cores and 32 threads, while the 9800X3D adopts a streamlined single-CCD design with 8 cores and 16 threads. This architectural divergence creates distinct performance profiles, with the 9950X3D targeting users requiring substantial multi-threaded performance alongside gaming excellence, whereas the 9800X3D focuses exclusively on delivering optimal gaming performance without the complexity of a multi-die design.

The 9950X3D's dual-CCD configuration incorporates two separate 8-core complexes, with only one CCD receiving the 3D V-Cache treatment. This asymmetric design results in 128MB of layered L3 cache, creating a complex but powerful architecture that requires sophisticated thread scheduling. Thankfully its automated through AMD's innovative driver.

In contrast, the 9800X3D's single-CCD design features a uniform 8-core complex with 96MB of total L3 cache, providing consistent performance characteristics across all cores and simplifying both hardware design and driver optimization.

Clock speed specifications reveal differences between these processors, with the 9950X3D operating at a 4.3GHz base clock with boost capabilities reaching 5.7GHz, representing the highest boost clock in the X3D lineup. The 9800X3D, conversely, features a 4.7GHz base clock with boost frequencies of 5.2GHz.

The second-gen 3D V-Cache tech represents a revolutionary architectural advancement that marks a big improvement over their predecessors. Unlike previous X3D generations, where the 3D V-Cache was positioned above the CCD, both processors feature the cache positioned below the CCD, enabling direct thermal contact between the cores and the integrated heat spreader.

This design transformation dramatically improves thermal characteristics, allowing both processors to achieve full overclocking capabilities (a first for X3D processors) while maintaining higher boost frequencies than their predecessors. The thermal improvements are particularly significant for the 9950X3D, which maintains its 170W TDP despite its larger cache capacity.

Platform support and connectivity specifications show AMD's commitment to the AM5 ecosystem. Both CPUs drop into the AM5 socket (LGA 1718) and are compatible with the full range of AM5 chipsets, including A620, B650, B650E, X670, X670E, X870, X870E, B840, and B850. Memory support extends to DDR5 with official specifications up to 5600 MT/s, though both processors can achieve higher speeds through AMD EXPO memory overclocking technology.

The processors provide 24 usable PCIe 5.0 lanes from the CPU, four native USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and comprehensive storage support including NVMe RAID configurations. Power consumption differs significantly, with the 9950X3D coming with a 170W TDP compared to the 9800X3D's 120W TDP, reflecting the increased thermal and power demands of the dual-CCD configuration.

⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D

The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D share a common Zen 5 foundation but diverge in their feature sets to serve distinct purposes. On paper alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is more impressive due to its higher clocks and additional cores, thus taking this round.

While our in-depth Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reviews offer a more comprehensive analysis and our test system specs, in this section, we will focus on a gaming performance overview. The following benchmark graphs display average FPS and 1% lows for various games at 1080p. Using a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card ensures GPU limitations are removed, making this setup ideal for comparing pure CPU performance.

In our 16-game geometric mean at 1080p with High/Ultra settings, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D narrowly edges out the Ryzen 9 9950X3D with an average of 195.5 FPS versus 194.8 FPS, which is a negligible 0.4% difference. This parity stems from AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which minimizes latency in cache-sensitive titles.

However, the 9950X3D's higher core count rarely translates to gaming gains, as most games prioritize cache and clock speeds over core quantity. For example, in A Plague Tale: Requiem, the 9800X3D leads by 5.9% on average, likely due to its optimized single-CCD design reducing inter-core latency.

On the flip side, the 9950X3D pulls ahead in 1% lows according to our testing, scoring 136 FPS in the geomean compared to the 9800X3D's 134 FPS, gaining a minor 1.4% advantage. This reflects its superior multi-core capabilities, mitigating stutter during asset streaming or background tasks.

Moving on to individual results, the picture becomes even more nuanced and needs analysis on a case-by-case basis. In our testing, we typically see that cache-bound games favor the 9800X3D. Minecraft RT shows a 10.9% average FPS lead. In Starfield, the Ryzen 7 leads by 1.7% in average FPS.

On the contrary, heavily multi-threaded titles seem to lean toward the 9950X3D. In Baldur's Gate 3, the Ryzen 9 leads by about 2.6%, exploiting its dual-CCD design to gain an advantage in this title.

The 9800X3D dominates efficiency, achieving 2.46 FPS/W versus the 9950X3D's 1.61 FPS/W, which is a tremendous 52.8% improvement. It consumes just 79.4W under load according to our testing, while the 9950X3D draws 52% more power at 120.9W. This gap arises from the 9800X3D's monolithic 8-core design, which avoids the power overhead of the 9950X3D's dual-CCD configuration.

The 9800X3D also offers superior value for money, gaining a staggering 50% advantage in our FPS per dollar chart. Priced 33% lower, the Ryzen 7 achieves almost the same average FPS in our Geomean as the 9950X3D. Even in titles where the 9950X3D wins, like Far Cry 6, the 9800X3D's cost efficiency remains unmatched. The 9950X3D does not justify its price premium in the gaming category when compared to its younger sibling.

⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D

Unless you are pairing gaming with heavy streaming or rendering, the 9800X3D's cache-optimized design and aggressive pricing make it AMD's gaming champion.

Ultimately, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D emerges as the smarter gaming investment. It matches the 9950X3D in average framerates while excelling in efficiency and value. The 9950X3D's edge in 1% lows is nice, but it cannot be justified by its hefty price premium.

According to our benchmark results, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D demonstrates a substantial productivity advantage over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D across both single-threaded and multi-threaded workloads.

In the aggregated single-threaded geomean, the 9950X3D scores 258, while the 9800X3D trails at 243, leaving a 5.8% performance gap. For multi-threaded geomean, the disparity widens dramatically: the 9950X3D achieves 635 versus the 9800X3D's 367, translating to a 42% delta. This underscores the 9950X3D's superior power budget and higher core count.

The 9950X3D's 16-core design obliterates the 9800X3D's 8-core setup in heavily parallelized tasks. Cinebench 2024 multi-core reveals a massive 43% performance delta; meanwhile, the POV-Ray multi-core test exacerbates this further as the 9950X3D scores a whopping 69% higher than the 9800X3D.

Real-world encoding tests like HandBrake x265 further validate this trend, with the 9950X3D achieving a 63% leap over the 9800X3D. This makes the 9950X3D a powerhouse for video rendering, 3D compilation, or scientific simulations where core scalability is paramount.

In tasks reliant on single-core speed, the 9950X3D also maintains a consistent lead, even though the gap narrows significantly. Cinebench 2024 single-core shows a 4.7% advantage, and the gap expands in POV-Ray single-core, where the 9950X3D has a 7.6% higher score than its younger sibling.

Even in lighter workloads like WebXPRT4 (browser-based tasks), the 9950X3D maintains a modest but notable 4.4% edge. The narrower gap confirms that browser-based tasks are less core-dependent, favoring cache/clock speed, yet the 9950X3D still leads. These modest gains reflect the close architectural similarities between the two CPUs in tasks that don't necessarily scale with core count.

The 9950X3D's dual-CCD layout (one with 3D V-Cache, one with higher clocks) optimizes it for hybrid productivity: cache-sensitive tasks leverage the stacked die, while all-core workloads engage both CCDs. The 9800X3D's single-CCD design restricts it in lighter multi-threaded tasks despite its cache advantage.

Putting it all together, for productivity alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is decisively superior, delivering 10-40% higher performance on average, with peaks exceeding 60% in core-heavy tasks. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains viable for budget-focused users handling lighter workloads, but professionals demanding uncompromised rendering, encoding, or compilation speed should opt for the 9950X3D.

⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D

Its massive compute throughput advantage, driven by its doubled core count, makes the 9950X3D the unequivocal choice for professional productivity, while the 9800X3D serves well for mainstream users where its strong gaming performance and lower cost are prioritized over extreme multi-threaded muscle.

Both the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D represent a significant advancement in X3D processor overclocking capabilities compared to their predecessors. Unlike previous X3D generations that had severe overclocking limitations, both Zen 5-based processors support full manual overclocking, including multiplier adjustments, voltage modifications, and extensive tuning options.

This is a revolutionary change from the Zen 4 X3D processors that were largely locked down, with the 7800X3D only supporting limited PBO and Curve Optimizer adjustments. The key architectural improvement enabling this overclocking freedom is AMD's redesigned 3D V-Cache placement.

In Zen 5 X3D processors, the 3D V-Cache is positioned underneath the Core Complex Dies (CCDs) rather than on top, dramatically improving thermal management and reducing the voltage sensitivity that previously restricted overclocking. This design change allows both processors to maintain higher boost frequencies while supporting the same overclocking toolkit as the regular Zen 5 processors.

The processors responds well to both traditional overclocking methods and AMD's advanced tuning tools, including Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2), Curve Optimizer, and the new Curve Shaper feature exclusive to Zen 5 processors. AMD has plenty of manual tuning option available, but most users are best just engaging the automated Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) feature.

⭐Winner: Tie

Both chips leverage the same AMD overclocking suite, so this section works out to a tie.

According to our test results, the power profiles of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reveal significant differences under load while showing remarkable similarity at idle, directly impacting efficiency and cooling requirements.

Under sustained AVX workloads, the 9950X3D consumes substantially more power than the 9800X3D, reflecting its higher core count and performance ceiling. In the grueling Prime95 Small FFTs test, the 9950X3D averages 215W compared to the 9800X3D's 171W, which is a substantial 25.7% increase. This pattern repeats in y-cruncher's AVX test, where the 9950X3D draws 23.9% more power than the 9800X3D.

Even in Cinebench 2024 multi-core rendering, which favors thread scaling, the 9950X3D requires 57.8% more power than its younger brother. This consistently higher power draw under heavy vectorized or multi-threaded loads is inherent to the 9950X3D's doubled core resources.

Remarkably, both CPUs demonstrate nearly identical power efficiency during low-activity states. In active idle states (such as YouTube playback), the 9950X3D uses 31% more power than the 9800X3D, but the actual difference is 9W. However, in true idle scenarios, the gap narrows to just 3W, which is pretty negligible in the big picture. This parity highlights that the 9950X3D efficiently powers down unused cores, but also highlights that both chips carry the same power burden of the central I/O die, which ultimately results in higher idle power consumption for Zen 5 processors compared to Intel offerings.

Despite its higher power consumption, the 9950X3D often delivers superior performance-per-watt in multi-threaded tasks. In our Cinebench 2024 "Watts per Point" metric, the 9950X3D scores a 10.8% efficiency advantage over the 9800X3D. Similarly, in HandBrake x265 encoding, the 9950X3D achieves a 6.4% lead in efficiency despite consuming more raw power in the test itself.

This indicates the 9950X3D's additional cores translate workloads into completed tasks more efficiently under heavy utilization. The "Estimated Task Energy" graph further confirms this trend, placing the 9950X3D in a significantly better (lower-right) position than Intel competitors and delivering way more FPS than the 9800X3D despite consuming almost similar task energy.

The 9950X3D's higher sustained power load necessitates more robust cooling. A 360mm AIO liquid cooler is optimal for the 9950X3D to maintain optimal boost clocks during extended AVX workloads. The 9800X3D, with its peak draw nearly 20-25% lower, is far more forgiving. A capable dual-tower air cooler or 240mm AIO should suffice in most cases.

At the end of the day, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the clear winner if you just compare the two CPUs by their peak power consumption, especially under heavy AVX loads, making it ideal for users prioritizing low heat output, quieter cooling, or constrained thermal environments.

However, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consumes 25-58% more power under load but delivers 6-11% better performance efficiency (work completed per watt) in multi-threaded scenarios like rendering and encoding. For users needing maximum multi-core throughput, the 9950X3D's efficiency may justify its higher power ceiling, though it demands stronger cooling to realize its full potential.

⭐Winner: Tie

If you want the absolute lowest power draw, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the obvious pick among these two CPUs. It is also easier to cool and is generally quite tame compared to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which consumes significantly more power under load.

In contrast, the 9950X3D takes a significant win in power efficiency (performance-per-watt), highlighting that it delivers exceptional power characteristics of its own.

Overall both chips have their charms, depending on the target workload. That leaves us with yet another tie -- the winner just depends on your personal use-case.

When comparing the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the starting point is their respective CPU prices: the Ryzen 9 9950X3D costs $670 at the time of writing, while the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is priced at $470, a difference of $200. However, to truly assess which CPU offers better value for the money, it's essential to consider the entire platform cost, including the motherboard, RAM, and CPU cooler.

When examining the complete platform cost, both processors share identical requirements for supporting components, but they do have different needs in some areas. DDR5 memory pricing remains consistent across both builds, with 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory costing around $120-$150.

The AM5 socket requirement means both CPUs could use the same types of motherboards, ranging from budget B650 boards at $125-$160 to premium X870 motherboards that can cost $320-$500. However, the 9950X3D's higher power consumption and thermal output requires a better motherboard than the 9800X3D.

With a higher TDP and peak power consumption, the 16-core 9950X3D necessitates more robust VRM designs on motherboards for full performance, potentially adding $50-$100 to the platform cost.

Cooling the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which has a lower TDP (120W) compared to its higher-end sibling (170W), can be adequately handled by a mid-tier solution. Options include a $50 to $70 air cooler or a $100 to $150 240mm AIO liquid cooler. In contrast, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D would benefit from a more capable solution, with a 360mm AIO liquid cooler being optimal, which can cost you about $150-200.

Conclusively, the 9800X3D emerges as the superior choice for value-conscious builders, despite both processors delivering nearly identical gaming performance, as we already saw. The nearly $230 price difference represents money that could be allocated toward a better graphics card, faster storage, or premium peripherals, which are components that would provide more tangible benefits for gaming performance.

As for the 9950X3D, its additional productivity capabilities justify its premium only for users who can leverage its extra cores for content creation, streaming, or professional workloads.

⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D

For the vast majority of enthusiasts prioritizing gaming and overall bang-for-buck, the 9800X3D's combination of potent gaming performance and lower total platform cost makes it the clear winner for value. The 9950X3D is best reserved for users who explicitly need its extra cores and are willing to invest in the supporting high-end platform.

Everything's currently coming up Glen Powell—but as far as he's concerned, he's standing on the backs of actors before him.

In GQ's latest cover story, the Running Man actor talked a lot about the stars who helped him breakout, even indirectly. Chief among them, according to Powell at least, is Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in the first Guardians in the Galaxy. It can be easy to forget, but the transformation from Andy to Peter Quill was a big deal back in the 2010s, and Powell credits Powell with allowing leading male roles to lighten up a little and have some more fun—especially after years of the likes of Christian Bale and Robert Pattinson's more serious, broody roles.

“When Pratt kind of appeared on the scene where he was doing things that were a little more silly and buoyant, that's where I feel most at home,” Powell told GQ. “And that's where I feel like I had a gear that is a necessary flavor in terms of Hollywood, and not a gear that a lot of guys can play.”

Powell's Mission: Impossible costar Tom Cruise also weighed in on the actor's trajectory to GQ, with Powell making extremely clear that he hoped to emulate Cruise's trajectory. Cruise apparently convinced Powell to play Hangman in Top Gun: Maverick after Powell lost the co-lead role to Miles Teller. In Cruise's telling, he advised Powell to “really look at [Hangman] and evaluate it from every angle. [I wanted him to] gather all the information on the process of how I approach making movies, my career, all the talented artists that were involved, and how the film is actually going to be made.”

And when the time came for Powell's new film Running Man, it was Cruise who apparently helped Powell prepare for doing the film's major stunts and live up physically to the novel's descriptions of Ben Richards. Powell recalled “putting on a lot of muscle for this, and a lot of it was functional so I could absorb hits. But a lot of it was also authentically for an audience. I went from going, ‘Oh, I'm an actor on a movie,' to ‘I'm a high-performance athlete,'” Powell said. “And I'm just very lucky that I have someone like Tom who I could literally go, ‘Hey, what do I do to survive something?'”

Running Man hits theaters November 14, with Glen Powell doing most of his own stunts—for more on that film and Powell's other projects, you can read the GQ story here.

Who needs analytics? Sometimes in football you have to trust your gut in real time, and Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald ran into that situation during the team's season-opening loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

“It was a tough one,” Macdonald said during his radio show on Seattle Sports 710 on Monday with hosts Brock Huard and Mike Salk (starting at 9:45 above). The Seattle Times broke down the play call here.

Macdonald was recounting the scenario late in the fourth quarter, with the game tied at 10 and the Seahawks facing a 4th-and-1 from the 49ers' 19-yard line.

The second-year coach admitted that the team's analytical model favored going for it and trying to pick up the first down in that situation. The goal would be a new set of downs and the increased odds to come away with a touchdown.

“But you are making these [calls] in real time,” Macdonald said, illustrating the dynamic at play in tense football situations where increased access to data and predictive analysis in-game can run up against the human instincts and experience of coaches making the calls.

Ticking off a variety of reasons for why he chose to ignore the model, Macdonald kicked the field goal to take a 13-10 lead. The 49ers came back and scored a touchdown and won the game 17-13.

While Macdonald said he felt pretty strongly about his decision to kick, there was “definitely an argument to go the other way.”

In a previous interview with GeekWire, Macdonald said his philosophy in Seattle is a combination of “old school principles and new school methods,” where the team is embracing tech for any edge it can get. That includes around decisions about whether to go for it on fourth down.

“We have a way to measure the advantage you get for going for it on fourth down,” Macdonald said. “Every team has that.” 

Through its partnership with Microsoft, the NFL makes a variety of tech tools available to players and coaches during games. This year, a new GitHub Copilot feature is introducing enhanced AI capabilities for quicker filtering when reviewing plays. Generative AI is not being used to make in-game decisions, according to the league.

“We feel AI can streamline processes, but cannot be a substitute or supplement for coaches developing adjustments and strategies on game day,” the NFL said.

— Adriana Gil Miner, a longtime Seattle-area marketing leader, has joined Atlanta-based cybersecurity company Pindrop as its new chief marketing officer. 

Miner was previously CMO at marketing startup Iterable and has held leadership roles at multiple Seattle-area companies, serving as senior vice president of marketing for Tableau Software and CMO of both Qumulo and Artefact. 

Founded in 2011, Pindrop sells software to help banks, retailers, insurers, and other customers secure their voice-related interactions. 

Miner said she's excited to join Pindrop amid the rise of AI-fueled deepfakes and fraud. She called deepfakes “the hard problem of this AI moment.”

“It's the ‘dark side' of GenAI and it sits at the intersection of consumers and B2B. It affects everyday people and the largest enterprises,” she told GeekWire. “Pindrop has the technology, proven scale with 8 out of 10 top banks in the country, and the signal to solve it in real time — across all enterprise communication channels.”

Pindrop CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan recently spoke to CNBC about the rise of deepfake job candidates. 

Pindrop is remote-first and does not have a Seattle-area office. The company landed a $100 million loan last year.

— Pedro Diaz was named chief revenue officer at Kirkland, Wash.-based cybersecurity company Tanium.

Diaz initially joined Tanium last year as SVP of Americas Sales. He previously worked at Cloud Software Group, BMC Software, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 

“Tanium is foundational to our customers' efforts to build a strong offensive security posture by delivering real-time, continuous visibility across their IT environments,” Diaz said in a statement.

Tanium moved its headquarters from San Francisco to the Seattle region at the end of 2020, when it had 1,500 employees. The company, which raised $150 million in early 2021, now has more than 2,000 employees worldwide across 20 offices, and about 70 in the Seattle area.

Tanium earlier this summer named Tara Ryan as its chief marketing officer. 

— Chris Parkinson, former CEO of Vancouver, Wash.-based augmented reality headset maker RealWear, was named president of enterprise solutions at Vuzix, a Rochester, N.Y.-based supplier of enterprise smart glasses. 

Parkinson helped launch RealWear in 2016 and was the company's CTO. He became CEO in 2023 and stepped down in January. 

Vuzix, which went public in 2021, competes with RealWear in the enterprise smart glasses market. Both companies make head-mounted displays used by customers in construction, manufacturing, and other sectors.

If you've upgraded to a newer iPhone model recently, you've probably noticed that Apple Intelligence is showing up in some of your most-used apps, like Messages, Mail, and Notes. Apple Intelligence (yes, also abbreviated to AI) showed up in Apple's ecosystem in October 2024, and it's here to stay as Apple competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others to build the best AI tools.

Cupertino marketing executives have branded Apple Intelligence: “AI for the rest of us.” The platform is designed to leverage the things that generative AI already does well, like text and image generation, to improve upon existing features. Like other platforms including ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Apple Intelligence was trained on large information models. These systems use deep learning to form connections, whether it be text, images, video or music.

The text offering, powered by LLM, presents itself as Writing Tools. The feature is available across various Apple apps, including Mail, Messages, Pages and Notifications. It can be used to provide summaries of long text, proofread and even write messages for you, using content and tone prompts.

Image generation has been integrated as well, in similar fashion — albeit a bit less seamlessly. Users can prompt Apple Intelligence to generate custom emojis (Genmojis) in an Apple house style. Image Playground, meanwhile, is a standalone image generation app that utilizes prompts to create visual content that can be used in Messages, Keynote or shared via social media.

Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game, but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple's operating systems; for instance, instead of the familiar icon, users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it's doing its thing.

More importantly, new Siri works across apps. That means, for example, that you can ask Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It's a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you're currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.

Leading up to WWDC 2025, many expected that Apple would introduce us to an even more souped-up version of Siri, but we're going to have to wait a bit longer.

“As we've shared, we're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,” said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi at WWDC 2025. “This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.”This yet-to-be-released, more personalized version of Siri is supposed to be able to understand “personal context,” like your relationships, communications routine, and more. But according to a Bloomberg report, the in-development version of this new Siri is too error-ridden to ship, hence its delay.

At WWDC 2025, Apple also unveiled a new AI feature called Visual Intelligence, which helps you do an image search for things you see as you browse. Apple also unveiled a Live Translation feature that can translate conversations in real time in the Messages, FaceTime, and Phone apps.

Visual Intelligence and Live Translation are expected to be available later in 2025, when iOS 26 launches to the public.

After months of speculation, Apple Intelligence took center stage at WWDC 2024. The platform was announced in the wake of a torrent of generative AI news from companies like Google and Open AI, causing concern that the famously tight-lipped tech giant had missed the boat on the latest tech craze.

Contrary to such speculation, however, Apple had a team in place, working on what proved to be a very Apple approach to artificial intelligence. There was still pizzazz amid the demos — Apple always loves to put on a show — but Apple Intelligence is ultimately a very pragmatic take on the category.

Apple Intelligence isn't a standalone feature. Rather, it's about integrating into existing offerings. While it is a branding exercise in a very real sense, the large language model (LLM) driven technology will operate behind the scenes. As far as the consumer is concerned, the technology will mostly present itself in the form of new features for existing apps.

We learned more during Apple's iPhone 16 event in September 2024. During the event, Apple touted a number of AI-powered features coming to its devices, from translation on the Apple Watch Series 10, visual search on iPhones, and a number of tweaks to Siri's capabilities. The first wave of Apple Intelligence is arriving at the end of October, as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1.

The features launched first in U.S. English. Apple later added Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and U.K. English localizations. Support for Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will arrive in 2025. 

The first wave of Apple Intelligence arrived in October 2024 via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 updates. These updates included integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for the redesigned Siri experience. A second wave of features became available as part of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2. That list includes Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration.

These offerings are free to use, so long as you have one of the following pieces of hardware:

Notably, only the Pro versions of the iPhone 15 are getting access, owing to shortcomings on the standard model's chipset. Presumably, however, the whole iPhone 16 line will be able to run Apple Intelligence when it arrives.

When you ask GPT or Gemini a question, your query is being sent to external servers to generate a response, which requires an internet connection. But Apple has taken a small-model, bespoke approach to training. 

The biggest benefit of this approach is that many of these tasks become far less resource intensive and can be performed on-device. This is because, rather than relying on the kind of kitchen sink approach that fuels platforms like GPT and Gemini, the company has compiled datasets in-house for specific tasks like, say, composing an email. 

That doesn't apply to everything, however. More complex queries will utilize the new Private Cloud Compute offering. The company now operates remote servers running on Apple Silicon, which it claims allows it to offer the same level of privacy as its consumer devices. Whether an action is being performed locally or via the cloud will be invisible to the user, unless their device is offline, at which point remote queries will toss up an error.

A lot of noise was made about Apple's pending partnership with OpenAI ahead of the launch of Apple Intelligence. Ultimately, however, it turned out that the deal was less about powering Apple Intelligence and more about offering an alternative platform for those things it's not really built for. It's a tacit acknowledgement that building a small-model system has its limitations.

Apple Intelligence is free. So, too, is access to ChatGPT. However, those with paid accounts to the latter will have access to premium features free users don't, including unlimited queries. 

ChatGPT integration, which debuts on iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, has two primary roles: supplementing Siri's knowledge base and adding to the existing Writing Tools options.

With the service enabled, certain questions will prompt the new Siri to ask the user to approve its accessing ChatGPT. Recipes and travel planning are examples of questions that may surface the option. Users can also directly prompt Siri to “ask ChatGPT.”

Compose is the other primary ChatGPT feature available through Apple Intelligence. Users can access it in any app that supports the new Writing Tools feature. Compose adds the ability to write content based on a prompt. That joins existing writing tools like Style and Summary.

We know for sure that Apple plans to partner with additional generative AI services. The company all but said that Google Gemini is next on that list.

At WWDC 2025, Apple announced what it calls the Foundation Models framework, which will let developers tap into its AI models while offline.

This makes it more possible for developers to build AI features into their third-party apps that leverage Apple's existing systems.

“For example, if you're getting ready for an exam, an app like Kahoot can create a personalized quiz from your notes to make studying more engaging,” Federighi said at WWDC. “And because it happens using on-device models, this happens without cloud API costs … We couldn't be more excited about how developers can build on Apple intelligence to bring you new experiences that are smart, available when you're offline, and that protect your privacy.”

Apple is expected to unveil a new-and-improved Siri experience in 2026, which is already a bit late compared to competitors. It may come as a blow to Apple, but in order to speed up development, they may have no choice but to partner with an outside company to power the new Siri. Apple has been rumored  to be in advanced talks with Google, its primary smartphone hardware competitor.

Yet all the attacker did was attempt to steal cryptocurrency

A total of 18 JavaScript packages that have over 2 billion weekly downloads have been injected with malicious code in what is billed as the largest supply chain hack in history. The compromised code was designed to steal cryptocurrency.

Picture this: Thanos, a Death-obsessed maniac retconned within the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be the most radical environmental activist in history, has assembled the Infinity Gauntlet. With it, he could wipe out half the universe's population. He raises his hand, snaps his fingers, and... steals a bunch of cryptocurrency instead. The Infinity Gauntlet would still be a problem, sure, but wouldn't that first snap come as a relief?

That's kind of how the recent compromise of JavaScript packages that have been downloaded billions of times feels. Does the ease with which an unknown threat actor was able to compromise the maintainer of these packages, modify the software, and distribute it highlight the disastrous state of modern software development? Absolutely. But we're lucky—they prioritized getting rich over wreaking havoc.

Here's what happened. Aikido said yesterday that 18 packages "were updated to contain a piece of code that would be executed on the client of a website, which silently intercepts crypto and web3 activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user."

The packages in question are distributed via npm, GitHub's package manager and registry for the Node.js ecosystem, and they are collectively downloaded approximately 2 billion times per week. In theory, the hacker could have used the ability to modify these packages to do anything; Aikido said they opted to attempt to steal "Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash."

We don't know how far these malicious packages spread. The packages themselves are downloaded billions of times a week, but that's at least partly a byproduct of software build systems constantly fetching and re-fetching a project's dependencies. There's no denying these packages are popular, though, and organizations whose software depends on them should make sure they aren't using the malicious releases.

But was this at least the result of a sophisticated attack? No. The maintainer of these packages (who, it should be noted, uses the handle "bad-at-computer" on Bluesky) said they received a two-factor authentication reset email that "looked very legitimate" from "support@npmjs.help" and thought it was benign. It wasn't. All it took to pull off a hack of this scale was a domain name, an email, and the willingness to try.

This isn't a new problem, nor is it exclusive to npm. I reported in 2021 that hackers were targeting maintainers of packages used by JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java developers in their own software, and even then, the problem had been known for years. The infamous left-pad incident—wherein the deletion of 11 lines of code "broke the internet" because so much software depended on it—happened in 2016.

The industry has been attempting to address this problem by encouraging the use of software bills of materials (SBOMs), requiring maintainers of widely used packages to secure their accounts with two-factor authentication, etc. Yet this incident proves that these measures are not enough. Until the commonly accepted processes of developing, maintaining, and releasing software change, these problems will persist.

This time, the Infinity Gauntlet was used to steal cryptocurrency. Will the next Thanos snap their fingers with the same intention? And which is going to come first, the snap that causes far more damage than a crypto thief, or the arrival of something that can finally stop that snapping altogether? Thanos claimed that he's inevitable; are we really just consigning ourselves to hoping that was only true on the silver screen?

Game built to target faster SSD platforms would need too much rework for slower cartridge-based storage.

Ubisoft wasn't being ‘cheap' by opting to deliver Star Wars Outlaws for Nintendo Switch 2 via Game-Key Card, according to a developer who worked on the title. In a discussion thread on BlueSky, Rob Bantin, Snowdrop's Audio Architect, explained that “Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed” to run the game at an acceptable quality. The Snowdrop engine uses a lot of disk data streaming to render open world environments.

If you aren't very familiar with the Switch 2, there's an important distinction to be made before discussing the issue here. Nintendo facilitates Switch 2 games distribution digitally online (simple enough), and on physical media dubbed Game Cards (even simpler). However, there's a somewhat controversial third way: the Game Key Card, which acts like a kind of dongle signaling ownership of a title and allowing you to download and play it on the console that you insert it into. After installation, this kind of game does not required constant internet connectivity, but you'll keep the card in the slot to fire it up.

Switch 2 Format

Description

Internet required?

Performance and portability

Used resale?

Digital Download

Purchased via eShop; the game is tied to your Nintendo account

Yes (to download)

2,100 MB/s data rate, but locked to your account

No

Game Card

A traditional cartridge with the full game data onboard

No

400 MB/s data rate (eMMC), Plug-and-play; no download needed

Yes

Game Key Card

A physical cartridge containing a license key, not the game

Yes (first time)

2,100 MB/s data rate, uses built-in storage, but card must stay inserted to play

Yes

Game Key Cards are widely acknowledged to be cheaper to make for the games publishers. No flash required. And the gaming community is naturally resistant to dongles, DRM, and what has here been referred to as the worst of both worlds. Moreover, Nintendo's Switch 2 comes with a measly 256GB of internal storage.

Expanding your built-in storage with MicroSD Express cards adds a middling third performance tier of ~800 MB/s transfers to the machine. These cards, sold in sizes up to 2TB, are quite costly for users, as we have highlighted previously. However, if the physical Game Cards matched this performance spec, perhaps we wouldn't see games like Star Wars Outlaws being forcibly shoveled onto the limited built-in storage of the Switch 2 via Game Key Card distribution.

Moving back, now, to Bantin's reasoned defense of the use of Game Key Card distribution for Star Wars Outlaws, and the dev underlines that “I don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot.”

The Snowdrop's Audio Architect would later share some further insight into the situation regarding Game Key Cards and Star Wars Outlaws. He reasoned that developing for platforms with faster storage standards first meant compromises when it came to the Switch 2 version's distribution. “I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different,” Bantin said. “As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call.”

From the conclusion:"We have presented a programming protocol, Extensible Visitor, that can be used to construct systems with extensible recursive data domains and toolkits. It is a novel combination of the functional and object-oriented programming styles that draws on the strengths of each. The object-oriented style is essential to achieve extensibility along the data dimension, yet tools are organized in a functional fashion, enabling extensibility in the functional dimension. Systems based on the Extensible Visitor can be extended without modification to existing code or recompilation (which is an increasingly important concern)."

Was this an important paper in its field?

The strangest aspect of it is that they cite Haskell. Given the date of the paper, I would understand unfamiliarity with Haskell given the implementations[1] that were available at the time weren't very "useful" if you had any kind of latency requirements on your software. That being said it's strange that somebody in 1998 would write a paper like this,  know that Haskell was a thing, and also have no knowledge of type classes, which are explicitly designed to fill the role of open type sets.For those note in the know, functional languages tend to be able to express this open type association in various ways. Type classes are one way, another example beyond Haskell is MaPLe[2]. SML (and ML-only style OCAML) has a somewhat restricted form by way of its module and functor system, and eqtype. MLPolyR has an unrestricted form by way of row polymorphism.[1] - https://www.haskell.org/hugs/[2] - https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl

Companies that have dug deep into AI have fallen in love with nuclear power for its promise of 24/7 electricity. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have all made deals with startups or reactor operators. But does the nuclear industry love AI back?

Yes, with caveats.

No one is proposing to let an AI run a reactor, but power companies are increasingly interested in the technology's potential to tighten things up on the business side, Bradley Fox, co-founder and CEO of Nuclearn, told TechCrunch.

Fox and Jerrold Vincent started Nuclearn to capitalize on that interest. The company says its AI tools are being used in more than 65 nuclear reactors around the world. 

It recently raised a $10.5 million Series A round led by Blue Bear Capital with participation from AZ-VC, Nucleation Capital, and SJF Ventures.

Nuclearn got its start when the founders were working at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station just west of Phoenix. They had been experimenting with ways to streamline various repetitive tasks first from a data science perspective, then with more advanced AI models.

Soon, other reactors took note, Fox said. “Can you help us do the same thing you're doing for Palo Verde but for my plant?” they asked him.

That interest coincided with the COVID pandemic. “We both were kind of bored after work,” Fox said. “We're like, hey, let's work on a startup.”

Nuclearn has developed models trained on nuclear industry-specific terminology. The startup can train custom models for utilities and power providers that request it, and while its software runs in the cloud, it can also help reactors set up hardware on-site if their security protocols require it. 

The startup's software can generate routine documentation that reactor employees then review and sign off on.

“Most AI in the industry now, the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] considers it a tool. It's the same way as if you're going to use Excel or Mathematica or some type of engineering software,” Fox said. “Liability always falls with a person.”

Reactor operators can set thresholds for how much gets automated depending on their level of comfort and their confidence in how well the model can tackle the problem.

“If the model doesn't know or if we're unsure, based on the setting you select, it'll send it back to the right people and get a double check,” Fox said. “We tell the customers, ‘Think of this as the junior employee.'”

Mistral AI, the French company that develops the AI chatbot Le Chat and several foundational large language models, is considered one of France's most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI.

“Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025.

In a significant step up from its June 2024 valuation of $6 billion, Mistral is now valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September, alongside signing a new strategic partnership with the AI company.

ASML's interest in having its clients benefit from its collaboration is an important milestone for Mistral. While the French company describes itself as “the world's greenest and leading independent AI lab,” it is still not as well known as its biggest competitors.  

Mistral AI, which offers some open source AI models, has raised significant funding since its creation in 2023, with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn't a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company's openness versus OpenAI's more recent, closed source take at developing AI models.

Mistral's chatbot Le Chat is available on iOS and Android, reaching 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release and grabbing France's top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.

In July 2025, Mistral AI updated Le Chat with new features that bring it closer to rival full-stack AI chatbots: a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. This update also added Projects, which lets users group chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces.

As of September 2025, Le Chat can remember previous conversations thanks to a feature called Memories.

This is in addition to Mistral AI's suite of models: 

In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character-recognition API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.

In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe-coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with Windsurf, Anysphere's Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

Mistral AI's three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies that have operations in Paris. Its CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google's DeepMind; CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.

Mistral's co-founding advisers include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan. Former digital minister Cédric O is also an adviser to the company, a fact that has caused persistent controversy due to his previous role.

Not all of them. Mistral differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, built in collaboration with Nvidia which the startup open sourced in July 2024.

While many of Mistral AI's offerings are free or now have free tiers, Le Chat also has paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat's Pro subscription costs $14.99 a month.

On the B2B front, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.

Overall, however, Mistral AI's revenue is reportedly in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.

In 2024, Mistral AI signed a deal with Microsoft that included a €15 million investment and a strategic partnership for distributing the French company's AI models through Microsoft's Azure platform. 

The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn't qualify for investigation due to its small size, though the deal sparked some criticism in the EU.

In January 2025, Mistral signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Le Chat query the AFP's entire text archive dating back to 1983.

Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France's army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.

In May 2025, Mistral said it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France's state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

In June 2025, Mistral said it would launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, Mistral Compute, in 2026. The initiative was hailed as “historic” by Macron, who shared the stage with Mensch and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the VivaTech conference shortly after the announcement.

In July 2025, Mistral launched AI for Citizens, an initiative that the company claimed could “help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services.”

In September 2025, Mistral and chip company ASML struck a partnership “to explore the use of AI models across ASML's product portfolio as well as research, development and operations.”

In May 2025, Mistral AI released the Mistral Agents API to “empower enterprises to use AI in more practical and impactful ways,” according to its Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang.

In September 2025, the company unveiled a revamped Connectors directory, showcasing Le Chat's integrations with some 20 enterprise tools, including Asana, Atlassian, Box, Google Drive, Notion, and Zapier, as well as emails and calendars; and soon, Databricks and Snowflake.

By February 2025, Mistral AI had raised a total of around €1 billion, some of which was debt financing. The money was raised across several equity rounds conducted in close succession.

In June 2023, just one month after being founded, Mistral AI raised a record $113 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round, Europe's largest ever, valued the startup at $260 million. 

Other investors in that round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.

Six months later, Mistral closed a €385 million Series A ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and saw participation from Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.

Microsoft's $16.3 million convertible investment in Mistral as part of a partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.

In June 2024, Mistral raised €600 million (about $640 million) in a mix of equity and debt. The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung Venture Investment Corporation participating.

Earlier this year, Mistral AI was rumored to be finalizing a €2 billion investment at a post-money valuation of $14 billion. This followed earlier reports that the company was in talks to raise $1 billion in equity from investors, who included Abu Dhabi's MGX fund, as well as hundreds of millions of euros in debt.

On September 9, 2025, Mistral closed a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C round  led by ASML at a €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) valuation. According to the company, the round saw investments from existing backers DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Bpifrance, General Catalyst, Index Ventures, Lightspeed, and NVIDIA.

Mensch was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025 urging Brussels to “stop the clock” for two years before key obligations of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act enter into force. The European Commission is sticking to its original timeline.

Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.” 

This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer. 

However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors — lately naming Apple — is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

If you don't want a laptop but need a compact PC that delivers strong performance without taking over your desk, the GMKtec Mini PC Gaming K6 is a solid option: It's small enough to fit into tight spaces but powerful enough to handle modern games and demanding tasks. Among the different models GMKtec offers, this one ranks near the top in terms of power. Right now, it's available on Amazon at an all-time low price of $455, down from $640.

See at Amazon

The heart of the GMKtec K6 is the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS processor which offers 8 cores and 16 threads with clock speeds of up to 5.1 GHz. This means it can comfortably carry out gaming and streaming without lags. The internal AMD Radeon 780M graphics have 12 cores and are built on the latest RDNA 3 architecture which gives performance virtually the same as a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti GPU.

The PC is pre-loaded with 32GB of 5600MHz DDR5 RAM in dual-channel configuration which keeps everything ticking smoothly whether you're working on massive projects or gaming. Storage is available in the guise of a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD for quick boot times and quick loading of games and apps. And there's the feature of adding storage using a second PCIe 4.0 slot for up to 4TB in total which gives plenty of space if you just continue adding to your game or media library.

Connectivity corners are filled using USB 4.0 ports capable of delivering high-speed 40 Gbps data transfers as well as 8K@60Hz video output. This makes it possible to attach the latest monitors or indeed an external graphics card in the future. For multitasking, there's triple-screen display via USB-C DisplayPort, HDMI, and standard DisplayPort outputs. Networking is robust with dual 2.5Gbps LAN ports for wired and WiFi 6E for fast wireless internet.

With its slim profile, the K6 can stay cool and silent for extended hours of usage. It also features dual copper heat pipes and a silent fan that keep the heat away without making any noise at all which is ideal for marathon gaming or work hours. This makes it a great choice if you require power and performance but not the bulk and noise of a typical desktop.

Esports pro Ropz asked X users to run a replay of a CS2 match featuring intensive gameplay, and even Ryzen 9 9950X3D's are dipping below 200 FPS.

Counter-Strike 2 is taking fire for serious frame rate issues that are causing headaches for esports players and affecting performance on even the Best Gaming CPUs. Renowned CS esports player ropz took to X to complain about these issues, noting that the game's frame rate instability is so serious that only AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D runs the game well enough for tournament play.

Ropz claims he can tell the difference between playing the game on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D or an Intel-based system running CS2. Not just that, but if the game is running on an Intel system, Ropz claims the game runs poorly. Further, Ropz claims that CS2's frame rate issues specifically revolve around 20-slot DM servers or in highly stressed 5v5 sessions where frame rates can reportedly drop below 200 FPS on Intel's latest CPUs.

Tbh it's tough to agree. A massive problem is still the FPS. For me the game is ass on anything else but a 9800X3D and not every tournament has that. Many issues still but this is a big one.August 20, 2025

9800x3d + 4080 on full tweaked system, custom os and dropped to 131fps when all their util got dumped😂August 21, 2025

7800x3d + 3080 + 32gb 6000mhz. dropped to 135fps. Almost all settings low 1280x960. Its a joke pic.twitter.com/T1joQ2aoutAugust 21, 2025

However, these issues aren't just a problem with Intel. A day after he made the above claims, he asked his fellow CS2 gamers to play through a demo of CS2 featuring a replay of a highly intensive 5v5 match to see what performance is like on other users' Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming machines and other hardware.

The reports he got back are impressively poor. Multiple users boasting Ryzen 7 9800X3Ds or Ryzen 9 9950X3Ds reported frame rates below 200FPS. For one user (Arklyn) sporting a 9800X3D and an RTX 4070, frame rates start at 600FPS but drop all the way down to 170 FPS during intensive scenes. Another user (badhan) reported an FPS dip all the way down to 163 FPS in the same replay, despite also running a 9800X3D and an even more powerful RTX 5080 graphics card.

If you are wondering if graphics settings are causing the issues, at least one X poster recorded a frame rate drop as low as 135FPS, featuring a 7800X3D and running the game on "almost all" settings on low with a resolution of 1280x960.

Ropz's demo is likely a worst-case scenario that won't always happen in your games, even in tournament matches. So you shouldn't worry about frame rates going that low if you're a more casual CS2 player.

Regardless, it shows CS2's performance issues firsthand and how erratic the game's frame rate dips can be. For those unfamiliar with CS2's regular performance, the best gaming chips on the market, liuke the 9800X3D, are capable of allegedly playing the game (albeit in less intensive scenes) at 600+ FPS, depending on graphics settings and the graphics card used. Less-capable chips, such as AMD's non-X3D chips and Intel's Core i5 and i7 Raptor Lake chips, are known for running the game in the 300-400 FPS range (again, depending on graphics settings and the GPU used).

Hopefully, Valve will get to the bottom of this. The game has technically been receiving patches with performance optimizations since its release, but highly intensive 5v5 and apparently 20-slot deathmatch sessions appear to be the Achilles heel of CS2's continuing frame rate fluctuation issues.

A first-of-its-kind marketplace rolled out on Tuesday offering free and discounted privacy and security services to America's 23 million current and former public servants. The marketplace is offered by Public Service Alliance (PSA), a private company that says it formed in response to an unprecedented rise in threats against government workers across the United States.

Open to anyone who is serving or has served in government—federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial—the platform debuts amid heightened concern over the safety of public officials and their families, especially in the wake of the June killing of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and the attempted assassination of state senator John Hoffman and his wife.

“Threats to public servants and their families have surged over the past decade, with no scalable support for those at risk. This is a broken business model for effective government and undermines everything America stands for,” PSA founder and CEO Isabella Ulloa says in a statement.

The group says its marketplace is designed to connect public servants—from veterans and judges to first responders and lawmakers—with resources spanning four areas: privacy and security, legal and communications risk, career support, and personal well-being. The services, which anyone can browse for free, include online data removal, legal counsel, threat monitoring, job coaching, and stress management tools.

After creating a free account and attesting to their government service, users will receive codes that unlock reduced rates from vetted vendors: data-privacy firms like Optery and Atlas, which help remove personal information from the web and keep it from reappearing; Alethea, a security firm that monitors for online harassment and physical threats; and Lifemart, which offers discounted lifestyle and wellness products. Additionally, while it does not itself provide legal advice, PSA says it can connect users to a network of attorneys that provide low-cost legal consultations.

During a quiet launch last year, PSA tells WIRED, it amassed roughly 1,000 users by word of mouth alone, saying it so far touts a 100 percent retention rate. Users pay a 10 percent fee (based on the discounted rate of the services used) to help maintain the platform, but waivers are available for those for whom the added cost becomes prohibitive. Many of the discounts are steep, PSA says, noting that threat monitoring services, which can range from $5,000 to over $30,000 annually, can be obtained by its users for less than $1,000 per year.

PSA casts itself as strictly nonpartisan, pointing to an advisory board that spans both parties as well as members of law enforcement, including former Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock, Massachusetts sheriff Peter Koutoujian, and David Sundberg, a retired FBI assistant director. Ulloa, the founder, recently worked for the Department of Homeland Security. PSA says the bipartisan structure underscores its view that protecting people's lives should always transcend politics.

The group says it has plans to extend access to the discounts to other at-risk groups, including nonprofit workers, later this year.

A January report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy nonprofit, underscored the widespread nature of the threats and harassment public officials are facing. Its researchers found that nearly half of state legislators and nearly one in five local officials reported being threatened, many saying the abuse has intensified in both frequency and tone. Women and officials of color bear the abuse at rates several times that of their peers.

The threats are not only endangering people, the center says, but warping democratic participation; deterring candidates from running for office and silencing officials on controversial issues, pushing many to scale back public events and social media use.

The US Capitol Police says it investigated 9,474 threats against members of Congress and those close to them last year, marking a second straight annual increase, more than doubling 2017's total.

Data brokers, which are often used for targeted abuse, sit at the heart of a multibillion-dollar industry that thrives on collecting, packaging, and selling detailing personal information, often without your knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers on nearly every American, from their location histories to political leanings and even religious affiliations. This data is sold and resold for a variety of purposes, ranging from targeting advertising to law-enforcement surveillance and immigration control.

The risks are not abstract. People-search websites, which draw heavily on data broker feeds, have long been used by abusers to track and harass victims. Data breaches have exposed the movements of politicians and military personnel. And even when opting out is possible, it's a burdensome, piecemeal process that requires repeatedly chasing down companies as information is re-collected and relisted.

The Trump administration has orchestrated a major rollback of efforts to rein in data broker abuse pursued by ex-Biden administration officials. In May 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau quietly withdrew a Biden-era rule that would have required data brokers to get people's consent before selling sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers or income details.

Meanwhile, privacy watchdogs like the Electronic Frontier Foundation report that hundreds of data brokers are evading state transparency laws—including failing to register in states where it's required—further eroding oversight in the absence of federal regulation; a gap that's left even basic privacy protections vulnerable to corporate gamesmanship.

An investigation by The Markup and CalMatters copublished by WIRED last month found at least 35 data brokers deliberately hiding their opt-out pages from Google search results, making it harder for people to find and use tools to delete their personal data—a practice that consumer advocates say resembles an illegal dark pattern; another barrier to thwart users hoping to one day wrest control of their data from companies built on exploiting it.

Compare Serbia, where peaceful protests have been ongoing for some months - also against corruption.

Chudjak said he's not doing anything what the protestors want.

When the choice is a stream of inane fake news and viral sensationalist ragebait, or only government approved news.. I'm not entirely sure which is better?I'm guessing probably the latter. At least you know it's bullshit and your neighbors aren't trying to murder some minorities or shooting up ivermectin or whateverHope Nepal comes out of this alright and more people don't get hurt. A collapse of the government (even a bad one) usually leads to nothing good.

A leak of more than 100,000 documents shows that a little-known Chinese company has been quietly selling censorship systems seemingly modeled on the Great Firewall to governments around the world.

Geedge Networks, a company founded in 2018 that counts the “father” of China's massive censorship infrastructure as one of its investors, styles itself as a network-monitoring provider, offering business-grade cybersecurity tools to “gain comprehensive visibility and minimize security risks” for its customers, the documents show. In fact, researchers found that it has been operating a sophisticated system that allows users to monitor online information, block certain websites and VPN tools, and spy on specific individuals.

Researchers who reviewed the leaked material found that the company is able to package advanced surveillance capabilities into what amounts to a commercialized version of the Great Firewall—a wholesale solution with both hardware that can be installed in any telecom data center and software operated by local government officers. The documents also discuss desired functions that the company is working on, such as cyberattack-for-hire and geofencing certain users.

According to the leaked documents, Geedge has already entered operation in Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Myanmar, as well as another unidentified country. A public job posting shows that Geedge is also looking for engineers who can travel to other countries for engineering work, including to several countries not named in the leaked documents, WIRED has found.

The files, including Jira and Confluence entries, source code, and correspondence with a Chinese academic institution, mostly involve internal technical documentation, operation logs, and communications to solve issues and add functionalities. Provided through an anonymous leak, the files were studied by a consortium of human rights and media organizations including Amnesty International, InterSecLab, Justice For Myanmar, Paper Trail Media, The Globe and Mail, the Tor Project, the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, and Follow The Money.

“This is not like lawful interception that every country does, including Western democracies,” says Marla Rivera, a technical researcher at InterSecLab, a global digital forensics research institution. In addition to mass censorship, the system allows governments to target specific individuals based on their website activities, like having visited a certain domain.

The surveillance system that Geedge is selling “gives so much power to the government that really nobody should have,” Rivera says. “This is very frightening.”

At the core of Geedge's offering is a gateway tool called Tiangou Secure Gateway (TSG), designed to sit inside data centers and could be scaled to process the internet traffic of an entire country, documents reveal. According to researchers, every packet of internet traffic runs through it, where it can be scanned, filtered, or stopped outright. Besides monitoring the entire traffic, documents show that the system also allows setting up additional rules for specific users that it deems suspicious and collecting their network activities.

For unencrypted internet traffic, the system is able to intercept sensitive information such as website content, passwords, and email attachments, according to the leaked documents. If the content is properly encrypted through the Transport Layer Security protocol, the system uses deep packet inspection and machine learning techniques to extract metadata from the encrypted traffic and predict whether it's going through a censorship circumvention tool like a VPN. If it can't distinguish the content of the encrypted traffic, the system can also opt to flag it as suspicious and block it for a period of time.

One screenshot of the Geedge dashboard for Myanmar shows that the system is monitoring 81 million internet connections simultaneously, while it can theoretically be scaled even larger with more hardware, InterSecLab researchers say. Other documents show that as of February 2024, Geedge's equipment had been installed in 26 data centers across 13 internet service providers in Myanmar. Frontiir, a local telecom operator in Myanmar, previously denied having “built, planned, or designed anything related to surveillance,” but it was found in the leak to have installed Geedge equipment at its data center. Investcom, a joint-venture telecom operator between Burmese and Lebanese companies, said it was “aware of claims relating to third-party technologies in Myanmar” but refused to “confirm or deny the existence of third-party systems” in a written reply to the researchers at Justice for Myanmar.

Geedge sells a one-stop shop of censorship solutions, including internet gateway hardware. According to InterSecLab, Geedge originally used Western brand equipment from HP and Dell, but later moved to using hardware manufactured by Chinese companies to avoid being impacted by potential sanctions.

Another fundamental product of Geedge is Cyber Narrator, the main user interface where non-technical government clients can access the data that Tiangou Secure Gateway monitors in real time with a bird's-eye view, documents show. In screenshots of the system found in the leak, Cyber Narrator operators can see the geographic location of each mobile internet user based on their cell service communications, as well as analyze whether the user is accessing the internet through VPN services.

In the case of Myanmar, internal records reveal that Geedge identified 281 popular VPN tools, complete with their technical specifications, subscription prices, and whether they can be used in Myanmar. A separate document identified 54 apps marked as higher priority for blocking. The prioritization list of tools includes mostly popular commercial services like ExpressVPN, as well as Signal, the encrypted messaging app.

The documents show that Geedge's technical ability is rapidly growing. “I was reading through the tests and [realized that] they went from not blocking the most of the VPNs to blocking almost all the VPNs in months,” drawing from findings of academic scholars that the company works with, says Rivera.

While the leaked documents contain no record of business contracts, it discusses the clients in cryptic code names. Researchers were able to pin down four of the foreign government clients to Kazakhstan (K18 and K24), Pakistan (P19), Ethiopia (E21), and Myanmar (M22) by combing through documents in the leak for mentions of data centers' geographic locations, tracking international cargo records from Geedge to other countries, and drawing from prior reporting on Chinese companies' involvement in selling censorship software. There is the additional mention of a client coded A24, but there isn't sufficient evidence to show what it refers to.

Geedge's public hiring efforts may provide more information on its potential expansion plans. On a third-party job recruitment platform in China, Geedge is hiring a senior overseas operations and maintenance engineer to maintain the systems in “Belt and Road countries.” The job listing says it may require spending three to six months outside China, travelling to Pakistan, Malaysia, Bahrain, Algeria, and India. Separately, in March, the company was also hiring Spanish-speaking and French-speaking translators who could support Geedge's overseas businesses.

In Pakistan, for example, one license renewal document shows that the Geedge services, including capabilities to monitor real-time statistics and retain email information, were licensed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority in October 2024. Another Jira support ticket shows the example of an intercepted email, complete with the full content, subject, protocol, attachment, names of sender and receiver, and the IP addresses involved.

Researchers believe that some Geedge employees are able to access information intercepted by the client, which could be a national security risk for the client governments.

Geedge's experience in Pakistan also shows that it's building products on interoperable equipment to appeal to different customers. Prior to Geedge coming to Pakistan, the country had worked with Sandvine, a Canadian company that supplied deep-packet-inspection gear before withdrawing under US sanctions. When Sandvine left, its hardware remained in Pakistani data centers, according to the leak. Geedge moved in to repurpose the existing infrastructure, the documents show, offering a transition to a new regime of censorship—one that would eventually run on Chinese-manufactured hardware instead.

The company's ability and willingness to work with the hardware left by Sandvine should pose a warning for countries issuing export licenses for sensitive technologies, says Jurre van Bergen, a technologist at the human rights nonprofit Amnesty International: “Once it's exported, it's there, and they're going to reuse it in some capacity. I think it does speak to the limits of the sanctions.”

Researchers caution that there's no actual documentation in the leak that proves Geedge's system is responsible for the internet censorship that took place in a particular country, but key operation changes in the Geedge technical logs correspond with notable events. In Ethiopia, for example, the system was switched from a mode that passively monitors traffic to a mode that can actively stop traffic “just days before the internet shutdown” in February 2023, says Rivera. In total, the leak shows 18 times when the Geedge gateway system in Ethiopia switched from passively monitoring to actively interfering at the expense of slowing down services.

At the same time, the Canadian VPN service Psiphon, which documents show can be targeted by Geedge's system, has corroborated the leak's findings that they observed user behavior changes in Myanmar that can be caused by massive blocking at the internet service provider level, around the same time Geedge was deployed there.

While Geedge Networks may be obscure outside and inside China, it has close ties with the forces that built China's controversial filtering and blocking system, now known as the Great Firewall. When Geedge Networks was founded in 2018, it was going by a different name, Zhongdian Jizhi, showing its connection to China Electronics Corporation (CEC), a massive state-owned conglomerate with close ties to the country's military and security services. (Zhongdian is the abbreviation of CEC in Chinese.) CEC was sanctioned by the United States government in 2020.

What also connects the two companies is Fang Binxing, a Chinese computer scientist who's often called the “father of the Great Firewall,” as he led the early development of the censorship system. Fang's work would essentially achieve what former US president Bill Clinton compared to nailing jell-o to the wall: controlling a technology that was designed to give everyone equal access to information. As technology develops, the Great Firewall has been built higher too, effectively blocking the majority of Chinese people from accessing information deemed not politically acceptable by the Chinese government, no matter if they are using computers, phones, or even cutting-edge technology like AI models.

In 2019, when Fang was still employed as CEC's chief scientist, he became an investor of the company Jicheng (Hainan) Technology Investment, owning a 40 percent stake, according to Chinese corporate records databases. Jicheng is an investor in Geedge Networks and shares the same executive as the latter company. In 2024, Fang set up a new cybersecurity research studio with the help of Geedge, Chinese state media Xinhua reported.

Geedge is not only exporting Chinese censorship abroad; it is reimporting lessons learned overseas to refine repression at home, records show. Years after it had sold technologies to other countries, Geedge started targeting Chinese provincial governments too for their unique needs. First stop: Xinjiang.

The region, home to millions of Uyghur Muslims, has experienced intensive digital surveillance by the Chinese government in the past decade. Geedge's leaked documents show that the company is collaborating with Chinese research institutions to expand monitoring systems there. A script of a speech given at the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2024, found in the leak, mentions that “the national (firewall) is evolving from a centralized to a distributed model.” Photos in the leak show that the company has invited students from the Massive and Effective Stream Analysis (Mesalab), a research laboratory at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to visit Geedge's server room in Xinjiang.

This provincial deployment in Xinjiang, coded as J24 in the leak, started in 2024 after an initial test program. Like in other countries, Geedge operating centers are embedded in the telecom data facilities in Xinjiang.

Meanwhile, Geedge has also operated pilot projects in two other Chinese provinces, Fujian and Jiangsu, according to the leaked records. Screenshots and other documents of these projects show the focus of the system was on detecting financial scam websites, which happens more often in China's eastern coastal provinces.

In addition to collecting traffic information on both a wide and individual scale, the Xinjiang project was also exploring some experimental functions. A list of desirable features found in the leak shows that Geedge was aiming to update Cyber Narrator so it could construct relationship graphs between users and group individuals according to the apps they use. It also plans to triangulate the location of a user through mobile cell stations and create geofences for certain users, records show.

Another prototype feature found in the leak is described as an individual “reputation score.” Each internet user is given a baseline score of 550, and it can be increased by authenticating the user's personal information, including the national identification, facial recognition data, and employment details. If the user's reputation score doesn't rise above 600, they won't be able to access the internet.

It's unclear whether these features have been realized and incorporated into Geedge's surveillance systems deployed in China and abroad.

Geedge's ongoing attempt to unearth information from individuals is particularly worrying, because the company also has the capability to inject malware into users' internet traffic, says Lea Horne, another researcher at InterSecLab. “It makes it so much easier to find a way to target an individual. Instead of trying to guess what website they visit that doesn't support HTTPS, you can just look at all their internet activity in the past, find a website that doesn't regularly use a secure internet connection, and inject malware into this website next time you visit,” she says. And even though some features were being tested within China, once the technology is mature, any foreign client can request the same features in their systems through a simple software update.

As the COVID-19 pandemic wound down, so did the federal government's funding to states that allowed all Medicaid enrollees to keep their coverage even if they no longer would have been eligible otherwise.

This "great unwinding" at the end of March 2023 meant that more than 25 million people-about 30 percent of all Medicaid recipients-were removed from the program.

Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers have analyzed how the unwinding affected the payer mix for children's emergency department visits in Texas. During the unwinding, about 1.2 million children in the state lost health insurance coverage.

Knowing whether payment comes from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance or the patient is important for health care organizations because it affects their financial bottom line."

Daniel Marthey, PhD, a health policy expert and study author at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health

Commercial insurance pays more than Medicare, while treating uninsured patients increases a hospital's uncompensated care costs and bad debt.

For their study, published in Health Services Research, the team analyzed data on all 7.6 million patients younger than 17 who visited 472 emergency departments in Texas from April 2021 (before the Medicaid unwinding) through May 2024 (after the unwinding).

Other Texas A&M researchers involved in the study were Benjamin Ukert, PhD, with the School of Public Health and Laura Dague, PhD, with the Bush School of Government and Public Service, along with colleagues from the University of Alabama and Penn State University.

"The share of Medicaid-insured visits declined by 7.2 percentage points during the period studied, for a relative reduction of 11.7% from baseline," Marthey said. "In addition, the share of commercially insured patients increased 12.5%, and the share of uninsured visits increased 45.2%."

Further analysis revealed that the shift to commercial coverage happened more immediately following the unwinding, while the increase in uninsured happened with an upward trend over time.

"Understanding the financial implications from the increase in the proportion of uninsured emergency departments visits for children is important to hospitals and the state," Ukert said.

For Texas, the increased share of patients with commercial insurance could help offset the decrease in the Medicaid share. For hospitals that must provide care to more uninsured patients, on the other hand, the increased financial burden could result in a need for assistance from the state, which also would affect the state's budgets.

In addition, a lack of health insurance might lead to delays in children receiving routine health care, which could also increase the need for emergency department visits in the future, especially for the nearly half a million Texas children with asthma.

Small, rural hospitals experienced the biggest declines in Medicaid patients and the largest increases in uninsured patients.

"These hospitals are an important safety net for people in areas underserved in terms of health care access," Ukert said. "Many of them already have low or negative profit margins and risk closure."

A rough calculation showed that while the unwinding led to fewer Medicaid-covered emergency department visits and more uninsured children, the loss in revenue may have been fully offset by higher payments from commercially insured visits. This estimate does not account for other shifts in payer distribution.

Marthey noted that these findings might not apply elsewhere since Texas is one of the more populous states and since Medicaid eligibility and requirements can differ from state to state.

"Our study underscores the need for policies that target transitions to other health programs so that the impact of the loss of health insurance coverage is minimized," he said.

A large portion of the global population with diabetes remains undiagnosed or is not receiving optimal care, according to a new study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a global network of collaborators conducted the analysis of the diabetes care cascade for all ages, both sexes, and 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2023.

In 2023, an estimated 44% of people aged 15 and older with diabetes are unaware of their condition. Underdiagnosis was greatest among young adults-despite facing higher risks for long-term complications.

Among those who were diagnosed, 91% were on some form of pharmacological treatment. However, of those receiving treatment, only 42% had their blood sugar levels managed optimally. This translates to just 21% of all people with diabetes globally having their condition under optimal management.

Despite improvements over two decades, the research also found substantial regional diagnosis and treatment disparities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. High-income North America had the highest rates of diagnosis, while high-income Asia Pacific showed the highest rates of treatment among diagnosed individuals. Southern Latin America had the highest rates of optimal blood sugar management among those treated. In contrast, Central sub-Saharan Africa faced the largest gaps in diagnosis, with less than 20% of people with diabetes being aware of their condition.

By 2050, 1.3 billion people are expected to be living with diabetes, and if nearly half don't know they have a serious and potentially deadly health condition, it could easily become a silent epidemic."

Lauryn Stafford, first author and researcher at IHME

Given the pace at which cases are rapidly rising, the research underscores the urgent need for investment in screening programs for younger populations and access to medications and glucose-monitoring tools, especially in underserved regions. In 2022, the WHO set a target to have 80% of people with diabetes clinically diagnosed by 2030.

The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In-hospital strokes — defined as those occurring during hospitalization for another diagnosis — are relatively common, affecting between 35,000 and 75,000 patients each year in the US.

While the hospital may seem like the optimal setting for a stroke to occur to ensure good care and outcomes, these strokes actually have worse outcomes than those occurring in the community, said Fernando D. Testai, MD, PhD, professor of vascular neurology and fellowship director at UI Health, Chicago.

Testai is also a co-author of the recent American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on best practices to improve in-hospital stroke care. “Patients who experience a stroke during hospitalization are more likely to experience delays in symptom recognition and initiation of treatment and worse outcomes compared to strokes occurring in the community,” Testai said in an email interview with Medscape Medical News.

Hospitalists, he said, can play an important role in improving that scenario. Like other non-neurologists, they can “serve as the first line of defense in recognizing new signs and symptoms of stroke and engaging the stroke team,” he said.

“Beyond the acute setting, they play a critical role in delivering comprehensive, longitudinal healthcare,” he said, helping patients manage vascular risk factors and encouraging lifestyle modifications to reduce recurrent stroke risk — both for those patients affected after they have been admitted and those who arrive seeking treatment for a suspected stroke.

In years past, options to treat acute stroke were limited, and management was largely supportive, Testai said. “This led to a somewhat nihilistic attitude toward acute stroke management in the medical community. However, over the past 15 years, significant advances have transformed the acute stroke landscape.”

As a result, he said, a new generation of non-neurologists realize that effective treatments exist. They also realize prompt treatment is crucial. “In stroke care, time is brain,” Testai said.

Testai recommends that hospitalists maintain a high index of suspicion about stroke when caring for patients and that they promptly engage the stroke team if needed — because that will maximize the chances of timely treatment, in the process minimizing brain injury and improving patient outcomes.

It's important, too, he said, to be able to differentiate between stroke mimics — any condition that presents with signs or symptoms similar to a stroke but not vascular in origin — and a stroke chameleon — an actual stroke that presents atypically and masquerades as a non-stroke. Confusion due to hyperglycemia might appear as a stroke mimic, for instance, while nonsensical speech in a postsurgical patient might be thought to be an anesthesia effect but could be an evolving stroke.

Testa's advice: “Given the potential consequence of missing a true stroke, sensitivity is prioritized over specificity.” Maintain a low threshold for activating a stroke code, he said.

In a session at the Society of Hospital Medicine's CONVERGE conference, neurohospitalist Joseph “Caleb” McCall, MD, MBA, Neurohospitalist Division chief and clinical assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, discussed the past, present, and future of stroke care, citing studies, guidelines, and developments that hospitalists should know about.

Among the highlights of his talk:

In a post-conference interview with Medscape Medical News, McCall said: “There's sort of a micro and macro perspective on stroke. The micro is for each patient, and that's hard to encapsulate in an overview. The macro has to do with the [healthcare center's] platform and how to deliver care to all.”

Hospitalists should become familiar with the resources of their own hospital, McCall said. That means knowing procedures starting from the emergency room “to the critical imaging and testing that has to be done in radiology, all the way down to the system that helps you link those things, such as patient transport.”

Hospitalists will generally be providing care outside that hyperacute window, McCall said. He encourages developing a good relationship with the neurologists on staff and the therapy and rehabilitation team. “All are going to be really important for care.”

Be aware of your facility's policy for when a patient needs referral to a higher level of care, whether to the ICU or another hospital, he said. If your facility has no guidance, “it makes sense to work with your allies inside the institution to create guidance,” McCall said.

Become familiar with tools such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.

“For stroke patients, every decision we make as hospitalists carries the profound power to shape their future,” said Gurdeep Singh, DO, a hospitalist and associate professor at The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who currently serves as the past president of the Society of Hospital Medicine's New Mexico chapter.

“While we may care for 16 or more patients in a single day, each patient often has only one doctor — and, in that moment, our presence and attention can mean everything.”

His advice: “Know your protocols.” These may be different, he said, if a stroke occurs in the emergency department vs on the floors. If you are the first doctor to become aware of the stroke, know how to respond and place orders. “If you're further down the chain, then what do you need to verify as well as implement?”

“One of the problems is that the focus of stroke accreditation institutions and hospitals is typically centered in the emergency department,” Testai said. As a result, he said, there is substantial variability among hospitals in terms of what constitutes stroke education for staff and how widely it is disseminated in each institution.

In the AHA scientific statement, issued in 2022, five core elements to optimize in-hospital stroke care are proposed:

“Stroke care captures the very essence of what it means to be a hospitalist,” Singh said. “In these moments, we care for individuals during some of the most vulnerable — and often most frightening — days of their lives. Through clear communication, rapid deployment of resources, and the thoughtful application of medical knowledge, we have the opportunity to make a profound difference.”

Testai, McCall, and Singh had no relevant disclosures.

People with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obstructive sleep apnea have a higher risk of death, but treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may reduce that risk by around 26%, according to new research being presented at this year's Annual Meeting of The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), Vienna (15-19 Sept).

The Swedish researchers said the results underscore the importance of treating sleep apnea as part of a broader effort to control type 2 diabetes and improve long-term survival.

Obstructive sleep apnea is when throat muscles relax during sleep, blocking the airway, causing a person to wake up repeatedly to breathe. This disrupted sleep pattern can lower oxygen levels, affecting the brain. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart trouble, and T2D.

CPAP machines treat sleep apnea by delivering pressurized air through a mask to keep the airway open during sleep. However, research on the effects of CPAP on survival has produced mixed results.

Obstructive sleep apnea affects around 1 billion of the world's adults aged 30-69 years, and an estimated 50–80% of adults with T2D, most of whom are undiagnosed, increasing the risk of complications. In people with T2D, sleep apnea is associated with more than a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease (including heart failure and stroke) and a 24% higher risk of dying from any cause compared to those without sleep apnea.

Despite the substantial impact of obstructive sleep apnea on cardiovascular disease and survival, it often goes undiagnosed in people with type 2 diabetes and is not routinely addressed as part of diabetes management. What's more, the impact of treatment with CPAP on survival in people with T2D hasn't been clear."

Dr. Jonas Aghome, lead author from Linköping University, Sweden

Previous studies in patients with both T2D and obstructive sleep apnea have been limited by short follow-up periods and a focus on metabolic endpoints, rather than on longer-term clinical outcomes such as survival.

To answer these questions, Swedish researchers analysed data from five Swedish national registers between 2010 and 2024 to identify 12,388 T2D patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had been prescribed CPAP and 737,911 T2D patients (whose obstructive sleep apnea status was unknown) who were never prescribed CPAP, to compare long-term survival.

Dr Agholme explains, "Despite potential dilution from including individuals without obstructive sleep apnea in the control group, the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in people with T2D, together with the higher risk of illness associated with having both T2D and obstructive sleep apnea, should allow any clinically relevant associations of CPAP to be detected."

The CPAP treatment group included less women ( 31% vs. 43%), was younger (average age 58 years vs. 65 years), but had a higher average body mass index (BMI, 34.7 kg/m² vs. 30.6 kg/m²).

Of those prescribed CPAP, 764 people (6.1%) died within 14 years compared to 212,336 people (28.7%) of those who did not receive CPAP.

After adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, and prior cardiovascular disease, as well as factors that may vary during follow-up including BMI, smoking, cholesterol, kidney function, blood pressure, and pharmacological treatment, they found that patients who were prescribed CPAP had a 26% lower risk of dying from any cause over the 14-year period, compared with patients who never received CPAP.

"This new study using real-world data highlights the potential benefits of CPAP in people with T2D and obstructive sleep apnea, a clinical conundrum that has long awaited answers," said Dr Agholme. "The findings suggest that CPAP may play an important role in improving patient outcomes and survival, and they underline the value of early OSA diagnosis in people with T2D. Still, more rigorous research is needed to determine the causal effect of CPAP treatment. "

This is an observational study, and as such, residual confounding and selection bias cannot be entirely ruled out. The authors also acknowledge that data on CPAP adherence were only available for a small subset of patients, so the analyses followed an intention-to-treat principle. They also lacked information on sleep apnea severity across groups, so could not examine whether the effect of CPAP differs by severity. Finally, since the study was conducted within the Swedish healthcare system, further work will be needed to assess the generalisability of these findings to other contexts.

A large-scale survey conducted by Lung Cancer Europe (LuCE) has identified critical communication barriers that affect information access, understanding, and shared decision-making among lung cancer patients and caregivers across Europe.

The research was reported at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).

The study, based on 2,040 valid survey responses from 34 WHO European Region countries in 20 languages, evaluated three key areas: general knowledge about lung cancer, access to information, and involvement in decision-making. The findings underscore the need for healthcare systems to improve communication practices and patient engagement to ensure more person-centered care.

Lung Cancer Europe (LuCE) is a nonprofit, patient-led organization that serves as the umbrella group for lung cancer advocacy organizations across Europe.

Patients need information that is understandable, timely, and supports meaningful participation in their care. Despite best intentions, current systems often fall short of empowering patients and caregivers to make informed decisions."

Debra Montague of LuCE, the presenting author

Montague reported that 65% of participants delayed seeking care due to unrecognized symptoms and 22% were unaware of biomarkers, while 24% did not understand their prognosis.

She added that 40% said they did not receive enough information and 29% did not fully understand what they received.

"Patients told us that common barriers included information processing (39%), lack of clarity (33%), and complexity (33%)," she said. "Surprisingly, only 56% felt their opinion was considered in treatment decisions while 60% felt the care plan matched patient preferences."

Montague reported that the top obstacle to shared decision-making was complex medical language (49%).

The majority of respondents (64%) valued both quality and length of life equally, though about one-third prioritized quality over quantity of life, underscoring the need for personalized care discussions.

Montague said she encourages healthcare providers, policymakers, and advocacy groups to collaborate to improve early diagnosis, enhance communication, and prioritize shared decision-making.

"Health providers must enable and implement shared decision-making to help enhance quality of life. Improved communication strategies are critical to deliver person-centered care," Montague said.

A new study presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) demonstrates that monitoring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can refine and personalize the use of consolidation immunotherapy in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).

The research, led by scientists at the National Cancer Center of China, assessed ctDNA in 177 patients with LS-SCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), 77 of whom received consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Circulating tumor DNA was measured at multiple time points to evaluate its ability to predict survival outcomes and immunotherapy benefits.

This is the first study to show that early ctDNA detection after induction chemotherapy can help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from consolidation immunotherapy. It's a step toward precision immunotherapy in limited-stage SCLC."

Dr. Nan Bi, from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences

Key findings:

The study used next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a 139-gene lung cancer panel to assess ctDNA at ultra-deep coverage (30,000×). Advanced statistical models including time-dependent Cox regression were employed to eliminate immortal time bias.

"These findings offer a compelling rationale for integrating ctDNA-based stratification in future LS-SCLC trials and may help guide real-time decisions on the use of consolidation ICIs," Dr. Bi said.

For most broken bones, bone cells regrow on their own while patients wear a cast or brace to keep the injury steady. But for complex or severe fractures, surgeons may intervene by placing grafts or scaffolds made of biocompatible materials, or by using metal fixation devices to ensure proper bone healing and alignment. Collaborating with orthopedic surgeons, a team led by biomedical engineering researchers at Penn State created CitraBoneQMg, an implantable biodegradable scaffold to support bone regrowth made by combining magnesium and glutamine with citric acid. They published research on their implant, for which they filed a U.S. patent application, in Science Advances.

"By integrating magnesium and glutamine - two small molecules found naturally in the body and in food - with citric acid, we found that the molecules work together to promote bone growth by encouraging increased intracellular energy metabolism," said first author Hui Xu, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, who is advised by co-corresponding author Su Yan, assistant research professor of biomedical engineering.

The researchers found that adding magnesium and glutamine to a traditional citric acid-only based implant, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and on the market, increased intracellular energy and helped regulate two energy pathways that are essential for bone growth, AMPK and mTORC1. The pathways act as control systems inside the cell, balancing fuel use so cells have the energy to make new bone.

"The molecules concurrently regulate the two energy pathways, which is different than what normally happens – usually they act as a seesaw, one speeding up while the other slows down," Xu said. "The scaffold essentially powers up a bone cell: both nutrients act in a synergistic relationship with the citric acid to give stem cells more energy to grow and differentiate to bone cells, leading to better bone regrowth."

To test CitraBoneQMg, the researchers implanted their experimental scaffold into a cranial defect of the skull of rats and compared its resulting bone growth to rats with a citric acid only-based scaffold implant and one with a traditional bone material implant.

They found that after 12 weeks, CitraBoneQMg had increased the bone growth surrounding the cranial injury by 56% as compared to the animals with the citric acid only-based scaffold and 185% compared to the animals with a traditional bone material implant.

"The three molecules work as a healing recipe for the bone, paving the way for a new way of thinking of bone repair," Yan said. "Alongside rapid bone growth, we also saw nerve regeneration and antiinflammation properties at the site of the scaffold, two elements that are important to long-term healing of the bone."

Releasing the molecules directly at the site of the injury via the scaffold helps transport a high concentration of nutrients directly to where they are most needed, the researchers explained, rather than relying on oral ingestion, where only a small percentage reaches the injury site.

Additionally, the researchers discovered that the polymer scaffold contains inherent photoluminescent and photoacoustic properties, which allows it to be easily imaged after it is implanted at the injury site.

"With photoacoustic properties, CitraBoneQMg has great potential for in vivo tracking, where it can be detected by ultrasound underneath deep tissue," Xu said.

In addition to Xu and Yan, the Penn State-affiliated co-authors include Ethan Gerhard, Rohitraj Ray and Yuqi Wang, doctoral students in biomedical engineering; Sri-Rajasekhar Kothapalli, associate professor of biomedical engineering; and April D. Armstrong, the C. McCollister Evarts Professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation and chief of the Shoulder and Elbow Service, Penn State Health.

An international team of scientists has revealed how rogue rings of DNA that float outside of our chromosomes – known as extrachromosomal DNA, or ecDNA – can drive the growth of a large proportion of glioblastomas, the most common and aggressive adult brain cancer. The discovery could open the door to much-needed new approaches to diagnose glioblastoma early, track its progress and treat it more effectively.

The findings, published today in Cancer Discovery, are the first to suggest that ecDNA rings containing cancer-driving genes often appear in the earliest stages of glioblastoma's development – and in some cases, even before the tumor has fully formed. This early arrival may set the stage for the cancer's rapid growth, adaptability and resistance to treatment. 

The study was led by Dr. Benjamin Werner at Queen Mary University of London and Professor Paul Mischel at Stanford University, both part of Cancer Grand Challenges' team eDyNAmiC, as well as Professor Charlie Swanton at The Francis Crick Institute.

Glioblastoma is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with median survival remaining at around 14 months and little improvement in recent decades. New approaches for earlier detection and more effective treatment are urgently needed. 

ecDNA is emerging as a potentially important player in many adult and paediatric cancers, including glioblastoma, but its role is complex and mysterious. The Cancer Grand Challenges initiative – founded by Cancer Research UK and the National Cancer Institute in the US – identified understanding ecDNA as one of the toughest challenges facing the field today. In 2022, they funded team eDyNAmiC – a $25m international, cross-disciplinary consortium of experts in cancer, clinical research, evolutionary biology, computer science and mathematics – to decipher ecDNA's role and identify ways to target it. The current study marks an important advance in team eDyNAmiC's work.

In their new study, team eDyNAmiC and their collaborators integrated genomic and imaging data from patients with glioblastoma with advanced computational modelling of the evolution of ecDNAs in space and time.

We studied the tumors much like an archaeologist would. Rather than taking a single sample, we excavated multiple sites around the tumor, allowing us to build computational models describing how they evolved. We simulated millions of different scenarios to reconstruct how the earliest ecDNAs emerged, spread, and drove tumor aggressiveness, giving us a clearer picture of the tumor's origins and progression."

Dr. Benjamin Werner, senior author, group leader at the Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London 

The analysis revealed that most ecDNA rings contained EGFR, a potent cancer-driving gene. EGFR ecDNA appeared early in the cancer's evolution – even before tumor formation in some patients. It also frequently gained extra changes, such as the EGFRvIII variant, that made the cancer more aggressive and resistant to therapies. 

"These subtle mechanisms show that there may be a window of opportunity to detect and treat the disease between the first appearance of EGFR ecDNA and the emergence of these more aggressive variants," suggests Dr. Magnus Haughey, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr Werner's group and one of the paper's lead authors. "If scientists can develop a reliable test to detect early EGFR ecDNA – for example through a blood test – it could enable them to intervene before the disease becomes harder to treat."

The study confirmed that ecDNA can carry more than one cancer gene at a time, each of which may uniquely shape how tumors evolve and respond to treatment. This highlights the potential value of tailoring treatments based on a tumor's ecDNA profile.

Yet many mysteries remain. The researchers now plan to study how different treatments affect the number and types of ecDNA in glioblastoma. Team eDyNAmiC will continue to investigate the role of ecDNAs across a range of cancer types to uncover further opportunities to diagnose cancers earlier, track their progress more precisely, and design smarter treatments.

Charlie Swanton, Deputy Clinical Director and head of the Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory at The Francis Crick Institute and chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, says: 

"These findings suggest that ecDNA is not just a passenger in glioblastoma, but an early and powerful driver of the disease. By tracing when and how ecDNA arises, we open up the possibility of detecting glioblastoma much earlier and intervening before it becomes so aggressive and resistant to therapy. I hope this might help to drive a new era in how we diagnose, track and treat this devastating cancer."

Paul Mischel, MD, the Fortinet Founders Professor and professor and vice chair of research in the pathology department at Stanford Medicine, says:

"These findings reveal an important new insight into the role of ecDNA in tumor development and progression. Previous work from our collaborative team and other researchers, has shown that ecDNA can arise early in tumor development, including at the stage of high-grade dysplasia, and it can also arise later to drive tumor progression and treatment resistance. The findings here show that in glioblastoma, there is an early event driven by ecDNA that could potentially be more actionable, raising the possibility that glioblastoma is another cancer for which earlier detection and intervention based upon ecDNA may be possible."

This study exemplifies the bold, boundary-pushing science Cancer Grand Challenges was created to support. By unravelling the evolutionary history of ecDNA in glioblastoma, team eDyNAmiC is not only deepening our understanding of one of the most devastating cancers but also illuminating new paths for earlier detection and treatment. It's a powerful reminder that when we bring together diverse disciplines and global talent, we can begin to solve the toughest problems facing cancer research."

A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on the potential therapeutic effects of berberine (BBR), a natural compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, in treating diabetic encephalopathy (DE). The research, conducted by a team from the State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, reveals that BBR can significantly improve cognitive function and protect cerebral vessels in type 2 diabetic encephalopathy mice by modulating the gut microbiota.

Diabetic encephalopathy is a condition characterized by cognitive impairment due to chronic hyperglycemia, often leading to severe neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenesis of DE is complex and involves factors like cerebrovascular inflammation, which can be exacerbated by the activation of inflammatory pathways such as Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The study investigates the role of BBR in mitigating these effects by targeting the gut microbiota, which has been increasingly recognized for its influence on neurological health.The researchers used a type 2 diabetic encephalopathy KK-Ay (2DEK) mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of BBR. The mice were divided into three groups: a control group, a low-dose BBR group (100 mg/kg/day), and a high-dose BBR group (200 mg/kg/day). After ten weeks of treatment, the cognitive functions of the mice were assessed using novel object recognition and step-down tests. The results showed that BBR treatment significantly improved cognitive performance, with the high-dose group demonstrating the most substantial improvements.High-resolution imaging via fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) revealed that BBR treatment enhanced the integrity of brain vessels. The average vessel diameter, vessel length density, and total vessel volume were significantly improved in the parietal association cortex (PtA) and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. These findings suggest that BBR can protect cerebral vessels from hyperglycemia-induced damage.The study also explored the mechanism by which BBR exerts its protective effects. It was found that BBR inhibits the production of δ-valerobetaine (δ-VB), a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota that can cross the blood-brain barrier and activate the TLR-4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway in blood vessel endothelial cells. By reducing δ-VB levels, BBR interrupts this inflammatory pathway, thereby protecting cerebral blood vessels and improving brain function.To further validate the role of the gut microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed using gut microbiota from BBR-treated mice. The results confirmed that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in mediating the therapeutic effects of BBR. The transplanted microbiota significantly improved cognitive function and reduced inflammation in the recipient mice, similar to the effects observed with direct BBR treatment.The study also analyzed the changes in the gut microbiota composition following BBR treatment. The results showed that BBR increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Akkermansia, which are known to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and may contribute to the overall therapeutic benefits of BBR. Conversely, BBR reduced the levels of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella, which are associated with increased inflammation.The study provides compelling evidence that BBR can protect cerebral vessels and alleviate diabetic encephalopathy by modulating the gut microbiota and reducing the production of harmful metabolites like δ-VB. These findings highlight the potential of BBR as a therapeutic agent for DE and underscore the importance of the gut-brain axis in managing neurological disorders. Future research should focus on clinical trials to further explore the therapeutic potential of BBR in human patients with DE.

Black adolescents with mental distress are less likely to use mental health services than their White peers, and Black girls are the least likely to access care, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241733.

"Adolescence is a crucial developmental stage and a critical period for onset of mental health problems," writes Mercedes Sobers, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto and research coordinator at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, Ontario, with coauthors. "In Canada, Black adolescents disproportionately access services through crisis situations, such as justice system interactions or when intensive care is required, suggesting they are less likely to access mental health care until intense intervention is needed."

There is a lack of data on mental health services usage in Canada for Black youth and other racialized populations.

The study, which included data on 12 368 middle- and high-school students (grades 7–12) who identified as Black or White from the 2015, 2017, and 2019 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, encompassed schools from as many as 52 school boards in Ontario. It included students from English and French schools in both the public and Catholic systems from the Greater Toronto Region, Northern, Western and Eastern Ontario.

The researchers found distinct trends for Black males and females. Black females consistently used mental health services less than their White peers, with the gap widening as their distress increased. Although Black males with low distress were more likely to use services than their White counterparts, once their distress increased to moderate levels, their odds of service use dropped significantly. In general, Black youth (both male and female) who were more distressed were less likely to report using services than their White peers.

"Black adolescent mental health must be discussed with consideration of the interaction between being Black, sex, and mental distress," write the authors.

Many barriers may reduce access to care, such as a lack of culturally competent care, inaccessible services, racism, and cultural stigma that can contribute to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and misconceptions that foster mistrust in the system. The shortage of mental health professionals who understand the unique perspectives and challenges of Black adolescents can hinder diagnosis and treatment.

"Black boys are more likely to be perceived as older, less innocent, and more threatening than White peers. When Black males exhibit signs of psychological distress, they are more likely to be met with disciplinary or punitive responses, sometimes with fatal consequences, rather than mental health support. This may also explain why, once they overcome access barriers, their care frequency matches that of White peers," write the authors.

They call for specific policy and practice changes to help equalize mental health service use.

"Intersectional strategies that tackle racism and the specific mental health challenges faced by Black students are needed. Enhancing mental health service utilization for Black adolescents demands culturally responsive and sex-specific adaptations to care."

An Australian study suggests that mandatory folic acid fortification may have unintended consequences, linking excess folate to rising gestational diabetes and calling for urgent policy reassessment.



Study: Maternal Folate Excess, Placental Hormones, and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Findings from Prospective Cohorts Before and After Mandatory Folic Acid Food Fortification. Image Credit: Pixel-Shot  / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Australia investigated the potential associations between folic acid, a commonly used food fortification in Australia, and the alarming surge in gestational diabetes currently observed in the country. The study leveraged a “natural experiment” comprising two large groups of pregnant women (n = 2,464; SCOPE and STOP cohorts) before and after Australia mandated folic acid food fortification.

Study findings revealed that post-fortification, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rates tripled, maternal folate stores rose by 259%, and levels of key placental hormones were altered in ways that may affect glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that widespread maternal folate excess may be associated with the Australian GDM epidemic.

Beyond GDM: While GDM surged post-fortification, other complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth showed no similar increase, pointing to a specific link with glucose metabolism.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of high blood sugar that develops specifically during pregnancy and can pose severe health risks to both the mother and her unborn child. Australia currently faces an unprecedented surge in GDM incidence, with reports estimating a rise from only 5.6% in 2010 to 19.3% in 2022.

While factors like rising maternal age and obesity are known contributors to GDM, their prevalence fails to account for the steepness of this trajectory, leading scientists to seek other potential environmental drivers and modifiable risk factors. Folic acid, the synthetic form of vitamin B9 (folate), and a known crucial requirement for normal foetal neural tube development, presents an unlikely prime candidate.

To ensure adequate vitamin B9 intake, Australia implemented a mandatory folic acid (FA) fortification program for bread-making flour (2009). This policy, combined with a sharp increase in the use of high-dose prenatal supplements, has successfully reduced Australia's previous folate deficiency.

However, a growing body of observational and animal evidence suggests that the overconsumption of folic acid may trigger gestational complications, including GDM. Validating these accounts would help inform future public health policy within the nation, potentially reducing the risk faced by millions of mothers and children.

Triglycerides also played a role: Within the post-fortification group, high triglyceride levels were actually a stronger independent predictor of GDM risk than folate itself.

The present study aims to meet this knowledge requirement by leveraging a “unique natural experiment” comparing two large prospective cohorts of pregnant women recruited from the same hospital, one before and one after Australia's 2009 folic acid fortification mandate.

Data for the pre-fortification group were obtained from the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) cohort, comprising 1,164 women recruited between 2005 and 2008. Analytically identical data from the Screening Tests to identify poor Outcomes of Pregnancy (STOP) cohort (1,300 participants), recruited between 2015 and 2018, were used to synthesize the post-fortification group dataset. Long-term folate data (RCF) for the pre-fortification period were not available from SCOPE and were instead derived from a separate contemporaneous cohort at the same hospital using identical protocols.

Data collection included blood samples (collected during early pregnancy) for serum folate and red cell folate (RCF) levels as representatives of recent intake and long-term folate stores, respectively. Key placental hormones involved in glucose regulation (e.g., human placental lactogen [hPL], placental growth hormone [GH2]) were also estimated.

The study's primary outcome of interest was the rate of GDM, which was diagnosed using the same criteria for both cohorts to ensure a valid comparison. Between-group comparisons were conducted within a meta-analytic framework, utilizing log-binomial regression with inverse probability weighting models.

Folate deficiency also showed a hint of risk: While numbers were very small, the single case of GDM among the few women with folate deficiency suggests a potential U-shaped risk curve.

Log-binomial regression with inverse probability weighting revealed a dramatic shift in both GDM rates and folate levels between the STOP and SCOPE participants. GDM incidence was observed to triple from 5.0% (SCOPE) to 15.2% in post-fortification STOP, mirrored by an unprecedented surge in maternal folate levels. Long-term folate stores, measured by RCF, were 259% higher in the post-fortification group (p < 0.0001).

Most alarmingly, between-group comparisons revealed that the proportion of women with RCF levels above the established clinical reference range increased from 0.5% before fortification to 57.6% afterward, indicating a nationwide scenario of folate excess. Serum folate was also 18% higher in the post-fortification group. However, serum folate concentrations alone were not significantly associated with the risk of GDM, whereas excess RBC folate was.

Subsequent analysis directly linked this folate excess to the risk of GDM. In the post-fortification cohort, women with excess RCF had 48% more GDM cases than women with normal RCF levels (p = 0.03). For every 500 nmol/L increase in RCF, the risk of developing GDM was observed to rise by 34% (p = 0.04).

Finally, the study found that women in the post-fortification era had significantly higher concentrations of placental hormones, including a 29% increase in hPL and a 13% increase in GH2. The authors noted that these hormones influenced the risk of GDM in opposite directions (hPL potentially protective, GH2 adverse), and while this suggests a plausible biological pathway, the combined mediation effect was not statistically significant.

The present study provides evidence of associations between Australia's publicly successful folic acid fortification program of 2009 and its current GDM epidemic. Its findings suggest that high folate levels may alter placental hormone production, potentially disrupting the mother's ability to regulate blood sugar during pregnancy.

While folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy remains essential, this research underscores the need to reassess current fortification and high-dose supplementation policies. Future public health policy in Australia should prioritize establishing an upper safe limit for folate intake during pregnancy, as it is crucial to balance the prevention of congenital disabilities with the protection of maternal metabolic health.

A common and inexpensive diabetes drug could significantly lower the risk of Long COVID in overweight individuals, opening new possibilities for prevention strategies in the pandemic's long tail.



Study: Effect of Metformin on the Risk of Post-coronavirus Disease 2019 Condition Among Individuals With Overweight or Obese: A Population-based Retrospective Cohort Study. Image Credit: luchschenF / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, researchers conducted a large-scale retrospective analysis to investigate whether the common diabetes medication metformin could reduce the risk of overweight or obese individuals developing Long COVID in a real-world setting.

The study leveraged data from over 1.8 million observations from 624,308 individuals in the UK and found that overweight/obese patients who initiated metformin within 90 days (across three sequential trial emulations) after a COVID-19 infection demonstrated a 64% reduction in their likelihood of a subsequent Long COVID diagnosis. 

These findings suggest that this inexpensive drug may offer a potential preventive benefit for individuals with higher weights, thereby improving the quality of life for this at-risk population.

Despite the acute phase of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) having passed, widespread reports and a growing body of evidence highlight that many survivors continue to suffer from the pandemic's aftermath. Colloquially called "Long COVID", post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is an umbrella term for complex, multi-system disorders characterized by over 200 possible symptoms, including persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), shortness of breath, and insomnia.

The World Health Organization (WHO) officially defines PCC as symptoms lasting at least two months, typically starting within three months of the initial infection. UK surveys reveal that more than 1.9 million people (2.9% of the population) have Long COVID as of March 2023, underscoring the importance of identifying and mitigating risk factors.

Unfortunately, since the mechanisms underlying Long COVID remain largely elusive, recent research has aimed to identify common and affordable interventions to help COVID-19 patients and inform risk mitigation policies. A previous randomized trial, COVID-OUT, reported reduced PCC incidence as a prespecified secondary outcome in overweight/obese individuals, though real-world applicability remained uncertain.

Metformin is a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is best known for its ability to lower blood glucose. However, the drug has demonstrated powerful anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to activate a key cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which may interfere with viral replication; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear.

The present study aims to establish the efficacy of metformin for preventing Long COVID in a real-world setting. The study design was retrospective and leveraged anonymized primary care data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database. Notably, the database covers nearly 25% of England's population.

Study inclusion criteria included adults with clinically validated overweight or obesity (defined as a Body Mass Index [BMI] of 25 kg/m² or higher) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and July 2023. Patients with medically recorded metformin use or other glucose-lowering drugs prior to their COVID-19 infections or metformin contraindications were excluded from subsequent analyses.

The study employed a statistical method known as "sequential target trial emulation" (with three entry points) to simulate the design and potential findings of a randomized controlled trial. Analyses involved comparing the one-year risk of Long COVID in patients who initiated metformin within 30 days of three staggered baselines (diagnosis, 30 days post-diagnosis, and 60 days post-diagnosis) to those who did not. The primary outcome of interest was a clinically validated PCC diagnosis or the emergence of new WHO-listed symptoms (without pre-infection history) between 90 and 365 days after infection.

After applying the exclusion criteria, the final study included 624,308 adults, 2,976 of whom initiated metformin after infection. Study findings revealed a statistically significant association between metformin use and a reduced risk of Long COVID. Specifically, the intention-to-treat analysis found that metformin initiators demonstrated a 64% reduction in PCC risk (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.36; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.32–0.41) compared with non-initiators.

Notably, these results translate to a one-year absolute risk difference of -12.58%, suggesting that approximately eight overweight/obese individuals need to be treated with metformin to prevent one Long COVID case.

Per-protocol analysis confirmed these findings (HR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.33–0.41), with the observed association remaining statistically significant across all investigated subgroups, including different age groups, genders, BMI categories, diabetes status (51.9% of metformin users had T2DM), and during periods dominated by both the Delta and Omicron variants. A negative control analysis revealed no association with cancer risk (HR 1.13), supporting the robustness of the findings.

The present study demonstrates the potential benefits of metformin in the effort to mitigate Long COVID, specifically in overweight/obese individuals. This extensive, real-world study provides evidence suggesting that early treatment with metformin may significantly reduce the risk of developing Long COVID in this population. As an observational study, these results indicate association but cannot prove causation.

While its mechanisms remain unclear, the drug's potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects are thought to be possible contributors. Crucially, the findings may not generalize to individuals of normal weight. The next step is to conduct large-scale, randomized controlled trials to confirm causality and clarify the role of metformin in the global strategy against post-COVID-19 conditions.

Portugal have qualified for eight editions, with their best result being a third-place finish in 1966. More recently, the European Selecao reached the quarter-finals in 2022, losing to eventual finalists France 0-3.

This marks the 16th meeting between the two teams, and Portugal lead Hungary 10-0 with five draws. The two teams met for the first time in December 1926, an international friendly which ended in a 3-3 draw.

In their most recent meeting, during the UEFA European Championship 2020, Ronaldo scored a brace in three minutes following Raphael Guerreiro's 84th-minute opener to complete a 3-0 rout at Puskas Arena, Budapest.

When and where will the Hungary vs Portugal, FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifying match be played?

The Hungary vs Portugal, FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifying match will be played in Budapest, Hungary on September 10, Wednesday at 12:15 am IST.

France returns to action in Group D of the World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday, with Iceland visiting the Parc des Princes in a matchup that could shape the early race for qualification.

Both nations opened their group campaigns with victories and sit level on three points. Les Bleus looked solid in their opener, defeating Ukraine 2–0 on Friday. The performance underlined France's defensive organization and attacking efficiency, though Didier Deschamps will want his side to be more clinical in front of goal as the qualifiers progress.

Iceland, meanwhile, announced itself with authority in a 5–0 rout of Azerbaijan. The emphatic win highlighted the team's attacking confidence, but facing France in Paris presents a far greater challenge. The Icelandic squad will need to show defensive resilience while searching for counterattacking opportunities to threaten the hosts.

For France, the stakes are about maintaining momentum and avoiding the kind of slip-ups that can complicate qualification campaigns. Iceland, however, enters with nothing to lose and the motivation of testing itself against one of Europe's elite sides.

England face their toughest World Cup qualifier when they travel to Serbia on Tuesday night. The Three Lions will step out at the Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade in front of what is expected to be a fiery atmosphere.

Thomas Tuchel's men are top of Group K with four wins from four, but Serbia is hot on their heels in second place. Only the group winner is guaranteed a place in the 2026 World Cup, and second place will enter a play-off.

A win for England would almost guaratee their spot in USA, Mexico and Canada. Stay tuned for all the latest updates below...

There are a couple of familiar faces in the Serbia starting XI

Nottingham Forest defender Nikola Milenkovic starts at centre-back and star striker Dusan Vlahovic, who is regularly linked with Premier League clubs, leads the line.

Serbia starting XI: Petrovic; Erakovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Maksimovic, Nedelkovic, Ilic, Lukic, Birmancevic; Zivkovic, Vlahovic



England starting XI (4-2-3-1): Pickford; James, Konsa, Gueki, Livramento; Rice, Anderson; Gordon, Rogers, Madueke; Kane

Subs: Quansah, J. Henderson, Eze, Rashford, Burn, D. Henderson, Spence, Gibbs-White, Loftus-Cheek, Watkins, Bowen, TRafford

The scene is set ahead of tonight's 7.45pm kick-off. England will need to be much better than they were against Andorra at the weekend.





Football fans have made their early predictions for the 2026 World Cup and 32% of voters in Betfair's poll picked Spain to lift the Jules Rimet Trophy next year.

England are the second favourites with 18% of the vote, followed by France, Brazil and then Argentina.

The two England legends clashed over the past week, with Michael Owen claiming it was "nuts" that Harry Kane moved to Bayern Munich with the Premier League all-time goalscoring record well within reach.

Kane fired back: "I heard it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I've spent a bit of time with him [Owen] but don't know him well. Obviously he is a Premier League great and an England great as well so I'll respect him as a person.

"But ultimately, as he will know, everyone's career is different -- everyone's decisions and motivations are different.

"I know he was insinuating I went just for the trophy but it was to be at the highest level for as long as possible and I'm really happy in that sense of playing big games, title runs, big Champions League matches, Club World Cup quarterfinal.

"I feel I'm improving as a player, I'm pushing my limits as a player in terms of goalscoring and just improving. It's hard not to hear things these days but the decisions are best for me and I'm really happy that I made that decision and very happy at Bayern Munich now."

Harry Kane has declared that England are prepared to walk off the pitch should any of his team-mates suffer racist abuse this evening.

"Yes, we had a similar situation in Bulgaria. UEFA have the protocols in place for us to follow. We know the steps, we know the situation," the striker said.

"We're talking about something that's not happened yet. We'll take every in our stride, everything as it comes. We're clear in what we want to do. Let's just see what happens tomorrow night. We're more focused on Serbia as a team and how we can hurt them."



Some early team news has been leaked today with reports suggesting that Arsenal youngster Myles Lewis-Skelly has been axed from the squad.

Thomas Tuchel is expected to make three changes. It is claimed that Newcastle full-back Tino Livramento will be handed a starting berth.

But his club team-mate Dan Burn is apparently set to be dropped for Ezri Konsa. The final tweak to the starting XI is expected to be Morgan Rogers in for Ebereche Eze.

Good evening and welcome to Express Sport's live coverage of Serbia vs England, which is the fifth of eight qualifying matches for the 2026 World Cup.

We're expecting team news in around 90 minutes time.

Women's Soccer

The North Carolina Courage have agreed to trade U.S. midfielder Jaedyn Shaw to NJ/NY Gotham FC for a record $1.25 million transfer fee, more than doubling the previous record set last month, multiple sources confirmed to The Athletic.

The trade was first reported by ESPN on Monday night.

The transfer fee for Shaw is set to be more than double the intra-league record previously set when Kansas City Current in August paid $600,000 to the Utah Royals for midfielder Ally Sentnor, another rising U.S. national team star.

A source with knowledge of the deal indicated the fee will be paid over multiple instalments and entirely with intra-league transfer funds. Gotham plans to sign Shaw on a contract through 2029.

While the secondary transfer window recently closed for any international arrival to the NWSL, trades between clubs can continue until Oct. 9.

Both Gotham and the Courage declined to comment when reached for this story.

Gotham currently sits 6th in league standings with 27 points and has been slowly climbing the NWSL ranks in recent weeks. They boast a 7-6-6 record, with forward Esther Gonzelez tied at the top of the Golden Boot race with 12 goals.

The club has struggled with creativity in their attack this year. With Shaw, the club will now have a versatile attacker known for her playmaking abilities. The 20-year-old provides an unexpected boost to the 2023 NWSL Champions, as they continue their playoff push and look ahead to a calendar riddled with intercontinental competitions.

Considering the length of Shaw's contract and hefty transfer fee, it's likely Gotham envisions Shaw as a foundational piece of their system moving forward.

Shaw signed with the Courage in January and was under contract through 2026. The Texas native arrived in North Carolina from San Diego Wave, after expressing her desire for a new challenge. Shaw won the NWSL Shield and NWSL Challenge Cup with the California club.

In their trade for Shaw, the Courage sent $300,000 in allocation money, an international spot for the 2025 and 2026 NWSL seasons and $150,000 in intra-league transfer fees to San Diego. With the Courage, Shaw scored three goals and recorded one assist across 19 appearances. In April, she told ESPN she struggled with the club's expectations.

The Courage currently sit 11th in the table, four points behind the final eighth place playoff spot. In August, the Courage abruptly fired former head coach Sean Nahas.

Shaw could be available for Gotham as soon as this weekend. The New Jersey club travels this week to San Diego, where they will face the Wave on Friday night.

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be the venue for a March friendly match between the United States men's national team and Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal, according to multiple sources.

The U.S. Soccer Federation is also trying to finalize an exhibition with Belgium during the same international window, sources said, with Atlanta potentially also the site for that exhibition. The Washington, D.C.-area is among others in contention for that friendly match, per the same sources. FIFA's two-match March window is the last before participating World Cup teams are required to submit their final 26-player rosters for the tournament.

The Athletic was the first to report Belgium and Portugal as the Americans' potential March opponents.

The Portugal match in Atlanta could coincide with the opening of U.S. Soccer's new $200 million-plus training facility in nearby Fayetteville, which is scheduled to open its doors this spring. The USMNT will train at the sprawling, 200-acre, state-of-the-art complex in May and early June before leaving for its World Cup base camp in Southern California. The Americans kick off their three-game group stage slate on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles against an opponent to be determined at December's draw.

Known as "The Benz," the 71,000-seat arena serves as home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of Major League Soccer. Both teams are owned by billionaire Home Depot founder Arthur Blank, who contributed $50 million toward the USSF training ground that bears his name. Blank's company also operates the $2 billion retractable roof stadium, which opened in 2017. Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host eight matches at the 2026 World Cup. Only AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas will have more.

While the USMNT in particular often has to contend with opposing fans outnumbering its own in major American cities, Atlanta has a proven history when it comes to supporting the home side. Last year, the U.S. women's national team drew more than 50,000 fans to The Benz, setting a new record for a USWNT friendly.

The American men have played just once previously at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a 2-1 loss to Panama in the first round of the 2024 Copa América in front of almost 60,000 spectators.

Portugal, FIFA's No. 6-ranked national team, won the UEFA Nations League title earlier this summer. But they have gone winless in their last four games against the Americans, including a famous 3-2 loss in the opening game for both nations at the 2002 World Cup. 

The U.S. and Portugal played to a 1-1 tie at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with Ronaldo setting up a stoppage time equalizer for his country. The 40-year-old legend and all-time leading scorer in men's international soccer history last played on U.S. soil just a few weeks later, in a friendly between Real Madrid and Manchester United in Ann Arbor, Michigan in August 2014. 

The most recent meeting between the USMNT and eighth-ranked Belgium came in the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup, with the Red Devils advancing in extra time. The U.S. men are 1-4 all time against the Belgians, their lone victory coming at the inaugural 1930 World Cup.

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be the venue for a March friendly match between the United States men's national team and Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal, according to multiple sources.

The U.S. Soccer Federation is also trying to finalize an exhibition with Belgium during the same international window, sources said, with Atlanta potentially also the site for that exhibition. The Washington, D.C.-area is among others in contention for that friendly match, per the same sources. FIFA's two-match March window is the last before participating World Cup teams are required to submit their final 26-player rosters for the tournament.

The Athletic was the first to report Belgium and Portugal as the Americans' potential March opponents.

The Portugal match in Atlanta could coincide with the opening of U.S. Soccer's new $200 million-plus training facility in nearby Fayetteville, which is scheduled to open its doors this spring. The USMNT will train at the sprawling, 200-acre, state-of-the-art complex in May and early June before leaving for its World Cup base camp in Southern California. The Americans kick off their three-game group stage slate on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles against an opponent to be determined at December's draw.

Known as "The Benz," the 71,000-seat arena serves as home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of Major League Soccer. Both teams are owned by billionaire Home Depot founder Arthur Blank, who contributed $50 million toward the USSF training ground that bears his name. Blank's company also operates the $2 billion retractable roof stadium, which opened in 2017. Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host eight matches at the 2026 World Cup. Only AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas will have more.

While the USMNT in particular often has to contend with opposing fans outnumbering its own in major American cities, Atlanta has a proven history when it comes to supporting the home side. Last year, the U.S. women's national team drew more than 50,000 fans to The Benz, setting a new record for a USWNT friendly.

The American men have played just once previously at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a 2-1 loss to Panama in the first round of the 2024 Copa América in front of almost 60,000 spectators.

Portugal, FIFA's No. 6-ranked national team, won the UEFA Nations League title earlier this summer. But they have gone winless in their last four games against the Americans, including a famous 3-2 loss in the opening game for both nations at the 2002 World Cup. 

The U.S. and Portugal played to a 1-1 tie at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with Ronaldo setting up a stoppage time equalizer for his country. The 40-year-old legend and all-time leading scorer in men's international soccer history last played on U.S. soil just a few weeks later, in a friendly between Real Madrid and Manchester United in Ann Arbor, Michigan in August 2014. 

The most recent meeting between the USMNT and eighth-ranked Belgium came in the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup, with the Red Devils advancing in extra time. The U.S. men are 1-4 all time against the Belgians, their lone victory coming at the inaugural 1930 World Cup.

World Cup

Former Inter Miami head coach Tata Martino has been watching Mauricio Pochettino's problematic stint as U.S. men's national team manager from afar, and he offered his thoughts on his fellow Argentine's process.

Speaking to The Athletic last week from his home in Rosario, Argentina, as part of a larger interview, Martino commented on the turmoil that has surrounded the U.S. squad since Pochettino's appointment one year ago. That includes Christian Pulisic's decision to skip the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino's lack of communication with his players and his push to call up players from MLS over alternatives based in Europe.

Martino and Pochettino were teammates with Newell's Old Boys in the late 1980s and remain friends today. On Pulisic, Martino understood Pochettino's frustration at not having the country's best player for a continental tournament one year away from a World Cup.

“I imagine Mauricio, being Argentine, has a mindset shaped by our culture with national teams — when the call comes, you go,” Martino said. “And maybe you also have to understand the culture of the country you're working in, see how the competitions are structured, and figure out if some adjustments in thinking are needed.”

“I'm speculating from a distance without full knowledge,” Martino added, “but sometimes it's a pretty tough situation, because generally we don't understand why, unless there's a justified reason, a player wouldn't come to make himself available for the national team.”

Martino sympathized with today's top players needing more rest, and opined that the Gold Cup and Concacaf Nations League don't always inspire Europe-based players to travel.

“They're constantly competing against the same opponents, and there aren't that many anyway,” Martino said. But in the end, he added, football is about one thing only.

“Coaches are judged by results, not by whether they gave players rest,” he said. “Rest makes sense, but when the team loses, no one considers the players who weren't there.”

Before Pochettino accepted the U.S. job, his first role as an international manager, the 53-year-old former Tottenham boss consulted Martino about coaching in North America. Martino coached U.S. rival Mexico from 2019-2022, and he also led Atlanta United and Inter Miami as an MLS head coach, winning an MLS Cup, Leagues Cup and Supporters' Shield.

At the time, Martino believed that Pochettino's Argentine background would be an asset. Managers from Argentina have become popular hires in this hemisphere, with Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Ecuador and Colombia all having qualified for the 2026 World Cup with a head coach from Argentina.

Yet, Martino's message to Pochettino was that he would have to learn to become a national team manager. Pochettino has been at odds with the press in the U.S. on the topic of American soccer culture. He has pushed back any time it has been suggested that he may be out of touch with the idiosyncratic-nature of the sport in the U.S.

When Pochettino revealed publicly that he rarely communicates with the U.S. squad, including with Pulisic, it set off alarm bells. Martino wasn't too put off by that, though.

“Everyone can feel different about whether they need to do it or not,” Martino said regarding communication with his international players. “I did it less with the Argentina national team.”

Before the 2022 World Cup, Martino traveled to Europe to meet with some of Mexico's players who were abroad. Yet, he was often criticized in Mexico for his perceived lack of interest in Liga MX matches. Martino kept a core of players together and did little tinkering with the Mexico squad before they traveled to Qatar.

Pochettino, now nine months away from the next World Cup, is still experimenting with a combination of MLS and Europe-based players who have not fully impressed. Asked if Pochettino should have his squad determined at this stage, Martino answered, “Yes, that normally happens.”

His insistence on calling up a bevy of MLS players, though, has led to a contentious debate about the quality of the league and the American player – and about Pochettino's strengths as a talent evaluator.

“For me, this has a very simple answer,” Martino said. “If (MLS) is is important for the Argentina national team — if Messi and (Rodrigo) De Paul are important for Argentina, if (Miguel) Almirón is important for Paraguay, if Diego Rossi is important for Uruguay — then why wouldn't an American player who plays in the same league be important for his own national team?

“Obviously, if I were the coach of the U.S. national team, I would also be very happy to have as many players in Europe as possible. It's much better if you have players in Milan, the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga. From my point of view, that's ideal. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider the players who play in MLS, because every other national team takes them into account.”

WASHINGTON — The FIFA World Cup is coming to North America next year and fans will soon get their chance at purchasing tickets to some of the games.

Starting Wednesday, Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. Eastern, fans will be able to enter a drawing for a chance to purchase tickets to World Cup matches. Once registration ends on Friday, Sept. 19, there will be a randomized selection process to select fans who will be able to purchase their tickets.

But there's a catch. This presale drawing is only available for Visa cardholders. According to FIFA's website, to be eligible for the presale, you need to have an unexpired Visa debit, credit or prepaid card enabled with 3D Secure. 

You can check if your Visa card qualifies and create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets. 

Once you do, you'll be able to log in using that ID and enter the drawing. Starting Monday, Sept. 29, successful applicants will be notified by email that they've been selected, and will be given a time to purchase the tickets. According to FIFA, those times start on Wednesday, Oct. 1. 

While tickets for all 104 matches will be put on sale, receiving a timeslot does not guarantee tickets will be available.

A second phase, called an early ticket draw, likely will run from Oct. 27-31, with purchase timeslots from mid-November to early December.

A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. FIFA said tickets will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.”

FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform.

Sales will be capped at four tickets per person per match, with no person being able to purchase more than 40 for the totality of the tournament.

Ticket prices for next year's World Cup will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final, but could change as soccer's top event adopts dynamic pricing for the first time.

The prices are up from a range of $25 to $475 for the 1994 tournament in the United States and for the U.S. dollar equivalent $69 to $1,607 when ticket details were announced for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

Former Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou reportedly dined with Evangelos Marinakis before clinching the Nottingham Forest job. The Australian was unveiled as the club's new head coach, following the swift dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. The deal may have been wrapped up in a hurry this week, but the seeds were planted months ago.

Martin Keown has fired back at "deranged" Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel for claiming that Arsenal play "ugly" football under Mikel Arteta. Schmeichel was critical of Arsenal's style of play in their 1-0 loss to Premier League champions Liverpool before the international break, homing in on their "annoying" focus on set-pieces.

Inter Milan star Petar Sucic refuses to get distracted by next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.

Speaking to Sportklub.n1info.hr via FCInterNews, the young midfielder gave priority to his club duties.

Petar Sucic spent 70 minutes on the pitch last night as Croatia thumped Montenegro 4-0 at Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium.

In doing so, Zlatko Dalic's side maintained their 100% win ratio in the ongoing World Cup qualifying campaign.

Furthermore, they've taken another significant step toward reaching the final tournament for the fourth time on the trot.

Despite sitting level on points with the Czech Republic in Group L, the Croats have a game in hand.

Therefore, they are in pole position to qualify for next summer's competition in North America.

However, the 21-year-old insists he will deal with World Cup matters when the time comes.

For the moment, he remains focused on his commitments in Serie A and the Champions League.

CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA – JUNE 30: Petar Sucic #8 of FC Internazionale Milano passes the ball during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 round of 16 match between FC Internazionale Milano and Fluminense FC at Bank of America Stadium on June 30, 2025 in Charlotte, North Carolina.

“It was a great victory,” Sucic said after last night's rout of Montenegro.

“We dominated and secured six points from these two matches, which was our goal, and we didn't concede any goals.

“So we can be satisfied.”

Asked whether he ever thinks about performing at the World Cup, Sucic replied: “Well, no, honestly, I have a lot of commitments with the club [Inter] and the national team right now.

“The goal is to make sure we can play in the World Cup. Once we qualify, we'll think about it.”

Then, Sucic praised AC Milan newcomer Luka Modric.

“I'm happy to play every single minute with him. No matter how good you are, with Modric, you become twice as strong.

“I really enjoy it, and I hope he plays for a long time so I can have fun on the pitch with him.”

Finally, he explained how it felt to return to Maksimir.

“I'm thrilled. It was a pleasure to come back, and I can't wait to return.”

World Cup

To many soccer fans, the dependable American goalkeeper was once as much of a national staple as fast food drive-thrus and podcast feuds. From 1995 to 2016, at least one Premier League club entrusted its last line of defense to a United States import. These men were beloved for being as committed to keeping clean sheets as maintaining their shaved heads.

Yet with the 2026 World Cup next in the queue, the USMNT is under intense pressure to find a starter – and is hard-pressed to feature a backstop such as Tony Meola, Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. Players who gave solidity to the USMNT at World Cup campaigns and were safe custodians at the club level.

“What we've had is a sort of changing of guard a little bit,” said Jack Robinson, U.S. Soccer's head of goalkeeping. Robinson, whose CV also includes time with Manchester United and the FA, assumed the role in August 2024 fresh off of six seasons at Liverpool under Jürgen Klopp.

“With Mauricio (Pochettino) coming in and his staff, there's a real onus from them to say that whoever is playing, whoever's in form, whoever's performing well for their team, will have an opportunity to come and play for us. I think that it's up for anybody to come and try and take that No. 1 shirt.”

It can't be comforting, though, that just over nine months from the World Cup kicking off in North America, Pochettino is still testing new options with a dwindling number of warm-up games left before the opening match. And it all leads to one simple question with a multilayered answer:

What happened to the once-mighty American goalkeeper?

“I think we were spoiled for a very long time,” Howard told The Athletic. “It's an interesting question, one that I get asked way more than I'd like, because you'd like to see more American goalkeepers have success abroad.”

The U.S.'s grand return to the World Cup in 1990 provided a breakout moment for a few players; even more would get the star treatment once the tournament came stateside in '94. Among the most popular faces was Meola, who played 11 games with Brighton after Italy 1990 but whose legacy was crystalized in MLS and across 100 USMNT caps.

By keeping the USMNT competitive in 1990 and helping send the hosts to the knockout stage in 1994, Meola set a standard that helped clue the world to a bevy of his successors.

Coming up as an Aston Villa fan, Aron Hyde — who was a goalkeeping coach on Gregg Berhalter's U.S. staff from 2020-2023 — came to admire the exploits of “the Brads,” as he calls them in a conversation with The Athletic. The summer of 2008 brought both to Villa: Friedel, the veteran who had already logged over a decade of starts with Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers; and his understudy, Brad Guzan, brought over from since-defunct MLS franchise Chivas USA.

To Hyde, it wasn't a source of anxiety to trust an American in goal. It was sensible.

“It's the stereotypical, quintessential things that American sports and upbringings give: hand-eye coordination, just the natural athleticism that is prevalent within Americans is well-suited,” Hyde said. “And then just their demeanor, presence, personalities: confident and able to deal with the pressures that come in the Premier League.”

The pair combined to make 256 league starts for the Villans. Their tenure was far from an anomaly.

Juergen Sommer came first, joining Queens Park Rangers in 1995. Keller made his Premier League debut in 1996-97 after four years with second-division Millwall, making 201 starts for four clubs. Howard arrived in 2003 and made 431 Premier League appearances, making the PFA Team of the Year in 2003-04 with Manchester United before becoming an icon across a decade at Everton. A model third-stringer for the USMNT, Marcus Hahnemann was first-choice with Reading and Wolves across his 12 years in England.

The trend reached an abrupt end when Howard returned to MLS in the summer of 2016, while Guzan followed him across the Atlantic a year later. The USMNT saw its one-time bounty of Premier League starting goalkeepers deplete entirely.

When Zack Steffen and Matt Turner were signed by Manchester City and Arsenal, respectively, they were viewed as dependable backups who could start cup games and give the preferred option a good sparring partner. Fans of their clubs need little reminding that Steffen and Turner struggled with on-ball decision-making; both are now back in MLS.

The 2025-26 season kicked off with two Americans on Premier League goalkeeping depth charts, although both appear to be third-choice. One, Gabriel Slonina of Chelsea, returned after two seasons on loan at Eupen and Barnsley. The other, England-born Brandon Austin of Tottenham, held his own in a one-off start. As the only homegrown player on Thomas Frank's squad, he doubles as a crucial piece in Champions League squad registration.

One commonly cited reason for the sudden falloff of American goalkeepers is the modern era's redefining of the role.

For decades, a goalkeeper was viewed as a specialist tasked with stopping shots and thumping the ball down route one. That all changed in 2016, the very same summer that saw Howard leave Everton. When Pep Guardiola controversially benched captain Joe Hart (a traditional keeper) for Claudio Bravo and then Ederson a year later, it changed perceptions of how the position should be played at the highest level.

An amendment to the IFAB's Laws of the Game has expedited this trend. Since the 2019-20 season, goal kicks no longer need to leave the box before a teammate can receive it.

The adjustment enabled using short passes to start possession sequences. In 2016-17, according to Opta, Premier League keepers launched 76% of all goal kicks into the opponent's half. In 2024-25, that rate had halved to just 38%. Suddenly, ball control and passing ability became key criteria for a goalkeeper.

“In terms of the build-up, at Liverpool, we worked really hard on trying to, as a team, beat the press of the opposition,” Robinson said. “With that is recognizing the state of the game, and recognizing that if their team is high pressing, there's going to be space somewhere else. That might be behind the last line, that might be into the 10 position. It might be wide. You just have to recognize it.”

Hyde pushes back against the popular notion that American goalkeepers can't do deft work with their feet. It's just that they were seldom asked to do these tasks until roughly a decade ago.

“I think it's too simplistic, I do,” Hyde said. “I would argue that at the time, Tim, Brad — both of them, even when Friedel was playing at Tottenham — they were still effective at what they were asked to do. You think about the initial sort of evolution (of the role), when you had to put the ball out to the fullback – they all were very proficient at doing that.”

The 21st century has also seen a rapid evolution of how clubs analyze transfer targets. In the past, many clubs leaned into observed archetypes if a nation was prolific at producing similar types of high-level players. The American goalkeeper was a shortcut akin to, say, targeting a Brazilian playmaker or an Italian defender.

The success of one or two players could open doors for the next handful of compatriots. These days, the financial ramifications of the sport's highest level and the increased access to extensive data means clubs leave far less to taking a chance on stereotypes.

“There's definitely an increase in the quality of scouting that's going on out there,” Robinson said. “I think there's a broader range of goalkeepers that have been brought up from all over the world. Essentially, I think clubs are getting smarter and smarter about how they (recruit).”

These evolutions aren't cause for defeatism. It requires a modified approach to development – one that starts far from the spotlight. Hyde credited U.S. Soccer for hiring Robinson fresh from his time at Liverpool, bringing a modern Premier League-winning goalkeeper expert into the fold. As the head of goalkeeping, Robinson says he aims to “leave the Federation in a better place than when I found it.”

Robinson and his team are creating a goalkeeping ‘B' coaching license and will subsequently launch a goalkeeping ‘A' license. Another of Robinson's aims is to create accessible instructions for all coaches, whether they're a national team assistant or “the mums and dads who are coaching the kids on a weekend.” Given the country's size and how sparsely the geography can be covered with pro academies, local youth clubs are a vital part of this all.

“We will make sure that the whole ecosystem gets an opportunity to have education on the goalkeeping side,” Robinson said, citing the importance of the grassroots programs. “That's where the passion and the love for the role comes. We want to get young boys or girls to be passionate about goalkeeping, and that starts at your local club.”

When working at the FA, Robinson joked he could visit any club rostering a promising prospect with a two-hour drive from headquarters. A similar approach to scout the best talent in the U.S. would deplete the federation's mileage budget.

U.S. Soccer is already trying to improve its outreach to all parts of the nation. Having split the U.S. into six geographic regions for youth talent ID camps, Robinson is working to launch goalkeeping-specific sessions as part of those three-times-a-year sessions. This would allow a greater number of young players to convene, also allowing interested youth goalkeeping coaches to come in and touch base with the players and federation alike.

Robinson won't push a one-model-fits-all approach. Instead, adaptability and a bedrock of positional awareness is central to the positional profile for the next wave of American goalkeepers.

“What I would like to see as we're developing our goalkeepers, from the younger ages through to the senior level, is that we have goalkeepers who can play in any team, any system, any formation, so that they have the ability to play if the opportunity is there,” Robinson said.

“I think the biggest things I want to see in the goalkeeper that we're trying to develop in the youth side and going to the senior team is that they show emotional control, they're adaptable, and able to play under pressure in different types of games against different styles and they're impacting the game. I think those are the three things that are important for me as we go forward.”

Refining how goalkeepers are coached is something Howard sees as mandatory.

“There's one train of thought that there was just something in the water in that generation and that we thrived – but the bigger part of it is goalkeeping coaching,” Howard said. “We still produce the athletes – we see it all the time – we produce the goalkeepers. But goalkeeper coaching on the whole in this country has gone downhill and I think goalkeepers are suffering the price for that.”

Developing the positional awareness that Robinson is seeking requires one element that has been in short supply beyond the domestic leagues for Americans: game action.

“You can't replicate the process for a goalkeeper of going through a game,” Hyde said, “in terms of: the prep before, going through the game, the warm-up, doing the game, and then the recovery and getting into the routine and the rhythm of reviewing and then working again, building up. It's really, really important to be able to have the rhythm within all that.”

But only one goalkeeper starts per team, and prospects can't enjoy the same gradual incorporation into a team that outfield players are afforded.

“The leash on a goalkeeper is always shorter,” Hyde said. “With an outfield player, you give him 20 minutes here and 10 minutes here. You've got a cup game, he's playing for 90 minutes. Then we'll train him for a little bit, and give him 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 20 minutes. Before you know it, he's racked up a ton of minutes within a season, and then the next year, he's starting games.

“You don't throw a goalkeeper in for 20 minutes. You have to prime them to deal with the ups and downs and be consistent in doing the things that are expected of them. Because then, they're strong enough then to deal with the downside of when they don't perform well. They're able to bounce back.”

The same predicament has played out for the USMNT since Pochettino took over last September. Ten goalkeepers have been named to his squads over the past 12 months. From the outside, it resembles a reality competition where a winner won't be named until the last minute.

Nonetheless, Robinson backs the approach and is confident it'll lead to the right option next summer.

“Now it's down to them,” Robinson said. “They have to perform for their clubs. They have to be fit and in rhythm when it comes to the selection, because anything can happen in these nine months. We wanted to make sure that we saw as many of the goalkeepers we could. We understood them; we know what they're like character wise. We're monitoring them every single week, we're watching all the games that are playing.”

Unlike the predecessors who fostered the U.S.'s goalkeeping reputation and plied their club trade abroad, the competition to start in goal at the 2026 World Cup is almost exclusively playing out in MLS stadiums. Turner is back from his European sojourn, starting again for the New England Revolution. Steffen has rediscovered his previous consistency since joining the Colorado Rapids last year. Matt Freese, whose penalty-stopping prowess made him a Gold Cup hero, starts for New York City FC.

Patrick Schulte started at the 2024 Olympics and is in his third season starting for a Columbus Crew side that fosters the highest rate of possession in MLS. Roman Celentano offers a more traditional shot-stopper for FC Cincinnati, while Chris Brady is already a surefire starter with the Chicago Fire at age 21.

“It's an exciting time, really,” Hyde said. “These guys all want to compete, and this is where it's at. They've got to get out there every week and get it done, then give Poch and (goalkeeper coach) Toni Jiménez a headache about who they're going to pick. That's what you want as a coach, rather than the necessity of ‘I have to play this guy.'”

Rather than repeat this contest every four years, the efforts to improve education and crystalize a positional profile are being done to dependably have options. Not just prospects, as Robinson is quick to emphasize, but viable alternatives to an incumbent starter to keep them fresh.

It's hard work, readying someone to excel in the sport's loneliest position. Still, it's something that the U.S. once did as well, if not better, than every other nation. For a program aspiring to compete at World Cups, shoring up the last line of defense is mandatory.

That begins at an early age, in parks and backyards across the country.

“We want to try and make sure that if somebody does have a passion when they've put the gloves on for the first time, that we continue that passion,” Robinson said. “That comes through the way that you coach them and the relationships you build with them. It also comes from having role models. Hopefully in the summer, on the men's side, there can be a role model for young goalkeepers, like we had with Brad Friedel and Tim Howard and Kasey Keller.

“But hopefully, it's not just one. Hopefully, it's a good production line of goalkeepers coming through who enjoy the position and take that challenge on board to be the best that they can be.”

Kasey Keller questions Mauricio Pochettino's 'plan' for the USMNT as they are defeated 2-0 by South Korea. (1:35)

What a difference a year makes, huh?

Well, it's not like U.S. men's national team fans were happy for all of 2024. Remember, Timothy Weah punched a guy, and then the U.S. got knocked out of the group stages of the Copa America. But then U.S. Soccer decided to move on from head coach Gregg Berhalter, and fans were pleased. And then U.S. Soccer decided to hire Mauricio Pochettino, and fans were ecstatic.

Fast-forward to today and yeah ... I don't know. Pochettino continues to baffle all of us with roster decisions, and there are, like, three or four or maybe five players who I would confidently say will make next summer's World Cup roster.

Beyond Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tyler Adams, and Antonee Robinson, everything is in flux. And if it's not in flux -- and Pochettino is just experimenting with new players while maintaining a settled roster in his mind -- then we still haven't seen that settled roster, and we certainly haven't seen it play well.

So, instead of trying to read through Pochettino's confusing messaging and even more confusing roster decisions, let's just take a look at the entire player pool. And to do that, we're bringing back the USMNT Player Performance Index for the 2025-26 season, where we rank every American based on their club performance, and then cut the list down to the top 50.

Each edition of this ranking consists of three inputs: (1) Playing time, (2) team quality and (3) wisdom of crowdsourced salary data. However, we'll lean on different parts of that input at different stages of the season. The main purpose of our USMNT PPI is to look at which players are playing a lot, which players are playing for good teams, and then combine those two aspects.

This methodology provides a simple, hierarchical snapshot of the USMNT player pool: the best players tend to play for the best teams, and the best players tend to play a lot of soccer. Unfortunately, we're only two or three games into the European soccer season, so we're both still learning the quality of each team and working with an incredibly limited sample of minutes. A player's playing time through the first three matches of the season isn't irrelevant, but it also doesn't tell us much.

So, for this early-season edition of the rankings, team quality -- as represented by the team's rating in Opta's power rankings -- accounts only for 15% of the input, while playing time (percentage of your team's available minutes) gets just 5%. Instead, most of these PPI ratings are made up of Transfermarkt's crowdsourced player valuations.

Player valuations are not one-to-one proxies for player quality -- older players get pinged here, as do players with one year left on their deals -- but doing ratings after just three games is pretty much all projection, and these valuations are a version of that.

So, who didn't make it this time around? From the current USMNT roster, goalkeepers Jonathan Klinsmann and Matt Freese; defenders Tim Ream, Max Arfsten, Sean Zawadzki, Alex Freeman and Nathan Harriel; and midfielders Luca de la Torre and Sebastian Berhalter all fell outside of the top 50.

The main reason? None of them has a projected transfer value north of €2.5 million. We know that Pochettino's view of the USMNT player pool differs greatly from conventional wisdom, and this is evidence of that.

Beyond these names, Patrick Agyemang and Brandon Vázquez, two potential center forward options, have both been left off due to injuries. Matt Turner, too, only just switched teams and started playing soccer again, so he's also not in the top 50.

With that, let's get to the first edition of the USMNT Player Performance Index of the 2025-26 season. Onto the rankings!

- Carlisle: Pochettino's latest USMNT roster a head-scratcher

He has played only about half of the available minutes under new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri, but we're talking about only two games. And he scored in the one match where he came off the bench. With the previously indestructible Robinson recovering from an injury for a middling Fulham team, there's really no competition for the No. 1 spot at this early stage of the season.

While his injury and Fulham's struggles this season will affect his PPI ranking, they actually improve my perception of his value as a player. Robinson was arguably the best left back in the Premier League last season -- he finally paired his unmatched defensive activity with high-level attacking production, and that was all backed up by elite athleticism and constant availability. But after offseason surgery, Robinson has played only 50 minutes or so this season. Fulham, meanwhile, are in 18th place.

Those last two sentences are not unrelated.

Leverkusen seemed like the right place for Tillman -- a kind of career-challenge move to a stylistically similar league to the Eredivisie, but to a team that expects to be in the Champions League. Was he good enough to start for a top-20 team in the world? We'd all get to find out.

He scored in his first start before the international break, but then Leverkusen fired manager Erik ten Hag after only two league matches. (Turns out the stability of the Xabi Alonso era was an outlier at Leverkusen.) For most of the past decade, the club has underachieved their financial resources at a Manchester United-esque rate.

While most stats are misleading at best at this point in the season, Cardoso's performance on the ball for Atletico so far this season does a nice job of summing up the kind of player he currently is.

Cardoso has played the ninth-most minutes for manager Diego Simeone thus far, and he's created the 12th-most expected possession value, which represents how much a player increased or decreased his team's chances of scoring a goal. But he also hasn't lost any value in any individual area, whether it's through passing, defending, crossing or dribbling.

In other words, he's something like an average LaLiga midfielder who isn't going to do anything that hurts you -- even if his USMNT appearances suggest otherwise.

While things do look quite uncertain at Juventus right now -- he has played three minutes across the first two Serie A matches -- we have this conversation every year: The new coach doesn't fancy McKennie at the start, but eventually, the new coach realizes that he can't afford to leave McKennie on the bench.

My theory is that he looks terrible in training, where coaches are more focused on technical precision and on-ball impact. In games, though, his fantastic off-ball movement eventually shines through.

McKennie has been at Juventus since 2020, and the club has finished outside of Italy's top four just once over that stretch. McKennie has played at least 1,300 Serie A minutes for the club in every season except 2022-23, the year they finished seventh.

Musah played 90 minutes for AC Milan in their second match of the season ... and then he was loaned out to Atalanta just two days later. Soccer clubs are not rational entities. Hopefully Musah gets a little more freedom, and a little more patience, with his new club.

Playing midfield for Bournemouth involves two things: (1) watching your teammates boot the ball over your head, and (2) cleaning up whatever chaos might ensue. While Adams is almost irrelevant on the ball for Andoni Iraola, I do think his loose-ball skills make it a little easier for Bournemouth to embrace the chaos that has made them such a hard out over the past two seasons.

After all, they lost their two starting center backs (Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi) to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, their starting left back (Milos Kerkez) is now starting at Liverpool, and they've still managed to win two of their first three Premier League matches this season. Adams is one of the lone defensive leftovers from a team that almost qualified for the Champions League last year.

The emergence of Mika Biereth last season seemed like it might marginalize Balogun this season, but manager Adi Hütter seems comfortable starting them together. Balogun has played almost every minute of Monaco's last two matches; he's attempted five shots and scored one goal. More of that from here on out, and he should be starting next summer.

Through four matches, Dest has completed more progressive passes and progressive carries than any other PSV player. No one else in the player pool is capable of doing that -- especially not for a team as good as PSV.

Sure, he has some weaknesses on the defensive end. But in possession, the U.S. has never had a player like Dest.

This loan seemed like it might accomplish two things that could overcome the completely toxic environment that it looks like Roberto De Zerbi is building in France: (1) get Weah starter's minutes, and (2) get Weah serious playing time on the wing.

The first part has been true: He has played two-thirds of the available minutes since moving to France. As for the second part, here's a heat map of his touches:

Is this what you want from your starting left winger, less than a year from the World Cup?

He's a victim of the early-season ratings leaning so much on market values. And among Crystal Palace's three center backs, the consensus seems to be that Richards is the third-most important after Marc Guéhi and Maxence Lacroix.

But he has played every minute of every match so far, and Opta's ratings currently have Palace as the ninth-best team in the world. Keep that up, and he'll rocket up the rankings as the season goes on.

We, unfortunately, won't get to see CCV in the Champions League this year. Celtic were eliminated on penalties in the qualifying round by Kazakhstan's champions, FC Kairat Almaty. Will we see him on another USMNT roster before next summer?

His minutes-share has ticked up every year during his four-plus seasons in the Bundesliga. Two seasons ago: 73.1%. Last season: 84.2%. So far this season: 96.7%.

America are one of the best teams in Liga MX, and Zendejas might be their best attacker. Through seven matches, he's leading the team in minutes, progressive carries, progressive passes received, expected goals and expected assists.

It's funny how these things work. Luna has become a fan- and manager-favorite with the USMNT this summer, but he has regressed in MLS this season. Nearly 100 other players (96) in MLS have created more expected possession value than Luna has in 2025.

He's played every minute of every Ligue 1 match, and Lyon are tied with PSG on both points and goal differential through games. He has to get called back into a USMNT camp at some point ... right?

Paredes and Wiley have combined for zero minutes so far this season. Unless they start to actually play, they'll both fall off this list by the next time we do it.

The PPI darling is back! Why do these rankings love Pukstas so much? He only just turned 21 and he's already played nearly 6,000 professional minutes for a team that has finished no lower than third in the Croatian league since 2020-21. Through five matches this season, he has a team-leading three goals.

Here are the top 10 Americans in MLS for expected possession value added from open play:

Some thoughts on that chart: Sullivan is breaking out. The Rapids got rid of Djordje Mihailovic during this season? Shaq Moore! And yes, Paul Rothrock is better than Messi.

There are too many inconsistencies with Mauricio Pochettino's management of the USMNT roster to count, but let's toss another one onto the pile. As the manager has preached about the value of MLS and players who would die for the shirt, he had consistently not called up Roldan, a veteran workhorse who has easily been the best American midfielder in MLS this season.

Some of that may have been due to Seattle's presence in the Club World Cup this past summer, but Roldan only even made the current roster as a last-second addition.

Gab & Juls discuss the perception around Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT.

Can the 18-year-old build on last season's 278 Bundesliga minutes? He's played one minute so far this season.

After wrecking his ankle last February, Sands has played all but four minutes for St. Pauli this season, and he leads the team in combined tackles and interceptions. There's probably too much depth in this position for him to crack the World Cup roster, but you'd think consistent minutes in the Bundesliga might be enough for him to get one last look.

It seemed like Schulte might eventually push Matt Turner for the starting goalkeeper spot with the USMNT, but then he got hurt before the Gold Cup, Freese became the starter, and Schulte wasn't even called up for the two most recent friendlies.

Mauricio Pochettino? I continue to not really understand what he's doing!

Here it is: Proof that U.S. Soccer occasionally, randomly, and arbitrarily, uses the PPI to figure out who they should call up as part of the next roster.

2026 World Cup takes place from June 11 to July 19 across three host nations; 48 teams will compete in expanded tournament; Brazil and Argentina have qualified; Thomas Tuchel leading England in UEFA qualification; main World Cup draw takes place on December 5 with President Trump involved

Tuesday 9 September 2025 10:45, UK

World Cup 2026 qualifying is underway and several teams - including holders Argentina - have already booked their place at the expanded tournament.

The 2026 World Cup takes place across three host nations - USA, Canada and Mexico - from June 11 to July 19. It will be the biggest yet, with 48 nations taking part - 16 more than in Qatar 2022.

The three host nations qualify automatically, while nations from the confederations of UEFA (Europe), CONMEBOL (South America), CONCACAF (North/Central America and Caribbean), AFC (Asia), OFC (Oceania) and CAF (Africa) stage their own qualifying campaigns.

UEFA is guaranteed 16 slots at the tournament. Twelve group winners will progress directly from the qualifying stage, with Thomas Tuchel's England aiming to top Group K. Sixteen teams - 12 group runners-up and four further teams based on their Nations League ranking - will enter four play-off paths, with each providing a further spot at the finals.

Outside of Europe, CAF gets nine spots at the World Cup and AFC has eight. There will be a minimum of six each from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, while OFC has one guaranteed slot for the first time.

Two final slots will be filled through an inter-confederation play-off. A tournament involving six teams will take place in March 2026: one team per confederation apart from UEFA, plus one additional team from the confederation of the host countries.

Keep track below of who has reached the showpiece tournament.

Frank Leboeuf reacts to an impressive Spain performance as they demolish Türkiye 6-0 in World Cup qualifying. (1:47)

While the majority of the world's great national teams were doubting, pouting or 'what-abouting?' over the last few days of the September international break, Spain got on with routing Turkey in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Sunday. It was a recital of football which underlined that, on their day, the European champions remain the most exciting, devastating and irresistible team in the world.

If you didn't see their 6-0 thrashing of Vincenzo Montella's team which featured Real Madrid's Arda Güler, Inter Milan's Hakan Çalhanoglu and Fenerbahce's Kerem Aktürkoglu then, please believe me, it was not just a big score against a team which hasn't shipped six at home for 41 years -- it was sublime, choral football.

Turkey goalkeeper Ugurcan Çakır was by far their best player (let that one sink in). Spain started without six of the XI which won the European Championship last summer, and yet La Roja's second goal came from 75 seconds of possession, 25 passes, 66 touches on the ball with every single one of Luis De La Fuente's team having been involved in the move at least once.

- Why left-footed right wingers like Yamal are so hot right now
- With nine months until World Cup, does Poch know best U.S. XI?
- Which teams can book their place at the 2026 World Cup this week?

Meanwhile, Germany fell to Slovakia (No. 52 in the FIFA World Ranking) -- Die Mannschaft's first-ever away defeat in the history of their World Cup qualifying campaigns (56 matches) -- and England bored their fans into snores while edging narrowly 2-0 past 174th-ranked Andorra (population 82,000).

Netherlands snuck a 3-2 win against 143th-ranked Lithuania in Kaunus, having stumbled 1-1 against Poland at home a couple of days earlier, while 2018 World Cup and 2023 Nations League finalists Croatia, still boasting Luka Modric, squeaked home 1-0 against 142th-ranked Faroe Islands (population 54,000).

Italy -- having had to sack their coach, Luciano Spalletti, following a 3-0 humbling against Norway -- beat minnows Estonia 5-0, the same scoreline by which Portugal won in Armenia with a 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo still leading the line (and scoring goals).

But what of the South American behemoths? World champions Argentina won 3-0 against a weak Venezuela, but there was a bust-up in the tunnel after half-time and, postmatch, Lionel Messi stunned the world by announcing that "the most logical thing is that I won't make it" to next year's World Cup. We shall see.

Brazil also won 3-0 against bottom-of-the-group Chile, but they've needed to appoint a foreign coaching staff -- Carlo Ancelotti and Paul Clement -- for the first time in their proud history to do so. Plus, there's a running spat with Neymar, who's miffed at having been excluded from Ancelotti's first squad.

Asian powerhouse Japan are going great guns, becoming the first country to qualify for next year's World Cup in March. They claimed a creditable 0-0 draw in Mexico on Saturday and face United States on Tuesday,

So, there's your worldwide context and a lens through which to view Spain's performance. Now, back to La Roja.

The summary is that they could easily have won 10-0, they danced across a cow-patch of a pitch in Konya, played with brutal intensity, never took their foot off the accelerator (nor the throat of Montella's team) and Pedri played Ballon d'Or vote-winning football with Lamine Yamal not far behind (sadly, voting closed a week ago.) Once you watch the highlights, by all means take your pick of the favourite -- but the 2-0 goal was pretty special. Maybe even all-time special.

By the time the move reaches Nico Williams just outside the penalty spot it has been uninterrupted Spain possession for well over a minute, 10 of La Roja's players have participated and the Athletic Club winger is in a position to have a shot, but he thinks Mikel Oyarzabal (who thus becomes the 11th man in the move) is in a better position. 'Big Foot' Oyarzabal thinks that Merino's in an even better position, and once the ball's zipped through three pinball penalty-box passes in three seconds the Arsenal man slots home with his left foot.

Merino is now on a run of six goals, plus two converted shootout penalties, in just six Spain appearances. In the absence of a true No. 9 (though converted winger Oyarzabal has a goal and three assists in the last two matches), he is La Roja's increasingly well-known 'secret' weapon.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

Possibly most interesting are Pedri and Lamine Yamal. In just under a fortnight, Yamal will become the youngest footballer ever to earn a podium place (whether he's first, second or third) in the history of the Ballon d'Or. But the brutal truth is that, with the exception of 30 startling minutes against Mallorca, the 18-year-old has been far from his best or most effective for Barcelona this season.

Going on Spain duty has jolted him back to life. On day one he was teased, mercilessly, by Oyarzabal during training in the playful accusation that he'd dived the previous night when winning and converting a penalty at Rayo Vallecano. That's not something he's going to experience when working with Hansi Flick's squad.

Then reigning Ballon d'Or holder Rodri admitted: "I didn't want the cameras to catch me doing it but, yes, I told Lamine 'Keep working and you can achieve whatever you want' and I also told him 'make sure you put yourself at the service of the team, and of football worldwide.'

"We've all seen footballers of huge talent who then go on to 'lose' themselves. Lamine really sees things clearly and he's got people around him who support him with good advice. What I see is a happy kid, smiling and if he develops this massive talent he's got it'll be to the benefit of Spain."

The "ESPN FC" crew react to Portugal's UEFA Nations League victory vs. Spain 5-3 on penalties.

Under a different spotlight, surrounded by guys who don't rely on him the way his Barça teammates do, mixing with hard-nosed serial winners, the catalytic effect on this genius teenager has been notable. Three assists, probably the game-changing performance in Thursday's 3-0 win in Bulgaria, and electrically good against Turkey with several defensive tackles in the mix. Not to mention him and Arda sparking a little 'who you looking at?' push-and-shove scuffle which bodes well for the 'Morbo' in the build-up to the next Clásico (Oct. 26, stream LIVE on ESPN+.)

Then there's Pedri. There seemed to be three of him on the pitch in Turkey. Intercepting, tackling, blocking, running elegantly into space, creating chances, scoring and, late in the game when everyone else was running on empty, making lung-busting overlapping runs.

UEFA's social media accounts posted: "Pedri makes excellence look so easy!" De La Fuente added, postmatch: "Pedri's the best in the world in his position." And that's right.

What to do once Rodri -- back again in these last two matches after long-term injury -- Fabián Ruiz, Merino, Gavi, Dani Olmo plus Pedri are all fit and in top form at the same time? One thing's for sure, Pedri will start. Probably with Rodri and Fabian. He's that good, that important.

And now with three goals in his last four Spain matches, and only 22, and racking up appearances for club and country without a hitch, the outstanding assignments, scoring big goals and staying fit, are arriving long before he hits the peak of his career.

Spain are now two matches (home to Georgia and Bulgaria) away from equalling their all-time run of 29 competitive matches unbeaten (in normal or extra time).

Set aside Williams' adductor injury (Athletic will be praying for a lad they so badly need for when the UEFA Champions League campaign begins) and this has been an outright stellar few days for Spain. They play the most delightful football in the world, and are best-placed to make their part in the World Cup an attractive prospect next summer.

Alex Morgan says never in her "wildest dreams" would she see San Diego Wave retire her. No. 13 jersey. (1:28)

U.S. women's national team forward Alyssa Thompson is officially a Chelsea player after completing a transfer from Angel City FC in the final hours before England's transfer deadline on Thursday.

Thompson's move from her hometown National Women's Soccer League team to the six-time defending English champions was one of the most expensive transfers in women's soccer to date. The ramifications of it, however, stretch far beyond the financial.

Is it a good move for Thompson's career? What will she bring to Chelsea? How bad is the situation for Angel City after losing Thompson? And is this really an problem for the NWSL at large?

Let's break it all down.

Thompson told Chelsea's website that she "[knew] in my heart" that she wanted to join the club after speaking with USWNT and former Chelsea head coach Emma Hayes. It's clear that this was the move Thompson wanted, and ultimately a player needs to be in an environment where she is happy.

At Angel City, Thompson was their best player, able to stay close to come-and-suit-up alongside her younger sister. But Angel City remains stuck in the middle of the table in the NWSL and continues to struggle with consistency.

Thompson will not immediately or automatically be Chelsea's best player, and that is likely part of her "why" for leaving. At Chelsea, the 20-year-old will be challenged daily in training by some of the world's top players. She will still play regularly difficult league games, and she will also help Chelsea try to win that elusive UEFA Women's Champions League title.

All of those things will expose Thompson to new playing styles and challenges. That should be good for her, which means it's good for the USWNT, too. -- Jeff Kassouf

Chelsea's signing of Thompson is another example of the club's relentless drive to sign the next generation of elite talent. While her 22 international caps place her firmly in the here and now rather than just the future, the move is a reflection of the club's "Vision 2030" strategy: bring in the best and brightest young players across the globe.

At just 20, Thompson fits that profile to perfection. With Mayra Ramírez sidelined until 2026 by a hamstring injury, Chelsea's push to sign her was both a statement of intent and a practical necessity. She's signed for five years, with Chelsea having high hopes for her ceiling.

Chelsea already boasts a squad purpose-built for winning titles, stacked with depth and world-class quality across every position. Adding Thompson, arguably one of the highest-rated young American players, only reinforces that strength.

Yet for all their domestic dominance, the one prize that has eluded the club is the Champions League, dating back to Emma Hayes' 12-year tenure (2012-24) and Sonia Bompastor's debut season ending the same way, a crushing loss against Barcelona in the semifinals, as it did the two seasons before. Determined to clear that final hurdle, Chelsea reinforced in key positions, building a squad even more capable of competing for a quadruple across the WSL, domestic cups, and Europe's biggest stage.

Thompson's ambition matches that of the club, too. "One, to win the Champions League," she told club media, when asked about main aims for the future. "Two, I hope I develop a lot as a player, learn from the veterans on the team, and get their insight on things so that I can grow each year and become a better player. And third ... win. A lot."

But with that ambition comes Thompson's biggest challenge. It will be no easy feat to break into a side where even world-class players fight for minutes. At Angel City, she was a face of the franchise, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft, and a hometown star. At Chelsea, she enters a forward line already boasting Sam Kerr, Lauren James and Catarina Macario, all established and deeply ingrained in the Blues' system.

Emily Keogh talks about USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson's potential move to Chelsea from Angel City.

Thompson's versatility is both her strength and, potentially, her biggest hurdle to regular playing time. She can feature wide or centrally, giving Bompastor options to experiment with her role. However, Chelsea already have several players of similar age and profile -- James, Maika Hamano and Wieke Kaptein, to name just three -- who have earned trust in the system and may initially be ahead of her in the rotation. Players who move too often between positions can struggle to claim one as their own, risking the fate of becoming a utility option off the bench rather than a cornerstone starter.

Thompson's task will be to show Bompastor where she belongs in this Chelsea side, lock down that role, and then use her versatility as an added asset rather than a crutch. Oh, and she'll have to do all of that while adapting to a move abroad, a highly competitive domestic league and a challenge of the newly restructured Champions League, which will be unlike any other competition she's ever faced, even having gone to the 2023 World Cup.

If she succeeds, Thompson could become a defining piece in Chelsea's bid to finally win in Europe and add more silverware to an already glittering trophy cabinet. If not, the gamble of trading star status in Los Angeles for fierce competition in London could prove costly. -- Emily Keogh

There is no other way to look at Thompson's departure than a major step backwards for Angel City. Thompson was a No. 1 draft pick who was born and raised in Los Angeles. She was the face of the Angel City franchise, the main building block in a rebuild that was only just getting started. The dynamic forward was the best American forward in the NWSL this season.

And then, she was gone.

Chelsea's payment for Thompson fell below the previously established world record of $1.5 million. Angel City might have lost leverage in the negotiations since Thompson wanted to go to Chelsea, but the fact that the fee was not astronomical made the optics worse for the NWSL side.

Thompson had just signed a long-term contract extension in January, with everything about this departure feeling abrupt. For Angel City, that has short- and long-term implications.

In the short term, Angel City is now in the thick of the playoff race without their star player. She can't be replaced immediately (if at all) because the NWSL's inbound transfer window has closed already -- and before this deal began to pick up steam. Angel City could make an intra-league trade, but the team almost certainly won't be able to do so for someone of comparable talent.

Yes, Angel City will have transfer funds to work with in the winter. Maybe they will use the funds to bring in several new players to deepen the roster.

This transfer, however, isn't measured in dollars or pounds. The exchange rate is really the optics -- and they are bad for Angel City and, by extension, the NWSL. Former USWNT teammate Alex Morgan, now an investor in the San Diego Wave, recently told ESPN she isn't worried about so many top American stars like Thompson leaving the NWSL for Europe, but it's not ideal for the league either. -- Kassouf

World Cup

Early kick-offs, drinks breaks, closed roofs and even postponements are going to become common features of summer World Cups, according to a comprehensive new study on the impact of climate change on football.

Published on Tuesday, Pitches in Peril is the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-aligned (IPCC) risk assessment of all 16 venues at next year's World Cup in North America, as well as the likely venues for the finals of the 2030 and 2034 editions, and grassroots venues linked with 18 global legends of the game.

Thirteen of the host venues in Canada, Mexico and the United States already experience at least one day every summer that exceeds FIFA's threshold for allowing a drinks break each half — a Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WGBT) of more than 32 degrees Celsius or 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit — with temperatures in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Miami and Monterrey exceeding that mark for two months or more.

But more alarmingly, 10 of the 16 host cities also experience at least one day each summer when with a WGBT of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) when it is simply not safe to play competitive football, with Dallas and Houston hitting that mark on 33 and 51 days, respectively.

Wet-bulb temperature is measured by a thermometer with a wet cloth-wrapped bulb and it indicates the lowest temperature achievable through evaporative cooling, in other words, sweat. The WGBT gauge is a more sophisticated measure of heat stress in direct sunlight, as it is factors in air temperature, cloud cover, humidity, sun angle and wind speed.

The study, which runs to 96 pages, was commissioned by UK-based sustainability campaigners Football for Future and Common Goal, a global collective of football-related charities, and it was complied by California-based climate risk analysis firm Jupiter Intelligence.

While it is true that the stadiums in Dallas, Houston and several other 2026 host cities have roofs, which means players and supporters will be kept cool, the study points out the real impact of climate change on football will be felt at the grassroots level, particularly in the Global South.

Every one of the grassroots pitches analysed, which include the childhood pitches of stars such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Mo Salah, has already passed unplayability thresholds for multiple hazards, such as extreme heat, flooding or strong winds, and by 2050, two thirds of these pitches will regularly exceed the 35-degree WGBT limit.

As part of the study, the organisations involved also commissioned a global survey of 3,600 fans that found more than nine out of 10 believe FIFA and the World Cup should be role models for sustainability and want their clubs to take more action to address climate change.

Leading current and former players such as Spain's 2010 World Cup winner Juan Mata, Germany's Serge Gnabry and Canada captain Jessie Fleming have all added their voices to the campaign, with Mata quoted in the report as saying football “can no longer ignore the reality of the climate crisis”.

And in a video conference call with reporters to publicise the report, Toulouse and USA defender Mark McKenzie said: “(At) the World Cup, the spectacle is to see the players on the pitch, to watch the matches, to see the goals and celebrations. But if it's not safe for anybody to be there, then the point of the World Cup kind of goes out the window.”

Arsenal and Colombia youth goalkeeper Alexei Rojas was also on the call and he said: “If young children aren't able to go outside and play football when they want to, they're not going to get those touches on the ball…and just have fun – that's when a lot of the development comes as a young player.

“I'm sure that if we don't take massive action on this to try and minimise the effects of this, it will be very harmful for all levels of the game moving forward.”

Whether FIFA or any other sporting governing body can do much to tackle climate change seems very unlikely, given the fact that governments around the world seem unable to decide how much of a priority it is, let alone take coordinated action to address it.

But FIFA has so far not looked like an organisation that is taking climate change particularly seriously, as it has recently awarded World Cups to Russia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, three countries built on wealth from fossil fuels, as well as greatly expanding the size of its tournaments. And this summer's Club World Cup in the U.S. was dominated by debates about excessive heat and storms, with substitutes hiding in the locker-rooms to avoid the heat and several games reduced to exhibition-match pace because of the energy-sapping conditions.

The U.S. Women's National Team player pool had quite the productive weekend in the NWSL and European leagues, some of which have kicked off new seasons, with others about to begin in the coming weeks.

Five USWNT players — who have been capped in 2025 — scored for their club teams. That includes a brace from forward Trinity Rodman.

Let's rewind through the biggest USWNT moments over the last week:

Rodman scored two goals in the Washington Spirit's 2-0 win against the Seattle Reign FC. She notched her first goal in the 33rd minute with a valiant volley far out of reach for the Reign goalkeeper. The second in the 81st minute followed another well-placed pass — this time from USWNT midfielder Croix Bethune. Rodman buried the strike in the upper right side of the frame to seal the win.

According to Opta, since returning from a back injury in August, Rodman has attempted the most shots of any other NWSL player, 23, across all competitions. Her five goals in that span are second only to six from Ludmila, NWSL's Player of the Month for August. Rodman has three goals in NWSL play and five across all competitions.

Over the summer, Yohannes transferred to OL Lyonnes from Ajax Amsterdam, joining fellow USWNT players Lindsey Heaps and Korbin Albert.

In the Lyonnes first game of the new Première Ligue season, Yohannes scored in the 3-1 victory over Olympique de Marseille and was named the Player of the Match. Yohannes swelled the squad's lead to 3-0 with a right-footed strike into the high near post, which bounced off the inside of the top crossbar and into the net. The attempt came off a ricocheted shot that hit her after a corner kick, but the 18-year-old midfielder was able to control the ball deep into the box and make her move.

Following a No. 1 finish last season, OL Lyonnes was one of four teams to win in the opening weekend. Heaps started alongside Yohannes in the midfield and played the full 90 minutes.

The Houston Dash had a 1-0 lead over the San Diego Wave, but just before halftime, Yazmeen Ryan made it 2-0.

In the 45th minute, Ryan slammed a short left-footed strike high above the Wave goalkeeper's reach. Ryan and company finished the match 3-0 against No. 3-ranked Wave in front of Alex Morgan after the Wave and USWNT legend retired her jersey for the club.

It was Ryan's second goal of the season and second in the last few games. In the last three weeks, she's scored or assisted in each match. The three points helped keep the Dash (6-8-5, 23 points) in the playoff race, three points behind No. 8 Racing Louisville FC.

Lavelle scored her first goal of the 2025 regular season in a 3-1 victory against Angel City FC. In the 51st minute, Lavelle tallied the go-ahead goal to put Gotham FC up 2-1. Lavelle cleaned up a goalkeeper deflection and knocked in the rebound with a diving right-footed shot.

Lavelle missed some time to start the season, rehabbing from ankle surgery in December 2024. She returned this summer and has played a total of nine NWSL games. The former World Cup winner also recorded an assist in her previous outing against the Orlando Pride.

The North Carolina Courage and Utah Royals were deadlocked for almost 90 minutes, but late-game theatrics resulted in a 1-1 scoreline.

Shaw broke the deadlock in the 89th minute with a penalty kick. She took a stutter step from the spot and buried the ball in the high near post. That would have been the end of it if not for the Royals' equalizer that Paige Monaghan scored in stoppage time (90+4).

The last-place Royals prevented the Courage from picking up a much-needed three points, as North Carolina is in a tight race to make it into the playoffs with the season winding down. The Courage currently sits in No. 11 in the standings, four points behind No. 8.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – The pitches at the OhioHealth Performance Center are pristine. With the hint of an autumn chill in the air and a slow-moving train crawling in the background just yards away from the turf, an ode to Ohio's rich history in rail transportation, the facility created a refreshing setting for U.S. Men's National Team's training session Monday morning.

At the foot of Historic Crew Stadium, just off Black & Gold Boulevard, the United States was full steam ahead preparing for the second and final match of the September window. The next opponent is 15th-ranked Japan, which the United States faces Tuesday, Sept. 9 at Lower.com Field, home of the Columbus Crew in Major League Soccer.

Japan is the second straight AFC opponent for the U.S., and the team carries some similarities with the first. Like Korea Republic, Japan has secured qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Japan also plays a similar possession-based style to Korea that, according to U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino, makes them one of the most exciting teams to watch and one of the most difficult to play against.

“They play similarly,” said midfielder Sebastian Berhalter. “They're pretty similar teams in terms of the way they play and the way they defend. That's good for us because we saw how that worked the first game and now we can make adjustments.”

Teams like Korea and Japan tend to play with more patience. They hold possession and can move the ball effectively with superb technical skill. They also exercise discipline defensively, waiting for the right moment, or the right mistake, to capitalize. Concacaf teams, which the United States typically sees more of, might play more aggressively, operating with strength and speed. USMNT center back Chris Richards likened the difference to playing chess versus playing checkers.

“It's a learning experience, and I think that's the number one thing from this camp is that now we're learning to play against different types of opponents,” Richards said.

When it comes to playing against these types of teams, Pochettino sees value in giving his players exposure to different playing styles. It's all a part of the manager's methodology in September camp – to give his players both experience and opportunities in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

This was evident in the match against Korea. Pochettino's starting XI was a near-even mix of players rostered for the Gold Cup and players returning to their first camp after several months. The head coach made sure Sergiño Dest and Falorin Balogun, two players coming off injury, saw competitive minutes. Pochettino also made several substitutions throughout the night at Sports Illustrated Stadium to get more players onto the pitch.

When it comes to the next matchup against Japan, Pochettino told reporters on Monday he plans to continue that approach.

“The World Cup is not the moment to test or give players the possibility to gain experience, which is why you cannot be surprised if I make some changes tomorrow and some players may play,” he said. “They play because we want to give them time because now is the moment for them to get experience.”

For the United States, they will look to build off a strong second-half performance against Korea. The U.S. conceded twice in the first half but made some adjustments for the second 45. Substitutions in the 62nd minute put three U.S. center backs on the field, and the formation shifted into a three-man backline. The tactical adjustment allowed the team to push their press higher and instigate more of the attack.

In the second half, the United States also strengthened defensively and allowed just one shot on goal from Korea.

Another similarity between Korea and Japan is that they are opponents the United States does not face often. Tuesday marks just the fourth all-time meeting between the U.S. and Japan in men's soccer. Japan won the most recent meeting in 2022. The matchup prior to that was on Feb. 10, 2006. Goals from defender Eddie Pope, forwards Clint Dempsey and Taylor Twellman led the United States to 3-2 victory in San Francisco.

The United States meets Japan again on American soil, this time in Columbus, Ohio, a city filled with incredible history for the program and its players, which the USMNT hopes will work in their favor Tuesday night against a world-class opponent.

“Japan is a very good team,” Pochettino said. “I know Japan really well. That is the challenge we want to see as a team and challenge good teams. That is a great opportunity in a very good place and a historic place in Columbus.”

Fresh off a hard-court title sweep in Cincinnati and New York, Carlos Alcaraz will not appear in this weekend's Davis Cup second-round qualifier for Spain.Alcaraz, who defeated rival Jannik Sinner in Sunday's US Open final for his second major of the year and sixth overall, withdrew from his nation's tie with Denmark in Marbella due to fatigue.The 22-year-old won the Cincinnati Open after Sinner retired from their final down 5-0 due to illness, then played on Arthur Ashe Stadium the following day in his mixed doubles debut with Emma Raducanu. Alcaraz went on to capture his second title at Flushing Meadows, dropping a single set en route to reclaiming the No. 1 ranking from Sinner.

Hours after appearing on 'The Today Show', US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka took her media blitz to 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,' where she made a cameo alongside a fake Carlos Alcaraz (played by Fred Armisen).

It was Aryna Sabalenka day in New York City -- and everywhere else, for that matter -- on Monday, less than 48 hours removed from her second consecutive US Open title.

In the morning, the World No. 1 appeared on The Today Show alongside fellow US Open champion and World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz. Hours later, she again appeared alongside Alcaraz -- this time a fake one, played by comedian and actor Fred Armisen -- on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

After Armisen comedically gave a lackluster account of his win over Jannik Sinner, and explained that he really doesn't remember the match, or even being there, the host said, "I love having you here, and I'm so happy you took the time, but I actually wish I could hear from a US Open winner who does remember the—"

Before Fallon could finish his sentence, Sabalenka emerged from behind the curtain, trophy in hand, to a booming applause from the crowd.

"It was amazing," the four-time Grand Slam champion told the Tonight Show crowd. "I love playing in New York, and the experience was unforgettable.”

With the win over American Amanda Anisimova in the final, Sabalenka became the first woman to repeat as US Open champion since Serena Williams in 2014. It was also her first Grand Slam title of the year after getting upset in the Wimbledon semis by Anisimova and falling short in two finals, first to Madison Keys in Melbourne and then Coco Gauff in Paris.

This time around, the 27-year-old focused on managing her emotions, staying within herself and trusting her game.

"Going into this final, I decided for myself that I'm going to control my emotions," Sabalenka told reporters after the match. "I'm not going to let them take control over me, and [it] doesn't matter what happens in the match. ... My mindset was just going out there, fight for every point.

A post shared by The Tonight Show (BTS) (@fallontonightbts)

"Doesn't matter the situation. Just focus on myself and focus on things that I have to do to win the match. I think from what I understand today, that the lesson learned -- and I really hope it will never happen again if I'm going to be playing another finals -- that I will be more in control."

Sabalenka is next scheduled to play in Beijing, at the China Open, later this month.

After being captained by John and Patrick McEnroe for Laver Cup's first seven years, Team World will be guided in 2025 by a pair of Hall of Famers, Andre Agassi and Patrick Rafter. It will be fascinating to see what Agassi, an astute analyst of the game, as well as a member of three Davis Cup championship teams, will bring to the mix as he leads Team World's six players. Ditto for Rafter, who as an Australian, hails from the nation that for decades has brought team spirit to the tennis more emphatically than any country in tennis history. Mentored extensively courtside and beyond by such Aussie icons as Tony Roche and John Newcombe, Rafter too will provide plenty of wisdom.When it comes to the players, if experience is the best indicator, then Team World's alpha males are a pair of Americans, Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz. Between them, these two have competed at Laver Cup nine times. Currently ranked 29 in the world, Tiafoe made his Laver Cup debut at the age of 19 in 2017 and five years later, clinched Team World's first championship run with a dramatic win over Stefanos Tsitsipas.“It's an unbelievable feeling,” Tiafoe said that day. "We all did it together; it wasn't just me. I showed a lot of heart to get this done. This is big.”Tiafoe also won three matches when Team World took the title again in 2023. Having lost early at the US Open, Tiafoe will likely bring plenty of energy and a strong desire to make a statement in San Francisco.

Fritz, America's highest-ranked male player at number five, has had an excellent summer—two grass-court titles, the semis of Wimbledon, and the quarters of the US Open. Still, having gone all the way to the final in New York a year ago, Fritz left New York somewhat frustrated.Two other Team World members who've also played Laver Cup are Argentine Francisco Cerundolo and another American, big-serving Reilly Opelka. A top 30 mainstay for several years, the 21st-ranked Cerundolo has a compiled a 2-0 Laver Cup record. Opelka first played Laver Cup in 2021 (0-2) and reached a career-high ranking of 17 in the world the following season. But in recent years, he's struggled with injuries. This year, Opelka has recovered. Ranked nearly 300 in the world as 2025 began, the 28-year-old Opelka has made his way back up the ranks to No. 63.Rounding out Team World are two newcomers—each with highly different playing styles. World No. 32 Alex Michelsen plays small in a big man's body, this 21-year-old Californian's game an eclectic mix of tactical guile and power. Michelsen this year has reached the quarterfinals or better at six ATP Tour events. Brazilian Jose Fonseca is unquestionably 2025's most notable teen prodigy. Backed by a tremendously powerful forehand, the 19-year-old has risen in the last 12 months from a ranking of 158 to his current spot at 42. Earlier this year, in Buenos Aires, Fonseca won his first ATP Tour title.Part Two tomorrow will dig into Team Europe—also boasting new leaders in Yannick Noah and Tim Henman.

Ben Shelton is making headlines on and off the court, and this time, it's for stepping into the role of reporter.

Just two weeks ago at the US Open, the 22-year-old American was caught off guard when his girlfriend, football star Trinity Rodman, put him on the spot during a press conference by teasing him about not hitting a serve above 135mph.

On Sunday, Shelton turned the tables. After Rodman scored both goals in Washington Spritis' 2-0 victory over Seattle Reign in the National Women's Soccer League, Shelton seized his chance to ask the questions.

“First off, I wanna say great game, Trin. I got a couple questions,” Shelton said to Rodman, who couldn't contain her laughter. “Two great combo goals today, it was really cool to see the assist. Could you talk about your dynamic with Croix Bethune and how you guys play off each other. It's really cool to see.”

Rodman answered thoughtfully, but Shelton slipped in a playful reminder of the US Open cameo: “No, I'm going to keep it positive,” he joked, alluding to the pointed serve-speed question she lobbed his way in New York.



Since going public with their relationship in March, Rodman has been a fixture at many of Shelton's tournaments, including Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open.

Now sidelined with a shoulder injury that forced him to retire from his third-round match in New York, the No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is returning the support by cheering on Rodman at NWSL games, and even picking up a microphone when the opportunity calls for it.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max's Monza Masterclass

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz react to their respective P7 and P11 respctive finishing positions at the Italian Grand Prix.

There were mixed fortunes for Williams in the Italian Grand Prix as Alex Albon walked away from Monza with a hatful of points, while team mate Carlos Sainz was left frustrated by a difficult afternoon that saw contact and a battery issue derail his challenge.

Following a difficult Qualifying that saw both cars exit in Q2, Williams opted to split strategies for Sunday's Grand Prix – starting Albon on the hard tyre and Sainz on the mediums. The former ran a long opening stint, which saw him climb up into the top 10 and run as high as fifth at times, mixing it with the leading cars.

Even after he pitted, Albon managed to hold onto a points paying position and was rewarded with seventh at the flag – finishing as the lead midfield car.

“Fantastic strategy and great car pace, I think those two together, you are going to have a good time of it,” Albon explained as he reflected on his race.

“Honestly… It was meant to be a tough race on paper but actually we were the first hard car once everyone pitted. I don't want to call it an easy race, but the car was really nice to drive. One of the best Sundays balance-wise I've had all year.

“It always seems when we run the low downforce cars, our balance improves as well. Many parts of that race we were just as quick as the top teams. It was a great comeback from a tough Saturday.”

Albon's points keep Williams clear of Aston Martin in the fight for fifth in the Teams' Championship, while the Thai driver sits seventh in the Drivers' standings – moving ahead of Kimi Antonelli in the Mercedes.

“It proves we have a consistent car, it has been one of the biggest focus points for us last year and this year," Albon continued. "That is proving to be working and even at the same time, even when Saturdays are miserable we end up back in the points, I don't even know how!

“I'll keep it going, I'm enjoying it and I'll try and battle Kimi until Abu Dhabi.”

But while Albon was left overjoyed with how his race unfolded in Italy, the same could not be said for his team mate. Sainz has endured more than his fair share of bad luck this season – and more befell the Spaniard at Monza.

He started on the mediums – the same strategy as the majority of the field – but a mix of a battery issue and contact with Ollie Bearman's Haas, saw him come home in 11th – meaning he still has not scored in a Grand Prix since Canada back in June.

“We were the last of the medium starters I think and it was always going to be difficult to make a comeback on the same strategy as everyone in front of me but we actually extended the medium quite a long way and we were doing a good comeback on the hard,” Sainz explained.

“Quicker than Bearman in front, quicker than Bortoleto, we were going to start passing at that stage but when I went for a move with Ollie, unfortunately we touched. That pretty much ruined my race, I got damage and yeah, not the easiest race.

“We also ran into some battery issues so a difficult day in the office.”

Sainz has more than once this year found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time – just last week he was penalised after contact with Liam Lawson, he made contact with Charles Leclerc at Silverstone while brake and gearbox issues prevented him even starting the race in Austria.

Sainz was asked what he can do to arrest his bad luck, with the Spaniard replying: “Keep pushing, like my Qualifying pace is there, my race pace is there so at some point it will finish. But, not going to lie, it is starting to get frustrating and rather depressing.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max's Monza Masterclass

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps

Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson came to blows during the Italian Grand Prix, with the two drivers sharing their views post-race.

Yuki Tsunoda was left to ponder what might have been at the Italian Grand Prix after his bid to make it back-to-back points finishes came undone via a collision with Liam Lawson.

Lawson and Tsunoda found themselves sharing the same piece of track midway through Sunday's race at Monza – the Racing Bulls driver having pitted early on a soft-hard tyre strategy and the Red Bull man stopping a few laps later on a medium-hard approach.

Drama ensued heading into the Roggia chicane when Lawson attempted a move around the outside, only for his front-left tyre to make contact with the rear-right of Tsunoda's – sending both drivers over the run-off area.

While the position was returned to him, Tsunoda picked up significant damage on the floor of his car and could only work his way back to 13th by the chequered flag, which he took a couple of seconds up on Lawson.

Reflecting on his race, and that incident, Tsunoda said: “The first stint was okay, and in the second stint I got distracted by a guy who was not even fighting for the points. I picked up so much damage, which was enough to make me slow down enough… to have bad pace.

“It's very frustrating, to be honest. I was fighting for points and… [it was] a very unnecessary move from Lawson. I don't know what to say.”

Asked if he will go and talk to Lawson, the Japanese racer added: “We know that he's an aggressive driver, and I think it's not a bad thing, but at the same time there's always a line that we can't step over and be beyond. Especially when we're [under] the same [Red Bull family] roof.

“Obviously with his position, it's a seat that probably can be very high competition [to secure], more than anywhere else. At the same time, there's always a line and there's a respect, so it's a shame.”

Lawson then shared his side after going aggressive with his tyre strategy following a back-of-the grid start, brought on by the New Zealander's mistake at the end of Q1.

“We tried a gamble to make something out of it, and it just didn't work,” he sighed. “I think it nearly worked, just a couple of cars came out around us, they were on fresh tyres, and we just lost a lot of time. It was tough from where we were starting.

“[With Tsunoda], he passed me, I tried to pass him back, and he just squeezed me in the braking zone. We both went off, so I gave the position back, but… I was on the edge of the track, so it was close.”

If nothing else, it's always wonderful to see a new Steven Soderbergh movie with some actual life in its bones. After the airless spy games of “Black Bag,” the postmortem gimmickry of “Presence,” and the limp gyrations of “Magic Mike's Last Dance,” the prolific filmmaker's run of small and increasingly sterile genre exercises was starting to feel like a waste of his un-retirement. I never would have guessed that the answer to Soderbergh's listlessness might be an 86-year-old man, but Ian McKellen — delivering what's easily his most essential screen performance since “The Lord of the Rings” — is so full of vim and vigor in “The Christophers” that he threatens to revitalize his director by osmosis.

McKellen stars as the fading artist formerly known as Julian Sklar, a once-revered painter who peaked in the '90s with a series of portraits of his ex-lover — the titular Christopher — before losing his luster, becoming the Simon Cowell of a ludicrous reality competition show, and finding himself on the wrong side of “cancel culture” for unspecified reasons. Now supposedly dying from some terminal illness, Julian has gone total hermit mode inside of his cluttered London apartment, where the walls are festooned with the relics of his success and the backrooms are a junk pile of painful memories.

Painful memories like his relationship with Christopher, which left Julian rich but scarred; his work began to suffer along with their romance, to the point that the last eight pieces of his signature series have remained unfinished in a dusty corner of his home for the last 30 years. His grubby adult kids (James Corden and Jessica Gunning) — still stinging from the casual cruelty he inflicted upon them as children, and well-aware that Julian's withholding nature will extend to their inheritance — would sure love it if they found a previously unknown trove of three million dollar paintings among their father's stuff when he died, and so they hire the best art forger in Britain to apply for an assistant job in the hopes that she can nick the unfinished “Christophers” and complete them with Julian's original materials (thus making it impossible to identify them as fakes). 

Would that it were so simple. Julian is no easy mark, and Lori (a smart, sly, and deeply felt Michaela Coel) has reasons for wanting to fuck him over that have nothing to do with money. The competing agendas of Ed Solomon's script set the stage for a fun and prickly chamber piece that's hiding a dozen booby traps in every room, and Soderbergh is so excited about the prospect of setting them off that his camera literally shakes the moment he steps foot into the tomb-like apartment where most of this story takes place, as if the director — again doing his own cinematography under the guise of “Peter Andrews” — was getting a contact high just from being that close to a vintage Ian McKellen performance. 

 










The 30-minute sparring match that unfolds from there is one of the great sequences of Soderbergh's post-retirement career. It starts with Julian recording a rapid-fire series of Cameo-like internet videos for $149 a pop, and scatters around the duplex from there until what's left of his legacy is placed into a firepit in the backyard. In between, both the flamboyant painter and the business-like job applicant who comes to his door lay all of their cards on the table, as what seems to be the premise for another Soderbergh heist movie instead gives way to a broader and frequently withering — sometimes even Pinter-esque — pas de deux about all of the things that people take from each other. And, in a way, the things they give each other in return.

Not that Julian seems like he's ever given someone more than a headache or a broken heart. A rascally old coot who's lost everything besides his ability to piss people off (a talent that he nurtures like a virtue), Julian knows that he fell off as an artist, but his growing irrelevance has been difficult for him to reconcile with the increasing smallness of his life; the world may have moved on, but he's still the center of his own universe. 

In a performance as layered as the unfinished canvases that Julian keeps in storage, McKellen inhabits the character as a bloody prick who takes pleasure in his cutting wit, but also endows him — absent the slightest trace of sentimentality — with the wounded resignation of a man who only hurts people because he doesn't know how to help them. He bared his soul to the world with the “Christophers,” possibly at Christopher's expense, and the experience left him so exposed that he felt like he had to spend the rest of his life on the attack. (Details are few and far between in a movie that doesn't make a lot of room for exposition, but there are telling references to a public stunt where Julian gave a middle finger to the art community by selling his work to people on the street.)

 










In Lori, Julian finds someone who knows how to put him back on defense. The rare forger capable of perfectly imitating Julian's style, but also an art burnout who's lost faith in her ability to produce meaningful work of her own, Lori offers Julian a most unexpected kind of mirror. Young, Black, poly, and so petrified of vulnerability that she handles every interaction in a cool-headed monotone, Lori is the living emblem of who an old white artist might blame for their irrelevance, and yet — for reasons that don't become fully clear until the end of the film, via a clumsy flashback that's only redeemed by the ambiguity it still leaves behind — she and Julian are as tightly intertwined as a needle sewn into a canvas. 

It can be riveting to watch Lori and Julian try to make sense of the more abstract connections between them, and “The Christophers” is at its best as these characters use the kids' forgery scheme as a pretext to map their own understanding to art and to each other. The movie seldom leaves the musty interior of Julian's apartment, but the dynamic between its dueling painters is a kind of spectacle unto itself, and Soderbergh's loose and reactive cinematography pulses with the energy that's been missing from the locked-off angularity of his recent work. 

 










Yes, the movie could still be mounted as a piece of theater without much need for adaptation, and yes, it still feels more like Soderbergh is testing his own talent for efficiency than it does like he's trying to make a meaningful piece of pop art, but “The Christophers” at least has an answer for that. Real or fake, finished or not, a genre exercise or a full-hearted statement of purpose, the things we create have an impact on the world that no market could ever be able to measure. And, for better or worse, the same is true of the people who are brave enough to create them.

“The Christophers” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The "Stressed Out" duo is the latest musical act to use the legal system to crack down on alleged sellers of counterfeit merch.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Twenty One Pilots is suing the Chinese e-commerce giant Temu over allegations that the “unethical” company is flooding the market with cheap knockoffs of the band's merchandise.


	The “Stressed Out” duo, set to release its eighth studio album later this week, says the site is a “veritable swamp of infringing and otherwise illegal products,” including many that are “blatant copies” of its merch.


	“Temu is widely understood to be one of the most unethical companies operating in today's global marketplace,” the band's lawyers wrote in a complaint obtained by Billboard. “Instead of policing its products to guard against infringement, it chooses to profit from sales of such products, in disregard of artist and brand rights.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Temu, which means “Team Up, Price Down,” is an online marketplace that boomed in 2024 by selling low-priced goods directly to American consumers. But Twenty One Pilots (composed of singer Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun) says many of those goods are fakes that violate U.S. intellectual property.


	The lawsuit includes dozens of photos of t-shirts, mugs, posters and other allegedly counterfeit products. In one, an exact replica of a $35 t-shirt that features the two stars standing back to back, is shown on Temu at the price of just $7.54.


	“Temu's pattern of flouting the law and attempting to exploit the hard work and creativity of others without consent is manifest in the claims at issue here,” the band's lawyers wrote.


	Artists are increasingly using legal measures to crack down on counterfeit merch. Last month, Benson Boone and Tate McRae's merchandise partners each filed separate lawsuits over fake gear sold outside their concerts. Before that, Nirvana, Harry Styles, Rod Wave and many others had filed similar cases.


	But such cases can be tricky: In late 2023, Luke Combs accidentally sued a superfan who was selling decorative tumblers and quickly won a $250,000 judgment against her. After the story went viral, he apologized to her and forgave the huge debt.


	Other artists have chosen to target major online platforms that allegedly facilitate such sales. Monday's case was filed by the same lawyers who filed a similar case against Temu last month on behalf of the estate of MF Doom, leveling many of the same accusations. That lawsuit remains pending.


	Like that earlier case, Twenty One Pilots' new allegations reach well beyond intellectual property by including claims that the company sells the products of forced labor, has aided the Chinese Communist Party and has sold toxic lead products.


	The suit also claims Temu has sold goods tied to “homophobia, inciting violence, and violent criminal gang activity,” featuring an image of a shirt purportedly promoting the gang MS-13 and another that reads, “I'm Violently Homophobic.”


	“The above are two representative examples of the type of product Temu markets and sells and reflect only the tip of the iceberg,” Twenty One Pilots' lawsuit says.

Childhood fears are often extremely personal in how they manifest internally, but many are universal in the outward shape they take; fear of darkness and the monsters lurking within that unknown void being one of the most common. “Dust Bunny,” the debut feature film from prolific television creator Bryan Fuller (“Wonder Falls,” “Pushing Daisies,” “Hannibal”) takes a simple question: “What if the monster under the bed is real?” and crafts a thrilling and heartfelt action-horror-comedy that brings his trademark mixture of whimsical maximalism and macabre humor effortlessly to the big screen.

 










The film stars newcomer Sophie Sloan as Aurora, a young girl whose belief in the monster under her bed is so strong that the creature actually comes to life in physical form, at first as cute, yet sinister collection of dust shaped like a bunny before morphing into a giant room-sized furry piranha-like menace that eats people in one swallow, brought to life through thrilling CGI-enhanced puppetry. When her parents don't believe her, she wishes on a falling star for someone to help her kill the beast.

Enter Resident 5B, played with irrepressible charm and agility by long-time Fuller collaborator Mads Mikkelsen, Aurora's neighbor from across the hall. Convinced that she saw the man slay a dragon in Chinatown one night, Aurora attempts to hire him to kill the monster under her bed after it eats her parents. Despite the mess in her apartment, the man, like everyone else in her life, brushes off her fears as the exaggerations of an overactive imagination. But because of his actual profession — he's a hired hitman — he thinks perhaps one of his monsters may have accidentally axed her parents thinking they were him, and will come for Aurora next. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






The rest of the film plays out like a mixture of “Leon: The Professional,” “Poltergeist,” “City of Lost Children,” and “John Wick” as Resident 5B fights off monsters and men, bonds with the little girl while dismembering a hitman's body, and protects her from the ire of a fellow mysterious and ruthless professional killer played by Sigourney Weaver, channeling her hilariously venomous Oscar-nominated performance in “Working Girl.” David Dastmalchian also brings his singularly bizarre persona into the last act of the film as one of the many hitmen coming for Resident 5B, while the otherworldly Sheila Atim rounds out the cast as an FBI agent who exudes big Pam Grier energy. 

 










Fuller has thrown a lot in the blender in terms of themes, imagery, and characters and the result is exactly what you would expect a Fullerverse-ian spin on a family friendly (ish) horror film would be. Shot in Hungary, the bulk of the action takes place inside the lux apartment building where Aurora and Resident 5B live, a pre-war style building with winding staircases, thick wallpaper, and an old school gated elevator. The art direction has nods to the luxury of “Hannibal” season three with the vibrant color palette of “Pushing Daisies.” Viewers familiar with Fuller's television work will not be surprised by the many shots of delicious food, including a dim sum dish that looks like a cute little bunny, which was styled by Janice Poon, whose work on “Hannibal” was the cherry on top of its aesthete horror vibe. 

DP Nicole Hirsch Whitaker renders the film's colorful imagery with a fairytale glaze, emphasizing the maximalism of the production design, while often slightly warping the edges to give the frame a dreamlike quality. Old fashioned filmic techniques like split diopter shots, iris wipes, and chiaroscuro lighting add another layer of maximalist flare to the whole affair. Eccentric touches, like the bunny dim sum moving slightly before being eaten or a taxidermied chicken with an egg in its butt as a lamp or a swinging church choir wearing Pam Am style uniforms, firmly place “Dust Bunny” inside the whimsical world of the Fullerverse, although the uninitiated may find it all a bit too much.  

 










Mikkelsen, in one of the most tender performances of his career, and Sloan, whose expressive eyes stay impossibly wide for the duration of the film, craft an easy chemistry together, his mordant humor matching hers like a glove. By the end of the film, a running joke where Resident 5B, due to his thick Danish accent, cannot say Aurora's name properly becomes a term of endearment between the two, who form a new family from the broken pieces of their own. 

For all its filmic flourishes, this a sweet film at its heart, one interested in the darker side of childhood, not just the fears we have as children, but the anger as well. The ending might not sit well with everyone, it's both on-the-nose and a little overly simple, but as someone who had rage issues as a child, I felt it deeply in my bones. We all carry our monsters from childhood with us to adulthood, whether we'd like to admit it or not. As far as Fuller is concerned, the best we can do is accept that part of ourselves, and find more constructive ways to feed it. Like making emotionally resonant, visually resplendent, and ridiculously gruesome art about the power of chosen family. 

“Dust Bunny” premiered in Midnight Madness at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It will be released in theaters by Roadside Attractions on December 5.

Breakups are hard, but when two people are on the same page, life gets easier. Actor Orlando Bloom and Former “American Idol” judge and pop Icon Katy Perry are proving there's no bad blood after their split. The former couple, who recently ended their nine-year relationship, showed they remain on good terms when Perry shared Bloom's new movie “The Cut” with fans.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

On September 7, Perry shared the trailer on Instagram, captioning it, “proud of you @orlandobloom.” Bloom responded with a simple heart emoji, a gesture that showed appreciation for her support.

The show of support came just days after Bloom addressed the breakup publicly. During a September 5 appearance on Today with Craig Melvin, the 48-year-old actor said he was in a good place.

“I'm great,” Bloom shared. “I'm so grateful. We've got a beautiful daughter. You know when you leave everything on the field like I did in this movie, I feel grateful for all of it.”

Bloom also made it clear that his bond with Perry remains strong. “We're gonna be great,” he said. “It's nothing but love.”

While Friday marked Bloom's first public comments about his split from Perry, the actor had previously shared uplifting quotes on his Instagram Stories on June 30, just days after news of their breakup became public.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

Bloom and Perry share a 5-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove. While Perry, 40, has not directly addressed the split, the couple's representative released a joint statement in July confirming the breakup.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

“Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on coparenting,” the rep shared. 

“They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is—and always will be—raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.”

Bloom, who is also father to 14-year-old Flynn with ex-wife Miranda Kerr, has consistently spoken about the importance of family. Perry echoed that sentiment in an interview on Call Her Daddy, where she explained why their relationship worked for so long.

A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry)

“We want to evolve,” Perry said at the time. “That's what I think our relationship is for: to become better humans so we can raise this beautiful human being.”

Even after their romantic chapter closed, Bloom and Perry continue to show that mutual love, respect, and shared dedication to Daisy will always come first.

The Conjuring series that's been in development at HBO Max since 2023 is ramping up: Deadline has confirmed that Nancy Won (Tiny Beautiful Things) will serve as showrunner and executive producer. 


	Peter Cameron and Cameron Squires, both of Marvel series like Agatha All Along and WandaVision, will join as writers.


	Two years ago, Deadline revealed that HBO Max was developing a drama series based on the New Line Cinema film franchise with Warner Bros. Television. It was described as a continuation of the story that was established in the films. Peter Safran is EPing, while James Wan‘s Atomic Monster is producing. Wan directed both The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2.

	











	There are nine films in the Conjuring universe. The most recent, The Conjuring: Last Rites was released Sept. 5, and enjoyed the biggest horror opener of all time worldwide.

Variety was first to report the news about Won and the writers. 


	Won is with UTA; Cameron is with Verve, Untitled, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole; and Squires with CAA, Artists First, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Following his work on the Screen Gems video game adaptation Until Dawn, David F. Sandberg has inked a deal to tackle another beloved genre property, as director of a new Amityville Horror movie in development at Amazon MGM Studios.


	Fresh off the success of The Conjuring: Last Rites, which was released in theaters this past weekend and has already earned $187 million global, Ian Goldberg & Richard Naing have been tapped to write the script, described as a reimagining of the original horror classic. Further specifics as to the story here are under wraps. The Safran Company's Peter Safran and John Rickard will produce alongside Sandberg, with The Safran Company's Natalia Safran being joined as executive producer by Lotta Losten.

	











	Sandberg comes to the project after collaborating with The Safran Company on projects like Annabelle: Creation, which grossed over $300 million at the worldwide box office, and Shazam!.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Dating back to the late '70s, The Amityville Horror franchise originated with a Stuart Rosenberg film, starring James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger, which adapted both the Jay Anson 1977 book of the same name, as well as the paranormal legend at its center. That tale is set in motion in 1974, when Ronald DeFeo Jr. murders his parents and four siblings in their home at 112 Ocean in Amityville, New York. A year or so after the horrific crime, George and Kathy Lutz, along with their three children, move into the house, unaware of its dark past. And shortly after settling in, they claim to experience a series of unsettling paranormal phenomena.

	











	Clearly, there's great interest in Amityville right now as a jumping-off point for new feature stories. Only a couple of months ago, we reported exclusively that BoulderLight Pictures and Divide/Conquer — the producers of Weapons and Heart Eyes, respectively — are developing a new Amityville project set apart from the film canon, with roots in the public domain folk tale. Joseph and Vanessa Winter, the married writer-director duo behind the SXSW found footage horror movie Deadstream, will direct that one from their own script. 


	Word of the Amityville projects comes at an opportune time, as it's been a while since we've seen a real breakout entry in the franchise. The most recent, semi-notable installment came last year with Amityville: Where the Echo Lives, a Lionsgate title with a no-name cast that went straight to Max. Prior to that, Dimension Films and Blumhouse were among the producers of Amityville: The Awakening, a title released through RADiUS-TWC that had a decent cast in Bella Thorne, Cameron Monaghan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mckenna Grace and Thomas Mann, but grossed just a little over $8 million.


	In addition to Until Dawn and Annabelle: Creation, Sandberg is known for his work on the horror pic Lights Out, as well as both Shazam! films. He is repped by CAA, Gotham Group, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.


	Goldberg and Naing are writer-producers who have previously worked together on projects like The Nun II, Fear the Walking Dead and The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Naing is repped by Independent Artist Group, Circle Management + Production, and Del Shaw Moonves; Goldberg by WME, New Wave Entertainment, and Del Shaw Moonves.

Will it be able to outgross the last one – Amityville: the Awakening? 

US Gross – $742 dollars.

I have 0 confidence in this after what happened to until dawn, how did he ruin that adaptation when it was one of the most cinemantic games ever created?

Who knew a hoax by a publicity hungry couple would still be a cash cow all these decades later.

You know, they COULD just write a brand new story about a haunted house that wasn't a sequel, requel, remake, reboot, reimagining, redo, revival, reintroduction… it could just be an ORIGINAl thing. You know, like how they used to make movies?

Shouldn't you not being getting work after making Until Dawn?

Over the Labor Day weekend, “Hamnet” turned the Werner Herzog Theatre at Telluride into a river of tears. And it did the same thing, by all accounts, at Toronto's 2,600-seat Roy Thomson Hall on Sunday night. (Toronto often waits until after the opening weekend to show Telluride titles. Not this time.)

Anyone who has seen “Nomadland,” which earned Best Picture and Director Oscars for Chloé Zhao in 2021, knows that this director is skilled at eliciting emotion, from her actors and her audiences. “I don't think I've screened any of my films in a theater that big before,” she told IndieWire the next morning on Zoom. “It's huge, and because it's three floors and it's round, it's actually like the Globe Theatre.”

That's Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, which Zhao had rebuilt at about 70-= percent scale for “Hamnet,” a heart-wrenching period family drama based on Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 bestseller about William and Agnes Shakespeare (Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley). The well-reviewed film tracks their early romance and marriage and the birth of three children, two girls and a boy, Hamnet. Their lives are rocked by grief when they lose Hamnet to the plague, and Shakespeare buries himself in writing the tragedy “Hamlet.”

 










When Sam Mendes pulled back from developing “Hamnet” in 2022, Amblin Entertainment called Zhao to check out her interest in directing. She was driving through New Mexico's Four Corners on her way to Telluride. She had never read the book, and at first said “no.” A few hours later, she got a call that Paul Mescal wanted to meet her at the festival. She did not know his work (he had done “Normal People,” and “Aftersun” was a secret screening at the festival). “I had no idea who he was,” she said. “I Googled him. I see pictures of him, and I saw a clip. ‘I like his vibe. Why don't I just meet with him?'”

During their walk in the woods, they stopped by a creek. Zhao looked at his profile. “Have you thought about playing young Shakespeare?,” she said. “‘Hamnet'?,” he asked. “I read the book. You have to read the book.”

“It was exciting to meet him,” she said, “because it was not that different than meeting my rodeo cowboy for ‘The Rider,' because I didn't know him as an actor or what he does, I just felt like this person could potentially do this.”

Then she read the book. “If I had read the book, I wouldn't have said, ‘no,'” she said. “I had never heard of the book.” And she wanted Jessie Buckley to play Agnes. “I knew her work. I had a feeling that she wouldn't be afraid. There was no vanity in her, which is what Fran McDormand had. I'm neurodivergent, and when there's dissonance, I can't function. I can't look at the person. So I need that authenticity, and vanity is the number-one enemy of authenticity. Actors, their greatest blessing they can give to the world is their authenticity and their humanness.”

 










Making people cry is not Zhao's goal, per se. “I never quite know what I'm doing when I set out to do something, and why,” she said, “because I never quite know what is real or what is true. Literal truth doesn't make sense to me. When something is completely present in the moment with no dissonance at all, that's when I say, ‘capture that right away,' because that is truth that can transcend time and space, and that can link everyone together. Every day on set, that's what we go for. Of course, we have a blueprint of a script based on a beautiful book. That's the bones, the spine.” 

Early in Zhao's career, her films were reality-based. They tried to capture something in the real world. And then she directed Marvel's “Eternals,” which is the opposite. While she got her worst reviews for that film, it did teach her many skills, including how to build a world. 16th century “Hamnet” needed to be created, built from the ground up. It doesn't exist except in the pages of O'Farrell's book. That's one reason why Zhao turned to O'Farrell to write the screenplay with her.

If O'Farrell had refused to write the “Hamnet” script with her, Zhao wouldn't have made the movie, because she had built a world in the book. “Not only that, she had also been swimming in that pond for so long that she knows what she didn't put in the book,” said Zhao. “To have that book, she must have written 10 of those to distill to that in her research. I needed to know what else isn't in the book, because things will change. We add scenes. And so without her, I couldn't have done that.”

 










O'Farrell did a first pass and arranged everything in chronological order. Zhao did another pass to condense it, pick the things to keep and throw away. And with that spine, they add and subtract “until we both go, ‘OK, this is it,'” Zhao said.

It helped to have Steven Spielberg on hand to give notes on the script and the edit. After he read the first drafts, he told Zhao, “I'm missing a moment between Will and Hamnet, between father and son.” So she wrote the “will you be brave?” scene. “He helped,” she said.

As far as Zhao is concerned, she and O'Farrell and the cast and crew contributed to the film every day, from Oscar-winning sound designer Johnnie Burn (“The Zone of Interest”) and ASC-winning cinematographer Łukasz Żal (“Cold War”) to co-editor Affonso Gonçalves and composer Max Richter.

“The emotionality of the film was the emotional truth of what we captured as a village,” she said. “We don't know how to do it any other way. We were swimming the river together. So this is what we ended up with. And I have a faith that I hold on to — I'm not a traditionally religious person — but this faith I have as an artist is that if we do the work and we have conviction and we show up every day, something much bigger and older is going to try to speak through us. And whatever that is, is what the world needs. I just want to trust that. Otherwise, I'm lost.”

 










“Hamnet” had to be filmed on a smaller scale than her Marvel movie “Eternals.” “There isn't another sunset that I could capture more dramatically than ‘Eternals,'” said Zhao. “Capturing sunsets in ancient places, with 500 people waiting and superhero-like, I've done enough sunsets now. In my thirties, I was chasing the horizons like a nomadic person, because for me it was easier to keep running. It's difficult for me to sit with myself. ‘Hamnet' needed depth, maturity. I challenged myself: one frame, one room, one stage. You're not going to rely on that grandeur and that excitement of movement. How deep can you go? Because once you restrain yourself with these walls, the only place you could go is above or below, and that is extremely uncomfortable.”

The day when everyone on set went deep was the death of Hamnet. The night before, Jacobi Jupe came to Zhao and said, “I'm going to break your heart tomorrow.” She said, “Good! I have high expectations.”

When the day came, “I did not know Jessie was going to scream,” said Zhao. “I didn't know that. I didn't know what Jacobi was going to do. I had no idea what the two of them were going to do. We create an environment. By then, we've been together for a couple of months, cast crew, everyone knew what today is, it was like a ceremony. It wasn't doing a scene. The pin could drop. Everyone in that moment was feeling something from the beginning of the day, something they loved they'd lost. So Jessie and Jacobi were channeling what all the people that are their found family in this last few months are feeling as well, and so the truth we capture in the moment is the only thing that we need to stand by. And in the edit, I have to make sure to not betray that, to not be afraid what that might do to the film in public.”

 










One of the reasons that Zhao initially shied away from the book was to avoid dealing with a mother figure. “When you have a deep mother wound, from your own personal life or ancestrally, telling a story about motherhood is triggering,” she said. “That's why, if you look at my films in the past, that character doesn't exist. She's either not present or dead. So when I heard about the synopsis, I said I was not anywhere near doing it. I was also in the middle of going through midlife transition, [I was] turning 40-41, around that time. ‘If I don't heal that wound, the second half of life is going to be hard.' So I was reading the book, seeing how Agnes is losing her mother, losing her connection with nature, her connection with her child. There's so much there. ‘How am I going to hold that? I can't do this!'”

But then Zhao saw something that she could grasp, “a safe place,” she said, “which is actually the William Shakespeare side of the story, because I was writing from myself, too. I escaped into the fantasy world because I didn't want to sit around the dinner table. It was not safe. So I know that character, that's my safe place for 41 years. If I can escape to him half the time, I can maybe handle her, and then to allow these two sides of myself who had been at war and caused a lot of suffering to finally see each other. At the end, I went on an incredible healing journey making this film.”

 










Crying together goes back to the Greeks. “In every indigenous tradition, you come around the fire, and then the shaman would channel a story,” said Zhao, who used daily meditations and dream sessions with her actors, and arranged weekly dance rituals to let off steam. 

“Animals, dreams, visions. People have strong emotions. Warriors come back from battle. They don't just take medication. They can go back home. They sit around the fire, and they dance, and they release these emotions, and that turned into theater, these Greek tragedies. You get together, everyone gets angry together, and then they rage, and then they cry. And we have been dealing with this impossible tension to be alive. We so far have not been able to escape the law of nature. We're going to be born, we're going to die. And we have been using art and storytelling and a collective communal experience, to grieve, to feel, to deal with that since way before any of these things that are telling us we should be separated even existed. We're remembering, ready to survive.”

[Editor's note: Spoilers for the last act of “Hamnet” follow.]

At the end of the movie, the grieving Agnes, feeling bereft of her child and her husband, and away writing and mounting “Hamlet,” comes to the Globe Theatre to see the premiere performance. She stands at the edge of the stage with hundreds of extras behind her. She is riveted as the actor playing Prince Hamlet (Noah Jupe) is onstage with her husband, Will, playing the ghost of his father, King Hamlet.

 










“It was four of the most difficult, but also life-changing days of my life,” said Zhao. “There's barely any dialogue. This language is quite universal for everyone, right? Sometimes our truth can only be felt in silence and maybe with Max Richter's music playing in the background. All we're asking is to see each other and be seen without judgment, unconditionally, and that was healing and also difficult to experience. Shakespeare worked hard his entire life to bring people together every day for a few hours: The illusion of separation dissolves.”

She added after the TIFF premiere, “And that's how I felt yesterday at the theater. Just for that short amount of time, you go to these events, you hold each other's grief and anger and fear and shame in that short amount of time.” 

Focus Features will release “Hamnet” in theaters on Friday, November 27.

The singer graciously accepted a load of gifts from the oddball Canadian interviewer.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Sabrina Carpenter took a trip to Los Angeles' Safari Records to chop it up with oddball Canadian interviewer Nardwuar, who loaded the “Espresso” singer with a satchel full of vintage vinyl and other musical keepsakes during their ramble.


	It wasn't just a record swap, though, Carpenter, 26,  also learned a few things during the chat. Nardwuar revealed that the singer's former label, Hollywood Records, only printed up 200 vinyl copies of her 2015 debut studio album, Eyes Wide Open, to distribute to press and VIPs. “Only 200 made? They really didn't give a f–k about me!” she laughed as she looked at the vinyl even she didn't own a copy of.

	











	Expertly navigating Nardwuar's signature rapid-fire topic skipping , Carpenter took it all-the-way back to the beginning, telling him that as an eight-year-old one of the first musicians she really laser focused on while listening to her iPod Nano was Taylor Swift. “At that time I was so tapped in and I was really fascinated because it's like you're seeing a rainbow for the first time,” she said of her early musical discovery. “One of one of the first artists that I listened to on the school bus was Taylor Swift because my best friend Anna — who was my next door neighbor — played me ‘Our Song' in her headphones for me. And I was like, ‘What is this?' I was gagged.”

	Not only did he engage in his typically wacky antics, but Nardwuar showered Carpenter with a series of precious keepsakes, including a 1953 vintage 7-inch Marilyn Monroe single and a vintage Monroe poster, as well as a vintage Patsy Cline album, a Dolly Parton stand-up and a poster signed by one of the singer's favorite bands, the Blue Nile. He also piled on a Carpenter vinyl Man's Best Friend slipmat, a copy of 1957's Funny Face soundtrack from the film starring one of her favorite actresses, Audrey Hepburn and a Patti Smith vinyl single of “Hey Joe,” as well as the MC5's “Kick Out the Jams” and an vinyl album of Carole King covers.


	And, of course, he gave her an Earth, Wind & Fire “Let Me Talk” single in honor of Carpenter taking the stage with the legendary R&B band during her headlining set at Lollapalooza this summer. “I've been a fan of them my whole life and I think they have created some of the most iconic and classic songs of all time,” she said. She also showed off her “at last” tattoo on her shoulder when Nardwuar gave her a copy of Etta James' signature song. 


	Given her Disney-affiliated background he handed over a copy of the 1961 Disney single “Heigh-Ho” from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, with Carpenter cheekily quipping that the phrase “has a new meaning now.” The interview ended with Carpenter asking the store's manager to find her a particular album by 1970s soft rockers Bread, the “underrated” band she predicted would be playing at her wedding some day.

The 'Alien' star gives her take on FX's acclaimed series, which is heavily inspired by her 1979 film. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Sigourney Weaver has some thoughts about FX‘s Alien: Earth. 


	The Alien and Aliens star has weighed in on the acclaimed FX series, which brought the iconic sci-fi franchise to TV for the first time.




	While the new series is heavily inspired by the first two films in the saga, Weaver seemed to most appreciate the ways in which the Noah Hawley series has moved the franchise into original territory — specifically, with the human-synthetic hybrid characters led by Wendy (Sydney Chandler), the film's commentary on amoral tech company greed and generating new creatures beyond the xenomoprh.

	“I'm really enjoying it,” she told People during an event promoting her upcoming film, Dust Bunny. “What I admire about it is the scope is so much more profound than just an Alien movie. It's about our world and what's dominating the world in 100 years, and to me it's right on.”


	Weaver added she appreciated “the new [hybrid] creatures based on children” and the new monsters in the show, such as menacing Eye. 


	“All these things are so remarkable and they're just building and building and building,” she said. “The monsters that he's also bringing in are just terrifying. It's like, we don't have enough problems with the alien, we need 50 more. I can't believe I'm watching TV.” 


Alien: Earth premiered Aug. 12 to critic and fan praise and is currently midway through its eight-episode run. The series chronicles what happens when a spaceship loaded with deadly samples of alien creatures crash lands on Earth and the subsequent race to contain and possess the valuable specimens. The series also stars Alex Lawther, Essie Davis, Timothy Olyphant, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay and Adarsh Gourav.

	











	Weaver's Dust Bunny is a horror thriller from Bryan Fuller (Hannibal) which is having its premiere tonight at the Toronto Film Festival. The film follows an 8-year-old girl (Sophie Sloan) who asks her neighbor (Mads Mikkelsen) for help to kill the monster under her bed who ate her family. Dust Bunny lands in theaters Dec. 12. Weaver also stars in Avatar: Fire and Ash, which arrives in theaters Dec. 19.

The Colombian-American artist will run through her decade-plus career and share her next chapter at the weeklong Miami event.

Associate Editor, Billboard Español


	Billboard Latin Music Week just got way more exciting. Kali Uchis, the bilingual powerhouse behind No. 1 Hot Latin Songs hits like “Telepatía” and “Igual Que Un Ángel,” will make a special stop at the 2025 edition. The weeklong event, set for Oct. 20-24 at the Fillmore Miami Beach, will feature the Colombian American artist in an intimate Superstar Q&A.

	











	During this special appearance, the artist born Karly Marina Loaiza will pull back the curtain on her decade-plus evolution, offering attendees an inside look at the career milestones, creative processes and cultural influences that have made her a trailblazer in both English and Spanish-language music.


	Amid her sold-out arena tour across the U.S. — that celebrates 10 years of music and in support of her latest album Sincerely, — the hitmaker continues to prove why she's one of the most revered bilingual artists in the industry. From her early SoundCloud days with 2015's EP Por Vida to the bilingual brilliance of Orquídeas (2024), which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, she continues to deliver bangers like “All I Can Say” and “Is It A Crime,” which reached the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at No. 24 and No. 11, respectively.

	“Sincerely, was such a nostalgic sound in general. It was very different for me because it played on some of my influences that I haven't really shown,” she recently told Billboard Español. “I'm influenced by so much different music. Everyone knows that I love oldies, but I also dug into an alternative sound. I pushed my voice in different ways that I haven't necessarily done in the past.”

	











	This year's annual event includes artist guests like Anuel AA, Carín León, DY (formerly known as Daddy Yankee), Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Laura Pausini, Luis R. Conriquez, Myke Towers, Netón Vega, Óscar Maydon, Ozuna, Silvana Estrada, and Xavi, with more artists to be announced soon.


	Latin Music Week aligns with the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, airing live from Miami on October 23 via Telemundo and Peacock. Tickets for Billboard Latin Music Week 2025 are on sale now at BillboardLatinMusicWeek.com.

A lot of the important stuff was real: the songs, the rhymes, the flow, the friendship. It was the window-dressing that was, well, dressing. In the early aughts, a pair of Scottish BFFs, Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd, were desperate to escape their provincial lives in coastal Scotland. The boys loved rapping and revered acts like D12 and Eminem, and they weren't half-bad at it, either. The problem? No one wanted to hear or see or support Scottish dudes rapping, with one now-iconic audition ending when a scout sniffed at them and called them “rapping Proclaimers.”

 










What are two plucky boys to do? In real life, just as in James McAvoy's peppy feature directorial debut “California Schemin'” that tracks the story two decades later, it became a question of giving the audience what they wanted. And what they wanted, Gavin and Billy decided, was a pair of rappers from California. So from California they shall be.

For his feature directorial debut, proud Scotsman James McAvoy has plenty of material to pull from: The real story of Gavin and Billy, of course, plus Bain's 2010 memoir of the same name and a 2013 documentary entitled “The Great Hip Hop Hoax,” Archie Thomson and Elaine Gracie's screenplay, and McAvoy's own apparently complicated feelings about his homeland. Scotland was complicated to Gavin and Billy too, and while their scheme initially involved a planned big reveal of their actual provenance, all the better to stick it to a classist and elitist industry that didn't want their brogues in their rap music, that slowly falls away.

 










It's fun enough at first, thanks to McAvoy's energetic direction and strong turns from its young stars, including Seamus McLean Ross (as Gavin, later to be known as Brains), Samuel Bottomley (as Billy, later to be known as Silibil), and the very charming Lucy Halliday (as Billy's girlfriend Mary). The trio work together in a call center in suburban Dundee, but quiet Gavin can't help but dream big. When he hears about an open audition in London (McAvoy himself plays a wonderfully scuzzy music executive who puts out the call), he and Billy alight for the big city.

It doesn't go well, and when the boys are laughed out of the office, the city, the country, Gavin won't give up. Free-wheeling, high-spirited Billy doesn't seem so very bothered, but it's Billy's own work ethos that gives Gavin his brilliant idea: at the call center, they give the customers what they want. Why not do that with their rapping? Bolstered by a delightful montage that sees the boys boning up on their American culture and accents — watching “Die Hard” and screaming “show me the money!” and “we were on a break!” — the energy is flying by the time they set out for London again.

This time, they are from “San de Angeles.” They speak with a surfer boy affect. They are wearing a metric ton of skater kid apparel. They are Silibil N Brainz. The duo essentially bluff their way through the city, eventually catching the eye of scout Tessa (Rebekah Murrell), who helps them land a contract almost immediately, their dreams coming true with startling speed. But as they zip through early aughts London (a trip to the MTV studios to appear on “The Hook” will give Millennial movie-goers some serious flashbacks), their quest to “expose the wankers” takes a hard turn. Turns out, the razzle-dazzle of the industry can blind just about anyone.

 










Many of the story beats here are quite traditional to the music biopic genre — Billy starts sleeping around and skipping calls from Mary, Gavin gets really into drugs and alcohol, both of the boys go all-in on being “from California” — and it all starts careening toward the inevitable. But that's sort of the point: these stories, both real and fake, follow this trope-laden arc because that's what tends to happen most often. The industry chews people up and spits them (and their dreams) right back out. 

It's the oldest story in the book, but it's made all the more crushing in “California Schemin'” because Gavin and Billy are so very convinced they're the ones pulling one over on the brass. That tension is never quite resolved, however, and as the film moves closer to its expected revelations, we can already guess how and where this all might end. Same old song, just with a slightly different tempo. 

“California Schemin'” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Billboard breaks down her big week on the charts.


													By
												

	Xander Zellner



	At this point, Sabrina Carpenter is one of pop music's biggest A-listers in the 2020s. After a breakout year in 2024 that delivered both her first No. 1 album (Short n' Sweet) and No. 1 song (“Please Please Please”), she just leveled up again thanks to her new album, Man's Best Friend. The new project doesn't just debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 this week, it also posts some major numbers on the charts. Let's dive in.


Man's Best Friend debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (chart dated Sept. 13) with 366,000 equivalent album units earned in its first week, according to Luminate. That's not only her biggest week ever, it's also the third-largest of the year, behind only Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem (493,000 in May) and The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow (490,000 in February).

	The album earns Carpenter her second No. 1, following Short n' Sweet in September 2024 — that album debuted with 362,000 units. Here's a look at her full Billboard 200 track record so far:




Title, Peak Date, Peak Position


	Vinyl was a huge contributor to Man's Best Friend's big first week. The album sold 160,000 copies in vinyl alone — boosted by 13 different vinyl variants, including two signed by Carpenter. That makes it the ninth-biggest vinyl sales week since Luminate starting tracking sales in 1991.


Vinyl Number, Artist, Title, Chart Week


	Carpenter's big chart week isn't limited to just sales — the album's tracks also took over the Billboard Hot 100, too. All 12 songs from Man's Best Friend land on the latest chart, led by new single “Tears” at No. 3. “Manchild,” which debuted at No. 1 in June, also rebounds to No. 4.


	Here's the full rundown:


	Thanks to these debuts, Carpenter's career totals now stand at:

	











	Carpenter also joins Taylor Swift, SZA and Olivia Rodrigo this week as the only women in history to chart at least 12 songs in the Hot 100's top 40 simultaneously.

G
hosts of late nights past haunt the streets of downtown New York. Mark Ronson can see them everywhere: In Tribeca, there are remnants of New Music Cafe, where Ronson made the jump to flyer-billed headlining DJ at a party called Sweet Thang in his early twenties. That same address, where Brooklyn legends Jay-Z and Notorious B.I.G. heard him play — and where he became the first DJ to drop “Hypnotize” before its official release — became an oyster restaurant a few years back. That's gone now, too. But Ronson remembers it all. 


	“I have so many memories of pulling up to the club and seeing everybody already on line, excited for the night ahead,” the DJ turned Grammy Award-winning producer recalls. Night after night, he came to understand the difference between people who enjoy a night out and night people — and he writes about it in his memoir Night People: How to Be a DJ in '90s New York City. 


	These days, Ronson is a bit of both. Now 50, a husband, and a father of two, he carries the memories in his bones quite literally: He has chronic neck problems and inflamed joints from countless nights spent hunched over turntables. It's in the music, too. 

	











	“I hear Busta Rhymes ‘Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See,' and I'm instantly back in this club called Rebar on 16th and Eighth. I can smell the fucking stale beer on the floor,” Ronson says. “Music, even more than other forms of art, stays in your body because the bass and things like that somehow change the molecules in your body.” 

	











You have so many memories tied to these locations that shuttered or that don't exist in the same capacity that they once did.The book is about a lot of things. It's about DJ'ing, and it's about going out and partying and the ups and downs of that. And then it's all about New York in the Nineties. But it's very much like a ghost story in some ways, because it's a New York that doesn't exist anymore, especially downtown New York. It was so different in those days. Some of those clubs opened and shuttered five times, even in the course of the Nineties when I was DJ'ing.

	New Music Cafe was the first place where I DJ'd, and Biggie would come down. I remember the first time he brought Jay-Z down, and Jay-Z only had, like, two songs to his name. He was the prince of New York; Biggie was the king. It was all these amazing things. I was a 21-year-old kid, and the people from my record sleeves are coming to life and just populating the party. Whenever I walk past that building, it's really crazy because I have so many memories from it, no matter what's in there now. I've lived in Los Angeles for a little while, I've lived in London. Whenever I lived in New York, I've never lived more than 10 blocks from this one place. It's always in my life. The very end of the book is me walking around downtown with my two-year-old daughter strapped to me in a BabyBjorn, seeing all these shuttered places and trying to remember names. Whenever I walk past that place I get a charge. It's like when you have that static cling and your T-shirt lifts. There's something about it.


What's it like when you recognize someone, but you can't place the face or the name? Are there people you wish you kept in touch with?For the book, I interviewed like 150 people, because I knew that there was so much exciting shit going on around me, but I was stuck in this fucking booth most of the time. Some of the clubs were just some weird-ass thing where you're in the corner, and you can't even really see past there. That night Biggie came in the club, I could feel the energy, because it's almost like the whispers would just become deafening. And then I was straining my neck trying to fucking see where he is. Frank, who was at the door, [told] me this insane story that Biggie rolled up with 50 dudes, and they're holding all sorts of stuff. He's like [to Biggie's crew] “Put that in the car” — guns, swords, whatever the fuck. But Biggie was just so cool.

	He knew that he wasn't gonna get 50 of his boys in right away, but he stood there for like an hour with a big wad of cash he'd give Frank every five minutes to let a guy in. He waited till his entire crew was in. I wanted to paint that scene as vividly as possible. That meant talking to whoever was at the club that night. So I did reconnect with a lot of people from that era while writing the book, and it was nice. But yes, there's people that I walk past on the street and I'm like, “I remember that person, or do I even know them? Do I just remember that they were dancing there all the time?” It's a bit of a ghost story. 

	











One of the standout scenes in Night People is when you dropped “Hypnotize” for the first time in a club. What was that moment like? It was so crazy. Part of the reason I think that I wrote the book was because kids kept coming to me like, “You were in New York in the Nineties?” This was maybe five to seven years ago, before Tyler, [the Creator] and a lot of people paid homage in their own ways. But I was just like, “Why are these kids obsessed with the Nineties?” I was in the Nineties, and we thought the Eighties sounded so cool. The Nineties didn't even sound that great. But then I understand why it's fascinating, why it's important, in hindsight, because it was this era in New York of Wu Tang, Biggie, [A] Tribe [Called Quest], Lil' Kim. Even Missy [Elliott] and Timbaland, who were from Virginia, Pharrell and Chad [Hugo], they were all in the clubs and they were coming to New York to make records — oh, and this guy Jay-Z. New York was the epicenter at that moment. It was a really exciting place to be. Biggie would be in the club sometimes because I was playing. It was at that same party on Canal Street. There was a promotion guy from Bad Boy Records. Because I had the hot party on Tuesday, he came through with this acetate — which is a straight-from-the-factory piece of vinyl that could only be played 10 times and fucking self-destructs or something. He was like, “I got the new Biggie. You can't keep it, but I can let you play it right now, and then I have to take it to [Funkmaster] Flex.” I put it on, heard a tiny bit of it in the headphones, and then just dropped it. The whole club was just like it had been hit by a meteor. There was something so sacred and special about this thing. It was maybe on the radio once, but for the most part, 400 or 500 people are hearing this song all at the same time for the very first time. When it's a fucking incredible song like that, you could feel the molecules in the room change. It was like this fucking 500-person orgasm or something.


What was the catalyst for wanting to do this book in the first place? I was worried that the longer I held on to these stories, the hazier they would get. Blu Jemz — my great friend who passed away four or five years ago, who the book is dedicated to — used to hang and DJ at this place called Le Bain. After he passed away, Le Bain wanted to throw a party. I was gonna DJ that night, and I remember sitting around in my room with all the records around. I'm like, “Why do I even keep these things?” There's something that's still meaningful to me about these old hip-hop 12-inches. They were just instantly conjuring stories.


Early in the book, there's a moment where you mention your first club experience, which was Keith Haring sneaking you and Sean Lennon into Area. There was this really iconic club in downtown New York called Area in the Eighties, and it was where the art world and hip-hop and everything came together. I don't know how much they “snuck us in” — we weren't in his coat, but obviously we're 12 years old and not supposed to be there. Sean's mom, Yoko, was good friends with Keith. I do remember just being in this very dark room, this ashy carpet, crawling around on the floor, running in between grown-ups — just doing shit that we weren't supposed to be doing, but feeling the fun, mischievous energy of what nightclubs do. I wasn't sneaking cocktails and downing them or anything, but it just felt a little electric. 

	











You describe Sean moving away as your first heartbreak, in a really sweet way. What was the significance of being able to share these memories with him?Because the book is really about clubs and stuff, when I was writing I was like, who cares about my fucking childhood? Like, just skip to the club shit. But I realized I had to give a little bit of context, because I grew up in this crazy house. My parents were, God bless them, kind of party animals. I remember being a kid in England and waking up in the middle of the night, and there'd just be 50 grown-ups in the house. Waking up to go to school at seven in the morning, my dad is still up playing chess with fucking Daryl Hall or some shit. When we moved to New York when my parents split, my mom married a musician, my stepdad, Mick [Jones], so kind of the same thing. I realized, I didn't just get this suddenly, this fucking draw to the night by myself. Part of the book being called Night People is exploring that. What makes us all drawn to the night? 


	I used to play music with Sean; he was my best friend growing up. He went to go to this fancy boarding school in Switzerland and I was kind of like, what the fuck do I do now? I'd put together this other band, and we just played high school parties and bars on Bleecker Street. But I wanted to get us this big gig for this thing called the New Music Seminar that used to happen in New York. It was a weeklong showcase where all the big bands would play. I ran up to this guy who threw this big night; he had Arrested Development and all these other people. I was like, “Yo, you should have my band play.” We had the worst band name. It was called the Whole Earth Mamas. And he was like, “What's your band called? Mother Earth Garden Bistro or some shit? No, sorry, you can't play our thing.” And I [said], “What if I get my friend Sean?” “Sean who?” I was like, “Sean Lennon.” So he came up, but actually the gig was a bit of a disaster. I always felt bad because I sold out my friend to get this gig and whatever else happened. I realized I never told Sean this story. He was like, “I don't remember if you really told me, but it's vaguely familiar, and I love you. It's so obvious why we're friends.” So Sean forgave me. 


When New York Magazine put you on its cover in 2000 and called you “The King of Spin,” the profile mentioned a moment where Sean is telling this story about you both hanging out with Michael Jackson. The way that he tells it is so different from the way that you tell it in Night People.  Really? What does Sean say?

	











He's like, “He was in town during the Bad tour, and we got him to record this melody. We turned it into this song, and we showed it to Roberta Flack.” It was this whole thing, and you're like, “Michael Jackson wanted to throw wet tissue at the walls.” He did. Michael Jackson was friendly with Sean, because Sean was Sean Lennon. He was so sharp and witty. He had this magnetism. People were drawn to him, and he had all these cool friends. I remember Steve Jobs would come over to the house and be like, “I have to show Sean this new computer that I designed.”


	Michael Jackson was over during the Bad tour, slept over at Sean's, and he was running up and down the hallway at the Dakota. He just wanted to throw soggies out the window. Soggies are when you take a giant mound of wet toilet paper and then just chuck. Sean lived on the seventh floor. He wasn't chucking [them] at people, but it was hitting the street and sounding like bombs were going off. In my mind, I was like, “This is all really fun, but I just need to get a hit song out of Michael Jackson. That's all I care about. I was already, I guess, at that age more producer-minded.” I remember me and Sean being like, “Michael, Michael, sing us a bass line!” I'll never forget, he did the whole thing, like the hand out with the snap, and started to sing this bass line. That's how he wrote music. He usually didn't write stuff down. He would have somebody come and he'd sing them all the parts, at least that's what I heard. We went back to my studio the next day — my stepdad had his home studio — and we made this song. It was pretty much just seven minutes of [Michael singing the bass line]. Thinking about it now and while I was writing the book, I was like, “Oh, he just kind of gave us some ‘Smooth Criminal' leftover.” But whatever, it's still a bass line from Michael Jackson. We put some horns on it, some sample Eighties horns. That night, we went to the Michael show. And because Sean also lived in the same building with Roberta Flack, she took us to the show. I know these stories sound so fucking crazy. Sean was like, “Roberta, listen to this song that we made! Michael gave us this bass line!” After the third minute, she's just like, “I mean, it's the same thing for a while, but James Brown did that. So you never know!” She was just trying to be friendly. And I think after like one more minute, she [hit] eject.


There are definitely certain moments throughout the book where it sounds like a Mad Libs, where you're just filling in the craziest name in the most ridiculous scenario. I didn't even tell anyone at school the night that we hung out with Michael, because even I knew, at 13, at some level, that kids are just gonna fucking hate me. Even the fact that when the book started, Q-Tip is this hero, and DJ Premier is his hero, and I maybe brush shoulders with them in a record store or something. But they're just these gods. Then somehow, by the end of the Nineties in the book, Q-Tip and I are friends and DJ'ing together. And DJ Premier, my producer hero, comes in the booth while I'm playing this song — the first record I produced, Nikka Costa — and he was like, “What is this?” I really thought he was coming in to be like, “Who made this? Who stole my whole style? What is this fucking shit?” Because he was so influential to me, in my mind, it sounded like a disciple of his. And he's like, “This shit is hard.” For three minutes he was bobbing his head. To even have those experiences that I had, even at that age, is really, I understand it's very lucky.

	











You mention feeling like the elder people within this scene thought that you hadn't paid your dues because your rise happened so quickly. But then you get a moment where Kid Capri is DJ'ing, and they want to take him off so you can get back on. What was that dichotomy like? I started around 18, playing five nights a week and just being so devoted to it and ambitious. By the time I was 21 or 22, Puffy had completely changed the face of New York. There was no way not to talk about it, even with everything going on. To try and just pretend that that didn't exist and Puffy didn't have something to do with how New York changed at times, and even how it helped my career, would have been insincere, even though I didn't have a lot of personal interaction with him. I was hired by his guys, and as long as he was dancing, I knew I was good. [Ronson opened for Kid Capri at Sean “Diddy” Combs' 29th birthday party at the former Manhattan's Merchants Exchange.]


	There was this moment that happened in New York, Jay-Z and Damon Dash just coming in. All these clubs downtown that were these kind of exclusive, boring, model-type hang spots just suddenly were on fire and so many hip-hop parties. I was there at that moment. The biggest DJ before my era was Stretch Armstrong, and then after me, there was this incredible DJ that a lot of people know, DJ AM. There was just this little moment in 1997 to 2001 or whatever the fuck. This was my zone. It was amazing to be playing sets with Grandmaster Flash and Funkmaster Flex and DJ Enuff and Kid Capri — legends, you know. I kind of forgot all about it, really, because I've done a lot of other shit since then. I've drank a lot, and I did drugs and my brain is a cloudy mess at times. But to go back and relive that thing and be like, “Oh, that was fucking cool.”


What was the process of going back and putting yourself into that headspace of these heavier moments? There's one scene where you're 20 and you think you're having a stroke. There's a lot of memories that I remember quite well. There's some that are a little more hazy. Luckily, all the ones where you think you're about to die stay in your head a little bit more. I would have this thing where I was so ambitious, I could keep all my partying under control to some extent. I never was fucked up at the gigs. I cared too much about it. But four o'clock, lights on, I was off to the after hours to fucking — not every night — but definitely get fucked up and party. I started to have these weird, insane anxiety attacks. Especially because of family history and stuff like that, I'd do drugs but then instantly have this weird guilt and shame and anxiety around it. I remember one night, some friends had drugs, and we all did it. I thought I was, 30 seconds later, having a heart attack. I found out the next day that it was talcum powder. 

	











	I was clearly aware that this was psychosomatic. I didn't set out to make the book that personal. When I started, I was like, this is just a DJ book and it's gonna be about this time. Then I was like, I can't call this book Night People and talk about all the shit that makes us want to go out at night — not everyone was going out to get fucked up. People were going out to commune and be around other people. Some people just loved the music. They wanted to dance. But there were a lot of us who were going out because we were broken. Night gave some people an extra coat of armor, or swag, or whatever you want to call it. If your life was kind of fucked up, you could leave all your daytime shit behind and go out at night. I try to say in the book, there's people who enjoy a night out, and then there's night people. There's the balance. But for the people that I knew that really became my crew and my family at that time, we were all lovingly sort of derelict and a little cracked in our own ways.


There's a lot of grief attached to that, as well. Before you decided to put all of this in a book, how often were you sitting around and catching up with people and telling these stories? Because each chapter is a different era, different people, I remember being like, “Oh, I'm gonna call [this person] when I get to that chapter.” And two or three people that I was really close to in that time passed away while writing the book. The book is dedicated to AM and Blu Jemz, who was the best night person I ever knew. He had a label called Night People, and the spirit of him is in this book. Fatman Scoop, DJ Neva, there's lesser-known DJs like my friend Paul Nice, Mister Cee — all these people that come in and out of the book were alive when I started it. There's something obviously sad about it. Hopefully, there's a way that they're celebrated and remembered through their music and what they did and maybe this book. 


There's one scene in the book where you throw a track on so that you can go see Missy Elliott and Timbaland with Aaliyah for a moment and then run back. Take me back to that and thinking, “Do I risk messing up the flow of this crowd just to have this moment?”When I met Aaliyah for the first time on a Tommy Hilfiger shoot, she had already made “One in a Million,” and it was already one of my favorite records. I remember just being like, “Holy shit, I'm not even really gonna look at her.” Even for the people that I had been around, she felt like another world. It wasn't someone I knew from the clubs around New York that happened to be famous. She was just so sweet and just radiated this amazing [energy]. 

	











	We started talking and a little bit later, we did the pictures. It's that one where she's behind the booth. We took a lunch break, and she came over and she wanted to fuck around with the turntables. They were still hooked up, so she was scratching. I think there's a picture of it that's an outtake. I just remember being like, “I'm gonna use this moment to ask her a thousand questions about Missy and Timbaland.” I had started to make beats and stuff. I had no idea what I was doing, but they were like heroes. She was just like, “They're just cool,” as if she's talking about her favorite aunt and uncle or some shit, not amazing alien geniuses. 


	So one time, a year later — I got to be friends with Aaliyah, we hung out on other occasions — I was DJ'ing this party at the Manhattan Ballroom. I was on the balcony, and I see these two towering dudes coming towards me with this little person in the middle. And I was like, “Oh, my God, it's Aaliyah.” I was like, “What are you doing here?” She's like, “Oh, I'm going up to the studio.” The studio that Missy and Timbland worked at that time was in Manhattan Center in that building. She was like, “Come upstairs!” I was looking down at 300 people dancing on the floor at some party I've been paid to play, not just go take a 20-minute bathroom break to go meet some famous people. And I was like, “I'd love to, I can't.” She walks away, and she turns back and gives me this one last look like, “What are you doing?” 


	So I'd put the longest record that I had on. I think it was Donna Summer or Diana Ross, something. I was like, “Fuck it. I don't know if it's gonna be long enough, but I'm not missing this opportunity.” I ran up and she took me in, just really briefly. It was my first time in a really big, fancy recording studio like that, like a modern one, other than maybe being with my stepdad. Timbaland was on a StarTech, and there was a beat playing super loud. Missy was on the couch, and Aaliyah just went and sat next to her. She started singing something in her ear, whatever the melody was. And then I was just like, this is fucking crazy. I hung for three minutes and ran back downstairs. I got back in time. No one knew. It is crazy to think that these people who feel so present — Aaliyah, you walk around New York and there's no way you're gonna make it to Fifth Avenue without seeing her on a T-shirt, and her music has just never been more relevant. Of course, we all wish she was here. It's amazing to think what she would still be doing if she was, but because of her music and how larger than life her legacy has been, it's like she also does still feel here.


You appeared in Aaliyah's “More Than a Woman” video. What do you remember about shooting it?I just remember I'm wearing these really kind of cheesy tinted shades, but that I thought looked so cool at the time. I remember Aaliyah calling me and being like, “I want you to come be in the video.” I just remember being like, “I really don't want to fly out to L.A. for the day, but it would be nice to see her. Fuck it. Why not?” I think it was maybe a week or two later that the plane crashed. I'm obviously so grateful that I did, because that was the last time that we got to hang out.

	











What was it like revisiting the music from that time?Music was almost my best friend and tool creating this. Some of these things are from 30 years ago. Some of the memories are hazy, but music just does something to your body. When I was trying to was trying to remember things, I'd listen to a certain song, a Tribe song, or Busta song, and it was instantly like, “Oh, right, it was in that room, and there was this guy down there smoking a cigarette looking up at me when I dropped the record, and then he dropped his drink because he put his hands in the air.” The records were so important. I didn't put the celebrities or the famous people stories in as a hook to draw people in. It was more just like, those are things that happened on that night. But the music was the most important thing. 


	With this book, there'll be people who will pick it up and be like, “Where's Amy? Where's Gaga? Where's Bruno? What is this fucking Mark Ronson book?” It's obviously about a time before I was really successful in some ways, or certainly before I had any celebrity — I mean, at least outside of a little circle of New York. I really wanted it to be about the music. I remember some DJ said something funny that was like,  “When I try to talk to my grandmother about DJ'ing, all she understands is a wedding DJ or Calvin Harris.” But there's also this thing in between of what I was back then, which was a gigging DJ, going to work playing shit because you love music, and you need the check, and you're dealing with all the hassles and fucking cokehead club owners and lunatic drunk people making requests. But you just do it because you love it. And then some nights you go home having the best energy. Some nights you go home as lonely as you could ever feel. And just to get across that feeling of being a DJ, the music side was important to at least try and paint as well as I could.

How much were you thinking about legacy while writing, or your oldest daughter and reading these stories?I didn't really think about that till I was nearly done, and then I was like, “God, is this something that I would want her to read?” I'm sure for her teenage years, she'll just be like, “My dad's lame, I'm not gonna listen to or read anything he did.” But I don't know. She's just obsessed with music now. She has a little record player with her 45s that she listens to. She's so into putting her records on, and she's transfixed by the whole thing. But, yeah, definitely not trying to breed a whole crew of DJs.

The star is teaming up with Paul Thomas Anderson for the first time in 'One Battle After Another,' almost 30 years after turning down 'Boogie Nights.'


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Leonardo DiCaprio has collaborated with some of the most acclaimed filmmakers of the modern era — and that's not by coincidence. 


	The star — who is teaming up with Paul Thomas Anderson for the first time as the lead of thriller One Battle After Another — told The Hollywood Reporter at the film's Los Angeles premiere on Monday that he credits working with top directors to “luck, and I guess the perseverance of just letting them know that you want to work with them, some day when the time is right.




	“That's what I've been doing; that's how I met Marty [Scorsese] when I was young, I just let him know that if he's ready, I'm ready,” DiCaprio continued. “I really love film as an art form; I love watching old movies, I'm a cinephile, and it's like those rare films rise to the top. There's certain filmmakers that have a multitude of those films — Paul is one of them, Quentin [Tarantino] is one of them, Marty's one of them. So I just let them know I'm ready and I'm game if they are.”

	Working with Anderson has been decades in the making, after DiCaprio famously turned down 1997's Boogie Nights because he was already signed on to star in Titanic. The actor recently called passing on the film his “biggest regret,” but almost 30 years later the two finally got around to collaborating. 


	“Any time that he asks, you work with P.T.A. This guy is like one of the great visionary filmmakers of my generation,” DiCaprio raved. “His films, I'm still intrigued by to this day; I still talk about The Master, Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia — these films that are going to last for generations to come so you jump at an opportunity to work with Paul.”

One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio as a washed-up revolutionary living off the grid who must spring into action when his daughter goes missing, with the help of his fellow former radicals. It's an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's anarchic 1990 novel Vineland and also stars Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti.  Hall — who is also neighbors with Anderson — said getting a call from the filmmaker, “was a dream, he's one of my favorite directors. It's nice enough when you're a big fan of someone and you meet them and they're nice, that's already a win. But then to be able to actually experience his process, work with him and be a part of something that's a part of his legacy is wonderful.”


One Battle After Another hits theaters Sept. 26.

The star is teaming up with Paul Thomas Anderson for the first time in 'One Battle After Another,' almost 30 years after turning down 'Boogie Nights.'


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Leonardo DiCaprio has collaborated with some of the most acclaimed filmmakers of the modern era — and that's not by coincidence. 


	The star — who is teaming up with Paul Thomas Anderson for the first time as the lead of thriller One Battle After Another — told The Hollywood Reporter at the film's Los Angeles premiere on Monday that he credits working with top directors to “luck, and I guess the perseverance of just letting them know that you want to work with them, some day when the time is right.




	“That's what I've been doing; that's how I met Marty [Scorsese] when I was young, I just let him know that if he's ready, I'm ready,” DiCaprio continued. “I really love film as an art form; I love watching old movies, I'm a cinephile, and it's like those rare films rise to the top. There's certain filmmakers that have a multitude of those films — Paul is one of them, Quentin [Tarantino] is one of them, Marty's one of them. So I just let them know I'm ready and I'm game if they are.”

	Working with Anderson has been decades in the making, after DiCaprio famously turned down 1997's Boogie Nights because he was already signed on to star in Titanic. The actor recently called passing on the film his “biggest regret,” but almost 30 years later the two finally got around to collaborating. 


	“Any time that he asks, you work with P.T.A. This guy is like one of the great visionary filmmakers of my generation,” DiCaprio raved. “His films, I'm still intrigued by to this day; I still talk about The Master, Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Magnolia — these films that are going to last for generations to come so you jump at an opportunity to work with Paul.”

One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio as a washed-up revolutionary living off the grid who must spring into action when his daughter goes missing, with the help of his fellow former radicals. It's an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's anarchic 1990 novel Vineland and also stars Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti.  Hall — who is also neighbors with Anderson — said getting a call from the filmmaker, “was a dream, he's one of my favorite directors. It's nice enough when you're a big fan of someone and you meet them and they're nice, that's already a win. But then to be able to actually experience his process, work with him and be a part of something that's a part of his legacy is wonderful.”


One Battle After Another hits theaters Sept. 26.

A few years ago, the idea of Bob Odenkirk in an action role was novel. Now there are enough of them to get them mixed up. Part of the problem is that “Normal” sounds a lot like 2021's “Nobody,” the movie that launched this latest chapter in Odenkirk's career; both evoke the sense of averageness that's at the core of the “Better Call Saul” actor's persona in these films, which play on the contrast between their mild-mannered protagonists and their hyperviolent actions.

Further confusing things is the fact that “Normal” shares a screenwriter with both “Nobody” and “Nobody 2.” Derek Kolstad also wrote the first three films in the “John Wick” series, another action franchise predicated on what happens when a seemingly unassuming man is pushed to his limit. The difference there is that Keanu Reeves is unflappable, while Odenkirk has a sputtering quality to him that adds a comedic layer to his bloody lash-outs.

Kolstad's script for “Normal” emphasizes the comedy, paying both implicit and explicit homage to Joel and Ethan Coen's “Fargo” in setting up its vision of a Minnesota town that's managed to thrive while its neighbors are rusting away. “Normal” has fun with the trappings of wholesome small-town Americana, casting Henry Winkler as the gladhanding mayor and establishing locations like a knitting-supply shop and a soda fountain in Normal, Minnesota (population 1,890). Will those same places later serve as ironic backdrops for bloody shootouts? Do moose shit on icy roads? 

 










Odenkirk stars as the mononymous Ulysses, provisional sheriff of Normal, a self-proclaimed “midwife with a gun” who's there to rubber stamp paperwork until his six-week contract is up and he can move on to the next town in need of a calming force during a period of change. Ulysses' nomadic lifestyle is explained with a quintessential sad-middle-aged-man divorce backstory, overlaid with a politically charged bit of lore about Ulysses' guilt over not believing a woman who came to him to report a sexual assault at his last job. 

Those both come back around, as does another subplot about Alex (Jess McLeod), the estranged child of the recently deceased former sheriff who was not invited to the funeral, but comes home anyway. That particular storyline feels very current, touching on issues surrounding trans people, military service, and armed self-defense. “Normal” is not overly preachy on this front, perhaps because there's no time to pause for a lecture once the action begins. 

No one would hear it over the explosions, anyway. Director Ben Wheatley — who, frankly, has had an off few years — returns to the bullet-crazed mode of his 2016 film “Free Fire” here, spraying the screen with automatic weapons until most of the town is lying dead on the sidewalk. Wheatley mixes the constant sounds of gunfire and dynamite extremely loud in the mix, accentuating their impact by having bodies fly across rooms and ricochet off of walls after being blasted with ammunition the length and thickness of a soda can. The sound does much of the work in action sequences obscured by blinding snowstorms and flashing emergency lights, punctuated by creative acts of accidental self-harm that save our protagonists from certain death more than once. 

 










The jokes continue once “Normal” shifts from intermittently successful small-town quirk to nonstop heavy artillery. Some of these are payoff for setups that were established before townsfolk started pinging around Main Street like pinballs. Others are new, building on a genuinely fresh and funny revelation that explains not only a cold open involving yakuza gangsters half a world away in Osaka, but also why this quaint town is sitting on a stash of weaponry big enough to overthrow the governments of several small nations. 

There's a twisted wit to the setup here, as Kolstad takes real trends in American life — economic stagnation, rising tribalism, gun fetishism — and follows them to their corrupt, violent end points. These people have lost their minds in recognizable, if extreme, ways: The town bar and grill is lined with what looks like hundreds of guns, covering every inch of available space. When Ulysses asks if they're loaded, the server replies with a big, beaming smile: “It wouldn't be much fun if they weren't.” She then recommends the pie. 

“Normal's” tendency not to overplay its satire works in its favor, which makes the obviousness of some of the more earnest dialogue very puzzling. It's not clear if it's meant to be a parody of action-hero clichés when Odenkirk juts out his jaw and says he's “tired of running away” before the film's last stand, or if he's just a funny guy doing his best with some very corny dialogue. “Normal” is a mixed bag in this way, at least as far as comedy goes. The action is very consistent, in that it's consistently pummeling.

 










“Normal” is breathlessly paced, at least once the shooting starts. Alliances shift, quips fly like the ever-present bullets, and if there is a pause, it's done for comedic effect. This is entertaining, but also has a numbing effect: When the climactic fight arrives, it doesn't feel any different from the dozen violent set pieces that came before it, and it too passes so quickly that we don't quite realize that it's over until the credits begin to roll. Like a firecracker with a long fuse, “Normal” builds up, burns fast, makes a big noise, and then it's gone. 

“Normal” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

After several stressful years of health challenges, including a diagnosis of Hashimoto's Disease, longtime Hallmark star Taylor Cole knew she needed a reset in early 2023. So she and her best friend, Nicole Marsel, headed to The Farm — a 200-acre retreat center near Nashville — for a nurturing week of good food, support, intentional movement, and reflection.

Cole never imagined then that two-and-a-half years later, she'd find herself back at The Farm for another much-needed week of restoration, this time by herself. When Cole returned in June 2025, she was emotionally and physically drained — grieving Marsel's death six months earlier from breast cancer and exhausted after five rounds of IVF, hoping to start a family with her husband of five years. 

Fortunately, the week that the “Double Scoop” star spent at The Farm in June provided just what she needed to move forward, she shared on social media, noting that miraculously, “I felt trust in myself again. 💞” 

The only issue? The Farm, Cole learned, was struggling to stay open. So, like a scene in a Hallmark movie, Cole turned to her big-hearted colleagues to team up and show up, with hopes of helping the small business thrive.

A post shared by The Farm (@thefarm_tn)

The Farm's original owner had to close in 2024, according to Variety. But one of its biggest fans, Lizzie Tucker, couldn't bear to see guests from near and far lose access to the healing space, so she reopened it herself in April 2025, per Nashville Voyager. 

In a statement to Variety, Tucker said, “I reopened it for everyone who's ever needed a place to feel good again. Our goal is to help people reconnect with their strength, their joy, and their sense of self.” 

But the rustic and charming property, where locals can spend the day and out-of-towners can choose from all-inclusive overnight packages, needs help drawing guests back in and spreading the word that it's open again, with many new activities and spa options available. 

To help generate excitement about The Farm, Cole has rallied a big group of Hallmark stars who've each agreed to spend time at the retreat between now and the end of 2025. They include Erin Cahill, Nikki DeLoach, Kristoffer Polaha, her recent “Double Scoop” co-star Ryan McPartlin, Andrew Walker, John Brotherton, Brooke D'Orsay, Colin Egglesfield, Stephen Huszar, Autumn Reeser, and Benjamin Ayres.

Cole told EntertainmentNow that some stars will announce the specific dates they'll be at The Farm, hoping to attract fans to visit too, while others plan to show up unannounced. That means anyone who books time at The Farm for the remainder of 2025 could very well wind up taking a yoga class or having a meal next to one of their favorite Hallmark stars. 

On September 8, Cahill shared via Instagram that she'd already spent several days there, thanking Cole for trying to save the retreat, calling it “absolutely incredible.” Cahill added, “I had never been to a wellness retreat before and within just a few short days it became one of my favorite places.”

Cole's deep desire to save The Farm comes from experiencing it as a place of healing and hope in times when she's been navigating grief and overwhelm. In order to explain how sacred the place feels to her, she knew she also needed to share why. Talking about her own hardships publicly is something she's slowly and bravely begun to do. 

The actress told EntertainmentNow that agreeing to film her 2022 Hallmark movie “Pumpkin Everything” began a shift for her; she had hesitated to sign on at first because it was about a woman who has to make the hard decision to move her beloved grandpa into a memory care center. 

Cole recalled, “I was just like, ‘I want to make people laugh. I want to make people happy. I want to make people fall in love and all of the warm and fuzzy feelings.' But I had a dear friend, Donna — she just turned 80 this year — and she was like, ‘This is what people are going through, and this is goingto help people, and you don't have any idea how much you're going to touch people's heartswith this story.'”

“And that flipped everything for me,” Cole continued. “And I was like, ‘Wow, I didn't think about itlike that. These people will feel less alone because they're going through it. And I thought I wasjust an escape from what their reality was, but if I'm modeling their reality, then they feel less alone as well.”

Cole's hoping that, just like in many of their movies, the Hallmark stars she's recruited to help bring attention and new faces to The Farm will see their efforts make a powerful impact. 

“I just feel like the world needs as much good news as possible right now,” she told EntertainmentNow, “and this is a feel good story with a potential happy ending.”

Just last month, the Mountain Goats announced a 20th-anniversary reissue of their 2005 LP The Sunset Tree. Now, they're back with the news of their next album. Through This Fire Across From Peter Balkan is out November 7 via the band's own label, Cadmean Dawn. Listen to lead single “Armies of the Lord,” which features backing vocals from Lin-Manuel Miranda, below.

John Darnielle explained the new album's concept in a press statement: “There were 16 men on a fishing boat, but only three survived the storm, and one of those went missing, and is presumed dead. That leaves me and Peter Balkan, whose health is failing as his apocalyptic visions dissipate in the spray at the shore.”

Through This Fire Across From Peter Balkan follows 2023's Jenny From Thebes. The Replacements' Tommy Stinson and harpist Mikaela Davis make guest appearances, alongside Miranda and bassist, Cameron Ralston, who joined the band following the departure of longtime bassist and backup vocalist Peter Hughes last year. The Mountain Goats will kick off a North American tour later this month.

From Kind of Blue to Bitches Brew, a revolutionary catalog enters a new chapter.

Industry News Editor


Reservoir Media has acquired the publishing catalog of iconic jazz trumpeter and composer Miles Davis, marking a significant expansion of its portfolio ahead of Davis' centennial in 2026. The deal also includes a partnership with the Miles Davis Estate to explore opportunities involving Davis' name and likeness. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


	The estate, managed by Davis' daughter Cheryl, son Erin, nephew Vincent Wilburn Jr., general manager Darryl Porter, and attorney Jeff Biederman, will collaborate with Reservoir on a wide-ranging celebration of Davis' 100th birthday.


	“We are so pleased to begin this new chapter of Miles' legacy,” said Erin Davis, while Wilburn Jr. commented that “this partnership gives us the chance to elevate his legacy in new ways, and to ensure that his influence continues to inspire.”

	Planned centennial activations include a feature film titled Miles & Juliette, chronicling Davis' romance with Juliette Greco, developed with River Road Entertainment and Mick Jagger's Jagged Films. Additionally, a live international symphonic show will pair Davis' music with original orchestrations and archival footage, and finally the M.E.B. (formerly Miles Electric Band) will embark on an international tour, including a run at SFJazz in March. These events build on the estate's recent successes, such as the Emmy-winning documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool and the traveling exhibition We Want Miles.


	One of the most influential musicians of any genre of any time, Davis' dizzying career spanned five decades, during which he released over 60 studio albums and collaborated with numerous fellow icons, including John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Wayne Shorter. The Alton, Illinois native was known for constantly reinventing his sound and many of his landmark albums represent pristine encapsulations of several jazz styles, including cool jazz (Birth of the Cool, 1957), modal jazz (Kind of Blue, 1959), third stream (Sketches of Spain, 1959), post-bop (Miles Smiles, 1967) and fusion (Bitches Brew, 1970).


Kind of Blue, recorded with saxophonists Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianist Evans, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, is considered his crowning achievement and remains the best-selling jazz album of all time, even ranking No. 12 on Rolling Stone's list of “The Greatest Albums of All Time.”


	Reservoir founder and CEO Golnar Khosrowshahi said, “Miles Davis is one of the most influential musicians of all time, and it is an incredible honor that his catalog has found a home at Reservoir.” She added, “This moment is also a recognition of Reservoir's proven commitment and capability to preserve legacies and reignite discovery of legendary artists on modern platforms, like streaming and social media. As we head into his centennial year, we look forward to showcasing Miles' brilliance to new audiences, ensuring his music continues to be heard and celebrated worldwide.”


	Reservoir Media's acquisition aligns with its broader growth strategy. In its most recent quarterly earnings, Reservoir reported an 8% revenue increase to $37.2 million, driven by a 4% rise in publishing revenue and a 48% surge in sync revenue. The company also partnered with Fool's Gold Records to acquire master rights and manage distribution, and invested in London-based immersive entertainment firm Lightroom, which creates experiences around music IP.

Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson star as the most unlikely Neil Diamond tribute act in the new trailer for the upcoming biopic, Song Sung Blue. 


	The film tells the story of Mike and Claire Sardina, a Milwaukee couple who fronted a tribute act called Lighting and Thunder, in which they sang songs by Diamond and Patsy Cline (the latter being Claire's specialty). Filmmaker Greg Kohs chronicled the Sardinas' story in his 2008 documentary Song Sung Blue, while the upcoming scripted movie was adapted by Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow, Dolemite Is My Name). 


	The new Song Sung Blue trailer starts with all the pep and energy of a feel-good music film as Mike (Jackman) and Claire (Hudson) bond over their desire to entertain people. There's a short clip of the duo performing Diamond's “Cherry, Cherry” together, as well as a shot of their first kiss as the two bandmates begin to fall in love.

	The trailer does take a heavy turn halfway through, as Mike and Claire confront hard financial realties, as well as the lingering repercussions of Mike's time as a soldier in the Vietnam War. Still, there's a resounding end to the clip, set — of course — to “Sweet Caroline,” that features a snippet of Mike's big heart-on-sleeve speech to Claire: “I can't thank Neil, because every ‘thank you' I got belongs to you, doll. You're my August night, you're my September morn, you're my cracklin' Rosie.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Joining with Jackman and Hudson, Song Sung Blue boasts a stacked cast that also includes Michael Imperioli, King Princess (who performed with Jackman at Radio City Music Hall earlier this year), Ella Anderson, Mustafa Shakir, Hudson Hensley, Fisher Stevens, and Jim Belushi. The film is to arrive in theaters on Dec. 25.

Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker has landed his next Netflix project.


	Brooker is behind an untitled four-part detective series starring House of the Dragon lead Paddy Considine, Game of Thrones star Lena Headey and Georgina Campbell, who worked with Brooker on Black Mirror's “Hang the DJ” episode.


	The show's logline calls it a “profoundly serious, stunningly original crime thriller in which a tormented detective from the Northern city of Bleakford ventures down to London on a mission to catch a ritualistic serial killer before they run out of people to kill. Contains blood and frowning.”

					'Normal' Review: Bob Odenkirk Back In Action Again In Ben Wheatley's Wildly Violent Black Comedy Western - Toronto Film Festival		
			








	The term “profoundly serious” is clearly being used tongue in cheek and Brooker's quote about the show reads: “I'm beyond thrilled to be saying these words for the press release. I've dreamt of providing a quote ever since I was a young foetus, and now here I am doing it. I'd pinch myself, but like all of us, I'm terrified that if I do that, I might wake up and discover 2025 has all been a magical dream. Please watch my show. I am begging you.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	No more plot details were forthcoming. Brooker previously made 2011's A Touch of Cloth for Sky,  a spoof British cop drama starring John Hannah and Suranne Jones.


	Brooker created the untitled detective series and has written with Ben Caudell, Jason Hazeley, Emer Kenny, Daniel Maier and Joel Morris, with additional material by Victoria Asare Archer. Brooker is also executive producing alongside Black Mirror EPs Annabel Jones and Jessica Rhoades. Mark Kinsella is co-EP, Richard Webb is producer and Al Campbell is directing.

	











	The show will be produced by Netflix, a spokesman for the streamer said, rather than a specific British production company. Several weeks back, we revealed Brooker and Jones had left their Netflix-owned production company Broke & Bones after five years. Deadline first revealed the $100M agreement in 2020, which we noted at the time was structured over five years.


Black Mirror Season 7 was Brooker's previous Netflix project and launched in April 2025. Episodes featured the likes of Rashida Jones, Issa Rae and Paul Giamatti. No word yet on Season 8.

	Everybody knows one, and every garden grows one.


	We have the first trailer for Song Sung Blue, starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson in the true-life tale of two down-on-their-luck musicians who form a joyous Neil Diamond tribute band that changes their lives. Have a look above.


	“I'm not a songwriter, I'm not a sex symbol — I just want to entertain people,” Jackman's Mike Sardina tells Hudson's Claire Stengl. “I don't wanna be a hairdresser,” she replies. “I wanna sing, I wanna dance, I wanna garden, I want a cat.” 


	Fast-forward a bit, and Mike holds a Moods LP cover next to his face and asks, “What do you think?” Claire says, “You don't want to be a Neil Diamond impersonator — you want to be a Neil Diamond interpreter.” Says he: “I was looking for the right way to say it, and you just came right out and said it.”

	Thus is born Lightning & Thunder, the tribute band. (Don't call them a “cover band”; that's like saying you were slam dancing, not moshing.) Romance blooms, backstories are told, and leafblowers are deployed as hair-ripplers. And … “Sweet Caroline” and the “BAH-bah-bahhhhhs,” etc.


	Michael Imperioli, Ella Anderson, King Princess, Mustafa Shakir, Hudson Hensley co-star, with Fisher Stevens and Jim Belushi also appearing in the film from writer-director Craig Brewer (Coming 2 America, Dolemite Is My Name). He also produces alongside John Davis and John Fox.


	Focus Features brings the musical journey in theaters on Christmas Day. Back in April, Hudson teased the movie's release date on Instagram, writing in part: “Loved every second making this beautiful film, working with the most lovely work husband you could ask for, @thehughjackman, singing the iconic songs of Neil Diamond.”

Actually looks like it may be fun!

Wonder what Diamond thinks if this.
Am a big fan of Neil and I guess am glad to see him still appreciated.
Had an original pressing of his Brother Loves Traveling Salvation Show album without Sweet Caroline but played it to death so got the other one later after Sweet Caroline was added.

Good times never seemed so good in the first trailer for “Song Sung Blue,” Craig Brewer‘s new inspiring romance drama starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson as members of a Neil Diamond tribute band who fall in love. Best of all — other than Jackman's long jet-black hair in tribute to Diamond — it's based on a true story.

Brewer has charmed audiences in recent years with “Dolemite Is My Name” and “Coming 2 America,” though his first big breakout hit was the 2005 Oscar-winner “Hustle & Flow.” Stories about big personalities, often set in the world of entertainment, are his specialty, and he both writes and directs “Song Sung Blue.” The Focus Features release seems a prime candidate to be a crowdpleaser, and possible awards contender, when it releases December 25.

What's especially exciting about “Song Sung Blue” is that it's a jukebox musical, playing many of the best hits from Diamond's extraordinary catalogue of songs, but it also tells an original story. After all, Diamond fans already got a straightforward biopic of the singer-songwriter from the Broadway (and national touring) stage production of “A Beautiful Noise.” This goes in a different direction, to show how the power of an artist's songbook can add to the lives of two people who admire it deeply. Think kind of like Gurinder Chadha's tribute to Bruce Springsteen fandom, “Blinded by the Light.”

 










It's also a welcome opportunity to hear Jackman sing onscreen, and bring to bear the showmanship that audiences have enjoyed from him on Broadway (most recently in “The Music Man”) as well as in movies like “The Greatest Showman.” Just don't call Jackman's character “a Neil Diamond impersonator.” As Hudson's character puts it, he's more of a “Neil Diamond interpreter.” They're joined in the cast by Michael Imperioli, Ella Anderson, King Princess,  Mustafa Shakir, and Hudson Hensley, with Fisher Stevens and Jim Belushi.

Hey, if just this description has you singing “play it now! / play it now! / play it now!/ play it now!” like any Diamond fan, well, go ahead, play it now and watch the trailer below.

Focus Features will release “Song Sung Blue” in theaters nationwide on December 25.

Black Screen Office CEO Joan Jenkinson, who spoke with THR at The Hollywood Reporter's Access Canada Summit, is set to unveil an Anti-Black Racism Policy Framework.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	The Canadian media industry has talked big in recent years about boosting Black representation and funded Joan Jenkinson and her Black Screen Office to help dismantle anti-Black racism in the country's screen industries.


	But Jenkinson, CEO of the BSO, now wants to see symbolism and promises replaced by collaborative and sustained policy steps by the Canadian film and television industry to secure real gains towards black equity.




	“It's not about statements, it's about measurable progress,” Jenkinson said ahead of the BSO unveiling an Anti-Black Racism Policy Framework later today at The Hollywood Reporter's Access Canada Summit in Toronto. The BSO and funding agencies have banded together to create a to-do checklist for the industry to practically tackle anti-Black racism in front and behind the camera and elsewhere in the cultural sector.

	Jenkinson recalls in 2021 when the BSO was launched amid an industry reckoning over a lack of diversity and inclusion, and “everybody wanted to talk to me and were throwing money at me.” But she recounts one meeting with a funding agency exec that heartily agreed with all of the BSO initiatives to boost Black representation.


	“At one point, I thought, wait a minute. I asked how does this fit into your organization? How are you going to sell this to your boss? What are your yeses based on?” Jenkinson continued. The exec had no clear answer. 


	“That's when it hit me. Strategies may be made, action plans may happen. Funding can be thrown at me. But unless it has a foundation, this is just going to be a trend or just be thrown off an agenda because something else comes along,” she argues, with the result Black talent continues to be excluded and their careers derailed.

	











	The BSO-led report, two years in the making, goes beyond the domestic film and TV industry to include music, publishing, the performing arts and theater as they sit within the country's cultural industries. The report asks cultural organizations to specifically define anti-Black racism, and not “just copy what's already out there.”


	The report also urges Canadian media to go beyond Black History Month to showcase homegrown Black talent and stories year-round, and to set goals on hiring and promoting black talent in organizations.


	Jenkinson accepts it's poor timing to put new obligation on arts organizations and content funding bodies in Canada during a period of wrenching industry disruption. But she counters: “Equity isn't a burden—it's a growth strategy. When Black talent thrives, audiences grow, programming gets stronger, and the whole sector is more competitive.”


	In a Canadian industry where for years doors were mostly closed to Black talent, and financing that came through when doors opened was meagre, the BSO report urges Black content creators be properly financed to build sustainable careers and businesses.


	“Support the development of parallel Black platforms – broadcaster, YouTube channel, theater company – by black creative entrepreneurs to bypass traditional barriers and foster success on the community's terms and within the community's values,” the report states. In addition, there's a call for Black professionals to get seats in boardrooms, on festival juries and senior leadership teams, to inspire emerging Black talent to pursue their own ambitions and careers in the cultural industries.

	











	The Framework stresses that, without policy actions, strategic plans risk moving in different directions, lose coherence or fall away. “Policy is the grounding that makes actions sustainable,” the report argues. The report sets out 25 adaptable policy strategies to tackle hiring, leadership, authorship, accountability, and representation for Black creators.


	“It is a flexible guide for organizations ready to move from statements of intent to institutional change,” the BSO report adds, rejecting one framework should apply to all organizations. “Each of those entities are different, each of those communities are different,” Jenkinson adds. 


	Across Canada's arts and culture sector, the report points to stark equity gaps. Black professionals hold only 2 percent of cultural board seats, despite making up 4.3 percent of the population.


	In music, 98 percent of Black artists have never applied for financial grants, and nearly 9 in 10 who did were denied, the report states. In Canadian screen industries, less than 3 percent of Black creators occupy top roles such as showrunner or executive producer.


	“Pay gaps, isolation, and discrimination remain common across sectors,” the report claims. Jenkinson rejects the BSO call to action represents activism over incremental policy steps for change. “This isn't politics. It's about relevance. If audiences don't see themselves reflected, institutions risk becoming outdated. Relevance is survival,” she tells THR.

The singer took a break from her Mayhem Ball tour to visit Stephen Colbert on the 10th anniversary of his recently canceled show on Monday night (Sept. 8).

Lady Gaga contains multitudes. After taking home the artist of the year award at Sunday's 2025 MTV VMAs and then sprinting to Madison Square Garden for a Mayhem Ball date that turned into stunning VMA performances of “Abracadabra”” and her latest single, “The Dead Dance,” Gaga popped into The Late Show on Monday night (Sept. 8) to transmogrify one of her Mayhem tracks.

	











	Seated at a piano, Gaga completely re-imagined “Vanish Into You” into a spare, chilling ballad as her accompanists plucked out thrumming notes on their guitar and bass and she gripped the mic, eyes close, pouring her soul into the track's love-drenched lyrics. “High on a hill you call/ Two lovers regret their time/ Once in a blue moon I forget you/ And once in your life you'll be mine,” she sang over the spare backing, which completely stripped away the original song's thumping beat and chilled disco bounce.


	The song written by Gaga along with producer Andrew Watt, Henry Walter and her fiancé, Michael Polansky — and produced by Gaga with Watt and Cirkut — is a plea to be recognized by her lover, with Gaga asking, “Do you see me/ Do you see me now?/ I've been waiting for you crying out/ Do you see me?/Do you see me now?”




			Trending on Billboard		







	As the tempo picked up and she finally laid her hands on the piano, Gaga's voice rose to a crescendo, picking up an added, gritty urgency as she wailed, “In the summertime, we were happy just to be alive/ Can I… I vanish into you?”

	











	Gaga's Mayhem Ball tour will continue on Wednesday night (Sept. 10) with the first of three show at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.


	Watch Gaga perform “Vanish Into You” on The Late Show below.

EXCLUSIVE: Hulu and Freeform have greenlighted That Thrifting Show with Lara Spencer, an unscripted design competition series hosted and executive produced by Lara Spencer. Additionally, Spencer has inked a new multi-year deal with ABC News to continue on Good Morning America, sources tell Deadline.


	In the 12-episode That Thrifting Show, which will debut on Hulu and Freeform in 2026, vintage design expert Spencer presents two designer duos with identical rooms. With limited time and budget, teams must treasure hunt for vintage and thrift store finds to design their way to beautiful, layered, finished rooms. It's style and sustainability in a race against the clock.

	“It is so meaningful to share my childhood love of thrifting and celebrate this new generation's passion for sustainable design,” Spencer said. “As you will see on That Thrifting Show, there are so many incredible treasures out there, just waiting to be reimagined and given a new life. To see the rooms these designers create with their thrifted finds is aspirational and simply amazing.”

	Spencer previously created and hosted HGTV's Daytime Emmy-winning Flea Market Flip and created, executive produced and hosted HGTV's Everything But the House.


That Thrifting Show with Lara Spencer is produced for ABC News Studios by Butternut, a division of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and Envisionary Productions. Spencer serves as executive producer, alongside Courtney White and Cheryl Wayne for Butternut, Jon Rosen for Envisionary Productions, and senior executive producer David Sloan and Melia Patria for ABC News Studios.

	











	At Freeform/Hulu, That Thrifting Show joins an unscripted slate that includes the Project Runway revival.


	ABC News would not comment on the new deal with GMA, which extends Spencer's relationship with the ABC morning show that dates back to 1999 when she first joined as a correspondent. After a break, she returned to GMA in 2011 and three years later was named co-anchor. For the past seven years, Spencer has served as a contributor on GMA while also focusing on producing.

In an excerpt from her new collection of essays, 'Does This Make Me Funny?,' the 37-year-old actress — daughter of David, Shoshanna on 'Girls' — recalls the on-set showrunner freakouts she experienced early in her career. 


							By 

	Zosia Mamet



	“I can't find my scissors so we're gonna have to use a straight razor.”


	It's six in the morning. I'm sitting in a makeup trailer in downtown LA in a parking lot next to the river. I've landed a recurring role on one of the biggest shows currently on television. The kind of show that's a phenomenon, that makes people fall in love with TV as a medium all over again. I never thought I'd get this job. When I went to the audition I honestly thought I was just there for fill. So the fact that I'm here already feels like a mistake.

	I'd woken up at 3:00 a.m. because I was so terrified of sleeping through the alarm I'd set for 4:00 a.m. because my call time was 6:00 a.m. but I wanted to get there at 5:30 just to be safe. They sat me in the hair chair at 5:55, and just as I sat down, the showrunner's assistant came in and began talking to the head of the hair department like I wasn't there. They both looked at my reflection in the mirror as if it were a photograph.

	“I didn't know her hair was that long?” the assistant said. “Me either,” the head hairdresser said.


	My hair had always been this long. My hair had never not been this long. In my audition, which the showrunner had attended, in all my fitting photos, in my entire nineteen years of life that I had lived up until now, my hair had always been this long. But they seemed to be upset with me inadvertently for not telling them that my hair was this long. It was below my boobs at this point and, as previously men‑ tioned, had been ever since they met me.

	











	They continued to stare at me in the mirror as the assistant took a photo, texted it to someone, waited for a reply, and then turned to the head hairdresser and said, “He doesn't like it. You need to cut a bob and we need her on set in five for a blocking rehearsal, with short hair.”


	The blood drained entirely from the body of the hairdresser as if a vampire had tapped her like a keg. And then she snapped to and began to tear the hair and makeup trailer apart searching for her cutting scissors. Three minutes into our five minutes, she gave up her search and held up a straight razor. That's when she told me she couldn't find her scissors and this would have to do. And then, without so much as asking me, she went to work. She grabbed a fistful of my long, thick horse mane of hair and began slicing it Sweeney Todd–style. As it fell around me I just kept thinking, Maybe this is a dream, maybe this is a prank, maybe I never got this part at all and this entire thing has been a hallucination.


	Two minutes later I was staring at myself in the mirror with chin‑length hair. The rest of it sprawled on the ground around me, missing its host. I could still feel it, almost like a phantom limb. A production assistant came in and whisked me off to set for a blocking rehearsal that I floated through. Nobody mentioned my hair again. Nobody mentioned the length or the fact that it looked like somebody had frantically cut it with a straight razor, which they had.


	The first day of shooting was a success, and minus my impromptu haircut, I had a blast. One of the actors on the show was directing for the first time, and he was absolutely incredible at it. And something about the energy of it being his first day at something new put me slightly at ease about waltzing into this overwhelming, successful, and established show as a newbie who had just had a traumatizing 6:00 a.m. haircut with a utensil not meant to cut hair.

	











	I went home at the end of that day having forgotten entirely about how my morning had started until I washed my hair and realized how truly uneven the cut actually was. But it didn't matter, nothing a trim in an actual salon with actual scissors couldn't fix.


	I did a couple more episodes of the show that season. And while the nerves didn't entirely wear off and there were still bumps along the road and the other actors definitely kept to themselves quite a bit, it was still a thrill and I loved every second of it.


	And I always got along with the crew so well. It turned out the on‑set props guy lived a couple blocks from me in Venice, and we became friends and he taught me how to play the ukulele. The costume designer was an absolute tornado of a woman who I came to adore. Her sincerity in her ridiculousness was something I wished I could emulate. When she'd try to put me in a pair of pants I was convinced I wouldn't be able to breathe in and I'd say, “These aren't going to fit,” she'd always respond with, “If you can zip 'em, they fit.”


	And then a glorious thing happened. They asked me to come back and do more episodes for the following season. I was over the moon — how could I be so lucky? I showed up on set for the first episode of the new season ready for anything. If they had asked me to buzz my head I would have been cool with it. If they had asked me to get naked, I probably would have done it. I was ready to roll with whatever they threw at me. Or so I thought.

	











	The show's creator and showrunner was an intense human. He directed some episodes every season but not all of them. This one was being directed by someone else. The showrunner wasn't always around, but when he was, the entire vibe of the set would change, as if a cold front had swept the soundstage. I never entirely understood why. He was definitely spirited and opinionated, but there's way worse than that in Hollywood. I had always thought there was maybe something I was missing.


	I was correct.


	We were doing a blocking rehearsal when he showed up on set. The scene was short and easy. I was meant to come into the office, tell everyone I had photos of something important, remove them from the manila envelope I was carrying, and place them on the table. Then everyone had a few more lines and that was it. So we're rehearsing, I walk in, I go to take the photos out of the envelope, and the showrunner calls “Cut.” Not the director of the episode, the showrunner. And we all look at each other like, Did somebody do something wrong? We all thought the scene was going fine.


	He gets up out of his chair at the monitors and walks toward me slowly, looking at the ground the entire time like he's trying to figure out how to word what he's about to say. And when he finally stops right in front of me, he takes a few more beats before he lifts his head, looks at me, and says, “What the fuck are you doing?” To which I say, “Um…rehearsing?”


	And then he grabs my hand that's holding the manila envelope and he says, “No! What the fuck are you doing with this! That's not how you take something out of an envelope! Do it again!”

	











	So we do it again, and again, and again. And every time we get to the part of the scene where I'm meant to take the photos out of the envelope, he calls “Cut” and he gets up and he yells. Well, first, he starts off just raising his voice, which escalates to yelling, which eventually mutates into full‑out screaming.


	He spews the kitchen sink at me: “You're doing it wrong!”


	“How the fuck can you think that looks right at all?”


	“That's not how anyone would remove anything from an envelope ever!”


	“I don't understand — when I cast you, you knew how to act.” “I'm honestly confused at how you can be so bad at this.” “Did you forget how to act, Mamet?”


	“What's wrong with you?” “Do it again.”


	“Do it again.” “DO IT AGAIN.”


	Eventually he gave up or got bored. But this lasted for about a half hour. And nobody stopped it. Everyone just stared at their shoes while he screamed at me. Eventually we finished the blocking rehearsal and shot the scene. I finished my day. I walked to my car and called my agents and told them I quit. I was supposed to do four more episodes that season, not including the one I was on, but I told them I didn't care what they had to do, I didn't care if the network sued me, I refused to go back on that set for one more day than I actually had to. I don't remember anything else about the rest of that shoot. I think I've blocked it out.


	The show went on to break records for awards and ratings. And it deserved it. It's an incredible piece of television, and I feel insanely honored to have been a part of it. I feel proud of the work I did on that show and I wouldn't take back any of it for a second. It's all a learning experience, right?

	











	I ran into that showrunner at the Emmys a few years later. Both of our shows were nominated. He pretended not to know who I was. They swept the awards that night and part of me resented him for that. But you know, he hasn't really made anything since. And sometimes I think about him sitting in his office alone feeling sad and angry and anxious and wondering if everyone's forgotten him, and for a moment it makes me feel sorry for him, feel compassion for him, hope that his life isn't too bad…


	But let's be real, only for a moment.

Ryan Seacrest has been spending lots of time with royalty lately. The host of “American Idol” and “Wheel of Fortune” has a jam-packed schedule, but can always make time for his six-year-old niece, Flora Marie. Lately, he's been “catching up” on all of the Disney princess movies with her. 

In an interview with People published on September 5, 2025, Seacrest, 50, said that following the escapades of princesses like Ariel, Belle, and Jasmine is just one of the reasons Flora, the daughter of Seacrest's younger sister Meredith, has given him the title of “funcle” — a popular term for especially fun uncles. 

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

Seacrest has never been married and has no kids of his own, so he's happy to pour his energy into being the best “funcle” he can be, periodically posting special moments spent with Flora.

“We watch Disney movies,” he told People. “I'm catching up. As a young guy, I didn't see all the princess movies, so now I'm seeing all the princess movies, which is a lot of fun.”

In addition to bonding with his niece, watching the Disney princess movies may come in handy for Seacrest on “American Idol,” which features an annual Disney night each season. In 2025, judge Carrie Underwood followed in her predecessor Katy Perry's footsteps by dressing up as the Disney princess Rapunzel.

Perry wore elaborate Disney Night costumes during her tenure, including dressing up as Cinderella in 2018 and 2024, Snow White in 2019, and Ariel from “The Little Mermaid” in 2022 (and falling out of her chair due to her large fin!), and Cinderella in 2018.

“I have a sweatshirt that my niece made, and I'm called the Funcle,” Seacrest told People. “It says ‘Funcle' on it. I wear it proudly.” 

In September 2024, Seacrest posted a selfie while wearing the custom gray sweatshirt, which says “Funcle Ry Ry.” 

“I might have a few titles but ‘FUNcle Ry Ry' has to be my favorite,” he captioned the photo. 

In addition to watching Disney movies with Flora, Seacrest told People, “She loves to go get Shirley Temples. We do that, and she loves to try and get me to do gymnastics, and I'm failing.” 

On December 11, 2018, Seacrest announced Flora's birth on “Live With Kelly and Ryan,” the morning show he co-hosted with Kelly Ripa for six years, revealing that she was born six minutes after he got off the air the previous day. 

Seacrest held up a sweet photo of his sister Meredith holding her newborn with her husband, Jimmy Leach, by their side in the hospital. 

“I can't even look at it, it makes me cry,” Seacrest admitted as Ripa and the audience swooned. 

“The baby has such chubby little cheeks,” he continued, smiling broadly. “She's so cute!” 

He then hilariously said, “I learned so much in the last 24 hours about women and birth. Because, you'll know all of this, but it was news to me. So she was on her way to the hospital at 6 a.m. She then had the baby at 10:06.” 

“That's incredible,” Ripa exclaimed, and Seacrest continued, “She went from a six to a 10 like that, they said. I didn't know what that meant. But now I do know.” 

The audience laughed as Seacrest marveled that Leach had told him he was “asked to participate” and was holding his wife's leg as she delivered the baby. 

Ripa then quipped, “I always say watching a baby come out is kind of like being in a nightclub in the daytime.”

Lady Gaga stopped by The Late Show to perform her song “Vanish Into You.” Hot off her win for Artist of the Year at the MTV VMAs on Sunday night, Gaga performed an intimate, emotional rendition of the piano-led ballad. 


	“Vanish Into You” appeared on Lady Gaga's most recent LP, Mayhem, which dropped in March. The song was written by Gaga alongside Andrew Watt, Henry Walter, and Michael Polansky, and produced by Gaga with Watt and Cirkut. The track was notably the first song she wrote for the album and seemingly references her fiancé Michael Polansky. “In ‘Vanish Into You,' I imagine that I just want to disappear into the person I love most,” the singer told ELLE. 


	Lady Gaga recorded Mayhem at Rick Rubin's Shangri-la Studios. “The album started as me conquering a fear: to return to the pop music my earliest fans loved,” she said in a statement. “This record allowed me to reclaim a huge part of myself. It's about enjoying everything I am and sharing that joy with my fans.”

	She told Rolling Stone that she wanted to harness some of the darker sound and imagery from The Fame Monster and Born This Way. “I wanted to traverse old ground while breaking new ground, which I think is hard to do,” she said. “There are a few moments on the album where some people might say, ‘Oh, that reminds me of this,' because I do have a style, but I made an effort musically to push myself to a new place.”

	Not only did Gaga take home the award for Artist of the Year at the VMAs, she also performed live from her show at Madison Square Garden for the televised ceremony. Gaga joined the broadcast for a performance of “Abracadabra” and “The Dead Dance.”


	While accepting Artist of the Year, Gaga spoke about the importance of artistry. “Being an artist is an attempt to connect the souls of people all over the world. Being an artist is a discipline, a craft meant for reaching into someone's heart, where it grows its roots and reminding them to dream,” she says. “Being an artist is a responsibility to make the audience smile, dance, cry, release at any turn. It is a method of building understanding and celebrating community. I hope as you navigate through the mayhem of daily life, you are reminded of the importance of the art of your life that you can count on yourself and your simple skills to keep you whole, your rehearsal, your discipline, your craft, deserves to be rewarded for its passion.”

Film Workers for Palestine published a pledge featuring more than 1,300 signatures of filmmakers, actors and creatives who refuse to work with Israeli companies that are “implicated in genocide.” 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	A host of Hollywood insiders are backing a new pledge to boycott working with Israeli film institutions and companies that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”


	Film Workers for Palestine announced the pledge this morning, citing the signatures of more than 1,300 filmmakers, actors, creatives and other industry professionals including Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Mark Ruffalo, Riz Ahmed, Tilda Swinton, Javier Bardem, Yorgos Lanthimos, Josh O'Connor, Emma Stone, Ava DuVernay, Asif Kapadia, Emma Seligman, Boots Riley, Hannah Einbinder, Cynthia Nixon, Adam McKay, Joshua Oppenheimer and others.

	“As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions,” reads the pledge. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror. The world's highest court, the International Court of Justice, has ruled that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza, and that Israel's occupation and apartheid against Palestinians are unlawful. Standing for equality, justice and freedom for all is a profound moral duty that none of us can ignore.”


	Per Film Workers for Palestine, the pledge was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, which was founded by high-profile directors like Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese to demand that the film industry refuse to distribute work in South Africa. 


	“It is the responsibility of every independently minded artist to use whatever powers of expression they possess to support the global resistance to overcome this horror,” said Oscar nominated producer Mike Lerner in a statement. “This pledge is an essential non-violent tool to undermine the deadly impunity that Israel and its allies currently enjoy.”

	











	In a statement to the Guardian, the Israeli Producers Association responded to the boycott pledge. “The signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people. For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers, and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries. 


	The statement continued, “This call for a boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all.” 


	The full list of signatories is published here.

Proving the inherent falability of Jesse Armstrong's award-winning series, Succession, the eldest boy will indeed be the successor to his father's right-wing media empire. After settling in court with his beloved family members, Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch, will continue in his role as the chairman of the Fox Corporation and Fox News' parent company, News Corp, positions he assumed in 2023 when Rupert retired. Per The Hollywood Reporter, the Murdochs announced a settlement to the siblings' legal dispute over the family trust, which began last year. Lachlan's siblings, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch, have broken away from the family business and will become beneficiaries of a new trust funded through the sale of millions of Fox and News Corp shares, netting each sibling between $500 million and $1.1 billion.

Last year, dear dad attempted to alter his family trust, favoring Lachlan, so that the eldest would retain control of the businesses in the unlikely event that 94-year-old Rupert dies. A Nevada court official denied his request, leading to the protracted legal battle between Lachlan and his siblings. At the heart of it, Rupert wanted to prevent James, Prudence, or Elisabeth from taking control of America's most popular news channel, Fox News, fearing they could have cleaned up the company's politics and slowed down the country's abrupt descent into authoritarianism. (Or, in an even more unlikely scenario, TV fanatics might have speculated that Rupert Murdoch's sniveling midwestern son-in-law would assume the reins.) Apparently, all it took was a few annoying months in court and a couple of billion dollars to make the problem go away.

Following the success of their film, The Smashing Machine, at the Venice Film Festival, where director Benny Safdie won the Silver Lion, and star Dwayne Johnson received a 12-minute standing ovation, Safdie and Johnson have settled on their next project: Lizard Music. Based on Lizard Music by Daniel Pinkwater, a children's book and young adult author, the film offers Johnson a chance to return to his gonzo Southland Tales roots. Much like Smashing Machine, the story of MMA fighter Mark Kerr, which echoes Johnson's relationship with combat sports as a member of a multi-generational pro-wrestling family and board member of UFC owner TKO, Lizard Music also offers Johnson a chance to explore a personal interest. This time, it's in service of his dream of being Chicken Man, the boyfriend of a 70-year-old chicken named Claudia.

Per Deadline, the film follows a boy who finds a Videodrome channel of lizards playing otherworldly music. In his search for answers, the boy meets the “eccentric and whimsical” Chicken Man and Claudia, who join him on his quest to find the truth behind the mysterious channel. As they traverse the hidden worlds, the boy, Chicken Man, and Claudia learn that the real Lizard Music is the friends they make along the way. “I'm your Chicken Man,” Johnson told Safdie after a 45-minute pitch on the film. Soon, he'll be the world's.

The daughter of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star, Kyle Richards, Alexia Umansky, married Jake Zingerman on September 6 — and she rocked out during the reception.

In a TikTok shared on September 7, Umansky is seen belting out “Valerie,” originally sung by The Zutons.

One of my favorite moments of the whole night.  We did not plan this at all, but when the band asked me to come up, little did they know they were fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine to sing at my wedding 🤍

She was joined on stage with her new husband as she danced to the beat, but only her voice was clearly audible.

Fans expressed their shock at Umansky's professional-sounding voice, and one wrote, “Girl WHY ARENT YOU A SINGER.”

Another replied, “Wait what! You sing?! You're so good!!”

Many thought she should display her talents on a popular competition show, with a fan writing, “Hopefully they can have her [on the ‘Masked Singer!'”

One TikTok user shared, “idk but I need a Christmas album from you.” Umansky responded, “Omgggg talk about a DREAM.”

A post shared by Alexia Simone Umansky (@alexiaumansky)

Alexia may have the vocal chops to become a pop star, but she's currently following in her father's footsteps as a real estate agent in California.

Working at Mauricio Umansky's firm, The Agency, Alexia is helping sell opulent homes worth tens of millions of dollars.

On August 5, she and her team shared an Instagram post showcasing a gorgeous Beverly Hills mansion sold for $14 million.

“After two years of searching, we finally landed the one. Bittersweet ending to a long journey, but so excited for our buyers and what's ahead in their beautiful new home,” she wrote.

“I grew up watching my father work. I'd watch him show homes, sit at open houses and build relationships with clients. He knows so much about every neighborhood in this city, driving around with him was always like a little lesson,” Alexia shared in her bio on The Agency's site.

She continued, “As I grew up, I would come into the office to shadow him and always learned something new. Real estate is something I always knew I loved. And I quickly realized I could devote my life to this industry and be happy.”

Richards is a woman of many talents, but it turns out that she can sing as well. In an X post shared in August 2018, the reality star is seen singing a silly jingle John Legend made up for his wife Chrissy Teigen's ever-revolving headband.

“It's the headband of the day / Push your locks away / With a headband of the day,” Richards croons. 

“Yasssss Kyle!!! Sing for us!” a fan wrote. Another replied, “Kyle — Who knew you had such a great voice???? Looks like Chrissy & John have started a new trend!”

“Ummmm so when is the duet with @johnlegend gonna happen?” a fan inquired.

Pastry chef and Food Network alum, Duff Goldman just hit us with all the feels. The “Ace of Cakes” star shared an adorable snap of his daughter, Josephine, as she prepared for her very first day of Pre-K. Yep, that tiny toddler we've seen in past family posts is officially growing up… and fans are losing it. Time really does fly, and it seems like just yesterday Josephine was crawling around in a tiny apron while her dad baked up a storm.

“First day of TK! 😩” Duff captioned the Instagram post, and yep, that emoji says it all. Josephine is holding the classic apple sign showing her grade level and some of her thoughts and expectations for the year, striking a pose that's equal parts proud, playful, and just a little sassy. 

A post shared by Duff Goldman (@duffgoldman)

Honestly, it's hard to believe she's already stepping into school life. This is that mix of “aww, time flies” and “wait… she was just born yesterday, right?” vibes that hits every parent (and fan); right in the heart.

As expected, the comment section exploded. Some immediately pointed out how much Josephine looks like her dad, with one writing, “Daddy's twin!! Such a cutie! 🩷” and another adding, “Oh my goodness! What a doll! I can see your humor in her. I love it. Thanks for sharing!” 

Plenty of people were just trying to process how fast she's growing, saying things like, “Gosh, I feel like she was just born. So sweet,” and “No way!!! She's not even mine, and this was too fast.” While others were cheering her on for her big milestone, with messages like, “She's ambitious! Keep dreaming big, little one!” 

And of course, fans couldn't resist joking about her attitude, pointing out her perfectly executed side-eye with “Oh that side eye is on point! 😂”

Scrolling through the comments, it's clear Josephine is already winning hearts. Fans are not only swooning over her cuteness but also celebrating her little personality. Some shared memories of their own first-day-of-school moments, while others just left a string of emojis, creating this whole little community moment around her milestone. It's wholesome, it's funny, and let's be real… it's exactly the kind of internet energy we need.

Duff has shared plenty of sweet family moments over the years, but this latest post is a reminder that kids grow up fast; like, alarmingly fast. Seeing Josephine holding that apple sign and heading into her first school year is both heart-melting and nostalgic, and it seems like her personality is already shining through in every little pose and expression. Between Duff's legendary baking skills and Josephine's charm, this little family is serving sweetness in more ways than one.

Last week, Yasmin Williams announced a free show at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C., for Thursday, September 18. Now, the Virginian composer and guitarist—who posted screenshots of a heated email exchange with Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell in April, and later elaborated on the experience in an interview with Pitchfork—has shared a statement explaining her decision to perform at the venue.

According to Williams, her upcoming performance was planned prior to President Donald J. Trump's overhaul of the Kennedy Center board of trustees. “I'm doing the show for all the Kennedy Center staff who formed their own union and are still working there, fighting to maintain the institution's integrity,” she wrote on Instagram. “I'm doing it for the folks who were unjustifiably fired. I'm doing it for the elderly ushers who were told to not wear masks publicly while working, even facing backlash from higher ups if they wore one.” Read Williams' full message below.

In February, President Trump was elected chairman of the Kennedy Center. He named Grenell as interim executive director and dismissed all 18 Democratic appointees from the traditionally bipartisan board of trustees. This led Ben Folds to step down from his role as artistic advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra. Dozens of artists, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rhiannon Giddens, and Issa Rae, subsequently canceled their scheduled performances.

Williams emailed Grenell directly to inquire whether the Kennedy Center's “hiring practices, performance booking, and staffing” would be meaningfully impacted following the shakeup. In the ensuing back-and-forth, Grenell accused artists of cancelling shows “because they couldn't be in the presence of republicans.” “I remember saying that I didn't think that was the right thing to do,” Williams told Pitchfork at the time. “I thought that artists should continue to play there, mainly because I know a lot of people who work there and their incomes were being really, really negatively impacted from artists canceling shows.”

Williams shared her latest album, Acadia, in 2024. Last month, President Trump announced the first class of Kennedy Center honorees since he took over as chair. Gloria Gaynor, Kiss, George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, and British actor Michael Crawford will be recognized at the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in December.

Read about Yasmin Williams' 2021 album, Urban Driftwood, at No. 59 on “The 100 Best Albums of the 2020s.”

Yasmin Williams:

I recently announced that I'm playing at the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage on September 18th. Some folks seem confused with this decision, so I'll explain why I decided to go through with the show.

The show was originally planned several months ago, before the overhaul of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, and before my email exchange with Ric Grenell. After these events transpired and I saw people's (understandably) negative reaction toward the Kennedy Center, with people saying they wouldn't see a show there anymore, I began to doubt whether or not I should do the show at all.

I wasn't sure if anyone would come… I'm still not sure about that… but I'm doing the show for all the Kennedy Center staff who formed their own union and are still working there, fighting to maintain the institution's integrity. I'm doing it for the folks who were unjustifiably fired. I'm doing it for the elderly ushers who were told to not wear masks publicly while working, even facing backlash from higher ups if they wore one.

I invite all of the Kennedy Center union members to the show. Please feel free to wear a mask, whether you're a staff member or a guest. I will try to personally make sure that all guests at the show are comfortable and treated with respect by the staff (which has always been the case at any show I've ever played at the Kennedy Center).

Ric Grenell, even you can come too… only if you can stomach sitting next to people who may not look like you or have your same politics… and if you can handle a polite verbal jab (or two) from me 😉

This milestone edition comes as a ClutchMerch.com exclusive gatefold vinyl, featuring a 12" LP pressed on purple smoke colored vinyl.

Available on CD and digital platforms, fully remastered and redesigned, the album packs 16 tracks, including a brand-new acoustic version of "The Regulator."Guitarist Tim Sult reflects on the reimagined track, saying, "The acoustic version of The Regulator came together very quickly and naturally.

Frontman Neil Fallon looks back on the album, commenting, "We recorded Psychic Warfare in the Texas hill country town of Dripping Springs with Machine. It was a fun album to put together, but it was an intense experience. I think A Quick Death in Texas summarizes that time nicely."Late August, Clutch released the official Blast Tyrant (2025 Remaster) edition. Available on CD and digital platforms, fully remastered and redesigned, the album packs 16 tracks, including a brand-new acoustic version of "The Regulator."Guitarist Tim Sult reflects on the reimagined track, saying, "The acoustic version of The Regulator came together very quickly and naturally. We changed the key from D to E, changed up the musical theme, but kept the same dark vibe of the original."Fans can also dig deeper with the special digital only companion release: Clutch - Blast Tyrant: Basket of Eggs (2025 Remaster). This features 10 tracks that expand on the Blast Tyrant era - two demos, three b-sides, and the original four acoustic tracks, all now remastered for 2025 as well, plus the new acoustic version of "The Regulator."Tracklisting - Psychic Warfare (10th Anniversary Edition):The AffidavitX-Ray VisionsFirebirds!A Quick Death In TexasSucker for the WitchYour Love Is IncarcerationDoom SaloonOur Lady Of Electric LightNoble SavageBehold The ColossusDecapitation BluesSon of VirginiaTracklisting - Blast Tyrant: Basket of Eggs (2025 Remaster):Boxcar Shorty's Confession (2025 Remaster)The Regulator (Acoustic) (2025 Remaster)Basket of Eggs (Acoustic) (2025 Remaster)Tight Like That (Acoustic) (2025 Remaster)Drink to the Dead (Acoustic) (2025 Remaster)Cattle Car (2025 Remaster)Walpole Man (2025 Remaster)Promoter (2025 Remaster)La Curandera (2025 Remaster)Steve Doocy (2025 Remaster)

Sul Ross State University is proud to celebrate Language and Literature faculty member Robin Alvarez on the release of her highly anticipated new book, “Paramour,” published Sept. 9.

Alvarez, who joined the SRSU faculty this year after serving the university in multiple capacities, has already gained recognition in the literary world. “Paramour” has been praised by Kirkus Reviews, which gave the novel its coveted “Get it” verdict and will feature the book in the October edition of Kirkus Reviews Magazine.

Sunday Times bestselling author A.Y. Chao (Shanghai Immortal) also lauded Alvarez's work, writing: “Alvarez weaves elements of old school urban fantasy faves like Buffy, Supernatural and True Blood … into this heartwarming and bittersweet tale of grief, loss, redemption, and the enduring power of love.”

Described as “Twilight with banshees,” “Paramour” blends paranormal romance with heartfelt themes of identity, grief and belonging. The story follows Sadie, a banshee on the run from hunters and her past, who must decide whether to risk losing control to protect the people she loves.

As part of the book's launch, Alvarez will appear as a featured author at the Forever Twilight in Forks Festival in Washington state on Sept. 12, where she will sign books and meet Stephanie Meyer, author of the Twilight series and an inspiration for Alvarez's own writing.

“Getting to launch ‘Paramour' at such a landmark celebration of Twilight's 20th anniversary feels surreal,” Alvarez said in a news release. “To meet Stephanie Meyer and share this story with fans who love paranormal romance as much as I do is a dream come true.”

In addition to the Forks festival, Alvarez will be a featured guest at major upcoming literary events, including Romantasy BookCon in Los Angeles in February and Imaginarium Book Festival in Washington, D.C. next June.

Alvarez is also the author of the #1 New Release “When Oceans Rise” and editor of “Monsters in Masquerade,” an OwlCrate anthology. Her work often highlights emotive characters, supernatural elements, and a multiracial perspective.

Alvarez lives in West Texas with her family, where she balances writing, teaching and adventures with her children.

A Texas man has been charged with murder following a game in which he and his friend took turns shooting each other in the head with rifles while wearing Kevlar helmets.

On 17 August, good friends Sean O'Donnell (37) and Aaron Prout (34) were hanging out in the former's home when they decided to play a very stupid and dangerous game – taking turns shooting each other in the head with a rifle while wearing a Kevlar helmet for protection. Kevlar helmets are used by modern soldiers because they are known to whithstand heavy impacts, but they are not completely bulletproof. In this particular case, the two friends, who had been drinking, were reportedly holding the Kevlar helmet above their heads while the other tried to aim at it with a rifle. All it took was for one of them to miss their shot by a few millimeters to turn their friendly game into a tragedy.

“Hard to believe two so-called friends would take turns shooting at each other wearing a Kevlar helmet, inside a house in a residential neighbourhood, while using a rifle,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez wrote about the incident on X.

UK native Aaron Prout sustained a bullet injury to the head and was pronounced dead at the hospital. Originally, authorities believed that his wounds were accidentally self-inflicted, but a subsequent investigation would reveal that they had been caused by his friend while trying to shoot at the Kevlar helmet above Prout's head. Despite O'Donnell's attempts at covering up his tragic mistake, the evidence against him was irrefutable. Apparently, the two had shared videos of themselves shooting each other with a rifle with other friends.

“The defendant is alleged to have told the police that he shot himself, but there are witnesses who have video that the defendant and the complainant sent of them playing with the gun and shooting with the helmet back and forth, and these friends told them to stop,” the judge in this case said during a hearing. “The defendant and his friend were playing with guns. They were drinking. They were shooting at a Kevlar helmet. They were holding it above their heads until the complainant ended up with a bullet hole in the top of his head.”

 ﻿

Aaron Prout had served in the Royal Marines for 10 years before moving to Texas. His friend O'Donnell has been arrested for murder, and his bail has been set at $3,000.

It's a tragedy that someone lost their life, but this story once again confirms that the saying “play stupid games, collect stupid prizes” holds true.

REAL TALK

Date: July 29, 2025

Byline: Investigative Desk

I. THE SOUNDTRACK OF CONTROL

Throughout multiple public shocks—Manchester Arena, Route 91 Harvest, Astroworld—iHeartMedia/Clear Channel surfaced as more than a broadcaster. Documents reveal the company served as a central hub for emotional amplification, broadcasting carefully curated grief messaging that synchronized with corporate and legal strategic timelines. The airwaves weren't reporting tragedy—they were scripting it.

II. MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE MEETS EMOTIONAL WARFARE

Clear Channel-owned stations in key U.S. and UK markets reportedly received pre-vetted narratives within hours of each crisis. These included celebrity statements, approved grief tributes, and messaging focused on unity rather than scrutiny. Sources within the network suggest this was a deliberate “narrative containment” approach—preventing counter-narratives or scrutiny from gaining traction in public discourse.

III. PROGRAMMING OVER PUBLIC INTEREST

Though local affiliates technically hold FCC licenses, national programming decisions—including post-trauma branding—shape what millions hear. iHeartMedia's feeds during these events directed emotional frames, controlled tone, and largely ignored legal or forensic questions. Critics call this emotional censorship—a corporate filter that replaced critical inquiry with choreography.

IV. PARTNERING WITH THE TRAUMA ENGINE

iHeartMedia did not operate in isolation. Its messaging was tightly synchronized with Live Nation's venue control, estate legal teams' damage management, and psychiatric detainment messaging. Together they formed the “Trauma Engine”—a loop of fear, empathy, and redemption. iHeartMedia's role: the amplifier, delivering volume without scrutiny.

V. WHAT IT MEANS FOR MEDIA TRUST

By exercising coordinated emotional control across millions of listeners, iHeartMedia turned tragedy into marketing vectors. This raises urgent questions:

• Should emotional narrative management be considered a form of psychological manipulation?

• Does the structure of syndicated broadcast restrict public discourse behind a corporate gate?

• How many tragedies have been quietly choreographed through the broadcast airwaves?

As investigations proceed, this expose exposes iHeartMedia as a key operator—not just a broadcaster—within a system that weaponizes tragedy for control.



Born with a copy of "Atlas Shrugged" in hand, Justin showed early signs of his future as a conservative firebrand. Raised in a household where Rush Limbaugh's voice echoed through the halls, Justin was inspired to become a prominent figure in conservative journalism, in which he shares his support of Republican values.

Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries? It could've been the crossover to end all crossovers. On paper, it does seem like things could've lined up: The shows were airing on The CW at the same time, and both of their premises involved paranormal beings. Not to mention, both had very passionate fanbases.

When TVD was rolling out its first season — and Supernatural was on its fifth — the network even approached the creators about collaborating. In Samantha Highfill's I Was Feeling Epic: An Oral History of ‘The Vampire Diaries, executive producer Julie Plec reveals that it didn't make sense at the time.

More specifically, Plec said the team decided that blending the two worlds wouldn't work with their mythology, but it might've been a different story had the request come a few years later. “By the way, if that same request had come my way in Season 7, I would've been like, ‘F**k yeah'” she admitted in the book.

Plec spoke more extensively on the topic at a convention in 2018, shortly after TVD had wrapped up its eighth and final season. ” Kevin [Williamson, coproducer] and I were like ‘absolutely not, because we are vampires and werewolves,” she explained, according to Screenrant. “We don't have demons. We don't have Hell. We don't have the devil. We don't have any of that stuff! It's like two completely different supernatural universes!”

A few years before that, Supernatural star Jensen Ackles was asked about a crossover he'd like to do, and he teased the possibility of the Winchesters meeting the Salvatore brothers. “Maybe given the trade that the Winchester brothers are in, maybe we go pay a visit to The Vampire Diaries and just wipe them out,” he said.

It wasn't the last time the actor would bring it up. In 2016, he admitted it would be difficult to make a crossover happen, considering that the shows were filmed thousands of miles apart.

“I just say at the end, we'll loan them an Impala and just have the Impala drive into town as the last thing you see,” he joked. His costar Misha Collins chimed in, “And then the screen cuts to black and you just hear screams.”

Alas, it never came to be. Instead, Plec noted in Highfill's book that they were more focused on spinoffs located within the TVD universe. As early as Season 2, the team was playing around with the idea of doing a university-set paranormal show with possessions and ghosts, according to Williamson, which definitely sounds more up Supernatural‘s alley.

While that didn't get off the ground, Plec and Williamson did start discussing The Originals around the same time instead. “The Originals spinoff happened because Klaus was so good and Elijah was so good and then suddenly we introduced Rebekah as part of the story and then it was like, ‘Why are we not doing this whole family? They're so good.'”

And the rest is history, though the higher-ups didn't immediately agree to the idea until about a season later. Would you have liked to see the Supernatural and TVD crews cross paths, or are you glad TVD kept everything within the same universe? Let us know in the comments below!

(NewsNation) — A historic House subcommittee hearing Tuesday unveiled never-before-seen video appearing to show a Hellfire fail to take down an unidentified “orb.” 

Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., shared the video, which was taken on Oct. 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen. 

As the missile appeared to bounce off the object rather than destroy it, journalist and hearing witness George Knapp observed “it kept going.” “What the hell is that?” he added.

The hearing centered on unidentified anomalous phenomena, government disclosure and protection for whistleblowers.

NewsNation special correspondent and investigative journalist Ross Coulthart watched along and gave his analysis, live on stream.

Spoiler alert: Erin Taylor is alive and well.

After spending the night in 16 allegedly haunted locations in Colorado and across the U.S., the Colorado Springs paranormal investigator and author is intact, and maybe even more of a believer in things that go bump in the night.

She documented those ghostly sleepovers in her 2022 book, “Sleeping Among Spirits,” and released a new version this summer with an extra haunted location. Both versions, along with her four other paranormal books, including “Strange Colorado,” in which she explores the state's urban legends, and “Unfinished Business,” a deep dive into haunted bathrooms around the country, are available online at erintaylorauthor.com and Amazon.com. Her sixth book, “Haunted Leadville,” is due out Sept. 16.

“I run into the fire, metaphorically speaking,” said Taylor, a Springs native who graduated from Liberty High School. “Some people might run away from ghosts but I run to them.”

Taylor also will be a featured guest at the Oddity & Fear Fest on Sept. 20-21 at Colorado Springs Event Center, and she'll host a ghost hunt Oct. 18 at the Outlaws and Lawmen Museum (the old Teller County Jail) in Cripple Creek. Details are online at rjpromotions.com/colorado-shows/colorado-springs-oddity-fear-fest and bumpinthenight.net/night-at-the-old-teller-county-jail.

She was a tiny ghost hunter before ghost hunting even became a pop culture fixation. As a little kid she loved reading scary books, like R.L. Stine's “Goosebumps” series.

“I wanted that to be my real life even though I thought it was scary,” Taylor said. “I grew up and still loved ghost stories and became more aware of our own legends in Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek and bigger places like The Stanley Hotel, and then the ghost shows started coming out.”

Around 2013 she realized she didn't have to sit back and watch other people explore the supernatural realm, she could do it, too. So she joined a local paranormal investigation group and then branched out into her own group, Cheyenne Mountain Paranormal.

“There are a lot of times things can be explained, but I love the times they can't,” she said. “That's the driving force behind why I and so many other paranormal investigators do this. It's the thrill of it.”

The idea to sleep in haunted spots was born out of doing 10 nights of paranormal investigations in 10 locations from Indiana to Gettysburg, Pa., with Richard Estep, another Colorado-based paranormal investigator and author. They spent their final night at the Sallie House in Atchison, Kan., a notoriously haunted house and tourist attraction.

“A family lived there and went on the show ‘Sightings,' and said they were being haunted by a little girl who was a demon,” said Taylor, who's been a mental health therapist for almost two decades. “The whole reputation of this house is being evil. For being such a demonic ghost I fell asleep in the living room. I joked that I slept great in this super-haunted house, and someone should write a book, a scared Airbnb sort of book. I took it and started running with it.”

Places she laid her head and hoped for the best: Croke-Patterson Mansion (now Patterson Inn) and The Lumber Baron Inn & Gardens in Denver, Victor Hotel & Restaurant, Hotel St. Nicholas in Cripple Creek, as well as Cripple Creek Hospitality House & RV Park. Her least comfortable night came in Squirrel Cage Jail Museum in Council Bluffs, Iowa, where she spent the night in a cell.

Many of the spots have been featured on hit paranormal TV shows, such as “Ghost Adventures,” “Portals to Hell” and “Ghost Hunters.”

“Sometimes there's possibly an initial apprehension, especially if I'm coming into a location knowing there's been a lot of negative comments,” Taylor said. “As I've done this more and more, I don't get as worked up or nervous as I did in the beginning, but it's more being aware and mindful of what's going on.”

And yes, unexplainable things happen during her adventures. Among her favorite go-to places are Cripple Creek and Victor, where she likes to say “you can't walk a block without having some sort of paranormal activity.”

OK, that's greatly exaggerated, she admits, but she's investigated the Outlaws & Lawmen Jail Museum and never had the same thing happen twice. It's where she first heard footsteps in her ghost hunting career and saw a semi-apparition she could tell was male.

Two memorable Springs experiences also come to mind. The evening she spent at Evergreen Cemetery, where she was walking with two other investigators and minus any recording equipment, and saw a black mass cross the path in front of her.

“It was darker than the night,” she said. “That one I couldn't really explain.”

And an investigation at the now defunct Cowboys nightclub on Palmer Park Boulevard elicited an interesting anecdote in the women's bathroom when she heard a woman's voice. Cave of the Winds was also rich with unexplained activity, including hearing footsteps and seeing a lit candle fall out of a bucket lantern.

“Yes, I'm a believer, but I also want to see what might be the reasons,” Taylor said. “I do like explanations. I take a scientific approach to it, but when there are experiences we cannot explain then that's what's so exciting.”

WASHINGTON­—Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) delivered opening remarks at today's hearing titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection.” In her opening statement, Task Force Chairwoman Luna highlighted the lack of transparency from the federal government and intelligence communities on the research and disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Task Force Chairwoman Luna also reiterated the importance of addressing threats to U.S. national security by UAPs and the need for the federal government to acknowledge them.



Below are Task Force Chairwoman Luna's opening remarks, as prepared:

Good morning, and welcome to this hearing regarding UAP disclosures.

For too long, the issue of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena – commonly known as UAPs – has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal. 

Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. 

This is about national security, government accountability, and the American people's right to the truth.

I have now spoken to a number of whistleblowers from the military, to include at the infamous Eglin AFB incident that occurred when myself and former Rep Matt Gaetz as well as Rep Burchett followed up on a lead from multiple active-duty air force pilot whistleblowers that alleged that the USAF was covering up UAP activity at Eglin AFB. 

We have heard from a number of whistleblowers, specifically military pilots, that the reason for not coming forward publicly is out of fear that speaking out would cost them their flight status, and potentially their careers. 

That is unacceptable. 

We cannot protect our airspace if our best-trained observers are silenced. 

We cannot advance science if we refuse to ask questions. 

And we cannot maintain trust in government if we keep the American people in the dark.

Now, Congress has tried to fix this problem.

Congress tried to create formal channels – through the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, also known as AARO and the Intelligence Community Inspector General – for service members and officials to make disclosures.

But the reality: the reports that come in are too often brushed aside, slow-walked, or met with skepticism rather than serious investigation. Recently, the former AARO director known as Sean Kirpatrick attacked our witness and members on this committee. It should be noted that he is a documented liar and brings into question what his purpose at AARO really was if it was not to follow up on investigations and disclose his findings to Members of Congress. 

A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Chris Mellon, described a report published by ARRO that “found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology,” as “the most error-ridden and unsatisfactory government report I can recall reading during or after decades of government service.” Mellon further noted that this was the first ARRO report submitted to Congress without the Director of National Intelligence's sign-off and seemingly excluded input from “any of the scholars or experts who have studied and written extensively on this topic as would normally be the case in another field.” Mellon determined that the report failed to fulfill the congressional mandate under which it was required, omitted entire agencies with “known investigations or activities relating to UAP,” and omitted any discussion of efforts to hide classified or unclassified information about UAP. Such efforts were unaddressed by the report despite the existence of agency records and investigations concerning them, including at US Customs and Border Protection.

If we set up offices and oversight bodies only to let them become graveyards for testimony or worse yet, ruses for pretending to investigate when in actuality, there was no follow up, then we are not doing our jobs.

In recent months, Congress has also been presented with evidence that points to technologies that to our knowledge, are beyond our current capabilities.  

It is our duty as elected representatives to follow the facts, wherever they lead, and to ensure those facts are not buried under classification stamps or bureaucratic excuses. 

Let me be clear: whether UAPs represent adversarial technology, natural phenomena, or something beyond current human understanding, Congress has a responsibility to investigate. 

If these objects are foreign in origin, they pose a direct threat to our national security. 

If they represent something unknown, they demand rigorous scientific inquiry – not ridicule, not secrecy, and not silence. 

The stakes are high. 

Adversarial nations are not waiting for us to catch up – they are studying these phenomena aggressively as well and multiple nations have also announced their own parliamentary investigation into this very topic.

If we continue to hide information from ourselves, we risk strategic surprises. 

If we continue to ignore our pilots and service members as well as the countless government whistleblowers, we risk losing their trust. 

And if we continue to shield the truth from the public, we risk eroding the very foundation of democratic accountability. 

That is why this hearing matters. 

This is not about fueling speculation.

This is about demanding basic transparency from the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community and/or military contractors. 

It is about asking the questions every American has the right to ask: What do we know? What don't we know? And why, in a free society are we still being told so little? 

A major barrier to the Committee's inquiry into UAPs has been a lack of cooperation and transparency from the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). In preparation for previous UAP hearings, the Committee repeatedly asked DoD to allow Members to view videos and files relating to UAP incidents. Unfortunately, DoD notified Committee staff that due to the Department's special access program (SAP) rules, only members of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) and the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee (HAC-D) were allowed to be “read in” on such programs. For a non-committee Member to be allowed to view these documents and videos, individual Members must be approved by the Chairman and Ranking Member of both HASC and HAC-D. Independent SAP oversight has presented a consistent problem for Congress as the program's budgets are classified. Additionally, oversight reporting to Congress is classified, and is only provided to the authorizing and appropriations committees of jurisdiction.

The American people are not fragile.

They do not need to be shielded like children from reality.

What they cannot tolerate – what they will not forgive – is a government that withholds the truth and punishes those who dare to speak out.

I want to close with this:

Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. 

Did we look away, embarrassed or afraid? Or did we pursue the truth with courage? 

I intend to be on the side of truth, transparency, and accountability, and I hope my colleagues on this Task Force will be as well. 

To quote a few elected officials:

Senator Schumer: “Multiple credible sources” allege a constitutional crisis over UFOs.

Senator Rounds: “They are brilliant individuals.” 

                        “They're not making this stuff up.”

Our current Secretary of State Rubio: “Very high clearances and high positions within our government.”

Senator McConnell: “Sane,” “Credible”

The witnesses today are not alone, far from it. In fact, 34 senior military, government, and intelligence officials have broken their silence. This includes Senator Rubio, Senator Rounds, Senator Gillibrand, General Jim Clapper, the former director of the Government's UAP task force, the former head of aviation security on the White House national security council, a former secretary of defense, and many more.  To quote Senator Rubio in the upcoming documentary Age of Disclosure: “even presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis but that begins to spin out of control.” And to quote Senator Gillibrand who went public in a upcoming documentary, “it's not acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees.” It is time for the fundamental truths around UAP to be revealed to our nation's leaders and to the public.

 It is time for the US government to exercise transparency.

And, with that, I yield to Ranking Member Crockett for her opening statement.

Jeffrey Nuccetelli is a U.S. Air Force veteran who served for sixteen years as a military police/security officer (oversight.house.gov). In his testimony titled “Nuccetelli-Written-Testimony,” he recounts multiple unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base between 2003 and 2005, including:

 The “Vandenberg Red Square”, a massive glowing red square that hovered near missile defense sites and was reported by Boeing contractors oversight.house.gov.

A football-field-sized rectangular craft that silently hovered before rapidly disappearing.

Reports of strange lights above the ocean prompting armed responses, and a triangular craft larger than a C-130 drifting silently over the base.

His personal chilling experience: A large, blue-white glowing orb that maneuvered like a butterfly, appearing directly above his backyard before vanishing oversight.house.gov.

Nuccetelli emphasizes that these events were documented and reported up the chain of command, yet no guidance or public communication followed—often due to fear, stigma, or retaliation that discouraged further reporting

Dylan Borland is an expert in analysing video, is officially a federal whistleblower and has testified to AARO. He claims he has "direct first-hand knowledge" of and experience with "technologies that are not ours" [i.e. non-human].

He claims his career was deliberately hindered when he turned UAP whistleblower.

While "Age of Disclosure" and "Capel Green" are not available to stream online yet, there are plenty of interesting UFO shows to watch, especially "UFO Revolution" season 2, which covers the explosive events of the last UAP hearing where Jeremy Corbell clashed with Michael Shellenberger over the Immaculate Constellation documents.

Officials are seeking to calm speculation after the deaths of several candidates, including seven from the Alternative for Germany, which said it was "saddened" by the news.

Tuesday 9 September 2025 13:39, UK

Officials in western Germany have sought to calm online speculation following the deaths of 16 candidates, including seven from a far-right party, in the run-up to a local election.

Voters will go to the polls on 14 September in North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's most populous state.

However, online conspiracy theories have been running rife after the deaths of several candidates, including seven representing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD) party.

AfD co-leader, Alice Weidel, highlighted the initial deaths on social media with a post on X saying “4 AfD candidates died.”

However, Dr Martin Vincentz, a spokesperson for the North Rhine-Westphalia branch of the party, told Sky News the confirmed number had risen to seven.

In a statement, he said the AfD was saddened by the news but that, according to the information they had received so far, there was “currently no indication of unnatural deaths".

Some of those running had known pre-existing conditions.

In total, 16 candidates are believed to have died, with police already ruling out unnatural causes in four of the cases, according to the DPA news agency.

The seven AfD nominees were standing for election in a variety of districts and with confirmed ages between 59 and 80.

The far-right party is reported to be the only one that has had more than one candidate die.

In all districts where candidates have died, any completed postal ballots will need to be re-cast, local media said.

Ahead of the vote, a spokesman for the local election commission tried to dispel intense online speculation, telling the media that the number of deaths was "not significantly higher" than in previous campaigns.

Exploring our solar system and returning pieces of it to Earth is a central part of the existential quest to search for life beyond our home planet.

Understanding the biosafety and biocontamination implications of landing on a planetary body or in bringing pieces of our solar system back to our home planet are the two themes that are central to planetary protection, a discipline that is unique to spacefaring nations.

The nature of planetary protection is twofold: (1) to ensure that we minimize our own terrestrial microbial footprint on other planets and moons (planetary bodies) in our solar system (forward contamination), and (2) to ensure that we minimize the potential impact of returning samples from another planet or moon to Earth (backward contamination).

The discipline of planetary protection focuses on who is the biological “invader” and when does their arrival indicate an “invasion”? The degree to which there is potential for biological or organic interactions that result in biocontamination or changes in biosafety posture is the central topic of this work.

If you love The Conjuring Universe, these paranormal horror shows are the perfect next watch. Since the first movie came out in 2013, The Conjuring movies have taken the world by storm. While plenty of paranormal movies existed prior to this, the Conjuring franchise was different because it took very loose inspiration from true stories of hauntings.

The Warrens were also based on real-life (albeit problematic) paranormal investigators. The Conjuring's actors, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, took the films to the next level. They made the demonologist main characters empathetic and easy to connect with. The franchise has only continued to grow.

Most recently, The Conjuring: Last Rites broke an IT record, becoming the biggest opening weekend of all time for a horror movie. After watching the most recent Conjuring movie, fans can move on to these eight TV shows, which are perfect for fans of the paranormal horror franchise.

The Conjuring movies are loosely based on real stories, and they aren't the only versions of them made. Fans of The Conjuring 2 need to check out the British miniseries The Enfield Haunting, which is a more direct fictionalization of the Enfield Poltergeist that occurred from 1977 to 1979.

Set in the 1970s, The Enfield Haunting tells the story of Mr. Grosse, a novice paranormal researcher, and Guy Lyn Playfair, and experienced researcher, as they attempt to care for an 11-year-old girl terrorized by a supernatural entity.

The show has a skin-crawling effect due to its scary moments and "true story" angle. The paranorml investigator characters will also make it perfect for Conjuring fans. On top of that, it has elements of film noir, similar to The Exorcist.

American Horror Story is one of the most prolific horror TV shows of all time in the same way The Conjuring franchise is one of the most prolific horror movie franchises of all time. Because American Horror Story is anthological, not all of the seasons cater to the same type of horror as The Conjuring.

However, seasons 1, 5, and 6 – Murder House, Hotel, and Roanoke, respectively – feel perfect for fans of the hit movie franchise. These three seasons of American Horror Story involve ghosts who wreak havoc on the living. 

They mix together atmospheric fear, jump scares, and gore, all of which can be found in The Conjuring Universe's movies. They also center on specific locations that are haunted. What's more, there are elements of ghost summonings and banishment, like in The Conjuring.

With 50 episodes across 4 seasons, Evil is an excellent choice for Conjuring fans seeking a paraanormal show they can watch for a long time before running out of episodes. The series started as a network show on CBS before transitioning to Paramount+.

The show centers on Dr. Kristen Bouchard, a non-believer forensic psychologist; David Acosta, a priest-in-training at a Catholic seminary; and Ben Shakir, an athiest technology contractor. The Catholic Church hires these three vastly different individuals to use their expertise to solve different paranormal occurances.

Evil is truly the perfect choice after watching The Conjuring because it involves demonic entities and terrifying hauntings to give you nightmares for days. Additionally, the show provided a proper conclusion for viewers rather than leaving the story open-ended like some streaming shows that get canceled.

The Korean Netflix show Parasyte: The Grey, directed by famed director Yeon Sang-ho (who brought Train to Busan to life), is an excellent live-action show that connects to the Parasyte manga and Parasyte: The Maxim anime.

The show exists in a world where parasites start taking over human bodies, usually killing them and using the carcass as a host. The story follows a young woman named Jeong Su-in who gets attacked and turned into a parasite. However, she and the parasite try to co-exist in a world that wants to kill them.

While Parasyte: The Grey doesn't necessarily sound like the more tame Conjuring movies, like Annabelle, it has many similarities to scarier movies within the same universe, namely The Nun and The Conjuring 2. However, it includes much more horror and gore, so viewers should be mentally prepared for that.

The Discovery Channel TV show A Haunting is the perfect blend of true stories and horror dramatizations. Like The Conjuring movies, A Haunting is theoretically based on real-life stories of paranormal events, ghosts, and demonic activity.

Each episode depicts a different alleged true example of supernatural incidents, using firsthand accounts and interviews. However, the show also features dramatic re-enactments in almost every episode, using fictionalized versions of the horrifying experience for narrative impact.

The re-enactments are often nothing short of terrifying, with some scenes being reminiscent of the movie franchise. Additionally, the atmospheric quality and genuinely scary stories make it perfect for The Conjuring fans.

While the show is divisive within the Exorcist franchise fanbase, the TV show The Exorcist is perfect for fans of The Conjuring. The show is a sequel to the original movie, ignoring the sequel films' stories. It follows Father Tomas Ortega and Father Marcus Keane, priests who try to help a family and foster home dealing with demonic entities.

Like The Conjuring movies, the premise is pretty simple, so it comes down to the execution. Rather than having a ton of jump scares, the show leans into atmospheric horror, like the Conjuring films. The show also has top-notch writing and character development, which the Conjuring franchise also excels at.

Unfortunately, the Exorcist TV show only lasted two seasons due to high production costs and low viewership. That being said, the smaller number of episodes makes it easy to binge-watch.

Some of the best shows that are perfect for The Conjuring fans are made outside of Hollywood. The French horror show Marianne holds a rare perfect Rotten Tomatoes critic score and an 84% Popcornmeter score. It's also one of the most perfect shows to watch after The Conjuring films.

The show follows a horror writer named Emma Larrsimon, who has spent her whole life haunted by childhood nightmares of a witch named Marianne. She turned these night terrors into bestselling books. However, she realizes that Marianne wasn't a figment of her imagination when she returns to her hometown.

As a lover of all things horror, I can confidently say that Marianne is one of the best horror TV shows that I've seen within the past decade, and I think fans of The Conjuring will love it. The show builds a bone-chilling ambiance, and Marianne ends up being just as terrifying as the demons in The Conjuring. I recommend watching the series with subtitles, but there's a dubbed version available as well.

No supernatural horror list would be complete without at least one Mike Flanagan show on it. Of all the options, The Haunting of Hill House is the best miniseries for fans of The Conjuring.

The show follows the Crain family during two parts of their lives. First, the family moves into Hill House, unaware of the terrifying paranormal phenomena they are about to experience. This is interwoven with their lives 26 years later, when they have to confront their traumatic experiences at Hill House.

Like The Conjuring, the TV show is very loosely shaped by a real story, with Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House taking inpsiration from a group of psychic researchers from the 19th century who went to a haunted house. Additionally, the shows both rely heavily on a scary ambiance as well a horrifying storyline.

Craig Jacocks shares his compelling true story of UFO sightings and alien abductions in Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition, revealing astonishing evidence and experiences.

United States, September 9, 2025 -- The Story Behind Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition

Craig Jacocks is not your typical author. His story is unlike anything you may have read before. In Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition, Jacocks opens up about his extraordinary experiences with UFO sightings and alien encounters. Unlike many who hesitate to speak about such occurrences, Jacocks is unapologetically open, sharing details that have shaped his life. His honesty about these experiences has led him to not only write a book but also speak at public engagements, television interviews, and podcasts.



Jacocks' journey began as a child when he witnessed a close-up UFO sighting, an event that sparked a lifelong interest in the phenomenon. The encounters continued into his twenties, with experiences occurring intermittently into his late forties. As he approaches his 60th birthday, Jacocks reflects on these moments, continuing to share his story with those who are willing to listen and learn.

An Unexpected Discovery

In 2005, Jacocks discovered two metallic objects embedded near his spine, a finding that was made by accident at an airport security checkpoint. The objects were detected by a wand detector when Jacocks failed to pass through a metal detector. The discovery led Jacocks to visit his doctor for x-rays, which confirmed the presence of two needle-like metallic objects lodged near his lower back.

What makes this discovery even more astonishing is the fact that similar metallic objects had been found in Jacocks' knee as a child. These objects were removed then, but the new implants near his spine could not be removed due to the risk of paralysis, as advised by the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic. This has led Jacocks to explore the nature of these objects and their possible connection to his extraordinary experiences.

The Impact of Jacocks' Story

Aware Of Their Presence isn't just about unexplained events, it's a window into one man's perspective on life, identity, and the unknown. Jacocks' willingness to share his deeply personal journey sets him apart from others in the UFO and alien encounter community. While many shy away from revealing their experiences for fear of ridicule, Jacocks stands firm in his belief and his openness, encouraging others to be equally unafraid to explore the unknown.

What makes Jacocks' story truly unique is his refusal to engage in debates with those who do not believe him. Rather than arguing with skeptics, Jacocks is content to tell his story honestly, even when it's uncomfortable, and allow others to come to their own conclusions. This approach has resonated with readers, many of whom report reading the book in a single sitting due to its gripping nature and candid storytelling.
