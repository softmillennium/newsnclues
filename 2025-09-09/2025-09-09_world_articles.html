                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shell signed a 10-year natural gas supply agreement with Hungary's MVM CEEnergy on Sept. 9, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, according to Reuters. This is Budapest's largest and longest deal with a Western energy provider, though Szijjarto said Russian gas imports will continue. Under the contract, Shell — the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader — will deliver around 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas annually to MVM starting in January 2026. Most EU countries have sharply reduced imports from Moscow following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. No, because of geographical and infrastructural conditions," Szijjarto said. "Not until we have proper infrastructure development in the region." Hungary has deepened purchases from Russia in recent years, importing some 5 billion cubic meters of gas via Turkstream by late August, according to Reuters. Szijjarto earlier this year rejected European Commission proposals to phase out Russian imports, aligning with Slovakia. The new Shell deal builds on a six-year contract signed in 2020 that provided Hungary with 250 mcm of LNG annually between 2021 and 2027. The agreement comes amid renewed tensions between Hungary and Ukraine over energy security. Last month, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil facilities temporarily disrupted operations on the Druzhba pipeline, which delivers Russian crude directly to Hungary and Slovakia. The halt underscored Budapest's heavy reliance on Moscow for energy. President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested on Aug. 24 the future of Druzhba could hinge on Hungary's stance toward Ukraine's bid to join the European Union, remarks that drew a sharp rebuke from Szijjarto.

Under the contract, Shell — the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader — will deliver around 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas annually to MVM starting in January 2026. "Therefore it is vital that we use this window of opportunity that we have while Russia is bogged down in Ukraine to strengthen NATO's northern flank,"  Sweden's defense minister Pal Jonson said. "We aim for 100% by October," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in reference to the 2 million pledged artillery shells. Three oil and gas pipelines in Russia were knocked out of service in a series of explosions on Sept. 8, a Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's plans could cost "years and a million people," or even "two or three million corpses" if Russia accelerates its offensive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raids by rival hives aren't rare after a dry, hot summer, but Christine McDonald was surprised to find her store besieged A Canadian beekeeper has described fending off thousands of “robber bees” as they raided her shop in a brazen attempt to steal honey. Christine McDonald, who owns Rushing River Apiaries in the British Columbia city of Terrace, said she entered her shop to find it overrun by the swarm. Raids of rival hives are common after hot, dry summers, when a “nectar gap” emerges between spring blooms and autumn flowers. Larger bee colonies also need more food to collect and store. “Fall beekeeping is very intense – trying to help bees hunker down against other bees and wasps and keep the food stores that they've worked so hard for,” said McDonald, who has previously seen raids on her outdoor hives – but never on her store. They tear open wax cells to get at the honey inside and can remove large amounts of honey very quickly,” said one beekeeping guide. These insects are even more aggressive, and will promptly kill off any bees left in the hive.” McDonald says she avoided disaster by throwing a tarp over the equipment and products, but ended up “sacrificing her bathroom” in order to trap the invading bees. “I think they've learned that, nope, there's no more food here,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield say The Magnum Ice Cream Company (TMICC), a new division of Unilever that is set to be separately listed in November and includes the brand founded by the pair in 1978 alongside Magnum, Cornetto and Wall's, “must free Ben & Jerry's” in an open letter to prospective investors and the group's board. The pair, who no longer have a financial interest in Ben & Jerry's or any formal role, say they “feel compelled to speak out – as concerned individuals”. For several years now the voice of Ben & Jerry's has been silenced by Unilever, particularly when the brand has tried to speak out about social justice and unjust wars. The letter says: “We believe that the founding values are central to what Ben & Jerry's is, and cannot simply be discarded out of convenience or under political pressure.” Cohen added: “Ben & Jerry's was founded on a simple but radical premise: that our business could thrive and make outstanding products whilst standing up for progressive values. Authenticity has always been at the very heart of what we do, and stripping this away risks destroying the very value of Ben & Jerry's. We urge the board and potential investors to rethink the inclusion of Ben & Jerry's in Magnum's future makeup and establish a Free Ben & Jerry's.” We remain committed to Ben & Jerry's unique three-part mission – product, economic and social – and look forward to building on its success as an iconic, much-loved business.” Last year, Ben & Jerry's social mission board, an entity that is independent from Unilever, launched legal action against Unilever, accusing its parent company of trying to block the ice-cream brand from making public statements supporting Palestinian refugees in the conflict in Gaza. Unilever has rejected the claims and said it would “defend our case very strongly”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard directed the National Security Agency in recent months to recall a classified report about Venezuela – despite agency staff affirming it was accurate and complied with all NSA policies – in a move that has raised major questions inside the intelligence community, according to people familiar with the matter. The classified report related to Venezuela and one of President Donald Trump's special envoys, Richard Grenell, the people said. One of the people said it included conversations that Grenell had with Nicolas Maduro, the leader of Venezuela whom the US has accused of drug trafficking, as well as information about Grenell collected by the National Security Agency. After it was released, an unclassified addendum was added directing staff to “recall this report” at Gabbard's direction. “Please remove the original report from all manual and computer files.” Grenell, who multiple sources said is close with Gabbard, declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the White House and Gabbard's office for comment. A senior intelligence official told CNN that the report was withdrawn over concerns about protecting a person's civil liberties and privacy. GOP officials have long raised concerns about “unmasking” people's identities in intelligence reports, feeling the common practice has been used to target and embarrass them by Democratic administrations. The official said that the White House ordered reduced distribution of Venezuela intelligence reporting a few weeks ago. Updating is often a reason reports are retracted. One US official called the move “highly unusual,” noting that senior intelligence officials typically defer to each agency when it comes to recalling reports of this nature, especially when they involve US persons whose identity is masked. A former official with knowledge of the process questioned why she recalled the intelligence product, rather than taking less intrusive action to limit who could access it. “If it was very sensitive, the usual method would be to increase the classification, which is still not the way it is supposed to be, but it is better than pretending a piece of intelligence doesn't exist,” the former official said. “Plus, the NSA is very rigorous about masking identity for US persons,” the official added, saying that the names of those individuals are typically hidden by default. Intelligence officials have to write a detailed justification, which receives multiple reviews, to get specific identities unmasked just for themselves in a report, they added. Grenell serves as a special envoy for Trump and has at times clashed with the State Department over attempts to release Americans from Venezuela. Shortly after Trump took office, Grenell visited Caracas to meet with Maduro. The surprise visit prompted speculation that the White House might be walking back the “maximum pressure” campaign against Maduro that it had previously pursued. But the episode set up a clash between Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long opposed giving any concessions to Maduro, and Grenell, who was pushing to make deals with the leader. Gabbard has vowed to root out what she has described as politicization of the intelligence community and launched a war on leaks to the media that critics say is hollowing out the intelligence community of needed expertise from experienced professionals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two key figures in the Iran-Contra affair quietly married last month, nearly 40 years after the scandal rocked US politics and President Ronald Reagan's administration. Oliver North married his former secretary, Fawn Hall, on August 27 in Virginia, according to a copy of the marriage certificate obtained by CNN. Reached by phone Tuesday morning, North declined to comment, apart from quoting a line famously delivered by Clark Gable's character in “Gone with the Wind.” “Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,” he told CNN. North, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, was a National Security Council staffer when he gained attention for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. She snuck documents that possibly implicated North's involvement out of the White House by stuffing them in her clothing and shoes, and the two later overfed a paper shredder to the point of it jamming. After the intertwining scandals were revealed in 1986, those involved defended their actions as necessary to secure the release of American hostages in the Middle East and said they facilitated Reagan's anti-communist policy goals in Central and South America. But the sales ran afoul of legislation that limited US government assistance to the Contras, an arms embargo against Iran, and Reagan's previous assurances that the US would not negotiate with terrorists. North was convicted in 1989 on three felony charges, but the convictions were vacated shortly after. News of the marriage was first reported by journalist Michael Isikoff for SpyTalk, a Substack publication focused on national security issues. After his convictions were vacated, North mounted an unsuccessful bid for a US Senate seat in Virginia in 1994 and went on to become a conservative political commentator. He was named president of the National Rifle Association in 2018 before leaving less than a year later amid a power struggle with the organization's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. She was married to Danny Sugerman, manager of the rock band The Doors, from 1993 until his death in 2005. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

Loud explosions were heard in the capital city, with pictures of smoke plumes rising. Israel took responsibility for the strikes, saying that they were targeting Hamas leaders. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. A senior Hamas source told Al Jazeera that Khalil al-Hayya, the leader of Hamas's negotiating team, was not killed in the strike, though Saudi Arabian media put out a conflicting report. This is the first known time that Israel has struck Qatar — a key party in the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas — amid its genocide in Gaza. Just in the past month, Israel has struck at least five Arab countries: Palestine, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Qatar. On Monday, a Gaza-bound aid flotilla was struck by an aerial projectile in a Tunisian port, and activists have pointed the finger at Israel. Israel has also escalated its siege on Gaza City in recent weeks, and ordered an estimated 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City to evacuate on Tuesday. Hamas officials had accepted a separate, similar ceasefire deal put forth by Qatar last month, that Israel never responded to. Israel has been known to sabotage ceasefire deals just as they are reaching completion, effectively prolonging the genocide. Israeli officials have long said that their goal is to take over Gaza, and that they will stop at nothing to achieve this objective. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office claimed full responsibility for the strike in a statement on social media. “Today's action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. The White House has thus far declined to comment. Qatar condemned the strike, saying that it targeted residential buildings where Hamas political officials were staying. “While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Willfully misinterpreting the Bible to justify what passes for “law and order” has only intensified in recent decades. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. In the lead-up to the passage of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, political and religious leaders quoted scripture to justify shutting down food programs and kicking mothers and their babies off public assistance. Instead, they put forward unethical and ahistorical (mis)interpretations and (mis)appropriations of biblical texts to prop up American imperial power and punish the poor in the name of a warped morality. Three decades later, the Trump administration and its theological apologists are working overtime, using Jesus's name and the Bible's contents in even more devastating rounds of immoral biblical (mis)references. Send me” quotation from Isaiah — commonly cited when ordaining faith leaders and including explicit references to marginalized communities impacted by displacement and oppression — to recruit new agents for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, a job that now comes with a $50,000 signing bonus, thanks to Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's former pastor went even further in marrying the Bible to anti-immigrant hatred by saying, “Is the Bible in favor of these ICE raids?… The answer is yes.” He then added: “The Bible does not require wealthy Christian nations to self-immolate for the horrible crime of having a flourishing economy and way of life, all right?

A month earlier, during a speech announcing the bombing of Iran, President Trump exhorted God to bless America's bombs (being dropped on innocent families and children): “And in particular, God, I want to just say, we love you God, and we love our great military. Though many Americans may be increasingly familiar with him, his various companies, and his political impact, many of us have missed the centrality of his version of Christianity and the enigmatic “religious” beliefs that go with it. In Vanity Fair this spring, journalist Zoe Bernard emphasized the central role Thiel has already played in the Christianization of Silicon Valley: “I guarantee you,” one Christian entrepreneur told her, “there are people that are leveraging Christianity to get closer to Peter Thiel.” And that is the problem with our atheist liberal world. Such a worldview couldn't contrast more strongly with the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus demonstrates his preferential option for the poor and his belief in bottom-up strategies rather than top down ones. He served as Trump's liaison to Silicon Valley in his first term. Since then, he has convened and supported a new cohort of conservatives (many of whom also claim a right-wing Christianity), including Vice President J.D. Vance, Trump's Director of Policy Planning Michael Anton, AI and crypto czar billionaire David Sacks, and Elon Musk, who spent a quarter of a billion dollars getting Trump elected the second time around. Thiel is also close to Curtis Yarvin, the fellow who “jokingly” claimed that American society no longer needs poor people and believes they should instead be turned into biofuel. (A worldview that simply couldn't be more incompatible with Christianity's core tenets.) Particularly relevant to recent political (and ideological) developments, especially the military occupation of Washington, D.C., Thiel is also close to Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir and founder of the Cicero Institute, a right-wing think tank behind a coordinated attack on the homeless now sweeping the nation. That's right, there's a throughline from Peter Thiel to President Donald Trump's demand that “the homeless have to move out immediately… FAR from the Capital.” In July, Trump produced an executive order facilitating the removal of housing encampments in Washington, a year after the Supreme Court upheld a law making it a crime, if you don't have a home, to sleep or even breathe outside. On top of this troubling mix of Christianity and billionaires, however, I find myself particularly chagrined that Thiel is offering an oversold four-part lecture series on the “antichrist” through a nonprofit called ACTS 17 collective that is to start in September in San Francisco. In an article at the Denison Forum, she's even more specific about her biblical and theological interpretation of poverty and the need to care for those with more rather than the poor. While social justice movements have done a great deal to point out our society's longstanding sins and call believers to action, it can be tempting for that message to become more prominent than our innate need for Jesus to save us.” Such a statement reminds me of the decades-long theological pushback I lived through even before the passage of welfare reform and the continued juxtaposition of Jesus and justice since. Of course, such a battle for the Bible is anything but new in America. Decades later, segregationists continued to use stray biblical verses to rubber-stamp Jim Crow practices, while the Moral Majority, founded in 1979 by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell, Sr., helped mainstream a new generation of Christian extremists in national politics. A galling example came when Representative Jodey Arrington (R-TX), rebutting a Jewish activist who referenced a commandment in Leviticus to feed the hungry, quoted 2 Thessalonians to justify increasing work requirements for people qualifying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Arrington said: “But there's also, you know, in the Scripture, tells us in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3:10 he says, uh, ‘For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: if a man will not work, he shall not eat.' And then he goes on to say ‘We hear that some among you are idle'… I think it's a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements.” The same passage, in fact, had already been used by Representatives Kevin Cramer (R-ND) and Stephen Lee Fincher (R-TN) to justify cutting food stamps during a debate over an earlier farm bill. And Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) used similarly religious language, categorizing people as deserving and undeserving, to argue against a healthcare plan that protects those of us with pre-existing conditions. He insisted that only “people who lead good lives” and “have done the things to keep their bodies healthy” should receive reduced costs for health care. Such “Christian” politicians regularly misuse Biblical passages to blame the impoverished for their poverty. There is never a suggestion, of course, that the rich, who have functionally stolen people's wages and engorged themselves by denying them healthcare, are in any way to blame. And — though you wouldn't know it from such Republicans — they are counter to the main themes of the Bible's texts. The historical equivalents of anti-poverty programs run through it all. That arc starts in the Book of Exodus with manna (bread) that shows up day after day, so no one has too much or too little. God's plan, on the other hand, was for society to be organized around meeting the needs of all people, including describing how political and religious leaders are supposed to release slaves, forgive debts, pay people what they deserve, and distribute funds to the needy. The biblical arc of justice then continues through the prophets who insist that the way to love and honor God is to promote programs that uplift the poor and marginalized, while decrying those with power who cloak oppression in religious terms and heretical versions of Christian theology. Such a conviction was captured by Reverend Yvonne Delk at the 1992 “Up and Out of Poverty Survival Summit,” when she declared that society, including the church, must move to the position that “poor people are not sinners, but poverty is a sin against God that could and should be ended.” “I represent all of those poor people who are on welfare and many who are not,” she said, “people who believe in the Christian way of life… people whose nickels and dimes and quarters have built the Christian churches of America. If we fail in our struggle, Christianity will have failed.” In a Trumpian world, where Christian extremism is becoming the norm, we must not let the words of Beulah Sanders be forgotten or the worst fears of countless prophets and freedom fighters come true. Rather, we must build the strength to make a theological and spiritual vision of everybody-in-nobody-out a reality and create the capacity, powered by faith, to make it so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The article was updated with comments by U.S. President Donald Trump. Zarutska had fled Kyiv in 2022 seeking safety from Russia's full-scale invasion, and was described by family members as hoping for a new beginning. “This is an irreparable loss for her family,” a GoFundMe campaign started by Zarutska's aunt states. Police arrested 34-year-old Decarlos Brown at the scene and charged him with first-degree murder. Brown's criminal record showed a long history of arrests dating back to 2011, with 14 prior court cases and a six-year North Carolina prison sentence for convictions including robbery with a dangerous weapon. Court records show Brown displayed signs of mental illness earlier this year, and his public defender has filed a motion questioning his competency to stand trial. U.S. President Donald Trump called the attack "horrible" when asked about the case by reporters on Sept. 7, adding he would "know all about it tomorrow morning." In a subsequent statement the following day, Trump called Zarutska a "beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious war in Ukraine" before she was attacked by a "mentally deranged lunatic." This incident comes just weeks after a 16-year-old Ukrainian refugee was fatally pushed in front of a freight train in Friedland, Germany, on Aug. 11.

"Therefore it is vital that we use this window of opportunity that we have while Russia is bogged down in Ukraine to strengthen NATO's northern flank,"  Sweden's defense minister Pal Jonson said. "We aim for 100% by October," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in reference to the 2 million pledged artillery shells. According to the agency, Ukrainian forces destroyed a 48Ya6-K1 Podlet low-altitude radar and an RLM-M module from the 55Zh6M Nebo-M air defense complex. Three oil and gas pipelines in Russia were knocked out of service in a series of explosions on Sept. 8, a Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) source told the Kyiv Independent. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow's plans could cost "years and a million people," or even "two or three million corpses" if Russia accelerates its offensive. Polish President Karol Nawrocki said that a country cannot join NATO while at war and that "today's discussion about Ukraine's membership in the European Union is premature."

TUNIS, September 9. /TASS/. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak proposed to new Syrian authorities to resume the work of the intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation at an extended meeting of the Russian delegation with Syrian officials in Damascus. The video was published by the Syrian state TV channel Al Ikhbariya.

"We propose to resume the work of the intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation, which has proven itself to be a good tool for expanding our relations, primarily in the economic area," he said.

"We are also discussing practical possibilities for providing assistance to Syria together with our partners in the region, with Qatar in particular, in terms of humanitarian supplies and the restoration of the energy sector," Novak added. "We confirm our readiness to launch a number of projects aimed at providing Syria with food, fuel, and pharmaceutical products both on a commercial basis and as part of humanitarian aid," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He served as Director of the National Economic Council from 2021 to 2023. The United States faces an energy crunch of historic proportions. After nearly 20 years of flat demand, electricity use is now growing at its fastest rate since World War II. New manufacturing facilities, such as those making semiconductors, and the data centers that undergird the country's artificial intelligence ambitions consume unprecedented amounts of electricity. The surge in electricity demand is not inherently a problem. It reflects the technology-fueled progress that electrification can deliver. Although the United States must build new power plants, these alone cannot produce enough electricity fast enough to meet skyrocketing demand. Another solution, however, is readily available: squeezing more out of the existing electric system. This is because the U.S. electric system was engineered for moments of intense demand—the rare episodes of extreme heat or cold when the need for electricity peaks—not for delivering power to consumers in the cheapest and most efficient way. What has resulted is a system full of inefficiencies and lost potential. Utilities, energy companies, and grid operators need to shift their focus from maximizing energy output to prioritizing improvements that will lower prices and increase reliability for consumers. For decades, the United States enjoyed a relative energy advantage. Electricity prices for industrial users ran at roughly half those for European competitors, and American households and businesses benefited from the United States' vast energy resources. Retail electricity prices in 2025 have increased at nearly twice the rate of overall inflation. Consumers are already feeling the pain: in an April survey run by PowerLines, a consumer education nonprofit, two out of three Americans indicated that utility bills are a source of financial stress. U.S. power markets are failing to hold enough spare power to prevent blackouts when demand surges, such as on very hot or cold days. This year, nine out of 13 power markets in the United States are expected to fall below a critical reliability threshold, which marks the level at which the supply of spare power is considered sufficient to avoid outages. The global economy is entering an era in which a few new or rapidly growing high-tech industries, including AI, innovative energy technologies, and cutting-edge semiconductors, will drive economic growth. Leading the world in these sectors requires an electric system that can power them. But even at this record pace, supply from new power generation alone cannot keep up with rising demand because of supply chain constraints and regulatory bottlenecks. New natural gas plants are being delayed until the 2030s because of a 50-month backlog for natural gas turbines, and new nuclear power plants can take more than a decade to get off the ground. Washington's recent tax and spending law, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, also raises costs by curtailing federal incentives for new sources of renewable power. The United States can meet staggering demand, however, without technological moonshots, long time horizons, or hefty price tags. In the twentieth century, with limited energy generation technologies and few ways to easily improve efficiency, the goal was to build as many new power plants as possible. Policymakers rewarded utilities, which have a regional monopoly over electricity and whose profits are determined by regulators, on the basis of how much new capital they deployed rather than how well the system performed. Over the past two decades, energy developers have also largely adopted an install-and-forget approach: maximizing upfront capital investments while ignoring the expense of ongoing servicing and maintenance. Performance has deteriorated as well: outages increased by 60 percent from 2013 to 2023. The electric system is underperforming because utilities and energy companies don't get rewarded for making the existing system operate more efficiently or adopting new technologies that could render outdated systems obsolete. But when policymakers change incentives and remove regulatory barriers for utilities and energy companies to adopt better technology, electric systems work better. Texas is an example of how to get this right. Yet despite this growth, Texas is not facing an energy crisis. Electricity prices are falling, and grid reliability is increasing. This includes connecting new power plants to the grid quickly; installing batteries to store more of the resulting cheap, clean electricity and then releasing it to the grid when demand spikes; and requiring new large-scale electricity users to operate flexibly when connecting to the grid so that the system takes full advantage of its existing capacity without stretching beyond its breaking point. Unlike other operators that force new power generators to wait years before they can plug into the grid, Texas's grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, uses a “connect and manage” model that connects new plants to the grid and then handles congestion by managing their operations in real time. Between 2021 and 2023, the state added at least 70 percent more capacity than any other market, almost all of it cheap, clean energy. Texas is also the fastest-growing market for energy storage: last year, the state deployed more new battery capacity than California—enough to power around three million homes. At a national level, estimates have shown that if power-hungry consumers such as data centers shift when they consume energy just a quarter of one percent of the time, it could increase the United States' effective production capacity by ten percent without building new infrastructure. When utilities connect these systems to one another and operate them in concert, they can act like a power plant built from technology rather than steel and concrete. The idea of a distributed power plant is not new. Starting in the 1970s, when the United States faced a wave of energy crises, utilities in states such as New Hampshire used phone calls and physical switches to coordinate thousands of water heaters to manage electricity demand. Today, basic communications technology such as WiFi and Bluetooth make connecting these assets even easier. Integrating them into the grid is far faster and cheaper than building a new physical power plant because these systems are already in place and paid for. In New York, the energy company ConEdison's $200 million investment to tap into distributed energy sources allowed it to bypass $1.2 billion in physical infrastructure upgrades. Projections by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that scaling distributed power plants could meet 100 percent of the projected growth in national electricity demand by 2030. Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it. Beyond building more transmission lines, increasing the transmission capacity of existing infrastructure with new and proven technologies can save billions of dollars in electricity costs each year. Sensors and software installed in wires can adjust electricity flows, which can add 20 percent or more additional capacity by enabling wires to safely carry more electricity when weather conditions allow. These upgrades do not require the same permitting process as new construction, meaning they can be deployed in months, not years, at a fraction of the cost. Real-world trials show they can be successful in the United States, too. One recent deployment of grid sensors in Indiana and Ohio took only nine months to install, increased capacity by more than 50 percent, and cost just one percent of the price of building new transmission lines. Other states are also beginning to see the potential of these new technologies. The looming energy crisis requires federal, regional, and state policymakers to embrace reforms that put consumers first and let efficient solutions win. In Washington, the agency tasked with overseeing the United States' electric system, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has for years asked utilities and grid operators to consider reforms to boost efficiency and upgrade their technology. When utilities and grid operators push back, FERC generally relents. Today's electricity supply crunch offers a perfect moment to break the cycle. FERC should use its rule-making power to make interconnection reforms mandatory, provide clear timelines for upgrades, and levy harsh penalties for underperformance to ensure that capacity grows everywhere as quickly as it has in Texas. It should require that reforms put storage and distributed energy systems on a level playing field with physical power plants to determine which sources produce power at the lowest cost. FERC should also aggressively encourage grid planners to upgrade wires and transmission technology. Policymakers and utilities alike have stalled for too long and claimed reforms are too hard, but in the face of skyrocketing demand, such excuses ring hollow. Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about efficiency, it is unfortunately pursuing a regulatory approach that increases uncertainty and reduces investment. State policymakers also have an important role to play because state public utility commissions set many of the policies that govern utilities. For decades, the public has not paid attention to these institutions; this has empowered some utilities and their lobbyists to stymie attempts at reform. Facing rising prices, both state policymakers and citizens can no longer ignore these institutions. In New Jersey, where electricity rates for households have increased by up to 20 percent this year, both Democratic and Republican candidates in the governor's race have centered their campaigns on rising energy costs. Governors in other mid-Atlantic states, in which prices are rising because of constraints on new sources of power generation, are calling for interconnection reforms similar to those in Texas that allow projects to connect to the grid quickly. And just this month, Mike Braun, the governor of Indiana, appointed a new Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents consumer interests against investor-owned utilities, and directed her to evaluate utilities' profits to lower rates in the state. These reforms will help Americans as workers and consumers. Squeezing more value out of existing energy systems requires investing in the skilled tradespeople who can improve them. Upgrading energy infrastructure is labor-intensive, technical work that relies on electricians, line workers, HVAC technicians, and power engineers, not software alone. And research has shown that skilled field trades like those that service the electric system stand to be augmented, not replaced, by artificial intelligence tools such as predictive maintenance and remote diagnostics. But when it comes to energy, a set of solutions are at hand that can deliver cheaper and more reliable power right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, September 9. Russia resolutely condemns Western attempts to remove Milorad Dodik, the president of Republika Srpska, from office, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference following talks with Dodik. "We strongly condemn attempts to oust Serbian leaders, those not aligned with the West, by fabricating charges against them. I mean our vis-a-vis, our friend and the legitimate president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik," Russia's top diplomat said. Lavrov said he was outraged to see Dodik the victim of these attempts. "And the `crime' as per Mr. Schmidt (German Cristian Schmidt, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina - TASS) is that Mr. Dodik has disobeyed Mr. Schmidt's orders and decisions," he explained. "It's hard to imagine that in a normal law-governed state, a self-appointed gauleiter, talking about Germany, would actually try and usurp power in a sovereign state whose rights were very clearly outlined in UN Security Council decisions," Lavrov added. On August 28, the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina scheduled early presidential elections in the Republika Srpska for November 23. This was preceded by the commission's decision to terminate Dodik's powers in the wake of his being found guilty of ignoring Schmidt's decisions. In response, the president announced that a referendum on confidence in the republic's leadership would be held on October 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This transaction aligns with our strategy of owning and operating the assets that are core to our business,” Cenovus chief executive Jon McKenzie said in a news release Tuesday. After the sale of its 50 per cent stake in WRB Refining LP, Cenovus will have a refining business comprised of assets that it controls and are well integrated with its vast oilsands operations in Alberta, McKenzie said. The operations in Wood River, Ill., and Borger, Texas, can churn out 495,000 barrels per day, 247,500 of which belong to Cenovus. Once the deal is complete, Cenovus said its downstream business will have total crude throughput capacity of 472,800 barrels per day. Cenovus shares rose about 2.6 per cent to $22.70 in late morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The refinery deal comes as Cenovus looks to take over its smaller oilsands peer MEG Energy Inc. MEG-T with a cash-and-stock offer worth almost $8-billion including debt. The two companies have side-by-side operations at Christina Lake, south of Fort McMurray, Alta., and have touted the cost savings and efficiencies that could be achieved by joining forces. MEG has agreed to the friendly Cenovus offer, but still faces a hostile all-stock bid from fellow oilsands operator Strathcona Resources.

ABU, Yamaguchi — A small coastal town will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the creation of its jazz concert that invites world-renowned jazz musicians to perform live in Yamaguchi Prefecture. This year's concert features Nicki Parrott, a bassist known for her silky-sweet tones, as a main performer. With Masumoto taking the lead, it hosted the Concord Jazz Festival in Japan for 10 consecutive years since 2005, inviting renowned musicians such as trumpet player Terumasa Hino. The 2023 festival was jeopardized due to the passing of Takao Ishizuka, the president of a Tokyo promotion company that had been a long-time collaborator in bringing renowned overseas musicians to the town's festival. Masumoto overcame this crisis by personally appealing to famous jazz pianist Makoto Ozone. The festival will start at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 12 at the Abu citizens center's cultural hall that has a capacity of 500. Parrott, from Australia, has performed at jazz festivals in Europe, the United States and at the 2022 Concord festival. The two-hour concert will feature many standard numbers including “Autumn Leaves.” Female musicians active in places like Tokyo will be on piano, guitar, saxophone and drums. “It's a small concert in a tiny town hall but presents world-class performances,” Masumoto said. All seats are reserved, and admission is ¥6,000. Popular articles in the past month Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. CELESTE A. WALLANDER is Executive Director of Penn Washington and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. She was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and oversaw U.S. military assistance to Ukraine during the Biden administration. Summits between heads of state are high-stakes gambles to achieve breakthrough solutions. And U.S. President Donald Trump's summit last month in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin is of this mold: it strengthened Putin, and in doing so has prolonged both the war in Ukraine and his hold on power. The meeting in Anchorage has parallels to the 1986 summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland. Then, as now, an American leader and a Russian one met to resolve a major foreign policy challenge—in 1986, ending an arms race, and last month, ending the war in Ukraine. The talks in Iceland collapsed when Reagan refused to scuttle his Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed program that would neutralize Soviet nuclear missiles before they struck their targets. Alaska ended without a deal to end Russia's invasion. Trump rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader in Anchorage and spoke gushingly of their “fantastic relationship.” Putin made no concessions, and Trump shifted the responsibility for ending the fighting to Ukraine: “Now it is really up to President Zelensky to get it done,” he said in an interview with Fox News. Although Putin did not face any strong opposition before Alaska, he now enjoys a glow of success for, by all appearances, having won over the American president. According to a late August survey by the independent Russian polling firm Levada, 79 percent of Russians view the summit as a success for Putin, and 51 percent are more optimistic for an improvement in relations with the United States. After the summit, Russian media did not have to put out false pronouncements to highlight Putin's diplomatic triumph: it broadcast the real event, along with Western commentary on Putin's victory. Stronger than ever, Putin can continue his war against Ukraine for as long as it takes to win on his terms. The Soviet military was bogged down in Afghanistan, a conflict that Gorbachev called “a bleeding wound,” and incompetent central planning was dragging down the Soviet Union's economic growth rate. Gorbachev promised hard-liners and reformists alike that he would fix these grave issues. Yet he promised to do so not by fundamentally changing the Soviet system. Rather than upend the party's central control, he would secure new resources by improving relations with the West, which would allow Moscow to curtail defense spending and ramp up economic modernization. To that end, Gorbachev asked the Politburo to support negotiations with Washington on limiting each side's stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons. The Soviet security elite agreed to back an agreement, but only if the Americans disavowed defenses against strategic nuclear weapons as part of it. The offense-defense balance, they warned, could not tip in Washington's favor. The world watched on television in real time as Reagan refused to cancel his Strategic Defense Initiative and Gorbachev left empty-handed. Gorbachev faced a divided leadership with competing demands on him. In 1987, Gorbachev agreed to sign an Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Reagan even though it did not constrain Washington's missile defenses. He pushed aside the Politburo's conservatives and began leaning more on moderate leaders and advisers, especially Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Over the next several years, Gorbachev pursued a sweeping series of economic and political changes that allowed for quasi-private businesses and greater autonomy for the 15 constituent Soviet republics, Russia included. But instead of unleashing an economic dynamism that would silence his opponents, Gorbachev's changes broke the Soviet system without creating a functional new one. Food lines grew longer, Soviet cities were shaken by hunger riots, and wage payments began to fall behind. And by weakening the tools of Soviet political control, he opened up space for nationalist movements and leaders, including Boris Yeltsin in Russia, to gain strength. Eventually, these movements overwhelmed what was left of a decaying state. Putin does not answer to a Politburo or any powerful committee: he presides over a personalist authoritarian system in which he is the sole source of power. And it's unclear how the Russian elite might respond if circumstances forced Putin to cut off their economic benefits. So far, the president has managed these risks well. Instead, the country's skilled economic leaders managed to keep growth above four percent last year, buoyed by high defense spending. It is hard to gauge accurate public opinion in an authoritarian police state, but there are no outward signs that discontent within the elite or society at large threatens Putin's rule. Still, extensive government spending to strengthen the economy has led to high inflation—nearly ten percent in 2024 and over eight percent this year. And Putin's war carries significant opportunity costs for Russia. Russia can sell oil to China and India, but its limited access to global markets means it does so at a discount. True, he did not secure agreement to some long-standing demands or the business deals that the Trump administration had hinted at. But in the eyes of Russia's elite and ordinary citizens, he succeeded nonetheless. He delayed and has possibly entirely avoided new crushing sanctions on Russian oil. And he reminded the world that Moscow stands resolute in its demands that Ukraine cede not just territory but its autonomy and sovereignty as well. Trump did nothing to push back against this narrative. Indeed, the American president appears to have accepted Putin's contention that Moscow should have a say over Ukrainian territorial integrity and Western security guarantees. For Putin, the summit was never about pursuing peace in Ukraine. Since his first incursions into Ukraine in 2014, Putin has played the long game. He has always believed that time is on his side.
