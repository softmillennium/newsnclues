Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content. France returns to action in Group D of the World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday, with Iceland visiting the Parc des Princes in a matchup that could shape the early race for qualification. Both nations opened their group campaigns with victories and sit level on three points. Les Bleus looked solid in their opener, defeating Ukraine 2–0 on Friday. The performance underlined France's defensive organization and attacking efficiency, though Didier Deschamps will want his side to be more clinical in front of goal as the qualifiers progress. Iceland, meanwhile, announced itself with authority in a 5–0 rout of Azerbaijan. For France, the stakes are about maintaining momentum and avoiding the kind of slip-ups that can complicate qualification campaigns. Iceland, however, enters with nothing to lose and the motivation of testing itself against one of Europe's elite sides. Live stream France vs Iceland on FS2 with Fubo: Start your subscription now!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England face their toughest World Cup qualifier when they travel to Serbia on Tuesday night. The Three Lions will step out at the Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade in front of what is expected to be a fiery atmosphere. Thomas Tuchel's men are top of Group K with four wins from four, but Serbia is hot on their heels in second place. Only the group winner is guaranteed a place in the 2026 World Cup, and second place will enter a play-off. A win for England would almost guaratee their spot in USA, Mexico and Canada. There are a couple of familiar faces in the Serbia starting XI Nottingham Forest defender Nikola Milenkovic starts at centre-back and star striker Dusan Vlahovic, who is regularly linked with Premier League clubs, leads the line. Serbia starting XI: Petrovic; Erakovic, Milenkovic, Pavlovic; Maksimovic, Nedelkovic, Ilic, Lukic, Birmancevic; Zivkovic, Vlahovic England starting XI (4-2-3-1): Pickford; James, Konsa, Gueki, Livramento; Rice, Anderson; Gordon, Rogers, Madueke; Kane England will need to be much better than they were against Andorra at the weekend. Football fans have made their early predictions for the 2026 World Cup and 32% of voters in Betfair's poll picked Spain to lift the Jules Rimet Trophy next year. The two England legends clashed over the past week, with Michael Owen claiming it was "nuts" that Harry Kane moved to Bayern Munich with the Premier League all-time goalscoring record well within reach. Obviously he is a Premier League great and an England great as well so I'll respect him as a person. "I know he was insinuating I went just for the trophy but it was to be at the highest level for as long as possible and I'm really happy in that sense of playing big games, title runs, big Champions League matches, Club World Cup quarterfinal. It's hard not to hear things these days but the decisions are best for me and I'm really happy that I made that decision and very happy at Bayern Munich now." Harry Kane has declared that England are prepared to walk off the pitch should any of his team-mates suffer racist abuse this evening. UEFA have the protocols in place for us to follow. "We're talking about something that's not happened yet. We'll take every in our stride, everything as it comes. Some early team news has been leaked today with reports suggesting that Arsenal youngster Myles Lewis-Skelly has been axed from the squad. It is claimed that Newcastle full-back Tino Livramento will be handed a starting berth. But his club team-mate Dan Burn is apparently set to be dropped for Ezri Konsa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The North Carolina Courage have agreed to trade U.S. midfielder Jaedyn Shaw to NJ/NY Gotham FC for a record $1.25 million transfer fee, more than doubling the previous record set last month, multiple sources confirmed to The Athletic. The trade was first reported by ESPN on Monday night. The transfer fee for Shaw is set to be more than double the intra-league record previously set when Kansas City Current in August paid $600,000 to the Utah Royals for midfielder Ally Sentnor, another rising U.S. national team star. A source with knowledge of the deal indicated the fee will be paid over multiple instalments and entirely with intra-league transfer funds. Gotham plans to sign Shaw on a contract through 2029. Both Gotham and the Courage declined to comment when reached for this story. The club has struggled with creativity in their attack this year. With Shaw, the club will now have a versatile attacker known for her playmaking abilities. The 20-year-old provides an unexpected boost to the 2023 NWSL Champions, as they continue their playoff push and look ahead to a calendar riddled with intercontinental competitions. Considering the length of Shaw's contract and hefty transfer fee, it's likely Gotham envisions Shaw as a foundational piece of their system moving forward. Shaw signed with the Courage in January and was under contract through 2026. The Texas native arrived in North Carolina from San Diego Wave, after expressing her desire for a new challenge. With the Courage, Shaw scored three goals and recorded one assist across 19 appearances. In August, the Courage abruptly fired former head coach Sean Nahas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be the venue for a March friendly match between the United States men's national team and Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal, according to multiple sources. FIFA's two-match March window is the last before participating World Cup teams are required to submit their final 26-player rosters for the tournament. The Portugal match in Atlanta could coincide with the opening of U.S. Soccer's new $200 million-plus training facility in nearby Fayetteville, which is scheduled to open its doors this spring. The USMNT will train at the sprawling, 200-acre, state-of-the-art complex in May and early June before leaving for its World Cup base camp in Southern California. The Americans kick off their three-game group stage slate on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles against an opponent to be determined at December's draw. Both teams are owned by billionaire Home Depot founder Arthur Blank, who contributed $50 million toward the USSF training ground that bears his name. Blank's company also operates the $2 billion retractable roof stadium, which opened in 2017. Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host eight matches at the 2026 World Cup. Only AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas will have more. While the USMNT in particular often has to contend with opposing fans outnumbering its own in major American cities, Atlanta has a proven history when it comes to supporting the home side. Last year, the U.S. women's national team drew more than 50,000 fans to The Benz, setting a new record for a USWNT friendly. 6-ranked national team, won the UEFA Nations League title earlier this summer. The U.S. and Portugal played to a 1-1 tie at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, with Ronaldo setting up a stoppage time equalizer for his country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON — The FIFA World Cup is coming to North America next year and fans will soon get their chance at purchasing tickets to some of the games. Once registration ends on Friday, Sept. 19, there will be a randomized selection process to select fans who will be able to purchase their tickets. This presale drawing is only available for Visa cardholders. You can check if your Visa card qualifies and create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets. Starting Monday, Sept. 29, successful applicants will be notified by email that they've been selected, and will be given a time to purchase the tickets. While tickets for all 104 matches will be put on sale, receiving a timeslot does not guarantee tickets will be available. A second phase, called an early ticket draw, likely will run from Oct. 27-31, with purchase timeslots from mid-November to early December. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. FIFA said tickets will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform. Sales will be capped at four tickets per person per match, with no person being able to purchase more than 40 for the totality of the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan star Petar Sucic refuses to get distracted by next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America. Petar Sucic spent 70 minutes on the pitch last night as Croatia thumped Montenegro 4-0 at Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium. In doing so, Zlatko Dalic's side maintained their 100% win ratio in the ongoing World Cup qualifying campaign. Despite sitting level on points with the Czech Republic in Group L, the Croats have a game in hand. Therefore, they are in pole position to qualify for next summer's competition in North America. For the moment, he remains focused on his commitments in Serie A and the Champions League. CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA – JUNE 30: Petar Sucic #8 of FC Internazionale Milano passes the ball during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 round of 16 match between FC Internazionale Milano and Fluminense FC at Bank of America Stadium on June 30, 2025 in Charlotte, North Carolina. “It was a great victory,” Sucic said after last night's rout of Montenegro. “We dominated and secured six points from these two matches, which was our goal, and we didn't concede any goals. Asked whether he ever thinks about performing at the World Cup, Sucic replied: “Well, no, honestly, I have a lot of commitments with the club [Inter] and the national team right now. Then, Sucic praised AC Milan newcomer Luka Modric. “I'm happy to play every single minute with him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kasey Keller questions Mauricio Pochettino's 'plan' for the USMNT as they are defeated 2-0 by South Korea. Well, it's not like U.S. men's national team fans were happy for all of 2024. But then U.S. Soccer decided to move on from head coach Gregg Berhalter, and fans were pleased. Pochettino continues to baffle all of us with roster decisions, and there are, like, three or four or maybe five players who I would confidently say will make next summer's World Cup roster. Beyond Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tyler Adams, and Antonee Robinson, everything is in flux. And if it's not in flux -- and Pochettino is just experimenting with new players while maintaining a settled roster in his mind -- then we still haven't seen that settled roster, and we certainly haven't seen it play well. So, instead of trying to read through Pochettino's confusing messaging and even more confusing roster decisions, let's just take a look at the entire player pool. The main purpose of our USMNT PPI is to look at which players are playing a lot, which players are playing for good teams, and then combine those two aspects. Unfortunately, we're only two or three games into the European soccer season, so we're both still learning the quality of each team and working with an incredibly limited sample of minutes. A player's playing time through the first three matches of the season isn't irrelevant, but it also doesn't tell us much. So, for this early-season edition of the rankings, team quality -- as represented by the team's rating in Opta's power rankings -- accounts only for 15% of the input, while playing time (percentage of your team's available minutes) gets just 5%. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Player valuations are not one-to-one proxies for player quality -- older players get pinged here, as do players with one year left on their deals -- but doing ratings after just three games is pretty much all projection, and these valuations are a version of that. So, who didn't make it this time around? We know that Pochettino's view of the USMNT player pool differs greatly from conventional wisdom, and this is evidence of that. Beyond these names, Patrick Agyemang and Brandon Vázquez, two potential center forward options, have both been left off due to injuries. Matt Turner, too, only just switched teams and started playing soccer again, so he's also not in the top 50. - USMNT transfer grades: Turner, Reyna, Weah and every move - Predicting success or failure when aging stars swap Europe for MLS - Carlisle: Pochettino's latest USMNT roster a head-scratcher He has played only about half of the available minutes under new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri, but we're talking about only two games. With the previously indestructible Robinson recovering from an injury for a middling Fulham team, there's really no competition for the No. 1 spot at this early stage of the season. Robinson was arguably the best left back in the Premier League last season -- he finally paired his unmatched defensive activity with high-level attacking production, and that was all backed up by elite athleticism and constant availability. But after offseason surgery, Robinson has played only 50 minutes or so this season. Was he good enough to start for a top-20 team in the world? He scored in his first start before the international break, but then Leverkusen fired manager Erik ten Hag after only two league matches. While most stats are misleading at best at this point in the season, Cardoso's performance on the ball for Atletico so far this season does a nice job of summing up the kind of player he currently is. Cardoso has played the ninth-most minutes for manager Diego Simeone thus far, and he's created the 12th-most expected possession value, which represents how much a player increased or decreased his team's chances of scoring a goal. But he also hasn't lost any value in any individual area, whether it's through passing, defending, crossing or dribbling. In other words, he's something like an average LaLiga midfielder who isn't going to do anything that hurts you -- even if his USMNT appearances suggest otherwise. My theory is that he looks terrible in training, where coaches are more focused on technical precision and on-ball impact. In games, though, his fantastic off-ball movement eventually shines through. McKennie has been at Juventus since 2020, and the club has finished outside of Italy's top four just once over that stretch. McKennie has played at least 1,300 Serie A minutes for the club in every season except 2022-23, the year they finished seventh. Musah played 90 minutes for AC Milan in their second match of the season ... and then he was loaned out to Atalanta just two days later. Playing midfield for Bournemouth involves two things: (1) watching your teammates boot the ball over your head, and (2) cleaning up whatever chaos might ensue. While Adams is almost irrelevant on the ball for Andoni Iraola, I do think his loose-ball skills make it a little easier for Bournemouth to embrace the chaos that has made them such a hard out over the past two seasons. After all, they lost their two starting center backs (Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi) to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, their starting left back (Milos Kerkez) is now starting at Liverpool, and they've still managed to win two of their first three Premier League matches this season. Adams is one of the lone defensive leftovers from a team that almost qualified for the Champions League last year. The emergence of Mika Biereth last season seemed like it might marginalize Balogun this season, but manager Adi Hütter seems comfortable starting them together. Balogun has played almost every minute of Monaco's last two matches; he's attempted five shots and scored one goal. More of that from here on out, and he should be starting next summer. No one else in the player pool is capable of doing that -- especially not for a team as good as PSV. Sure, he has some weaknesses on the defensive end. But in possession, the U.S. has never had a player like Dest. This loan seemed like it might accomplish two things that could overcome the completely toxic environment that it looks like Roberto De Zerbi is building in France: (1) get Weah starter's minutes, and (2) get Weah serious playing time on the wing. As for the second part, here's a heat map of his touches: He's a victim of the early-season ratings leaning so much on market values. And among Crystal Palace's three center backs, the consensus seems to be that Richards is the third-most important after Marc Guéhi and Maxence Lacroix. But he has played every minute of every match so far, and Opta's ratings currently have Palace as the ninth-best team in the world. We, unfortunately, won't get to see CCV in the Champions League this year. Celtic were eliminated on penalties in the qualifying round by Kazakhstan's champions, FC Kairat Almaty. Will we see him on another USMNT roster before next summer? Luna has become a fan- and manager-favorite with the USMNT this summer, but he has regressed in MLS this season. He's played every minute of every Ligue 1 match, and Lyon are tied with PSG on both points and goal differential through games. He has to get called back into a USMNT camp at some point ... right? Paredes and Wiley have combined for zero minutes so far this season. He only just turned 21 and he's already played nearly 6,000 professional minutes for a team that has finished no lower than third in the Croatian league since 2020-21. Through five matches this season, he has a team-leading three goals. Here are the top 10 Americans in MLS for expected possession value added from open play: Some thoughts on that chart: Sullivan is breaking out. The Rapids got rid of Djordje Mihailovic during this season? There are too many inconsistencies with Mauricio Pochettino's management of the USMNT roster to count, but let's toss another one onto the pile. Some of that may have been due to Seattle's presence in the Club World Cup this past summer, but Roldan only even made the current roster as a last-second addition. After wrecking his ankle last February, Sands has played all but four minutes for St. Pauli this season, and he leads the team in combined tackles and interceptions. There's probably too much depth in this position for him to crack the World Cup roster, but you'd think consistent minutes in the Bundesliga might be enough for him to get one last look. I continue to not really understand what he's doing! Here it is: Proof that U.S. Soccer occasionally, randomly, and arbitrarily, uses the PPI to figure out who they should call up as part of the next roster.</p>

The 2026 World Cup takes place across three host nations - USA, Canada and Mexico - from June 11 to July 19. It will be the biggest yet, with 48 nations taking part - 16 more than in Qatar 2022. The three host nations qualify automatically, while nations from the confederations of UEFA (Europe), CONMEBOL (South America), CONCACAF (North/Central America and Caribbean), AFC (Asia), OFC (Oceania) and CAF (Africa) stage their own qualifying campaigns. Twelve group winners will progress directly from the qualifying stage, with Thomas Tuchel's England aiming to top Group K. Sixteen teams - 12 group runners-up and four further teams based on their Nations League ranking - will enter four play-off paths, with each providing a further spot at the finals. Outside of Europe, CAF gets nine spots at the World Cup and AFC has eight. There will be a minimum of six each from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, while OFC has one guaranteed slot for the first time. Two final slots will be filled through an inter-confederation play-off. A tournament involving six teams will take place in March 2026: one team per confederation apart from UEFA, plus one additional team from the confederation of the host countries. Keep track below of who has reached the showpiece tournament. President Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Women's National Team player pool had quite the productive weekend in the NWSL and European leagues, some of which have kicked off new seasons, with others about to begin in the coming weeks. Five USWNT players — who have been capped in 2025 — scored for their club teams. That includes a brace from forward Trinity Rodman. She notched her first goal in the 33rd minute with a valiant volley far out of reach for the Reign goalkeeper. The second in the 81st minute followed another well-placed pass — this time from USWNT midfielder Croix Bethune. According to Opta, since returning from a back injury in August, Rodman has attempted the most shots of any other NWSL player, 23, across all competitions. Her five goals in that span are second only to six from Ludmila, NWSL's Player of the Month for August. Rodman has three goals in NWSL play and five across all competitions. Over the summer, Yohannes transferred to OL Lyonnes from Ajax Amsterdam, joining fellow USWNT players Lindsey Heaps and Korbin Albert. 1 finish last season, OL Lyonnes was one of four teams to win in the opening weekend. The Houston Dash had a 1-0 lead over the San Diego Wave, but just before halftime, Yazmeen Ryan made it 2-0. In the 45th minute, Ryan slammed a short left-footed strike high above the Wave goalkeeper's reach. Ryan and company finished the match 3-0 against No. 3-ranked Wave in front of Alex Morgan after the Wave and USWNT legend retired her jersey for the club. It was Ryan's second goal of the season and second in the last few games. Lavelle scored her first goal of the 2025 regular season in a 3-1 victory against Angel City FC. Lavelle cleaned up a goalkeeper deflection and knocked in the rebound with a diving right-footed shot. Lavelle missed some time to start the season, rehabbing from ankle surgery in December 2024. She returned this summer and has played a total of nine NWSL games. The former World Cup winner also recorded an assist in her previous outing against the Orlando Pride. The North Carolina Courage and Utah Royals were deadlocked for almost 90 minutes, but late-game theatrics resulted in a 1-1 scoreline. That would have been the end of it if not for the Royals' equalizer that Paige Monaghan scored in stoppage time (90+4). The Courage currently sits in No. 11 in the standings, four points behind No.</p>
