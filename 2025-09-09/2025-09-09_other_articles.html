                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sul Ross State University is proud to celebrate Language and Literature faculty member Robin Alvarez on the release of her highly anticipated new book, “Paramour,” published Sept. 9. “Paramour” has been praised by Kirkus Reviews, which gave the novel its coveted “Get it” verdict and will feature the book in the October edition of Kirkus Reviews Magazine. Chao (Shanghai Immortal) also lauded Alvarez's work, writing: “Alvarez weaves elements of old school urban fantasy faves like Buffy, Supernatural and True Blood … into this heartwarming and bittersweet tale of grief, loss, redemption, and the enduring power of love.” The story follows Sadie, a banshee on the run from hunters and her past, who must decide whether to risk losing control to protect the people she loves. As part of the book's launch, Alvarez will appear as a featured author at the Forever Twilight in Forks Festival in Washington state on Sept. 12, where she will sign books and meet Stephanie Meyer, author of the Twilight series and an inspiration for Alvarez's own writing. “Getting to launch ‘Paramour' at such a landmark celebration of Twilight's 20th anniversary feels surreal,” Alvarez said in a news release. “To meet Stephanie Meyer and share this story with fans who love paranormal romance as much as I do is a dream come true.” Alvarez is also the author of the #1 New Release “When Oceans Rise” and editor of “Monsters in Masquerade,” an OwlCrate anthology. Her work often highlights emotive characters, supernatural elements, and a multiracial perspective. Alvarez lives in West Texas with her family, where she balances writing, teaching and adventures with her children.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Texas man has been charged with murder following a game in which he and his friend took turns shooting each other in the head with rifles while wearing Kevlar helmets. On 17 August, good friends Sean O'Donnell (37) and Aaron Prout (34) were hanging out in the former's home when they decided to play a very stupid and dangerous game – taking turns shooting each other in the head with a rifle while wearing a Kevlar helmet for protection. In this particular case, the two friends, who had been drinking, were reportedly holding the Kevlar helmet above their heads while the other tried to aim at it with a rifle. All it took was for one of them to miss their shot by a few millimeters to turn their friendly game into a tragedy. Originally, authorities believed that his wounds were accidentally self-inflicted, but a subsequent investigation would reveal that they had been caused by his friend while trying to shoot at the Kevlar helmet above Prout's head. Despite O'Donnell's attempts at covering up his tragic mistake, the evidence against him was irrefutable. “The defendant and his friend were playing with guns. They were holding it above their heads until the complainant ended up with a bullet hole in the top of his head.” Aaron Prout had served in the Royal Marines for 10 years before moving to Texas. It's a tragedy that someone lost their life, but this story once again confirms that the saying “play stupid games, collect stupid prizes” holds true.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout multiple public shocks—Manchester Arena, Route 91 Harvest, Astroworld—iHeartMedia/Clear Channel surfaced as more than a broadcaster. Documents reveal the company served as a central hub for emotional amplification, broadcasting carefully curated grief messaging that synchronized with corporate and legal strategic timelines. Clear Channel-owned stations in key U.S. and UK markets reportedly received pre-vetted narratives within hours of each crisis. These included celebrity statements, approved grief tributes, and messaging focused on unity rather than scrutiny. Sources within the network suggest this was a deliberate “narrative containment” approach—preventing counter-narratives or scrutiny from gaining traction in public discourse. Though local affiliates technically hold FCC licenses, national programming decisions—including post-trauma branding—shape what millions hear. iHeartMedia's feeds during these events directed emotional frames, controlled tone, and largely ignored legal or forensic questions. Critics call this emotional censorship—a corporate filter that replaced critical inquiry with choreography. Together they formed the “Trauma Engine”—a loop of fear, empathy, and redemption. iHeartMedia's role: the amplifier, delivering volume without scrutiny. By exercising coordinated emotional control across millions of listeners, iHeartMedia turned tragedy into marketing vectors. • Should emotional narrative management be considered a form of psychological manipulation? • Does the structure of syndicated broadcast restrict public discourse behind a corporate gate? • How many tragedies have been quietly choreographed through the broadcast airwaves?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It could've been the crossover to end all crossovers. On paper, it does seem like things could've lined up: The shows were airing on The CW at the same time, and both of their premises involved paranormal beings. Not to mention, both had very passionate fanbases. When TVD was rolling out its first season — and Supernatural was on its fifth — the network even approached the creators about collaborating. In Samantha Highfill's I Was Feeling Epic: An Oral History of ‘The Vampire Diaries, executive producer Julie Plec reveals that it didn't make sense at the time. More specifically, Plec said the team decided that blending the two worlds wouldn't work with their mythology, but it might've been a different story had the request come a few years later. “By the way, if that same request had come my way in Season 7, I would've been like, ‘F**k yeah'” she admitted in the book. Plec spoke more extensively on the topic at a convention in 2018, shortly after TVD had wrapped up its eighth and final season. ” Kevin [Williamson, coproducer] and I were like ‘absolutely not, because we are vampires and werewolves,” she explained, according to Screenrant. We don't have any of that stuff! A few years before that, Supernatural star Jensen Ackles was asked about a crossover he'd like to do, and he teased the possibility of the Winchesters meeting the Salvatore brothers. In 2016, he admitted it would be difficult to make a crossover happen, considering that the shows were filmed thousands of miles apart. His costar Misha Collins chimed in, “And then the screen cuts to black and you just hear screams.” Instead, Plec noted in Highfill's book that they were more focused on spinoffs located within the TVD universe. As early as Season 2, the team was playing around with the idea of doing a university-set paranormal show with possessions and ghosts, according to Williamson, which definitely sounds more up Supernatural‘s alley. “The Originals spinoff happened because Klaus was so good and Elijah was so good and then suddenly we introduced Rebekah as part of the story and then it was like, ‘Why are we not doing this whole family? Would you have liked to see the Supernatural and TVD crews cross paths, or are you glad TVD kept everything within the same universe? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

(NewsNation) — A historic House subcommittee hearing Tuesday unveiled never-before-seen video appearing to show a Hellfire fail to take down an unidentified “orb.” 

Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., shared the video, which was taken on Oct. 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen. 

As the missile appeared to bounce off the object rather than destroy it, journalist and hearing witness George Knapp observed “it kept going.” “What the hell is that?” he added.

The hearing centered on unidentified anomalous phenomena, government disclosure and protection for whistleblowers.

NewsNation special correspondent and investigative journalist Ross Coulthart watched along and gave his analysis, live on stream.

Colorado Springs mental health therapist and paranormal investigator Erin Taylor documented the 16 nights she spent in allegedly haunted locations across Colorado and the U.S., including Croke-Patterson Mansion (now Patterson Inn) and The Lumber Baron Inn & Gardens in Denver and the Victor Hotel & Restaurant, in her book, “Sleeping Among Spirits.” Courtesy Erin Taylor Colorado Springs paranormal investigator Erin Taylor will be a featured speaker at the Oddity & Fear Fest Sept. 20-21. Colorado Springs mental health therapist and paranormal investigator Erin Taylor documented the 16 nights she spent in allegedly haunted locations across Colorado and the U.S., including Croke-Patterson Mansion (now Patterson Inn) and The Lumber Baron Inn & Gardens in Denver and the Victor Hotel & Restaurant, in her book, “Sleeping Among Spirits.” Courtesy Erin Taylor She documented those ghostly sleepovers in her 2022 book, “Sleeping Among Spirits,” and released a new version this summer with an extra haunted location. Both versions, along with her four other paranormal books, including “Strange Colorado,” in which she explores the state's urban legends, and “Unfinished Business,” a deep dive into haunted bathrooms around the country, are available online at erintaylorauthor.com and Amazon.com. “I run into the fire, metaphorically speaking,” said Taylor, a Springs native who graduated from Liberty High School. Taylor also will be a featured guest at the Oddity & Fear Fest on Sept. 20-21 at Colorado Springs Event Center, and she'll host a ghost hunt Oct. 18 at the Outlaws and Lawmen Museum (the old Teller County Jail) in Cripple Creek. As a little kid she loved reading scary books, like R.L. “There are a lot of times things can be explained, but I love the times they can't,” she said. “That's the driving force behind why I and so many other paranormal investigators do this. The idea to sleep in haunted spots was born out of doing 10 nights of paranormal investigations in 10 locations from Indiana to Gettysburg, Pa., with Richard Estep, another Colorado-based paranormal investigator and author. “The whole reputation of this house is being evil. For being such a demonic ghost I fell asleep in the living room. I joked that I slept great in this super-haunted house, and someone should write a book, a scared Airbnb sort of book. Places she laid her head and hoped for the best: Croke-Patterson Mansion (now Patterson Inn) and The Lumber Baron Inn & Gardens in Denver, Victor Hotel & Restaurant, Hotel St. Nicholas in Cripple Creek, as well as Cripple Creek Hospitality House & RV Park. Many of the spots have been featured on hit paranormal TV shows, such as “Ghost Adventures,” “Portals to Hell” and “Ghost Hunters.” “Sometimes there's possibly an initial apprehension, especially if I'm coming into a location knowing there's been a lot of negative comments,” Taylor said. “As I've done this more and more, I don't get as worked up or nervous as I did in the beginning, but it's more being aware and mindful of what's going on.” Among her favorite go-to places are Cripple Creek and Victor, where she likes to say “you can't walk a block without having some sort of paranormal activity.” OK, that's greatly exaggerated, she admits, but she's investigated the Outlaws & Lawmen Jail Museum and never had the same thing happen twice. The evening she spent at Evergreen Cemetery, where she was walking with two other investigators and minus any recording equipment, and saw a black mass cross the path in front of her. And an investigation at the now defunct Cowboys nightclub on Palmer Park Boulevard elicited an interesting anecdote in the women's bathroom when she heard a woman's voice. Cave of the Winds was also rich with unexplained activity, including hearing footsteps and seeing a lit candle fall out of a bucket lantern. I take a scientific approach to it, but when there are experiences we cannot explain then that's what's so exciting.” President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Space Command will move from Colorado Springs to Alabama, the latest in a years' long fight over the command.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON­—Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) delivered opening remarks at today's hearing titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection.” In her opening statement, Task Force Chairwoman Luna highlighted the lack of transparency from the federal government and intelligence communities on the research and disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Below are Task Force Chairwoman Luna's opening remarks, as prepared: Good morning, and welcome to this hearing regarding UAP disclosures. For too long, the issue of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena – commonly known as UAPs – has been shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and in some cases outright dismissal. Today, I want to state clearly: this is not science fiction or creating speculation. I have now spoken to a number of whistleblowers from the military, to include at the infamous Eglin AFB incident that occurred when myself and former Rep Matt Gaetz as well as Rep Burchett followed up on a lead from multiple active-duty air force pilot whistleblowers that alleged that the USAF was covering up UAP activity at Eglin AFB. We have heard from a number of whistleblowers, specifically military pilots, that the reason for not coming forward publicly is out of fear that speaking out would cost them their flight status, and potentially their careers. Now, Congress has tried to fix this problem. Congress tried to create formal channels – through the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, also known as AARO and the Intelligence Community Inspector General – for service members and officials to make disclosures. But the reality: the reports that come in are too often brushed aside, slow-walked, or met with skepticism rather than serious investigation. Recently, the former AARO director known as Sean Kirpatrick attacked our witness and members on this committee. It should be noted that he is a documented liar and brings into question what his purpose at AARO really was if it was not to follow up on investigations and disclose his findings to Members of Congress. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Chris Mellon, described a report published by ARRO that “found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology,” as “the most error-ridden and unsatisfactory government report I can recall reading during or after decades of government service.” Mellon further noted that this was the first ARRO report submitted to Congress without the Director of National Intelligence's sign-off and seemingly excluded input from “any of the scholars or experts who have studied and written extensively on this topic as would normally be the case in another field.” Mellon determined that the report failed to fulfill the congressional mandate under which it was required, omitted entire agencies with “known investigations or activities relating to UAP,” and omitted any discussion of efforts to hide classified or unclassified information about UAP. Such efforts were unaddressed by the report despite the existence of agency records and investigations concerning them, including at US Customs and Border Protection. If we set up offices and oversight bodies only to let them become graveyards for testimony or worse yet, ruses for pretending to investigate when in actuality, there was no follow up, then we are not doing our jobs. In recent months, Congress has also been presented with evidence that points to technologies that to our knowledge, are beyond our current capabilities. It is our duty as elected representatives to follow the facts, wherever they lead, and to ensure those facts are not buried under classification stamps or bureaucratic excuses. Let me be clear: whether UAPs represent adversarial technology, natural phenomena, or something beyond current human understanding, Congress has a responsibility to investigate. If these objects are foreign in origin, they pose a direct threat to our national security. Adversarial nations are not waiting for us to catch up – they are studying these phenomena aggressively as well and multiple nations have also announced their own parliamentary investigation into this very topic. If we continue to ignore our pilots and service members as well as the countless government whistleblowers, we risk losing their trust. And why, in a free society are we still being told so little? Independent SAP oversight has presented a consistent problem for Congress as the program's budgets are classified. Additionally, oversight reporting to Congress is classified, and is only provided to the authorizing and appropriations committees of jurisdiction. They do not need to be shielded like children from reality. What they cannot tolerate – what they will not forgive – is a government that withholds the truth and punishes those who dare to speak out. Future generations will look back on this moment and ask what we did when presented with the unknown. Or did we pursue the truth with courage? I intend to be on the side of truth, transparency, and accountability, and I hope my colleagues on this Task Force will be as well. Senator Schumer: “Multiple credible sources” allege a constitutional crisis over UFOs. The witnesses today are not alone, far from it. In fact, 34 senior military, government, and intelligence officials have broken their silence. It is time for the US government to exercise transparency. And, with that, I yield to Ranking Member Crockett for her opening statement.</p>

In his testimony titled “Nuccetelli-Written-Testimony,” he recounts multiple unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base between 2003 and 2005, including: The “Vandenberg Red Square”, a massive glowing red square that hovered near missile defense sites and was reported by Boeing contractors oversight.house.gov. A football-field-sized rectangular craft that silently hovered before rapidly disappearing. Reports of strange lights above the ocean prompting armed responses, and a triangular craft larger than a C-130 drifting silently over the base. His personal chilling experience: A large, blue-white glowing orb that maneuvered like a butterfly, appearing directly above his backyard before vanishing oversight.house.gov. Nuccetelli emphasizes that these events were documented and reported up the chain of command, yet no guidance or public communication followed—often due to fear, stigma, or retaliation that discouraged further reporting While "Age of Disclosure" and "Capel Green" are not available to stream online yet, there are plenty of interesting UFO shows to watch, especially "UFO Revolution" season 2, which covers the explosive events of the last UAP hearing where Jeremy Corbell clashed with Michael Shellenberger over the Immaculate Constellation documents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials in western Germany have sought to calm online speculation following the deaths of 16 candidates, including seven from a far-right party, in the run-up to a local election. However, online conspiracy theories have been running rife after the deaths of several candidates, including seven representing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD) party. AfD co-leader, Alice Weidel, highlighted the initial deaths on social media with a post on X saying “4 AfD candidates died.” In a statement, he said the AfD was saddened by the news but that, according to the information they had received so far, there was “currently no indication of unnatural deaths". Some of those running had known pre-existing conditions. In total, 16 candidates are believed to have died, with police already ruling out unnatural causes in four of the cases, according to the DPA news agency. The seven AfD nominees were standing for election in a variety of districts and with confirmed ages between 59 and 80. In all districts where candidates have died, any completed postal ballots will need to be re-cast, local media said.

Exploring our solar system and returning pieces of it to Earth is a central part of the existential quest to search for life beyond our home planet.

Understanding the biosafety and biocontamination implications of landing on a planetary body or in bringing pieces of our solar system back to our home planet are the two themes that are central to planetary protection, a discipline that is unique to spacefaring nations.

The nature of planetary protection is twofold: (1) to ensure that we minimize our own terrestrial microbial footprint on other planets and moons (planetary bodies) in our solar system (forward contamination), and (2) to ensure that we minimize the potential impact of returning samples from another planet or moon to Earth (backward contamination).

The discipline of planetary protection focuses on who is the biological “invader” and when does their arrival indicate an “invasion”? The degree to which there is potential for biological or organic interactions that result in biocontamination or changes in biosafety posture is the central topic of this work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While plenty of paranormal movies existed prior to this, the Conjuring franchise was different because it took very loose inspiration from true stories of hauntings. The Warrens were also based on real-life (albeit problematic) paranormal investigators. They made the demonologist main characters empathetic and easy to connect with. Most recently, The Conjuring: Last Rites broke an IT record, becoming the biggest opening weekend of all time for a horror movie. After watching the most recent Conjuring movie, fans can move on to these eight TV shows, which are perfect for fans of the paranormal horror franchise. The Conjuring movies are loosely based on real stories, and they aren't the only versions of them made. Set in the 1970s, The Enfield Haunting tells the story of Mr. Grosse, a novice paranormal researcher, and Guy Lyn Playfair, and experienced researcher, as they attempt to care for an 11-year-old girl terrorized by a supernatural entity. The show has a skin-crawling effect due to its scary moments and "true story" angle. The paranorml investigator characters will also make it perfect for Conjuring fans. However, seasons 1, 5, and 6 – Murder House, Hotel, and Roanoke, respectively – feel perfect for fans of the hit movie franchise. These three seasons of American Horror Story involve ghosts who wreak havoc on the living. They mix together atmospheric fear, jump scares, and gore, all of which can be found in The Conjuring Universe's movies. They also center on specific locations that are haunted. What's more, there are elements of ghost summonings and banishment, like in The Conjuring. With 50 episodes across 4 seasons, Evil is an excellent choice for Conjuring fans seeking a paraanormal show they can watch for a long time before running out of episodes. The series started as a network show on CBS before transitioning to Paramount+. The Catholic Church hires these three vastly different individuals to use their expertise to solve different paranormal occurances. Evil is truly the perfect choice after watching The Conjuring because it involves demonic entities and terrifying hauntings to give you nightmares for days. Additionally, the show provided a proper conclusion for viewers rather than leaving the story open-ended like some streaming shows that get canceled. The show exists in a world where parasites start taking over human bodies, usually killing them and using the carcass as a host. However, it includes much more horror and gore, so viewers should be mentally prepared for that. Like The Conjuring movies, A Haunting is theoretically based on real-life stories of paranormal events, ghosts, and demonic activity. Each episode depicts a different alleged true example of supernatural incidents, using firsthand accounts and interviews. However, the show also features dramatic re-enactments in almost every episode, using fictionalized versions of the horrifying experience for narrative impact. The re-enactments are often nothing short of terrifying, with some scenes being reminiscent of the movie franchise. It follows Father Tomas Ortega and Father Marcus Keane, priests who try to help a family and foster home dealing with demonic entities. Rather than having a ton of jump scares, the show leans into atmospheric horror, like the Conjuring films. Unfortunately, the Exorcist TV show only lasted two seasons due to high production costs and low viewership. That being said, the smaller number of episodes makes it easy to binge-watch. Some of the best shows that are perfect for The Conjuring fans are made outside of Hollywood. The show follows a horror writer named Emma Larrsimon, who has spent her whole life haunted by childhood nightmares of a witch named Marianne. She turned these night terrors into bestselling books. However, she realizes that Marianne wasn't a figment of her imagination when she returns to her hometown. As a lover of all things horror, I can confidently say that Marianne is one of the best horror TV shows that I've seen within the past decade, and I think fans of The Conjuring will love it. I recommend watching the series with subtitles, but there's a dubbed version available as well. No supernatural horror list would be complete without at least one Mike Flanagan show on it. First, the family moves into Hill House, unaware of the terrifying paranormal phenomena they are about to experience. This is interwoven with their lives 26 years later, when they have to confront their traumatic experiences at Hill House. Like The Conjuring, the TV show is very loosely shaped by a real story, with Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House taking inpsiration from a group of psychic researchers from the 19th century who went to a haunted house.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Jacocks shares his compelling true story of UFO sightings and alien abductions in Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition, revealing astonishing evidence and experiences. United States, September 9, 2025 -- The Story Behind Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition In Aware Of Their Presence Revised Edition, Jacocks opens up about his extraordinary experiences with UFO sightings and alien encounters. Unlike many who hesitate to speak about such occurrences, Jacocks is unapologetically open, sharing details that have shaped his life. His honesty about these experiences has led him to not only write a book but also speak at public engagements, television interviews, and podcasts. In 2005, Jacocks discovered two metallic objects embedded near his spine, a finding that was made by accident at an airport security checkpoint. What makes this discovery even more astonishing is the fact that similar metallic objects had been found in Jacocks' knee as a child. Aware Of Their Presence isn't just about unexplained events, it's a window into one man's perspective on life, identity, and the unknown. Jacocks' willingness to share his deeply personal journey sets him apart from others in the UFO and alien encounter community. While many shy away from revealing their experiences for fear of ridicule, Jacocks stands firm in his belief and his openness, encouraging others to be equally unafraid to explore the unknown. What makes Jacocks' story truly unique is his refusal to engage in debates with those who do not believe him. This approach has resonated with readers, many of whom report reading the book in a single sitting due to its gripping nature and candid storytelling. Craig Jacocks is an author, speaker, and advocate for those who have experienced similar extraordinary encounters. Beyond writing, Jacocks is passionate about raising awareness and sparking meaningful conversations on unexplained phenomena. Through his public speaking engagements, Jacocks hopes to create a platform where people can openly share their experiences without fear of judgment or ridicule.
