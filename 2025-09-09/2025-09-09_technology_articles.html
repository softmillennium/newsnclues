                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People will be able to connect their personal medical records to AI and “have a conversation that includes all of the knowledge of the published literature,” predicted Myerson, a former Microsoft Windows and Exchange leader who is now CEO of Seattle-area health data technology company Truveta. “I think a lot of things are going to change,” Myerson said. “That empowerment of the individual just seems so righteous to me. “Where I do get optimistic is that the AI models these days are ubiquitous. They're making really non-linear improvements in terms of what's possible,” she said. In healthcare, it's so discombobulated.” With health systems operating on thin margins, she said, any new technology must have an ROI that is “so obvious, because they don't have a lot of money.” He said the company has been funding lobbying, creating the necessary APIs, and pressuring API providers to make health data more accessible through its Apple Health app. Myerson said that Truveta's platform provides a crucial missing piece: data on actual patient outcomes. Truveta works with its healthcare system partners to gather clinical data from the medical records of roughly one in three Americans. This data, he said, is completely de-identified to protect patient privacy before it is used to help fill critical knowledge gaps in patient care. Microsoft is now expanding this AI technology to help bedside nurses. Myerson said Microsoft has an advantage over rivals in at least one respect: it is not a direct competitor to the healthcare systems it serves. He contrasted the Redmond company in this way with Google, which is often seen as a consumer company, and Amazon, which is viewed as a direct healthcare competitor through Amazon One Medical and other initiatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At yet another splashy event, Apple on Tuesday introduced its latest lineup of iPhones: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a new slimmer version dubbed the iPhone Air. But it also recalls a time when smartphone makers were chasing an ever-thinner phone. At its iPhone 17 event, the company only referenced AI technology a few times: to rehash some updates announced in June at WWDC, like Visual Intelligence and its on-device models, and in some aspects of its camera upgrades, like the iPhone 17's front camera, which it calls Center Stage. The most compelling use of AI wasn't even introduced as a phone upgrade; it was the AI-powered Live Translation feature coming to Apple's AirPods 3. There was no mention of Siri at all, AI-powered or otherwise. Much has been made about how Apple's miscalculation on AI could negatively affect its industry standing and future success. Meanwhile, Google last month rolled out its latest release of an AI-powered Android phone with its Pixel 10, as iPhone owners still await an AI Siri that's been delayed until 2026. Until now, Apple has only released what could be considered baseline AI features for its devices, like AI writing tools, summarization, generative AI images (which some complain are not very good), live translation, visual search, and Genmoji, among others. Yet a digital assistant that understands a wide range of questions — without deferring to ChatGPT — or one that can provide further context from your iPhone apps remains overdue. An AI-enhanced Siri could be running some other technology — like Google Gemini — under the hood. At first glance, this delay, combined with the decision to rely on a third party — or even, possibly a sizable acquisition — seems like it could spell bad news for Apple. However, Apple's decision to outsource some of the phone's AI technology could actually become a selling point for consumers. Today's iPhone owners often swap out Apple's technology for Google's by opting for Gmail, Google Drive and Docs, Google Maps, and Chrome over Apple's own apps like Mail, its iWork suite, Apple Maps, and Safari, for example. Why, then, shouldn't they be able to use Google's AI technology, too? If Apple does proceed with a third-party deal to integrate AI into its devices, it may work out to be an even bigger win for iPhone owners. Plus, given the speed with which AI technology has been evolving, this design would leave room for Apple to swap out models or expand support to include others, as AI companies edge themselves ahead of others. It also means that the look-and-feel of updated iPhones themselves and their hardware advances will continue to drive sales and upgrades, allowing Apple to do what it does best: focus on build quality, camera improvements, privacy-preserving tech, intentional software design changes like Liquid Glass — and yes, super thin phones. Apple could continue to market itself as a best-in-class hardware maker first, not an AI device maker; customers could still long for the latest iPhones, as always, without having to sacrifice the latest technology advances when they make the choice to buy a phone from Apple. Of course, this scenario only plays out if and when Apple opts to launch a version of Siri that runs a third-party's AI technology to enhance its own. But if Apple decides to only rely on its Apple Intelligence offerings without getting them up to speed quickly, the outcome could be much different.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple Watches don't change much year to year, although the last few updates have left users without landmark blood oxygen sensing tech for months. At its Tuesday “Awe Dropping” product showcase, Apple seemed to suggest that with Apple Watch Series 11, wearables fans can hope both past and all-new health monitoring features will stick around for good. The new Series 11 smartwatch is more of a refresh (even if last year's update didn't feel quite as significant as some hoped for). The square-shaped watch still comes in two sizes: 42mm and 46mm. Those looking for a little more flair on their wrist could opt for the gold, silver, and slate colors, plus all the various sport and fabric band options. The Nike Sport Loop also now has a version with yarn woven into the fabric, as if your grandmother came along and blinged out your new smartwatch. Apple removed the feature in January 2024, following a patent dispute with medical tech company Masimo. Apple's heart rate feature monitors for hypertension—AKA high blood pressure—and offers alerts in case the watch spots any abnormalities. The hypertension monitor works in the background, and it isn't designed to be a foolproof way of catching every potential instance of hypertension. Apple is still awaiting full clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The watch also includes a new sleep score feature that will let you know how well you've been snoozing, then offers advice for how to improve your slumber. If you had to stare real hard to identify the tiny size differences between the Apple Watch Series 9 and Series 10, you'd have a much harder time spotting distinctions between last year's and this year's wearables. Those models with a titanium frame will still use a sapphire front crystal material, which should be even more resistant than the base model's “Ion-X” glass. Apple said it redesigned its cellular antenna to hopefully increase coverage across more bands. The Apple Watch Series 11, in both 42mm and 46mm, is available for preorder starting Tuesday and should be on store shelves starting Sept. 19.

Apple announced a suite of four new iPhones today, and with them, new processors to power the devices. These chips are likely built on TSMC's latest N3P process node, which is also expected to be used for Apple's upcoming M5 chips for iPads and Macs. The processor has four efficiency cores and two performance cores, while the GPU continues advancements in hardware-accelerated ray tracing, mesh shading, and MetalFX upscaling. Like the A19, its six-core CPU utilizes two performance and four efficiency cores. The performance cores have better branch prediction and increased front-end bandwidth, while the new efficiency cores have a 50% increase in last-level cache. On the iPhone Air, there's a five-core GPU with the second generation of Apple's Dynamic Caching, with faster floating point math and better image compression. Each GPU core has its own Neural Accelerators, which Apple claimed allows for MacBook Pro-level performance in an iPhone. Apple is promising a 40% increase in sustained performance over the previous generation. On the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, the chip will be cooled by a new thermal system in a unibody design. This should help disperse heat and avoid the problems that iPhone 15 Pro users remember from launch in 2023.The thermal system utilizes a vapor chamber filled with deionized water, which directs heat throughout the system. On the iPhone Air, Apple has built its own networking chip, N1. This chip will allow for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth connections, and Thread. This chip takes over wireless duties, including Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support. Apple states that this integrated chip design will yield performance and efficiency benefits for functions such as AirDrop and Personal Hotspot.

The new C1X modem promises up to a 2x boost in performance, but it still doesn't include high-bandwidth, high-capacity mmWave technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the world focuses on Apple's latest slew of new products, we are taking a moment for the last bastion of Apple's proprietary past—the one remaining product with a Lightning connector that, somehow, Apple still sells. We have previously lamented Apple's drawn-out transition to USB-C. It's been far from quick and far from straightforward, leaving a mess of dongles and confusion in its wake. It was last year, at its September 2024 “Glowtime” event, that Apple made the move to change that, transitioning all of its newest products to USB-C. By February this year, it had stopped selling the remaining Lightning-supporting iPhones—the iPhone SE (3rd Gen) and the iPhone 14 family—following the EU's ruling for all of its devices to move to a nonproprietary connector by 2025. But one solitary device is still hanging on as the final Lightning product that Apple sells. Apple generally supports its hardware with OS updates for five to seven years. All of these only support the Apple Pencil (1st Gen), and none of the other Pencils above it, meaning it's seemingly a hard product for Apple to get rid of—despite its desperately aging connector. Based on that five-to-seven-year timeline, that could mean the Lightning still has as many as three years left in Apple's inventory. Unless, of course, it makes the call to leave older iPad owners to the second-hand Pencil market, and finally retires Lightning for good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why spend more than $300 for an Apple Watch? Apple may have its wearables fans asking that question with the new Apple Watch SE. It may not have all the health tracking features of the mainline wearables, but that may simply make it a better option for most people. The revised edition revealed Tuesday at Apple's “Awe Dropping” event may look closer to the regular Apple Watch Series 11 than the older 2020s-era wearables. The new SE is even closer to replacing a regular Apple Watch with an on-device Siri voice assistant and an always-on display. With the upgraded chip, Apple promised the new device would be faster than the one from 2022 thanks to last year's S10 SiP, or system in a package. Better yet, it will have fast charging, promising 15 minutes of charging to get 8 hours of battery life. It includes temperature sensing and some of the “wrist flick” gestures for shuffling through apps or music. You don't have to worry about a price bump like we saw from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 16e. The device starts at $250 for the 40mm version with GPS and comes in both a “midnight” and silver “starlight” aluminum case. The Apple Watch SE starts at $250 for the 40mm and will be available for preorder Tuesday. It should start shipping by Sept 19. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sure, we watch them to be educated, but also for the alarmingly gasp-inducing, uncomfortably emotional moments: killer whales gobbling adorable baby seals, furious lions battling each other for supremacy, uncomfortably large spiders just being themselves… you know how it goes. Horror studio Blumhouse is leaning hard into that idea with Nightmares of Nature, a new documentary series coming to Netflix. A joint production of Blumhouse Television and Plimsoll Productions, Nightmares of Nature has a Netflix-familiar narrator in Stranger Things‘ Maya Hawke. A press release teases it as a “natural history and horror series,” and further emphasizes the peril by noting “each season follows three animal characters facing all the horrors and monsters nature can throw at them.” Two seasons are arriving soon, each consisting of three 45-minute episodes. Our three characters (a soon-to-be-mother mouse, a young bachelor raccoon, and a froglet who has seen terrible things) quickly discover how scary the woods truly are and find themselves in search of sanctuary. They stumble upon an old cabin in the woods, thinking it a safe haven, they soon discover their nightmares have really only just begun…” Then, October 28 brings season two, Lost in the Jungle. These episodes are “set deep in the creepy Central American rainforest, a place with more creative ways to die than anywhere else on Earth. For our three characters (a young opossum, a newly hatched iguana, and a feisty jumping spider) the nightmare of staying alive in the jungle escalates fast when they discover an abandoned laboratory deep in the jungle. And before they know it, lost in this unnatural labyrinth, with a new monster hiding behind every corner, they are in the struggle of their lives to get out before it is too late…” I was already nervous about the spider element, but an abandoned laboratory?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new battery product known as Megapack 3, which Tesla revealed late Monday, are a bid to lure utilities and data center developers that are desperate for power. Megapack 3 stores around 1 megawatt-hour more electricity than Tesla's largest existing offering and promises a longer lifespan. Tesla also introduced Megablock, a grouping of four Megapack 3 units that can store 20 megawatt-hours, enough to run around 4,000 homes for four hours, the length of time such batteries are frequently used. By updating the thermal management system, Megapack 3 will be able to operate from –40˚ F to 140˚ F, specs that should cover just about everywhere on Earth. Both products will be manufactured in Tesla's Megafactory near Houston and won't enter production until the latter half of 2026. Tesla's energy storage business could use a shot in the arm after reporting two consecutive quarters of declining numbers this year. The company was the leading supplier of battery energy storage systems in 2024, though its lead was slipping even then, according to Wood Mackenzie. Last quarter, Tesla installed 9.6 gigawatt hours of stationary energy storage. Tesla's solar and energy storage businesses would seem to have a built-in customer in CEO Elon Musk's other company, xAI. The AI company has added 168 Megapacks at its data center in South Memphis, Tennessee, though it's apparently exploring the addition of more dozens more gas turbines.

After all, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D commands a $200 higher price point and boasts twice the number of cores, which naturally suggests superior performance. However, this faceoff dives deeper than just raw numbers and sticker price. It explores how these two processors, both from AMD's gaming-optimized Zen 5 X3D lineup, cater to different needs and whether the premium flagship truly justifies its cost in real-world scenarios. It's the "no compromises" option, commanding a premium price befitting its halo status. In contrast, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D offers a more focused approach, targeting gamers and mainstream users who seek exceptional gaming performance and efficiency without the complexity or cost of a higher-core-count processor. Forget assumptions, let's dissect where these two exceptional gaming processors truly excel and uncover which one deserves a place in your ultimate rig. These processors share the same foundational architecture but differ significantly in their core configurations and target use cases. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The 9950X3D is a dual-CCD powerhouse featuring 16 cores and 32 threads, while the 9800X3D adopts a streamlined single-CCD design with 8 cores and 16 threads. This architectural divergence creates distinct performance profiles, with the 9950X3D targeting users requiring substantial multi-threaded performance alongside gaming excellence, whereas the 9800X3D focuses exclusively on delivering optimal gaming performance without the complexity of a multi-die design. This asymmetric design results in 128MB of layered L3 cache, creating a complex but powerful architecture that requires sophisticated thread scheduling. In contrast, the 9800X3D's single-CCD design features a uniform 8-core complex with 96MB of total L3 cache, providing consistent performance characteristics across all cores and simplifying both hardware design and driver optimization. The 9800X3D, conversely, features a 4.7GHz base clock with boost frequencies of 5.2GHz. This design transformation dramatically improves thermal characteristics, allowing both processors to achieve full overclocking capabilities (a first for X3D processors) while maintaining higher boost frequencies than their predecessors. Platform support and connectivity specifications show AMD's commitment to the AM5 ecosystem. Memory support extends to DDR5 with official specifications up to 5600 MT/s, though both processors can achieve higher speeds through AMD EXPO memory overclocking technology. The processors provide 24 usable PCIe 5.0 lanes from the CPU, four native USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and comprehensive storage support including NVMe RAID configurations. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D share a common Zen 5 foundation but diverge in their feature sets to serve distinct purposes. On paper alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is more impressive due to its higher clocks and additional cores, thus taking this round. While our in-depth Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reviews offer a more comprehensive analysis and our test system specs, in this section, we will focus on a gaming performance overview. The following benchmark graphs display average FPS and 1% lows for various games at 1080p. Using a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card ensures GPU limitations are removed, making this setup ideal for comparing pure CPU performance. In our 16-game geometric mean at 1080p with High/Ultra settings, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D narrowly edges out the Ryzen 9 9950X3D with an average of 195.5 FPS versus 194.8 FPS, which is a negligible 0.4% difference. This parity stems from AMD's 3D V-Cache technology, which minimizes latency in cache-sensitive titles. However, the 9950X3D's higher core count rarely translates to gaming gains, as most games prioritize cache and clock speeds over core quantity. For example, in A Plague Tale: Requiem, the 9800X3D leads by 5.9% on average, likely due to its optimized single-CCD design reducing inter-core latency. This reflects its superior multi-core capabilities, mitigating stutter during asset streaming or background tasks. In our testing, we typically see that cache-bound games favor the 9800X3D. In Baldur's Gate 3, the Ryzen 9 leads by about 2.6%, exploiting its dual-CCD design to gain an advantage in this title. It consumes just 79.4W under load according to our testing, while the 9950X3D draws 52% more power at 120.9W. The 9800X3D also offers superior value for money, gaining a staggering 50% advantage in our FPS per dollar chart. Unless you are pairing gaming with heavy streaming or rendering, the 9800X3D's cache-optimized design and aggressive pricing make it AMD's gaming champion. The 9950X3D's edge in 1% lows is nice, but it cannot be justified by its hefty price premium. According to our benchmark results, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D demonstrates a substantial productivity advantage over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D across both single-threaded and multi-threaded workloads. This underscores the 9950X3D's superior power budget and higher core count. This makes the 9950X3D a powerhouse for video rendering, 3D compilation, or scientific simulations where core scalability is paramount. Cinebench 2024 single-core shows a 4.7% advantage, and the gap expands in POV-Ray single-core, where the 9950X3D has a 7.6% higher score than its younger sibling. Even in lighter workloads like WebXPRT4 (browser-based tasks), the 9950X3D maintains a modest but notable 4.4% edge. These modest gains reflect the close architectural similarities between the two CPUs in tasks that don't necessarily scale with core count. The 9950X3D's dual-CCD layout (one with 3D V-Cache, one with higher clocks) optimizes it for hybrid productivity: cache-sensitive tasks leverage the stacked die, while all-core workloads engage both CCDs. The 9800X3D's single-CCD design restricts it in lighter multi-threaded tasks despite its cache advantage. Putting it all together, for productivity alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is decisively superior, delivering 10-40% higher performance on average, with peaks exceeding 60% in core-heavy tasks. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains viable for budget-focused users handling lighter workloads, but professionals demanding uncompromised rendering, encoding, or compilation speed should opt for the 9950X3D. Its massive compute throughput advantage, driven by its doubled core count, makes the 9950X3D the unequivocal choice for professional productivity, while the 9800X3D serves well for mainstream users where its strong gaming performance and lower cost are prioritized over extreme multi-threaded muscle. Unlike previous X3D generations that had severe overclocking limitations, both Zen 5-based processors support full manual overclocking, including multiplier adjustments, voltage modifications, and extensive tuning options. This is a revolutionary change from the Zen 4 X3D processors that were largely locked down, with the 7800X3D only supporting limited PBO and Curve Optimizer adjustments. The key architectural improvement enabling this overclocking freedom is AMD's redesigned 3D V-Cache placement. This design change allows both processors to maintain higher boost frequencies while supporting the same overclocking toolkit as the regular Zen 5 processors. The processors responds well to both traditional overclocking methods and AMD's advanced tuning tools, including Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2), Curve Optimizer, and the new Curve Shaper feature exclusive to Zen 5 processors. AMD has plenty of manual tuning option available, but most users are best just engaging the automated Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) feature. Both chips leverage the same AMD overclocking suite, so this section works out to a tie. According to our test results, the power profiles of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reveal significant differences under load while showing remarkable similarity at idle, directly impacting efficiency and cooling requirements. Even in Cinebench 2024 multi-core rendering, which favors thread scaling, the 9950X3D requires 57.8% more power than its younger brother. This consistently higher power draw under heavy vectorized or multi-threaded loads is inherent to the 9950X3D's doubled core resources. Remarkably, both CPUs demonstrate nearly identical power efficiency during low-activity states. This parity highlights that the 9950X3D efficiently powers down unused cores, but also highlights that both chips carry the same power burden of the central I/O die, which ultimately results in higher idle power consumption for Zen 5 processors compared to Intel offerings. Despite its higher power consumption, the 9950X3D often delivers superior performance-per-watt in multi-threaded tasks. This indicates the 9950X3D's additional cores translate workloads into completed tasks more efficiently under heavy utilization. The "Estimated Task Energy" graph further confirms this trend, placing the 9950X3D in a significantly better (lower-right) position than Intel competitors and delivering way more FPS than the 9800X3D despite consuming almost similar task energy. The 9950X3D's higher sustained power load necessitates more robust cooling. The 9800X3D, with its peak draw nearly 20-25% lower, is far more forgiving. A capable dual-tower air cooler or 240mm AIO should suffice in most cases. However, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consumes 25-58% more power under load but delivers 6-11% better performance efficiency (work completed per watt) in multi-threaded scenarios like rendering and encoding. For users needing maximum multi-core throughput, the 9950X3D's efficiency may justify its higher power ceiling, though it demands stronger cooling to realize its full potential. It is also easier to cool and is generally quite tame compared to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which consumes significantly more power under load. In contrast, the 9950X3D takes a significant win in power efficiency (performance-per-watt), highlighting that it delivers exceptional power characteristics of its own. Overall both chips have their charms, depending on the target workload. That leaves us with yet another tie -- the winner just depends on your personal use-case. When examining the complete platform cost, both processors share identical requirements for supporting components, but they do have different needs in some areas. The AM5 socket requirement means both CPUs could use the same types of motherboards, ranging from budget B650 boards at $125-$160 to premium X870 motherboards that can cost $320-$500. With a higher TDP and peak power consumption, the 16-core 9950X3D necessitates more robust VRM designs on motherboards for full performance, potentially adding $50-$100 to the platform cost. Cooling the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which has a lower TDP (120W) compared to its higher-end sibling (170W), can be adequately handled by a mid-tier solution. In contrast, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D would benefit from a more capable solution, with a 360mm AIO liquid cooler being optimal, which can cost you about $150-200. Conclusively, the 9800X3D emerges as the superior choice for value-conscious builders, despite both processors delivering nearly identical gaming performance, as we already saw. The nearly $230 price difference represents money that could be allocated toward a better graphics card, faster storage, or premium peripherals, which are components that would provide more tangible benefits for gaming performance. The 9950X3D is best reserved for users who explicitly need its extra cores and are willing to invest in the supporting high-end platform. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D both bring impressive strengths to the table, ultimately leaving us with a 4-4 tie, but the winner for you will be clear based on your target workloads and budget. Its dominance in gaming performance, power efficiency, and pricing creates a compelling package that delivers exceptional results without unnecessary complexity. Its 16-core, 32-thread configuration provides superb multi-core performance that makes it the ultimate all-round CPU for users who refuse to compromise between gaming and professional workloads. It delivers virtually identical top-tier gaming performance to the 9950X3D while being significantly cheaper, more power-efficient, easier to cool, and less demanding on the supporting platform. The Ryzen 9 9950X3D remains a formidable, niche processor, but its considerable price premium and higher platform costs are only justifiable for users who simultaneously require maximum gaming performance and very high levels of multi-threaded productivity performance on a daily basis. Both chips have their place, and the clear swim lanes for the 9950X3D and 9800X3D show that AMD has done an excellent job in stratifying the Ryzen 9000 X3D lineup, delivering strong value for two very different chips and ultimately earning its price tag for each chip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes in football you have to trust your gut in real time, and Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald ran into that situation during the team's season-opening loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. “It was a tough one,” Macdonald said during his radio show on Seattle Sports 710 on Monday with hosts Brock Huard and Mike Salk (starting at 9:45 above). “But you are making these [calls] in real time,” Macdonald said, illustrating the dynamic at play in tense football situations where increased access to data and predictive analysis in-game can run up against the human instincts and experience of coaches making the calls. Ticking off a variety of reasons for why he chose to ignore the model, Macdonald kicked the field goal to take a 13-10 lead. In a previous interview with GeekWire, Macdonald said his philosophy in Seattle is a combination of “old school principles and new school methods,” where the team is embracing tech for any edge it can get. That includes around decisions about whether to go for it on fourth down. Through its partnership with Microsoft, the NFL makes a variety of tech tools available to players and coaches during games. This year, a new GitHub Copilot feature is introducing enhanced AI capabilities for quicker filtering when reviewing plays. “We feel AI can streamline processes, but cannot be a substitute or supplement for coaches developing adjustments and strategies on game day,” the NFL said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet all the attacker did was attempt to steal cryptocurrency When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A total of 18 JavaScript packages that have over 2 billion weekly downloads have been injected with malicious code in what is billed as the largest supply chain hack in history. The compromised code was designed to steal cryptocurrency. With it, he could wipe out half the universe's population. The Infinity Gauntlet would still be a problem, sure, but wouldn't that first snap come as a relief? But we're lucky—they prioritized getting rich over wreaking havoc. Aikido said yesterday that 18 packages "were updated to contain a piece of code that would be executed on the client of a website, which silently intercepts crypto and web3 activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user." The packages in question are distributed via npm, GitHub's package manager and registry for the Node.js ecosystem, and they are collectively downloaded approximately 2 billion times per week. We don't know how far these malicious packages spread. There's no denying these packages are popular, though, and organizations whose software depends on them should make sure they aren't using the malicious releases. But was this at least the result of a sophisticated attack? The maintainer of these packages (who, it should be noted, uses the handle "bad-at-computer" on Bluesky) said they received a two-factor authentication reset email that "looked very legitimate" from "support@npmjs.help" and thought it was benign. All it took to pull off a hack of this scale was a domain name, an email, and the willingness to try. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. I reported in 2021 that hackers were targeting maintainers of packages used by JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java developers in their own software, and even then, the problem had been known for years. The industry has been attempting to address this problem by encouraging the use of software bills of materials (SBOMs), requiring maintainers of widely used packages to secure their accounts with two-factor authentication, etc. Yet this incident proves that these measures are not enough. Until the commonly accepted processes of developing, maintaining, and releasing software change, these problems will persist. This time, the Infinity Gauntlet was used to steal cryptocurrency. Thanos claimed that he's inevitable; are we really just consigning ourselves to hoping that was only true on the silver screen?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The marketplace is offered by Public Service Alliance (PSA), a private company that says it formed in response to an unprecedented rise in threats against government workers across the United States. Open to anyone who is serving or has served in government—federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial—the platform debuts amid heightened concern over the safety of public officials and their families, especially in the wake of the June killing of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and the attempted assassination of state senator John Hoffman and his wife. “Threats to public servants and their families have surged over the past decade, with no scalable support for those at risk. This is a broken business model for effective government and undermines everything America stands for,” PSA founder and CEO Isabella Ulloa says in a statement. The services, which anyone can browse for free, include online data removal, legal counsel, threat monitoring, job coaching, and stress management tools. Additionally, while it does not itself provide legal advice, PSA says it can connect users to a network of attorneys that provide low-cost legal consultations. During a quiet launch last year, PSA tells WIRED, it amassed roughly 1,000 users by word of mouth alone, saying it so far touts a 100 percent retention rate. Many of the discounts are steep, PSA says, noting that threat monitoring services, which can range from $5,000 to over $30,000 annually, can be obtained by its users for less than $1,000 per year. PSA casts itself as strictly nonpartisan, pointing to an advisory board that spans both parties as well as members of law enforcement, including former Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock, Massachusetts sheriff Peter Koutoujian, and David Sundberg, a retired FBI assistant director. PSA says the bipartisan structure underscores its view that protecting people's lives should always transcend politics. Its researchers found that nearly half of state legislators and nearly one in five local officials reported being threatened, many saying the abuse has intensified in both frequency and tone. The threats are not only endangering people, the center says, but warping democratic participation; deterring candidates from running for office and silencing officials on controversial issues, pushing many to scale back public events and social media use. The US Capitol Police says it investigated 9,474 threats against members of Congress and those close to them last year, marking a second straight annual increase, more than doubling 2017's total. Data brokers, which are often used for targeted abuse, sit at the heart of a multibillion-dollar industry that thrives on collecting, packaging, and selling detailing personal information, often without your knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers on nearly every American, from their location histories to political leanings and even religious affiliations. People-search websites, which draw heavily on data broker feeds, have long been used by abusers to track and harass victims. Data breaches have exposed the movements of politicians and military personnel. And even when opting out is possible, it's a burdensome, piecemeal process that requires repeatedly chasing down companies as information is re-collected and relisted. In May 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau quietly withdrew a Biden-era rule that would have required data brokers to get people's consent before selling sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers or income details. Meanwhile, privacy watchdogs like the Electronic Frontier Foundation report that hundreds of data brokers are evading state transparency laws—including failing to register in states where it's required—further eroding oversight in the absence of federal regulation; a gap that's left even basic privacy protections vulnerable to corporate gamesmanship. An investigation by The Markup and CalMatters copublished by WIRED last month found at least 35 data brokers deliberately hiding their opt-out pages from Google search results, making it harder for people to find and use tools to delete their personal data—a practice that consumer advocates say resembles an illegal dark pattern; another barrier to thwart users hoping to one day wrest control of their data from companies built on exploiting it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A leak of more than 100,000 documents shows that a little-known Chinese company has been quietly selling censorship systems seemingly modeled on the Great Firewall to governments around the world. Geedge Networks, a company founded in 2018 that counts the “father” of China's massive censorship infrastructure as one of its investors, styles itself as a network-monitoring provider, offering business-grade cybersecurity tools to “gain comprehensive visibility and minimize security risks” for its customers, the documents show. In fact, researchers found that it has been operating a sophisticated system that allows users to monitor online information, block certain websites and VPN tools, and spy on specific individuals. Researchers who reviewed the leaked material found that the company is able to package advanced surveillance capabilities into what amounts to a commercialized version of the Great Firewall—a wholesale solution with both hardware that can be installed in any telecom data center and software operated by local government officers. A public job posting shows that Geedge is also looking for engineers who can travel to other countries for engineering work, including to several countries not named in the leaked documents, WIRED has found. “This is not like lawful interception that every country does, including Western democracies,” says Marla Rivera, a technical researcher at InterSecLab, a global digital forensics research institution. In addition to mass censorship, the system allows governments to target specific individuals based on their website activities, like having visited a certain domain. At the core of Geedge's offering is a gateway tool called Tiangou Secure Gateway (TSG), designed to sit inside data centers and could be scaled to process the internet traffic of an entire country, documents reveal. Besides monitoring the entire traffic, documents show that the system also allows setting up additional rules for specific users that it deems suspicious and collecting their network activities. For unencrypted internet traffic, the system is able to intercept sensitive information such as website content, passwords, and email attachments, according to the leaked documents. One screenshot of the Geedge dashboard for Myanmar shows that the system is monitoring 81 million internet connections simultaneously, while it can theoretically be scaled even larger with more hardware, InterSecLab researchers say. Frontiir, a local telecom operator in Myanmar, previously denied having “built, planned, or designed anything related to surveillance,” but it was found in the leak to have installed Geedge equipment at its data center. Investcom, a joint-venture telecom operator between Burmese and Lebanese companies, said it was “aware of claims relating to third-party technologies in Myanmar” but refused to “confirm or deny the existence of third-party systems” in a written reply to the researchers at Justice for Myanmar. Geedge sells a one-stop shop of censorship solutions, including internet gateway hardware. Another fundamental product of Geedge is Cyber Narrator, the main user interface where non-technical government clients can access the data that Tiangou Secure Gateway monitors in real time with a bird's-eye view, documents show. In the case of Myanmar, internal records reveal that Geedge identified 281 popular VPN tools, complete with their technical specifications, subscription prices, and whether they can be used in Myanmar. A separate document identified 54 apps marked as higher priority for blocking. The documents show that Geedge's technical ability is rapidly growing. Researchers were able to pin down four of the foreign government clients to Kazakhstan (K18 and K24), Pakistan (P19), Ethiopia (E21), and Myanmar (M22) by combing through documents in the leak for mentions of data centers' geographic locations, tracking international cargo records from Geedge to other countries, and drawing from prior reporting on Chinese companies' involvement in selling censorship software. There is the additional mention of a client coded A24, but there isn't sufficient evidence to show what it refers to. Geedge's public hiring efforts may provide more information on its potential expansion plans. On a third-party job recruitment platform in China, Geedge is hiring a senior overseas operations and maintenance engineer to maintain the systems in “Belt and Road countries.” The job listing says it may require spending three to six months outside China, travelling to Pakistan, Malaysia, Bahrain, Algeria, and India. Separately, in March, the company was also hiring Spanish-speaking and French-speaking translators who could support Geedge's overseas businesses. In Pakistan, for example, one license renewal document shows that the Geedge services, including capabilities to monitor real-time statistics and retain email information, were licensed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority in October 2024. Researchers believe that some Geedge employees are able to access information intercepted by the client, which could be a national security risk for the client governments. Prior to Geedge coming to Pakistan, the country had worked with Sandvine, a Canadian company that supplied deep-packet-inspection gear before withdrawing under US sanctions. When Sandvine left, its hardware remained in Pakistani data centers, according to the leak. Geedge moved in to repurpose the existing infrastructure, the documents show, offering a transition to a new regime of censorship—one that would eventually run on Chinese-manufactured hardware instead. The company's ability and willingness to work with the hardware left by Sandvine should pose a warning for countries issuing export licenses for sensitive technologies, says Jurre van Bergen, a technologist at the human rights nonprofit Amnesty International: “Once it's exported, it's there, and they're going to reuse it in some capacity. Researchers caution that there's no actual documentation in the leak that proves Geedge's system is responsible for the internet censorship that took place in a particular country, but key operation changes in the Geedge technical logs correspond with notable events. In Ethiopia, for example, the system was switched from a mode that passively monitors traffic to a mode that can actively stop traffic “just days before the internet shutdown” in February 2023, says Rivera. While Geedge Networks may be obscure outside and inside China, it has close ties with the forces that built China's controversial filtering and blocking system, now known as the Great Firewall. When Geedge Networks was founded in 2018, it was going by a different name, Zhongdian Jizhi, showing its connection to China Electronics Corporation (CEC), a massive state-owned conglomerate with close ties to the country's military and security services. CEC was sanctioned by the United States government in 2020. As technology develops, the Great Firewall has been built higher too, effectively blocking the majority of Chinese people from accessing information deemed not politically acceptable by the Chinese government, no matter if they are using computers, phones, or even cutting-edge technology like AI models. In 2019, when Fang was still employed as CEC's chief scientist, he became an investor of the company Jicheng (Hainan) Technology Investment, owning a 40 percent stake, according to Chinese corporate records databases. In 2024, Fang set up a new cybersecurity research studio with the help of Geedge, Chinese state media Xinhua reported. Years after it had sold technologies to other countries, Geedge started targeting Chinese provincial governments too for their unique needs. Geedge's leaked documents show that the company is collaborating with Chinese research institutions to expand monitoring systems there. Meanwhile, Geedge has also operated pilot projects in two other Chinese provinces, Fujian and Jiangsu, according to the leaked records. Screenshots and other documents of these projects show the focus of the system was on detecting financial scam websites, which happens more often in China's eastern coastal provinces. In addition to collecting traffic information on both a wide and individual scale, the Xinjiang project was also exploring some experimental functions. A list of desirable features found in the leak shows that Geedge was aiming to update Cyber Narrator so it could construct relationship graphs between users and group individuals according to the apps they use. It also plans to triangulate the location of a user through mobile cell stations and create geofences for certain users, records show. Another prototype feature found in the leak is described as an individual “reputation score.” Each internet user is given a baseline score of 550, and it can be increased by authenticating the user's personal information, including the national identification, facial recognition data, and employment details. Geedge's ongoing attempt to unearth information from individuals is particularly worrying, because the company also has the capability to inject malware into users' internet traffic, says Lea Horne, another researcher at InterSecLab. Instead of trying to guess what website they visit that doesn't support HTTPS, you can just look at all their internet activity in the past, find a website that doesn't regularly use a secure internet connection, and inject malware into this website next time you visit,” she says. And even though some features were being tested within China, once the technology is mature, any foreign client can request the same features in their systems through a simple software update.
