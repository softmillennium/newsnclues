                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps There were mixed fortunes for Williams in the Italian Grand Prix as Alex Albon walked away from Monza with a hatful of points, while team mate Carlos Sainz was left frustrated by a difficult afternoon that saw contact and a battery issue derail his challenge. Following a difficult Qualifying that saw both cars exit in Q2, Williams opted to split strategies for Sunday's Grand Prix – starting Albon on the hard tyre and Sainz on the mediums. Even after he pitted, Albon managed to hold onto a points paying position and was rewarded with seventh at the flag – finishing as the lead midfield car. “Fantastic strategy and great car pace, I think those two together, you are going to have a good time of it,” Albon explained as he reflected on his race. “Honestly… It was meant to be a tough race on paper but actually we were the first hard car once everyone pitted. One of the best Sundays balance-wise I've had all year. “It always seems when we run the low downforce cars, our balance improves as well. “It proves we have a consistent car, it has been one of the biggest focus points for us last year and this year," Albon continued. But while Albon was left overjoyed with how his race unfolded in Italy, the same could not be said for his team mate. “Quicker than Bearman in front, quicker than Bortoleto, we were going to start passing at that stage but when I went for a move with Ollie, unfortunately we touched. “We also ran into some battery issues so a difficult day in the office.” Sainz has more than once this year found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time – just last week he was penalised after contact with Liam Lawson, he made contact with Charles Leclerc at Silverstone while brake and gearbox issues prevented him even starting the race in Austria. Sainz was asked what he can do to arrest his bad luck, with the Spaniard replying: “Keep pushing, like my Qualifying pace is there, my race pace is there so at some point it will finish.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson came to blows during the Italian Grand Prix, with the two drivers sharing their views post-race. Yuki Tsunoda was left to ponder what might have been at the Italian Grand Prix after his bid to make it back-to-back points finishes came undone via a collision with Liam Lawson. Lawson and Tsunoda found themselves sharing the same piece of track midway through Sunday's race at Monza – the Racing Bulls driver having pitted early on a soft-hard tyre strategy and the Red Bull man stopping a few laps later on a medium-hard approach. While the position was returned to him, Tsunoda picked up significant damage on the floor of his car and could only work his way back to 13th by the chequered flag, which he took a couple of seconds up on Lawson. Reflecting on his race, and that incident, Tsunoda said: “The first stint was okay, and in the second stint I got distracted by a guy who was not even fighting for the points. Asked if he will go and talk to Lawson, the Japanese racer added: “We know that he's an aggressive driver, and I think it's not a bad thing, but at the same time there's always a line that we can't step over and be beyond. Especially when we're [under] the same [Red Bull family] roof. “Obviously with his position, it's a seat that probably can be very high competition [to secure], more than anywhere else. Lawson then shared his side after going aggressive with his tyre strategy following a back-of-the grid start, brought on by the New Zealander's mistake at the end of Q1. “I think it nearly worked, just a couple of cars came out around us, they were on fresh tyres, and we just lost a lot of time.</p>
