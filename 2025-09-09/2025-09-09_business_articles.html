                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's coverage of Apple's biggest launch event of the year, where it announced new iPhones and Apple Watches that will go on sale on Sept. 19. Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman said that the iPhone 17 launch comes at a "really tough" moment for Apple as the company is facing questions about its artificial intelligence efforts. "The problem with Apple is that everything that's showing up today is, in fact, pretty incremental," he told CNBC's "Power Lunch." We haven't had a big supercycle in four years." Newman said that last year's promise of Apple Intelligence driving a big cycle didn't really pan out, but the company does have "the longest on-ramp" to get AI right with its massive user base. For most people, the biggest change in iOS 26 will be a complete visual redesign. Apple calls its new iOS look "liquid glass," and has replaced static opaque buttons and menus throughout the operating system with new animations and transparent designs that are intended to flow like water as the user navigates the software. Investors seemed to be indifferent to Apple's latest product announcements, including the new iPhone Air model and Apple Series 11 Watch. Apple shares were down about 1.5% when the event ended. Apple raised the price of its iPhone 17 Pro on Tuesday, as expected, as the company deals with tariffs and geopolitical challenges. In addition, Apple's mid-range phone, the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, was discontinued. Meanwhile, Apple's high end Pro Max phones will cost $1,199. "Despite being much thinner and lighter, iPhone Air still gets amazing all-day battery life," the company said. The Air's internal design maximizes battery space and the new operating system, iOS 26, will have new power-saving features that learn your usage patterns and anticipate when you might run low on battery. Apple's iPhone 17 Pro will use aluminum as its case material. Before that, Apple sold iPhone Pro models with a stainless steel frame, which had heat dissipation and weight tradeoffs — Kif Leswing The new chip has a second-generation caching architecture that helps to double its ability to do math, the company said. It also adding parts called "machine learning accelerators" into its graphics processors, or GPUs, which are typically used for AI, in addition to graphics. Apple's chief marketer Greg Joswiak said the chip will enable its devices to run local large language models. The company says these updates will allow its new phones to have three times the GPU computation as last year's phones. Apple also said that the phone's computation performance compares to its MacBook Pro laptops. It's got a titanium frame that Apple says is "space grade." "Our intention was to make an iPhone that feels like a piece of the future, powerful, yet so thin and light it seems to disappear in your hands," an Apple presenter said. In previous years, one way Apple distinguished its entry-level iPhone from its "Pro" models was a feature it calls ProMotion, or the display's refresh rate, which makes the entire interface smoother. On Tuesday, Apple said its entry-level iPhone 17 will get the feature, and will also get a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen with smaller bezels. Analysts say that after battery life, display quality is one of the top reasons for users to upgrade to a new iPhone. The iPhone 17 series mobile devices will be available in five colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white and sage. They will also feature "ceramic shield 2," which Apple says will make the devices three times more scratch resistant than earlier models. Apple announced pricing for its new Apple Watches, which it calls Series 11, and Apple did not raise starting prices for its models, despite speculation from Wall Street analysts that it would have to a result of tariffs. Apple's highest-end watch, the Ultra, was introduced in 2022, and updated with minor improvements in 2023, but it didn't get a big update last year — only a new black color. Apple said it had improved its display, satellite connectivity and added 5G coverage. It starts at $799, the same price as its predecessor. A ceramic coating on the glass makes it harder and more scratch resistant. The Apple Series 11 will have a battery that can last 24 hours, and it will come available in colors like jet black, silver, rose gold and a new gray version. Apple positions its Apple Watch as a health aid, and its biggest medical improvement this year in its Series 11 models is that it can now monitor people with hypertension, or high blood pressure. The company said that its algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure in the background, by reviewing data over 30-day periods. Apple said its technology was based on a series of medical studies with 100,000 participants. "Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond," said Sumbul Desai, Apple's health vice president. However, she warned that it won't detect all instances of hypertension. Apple has announced its first price of the day — and there's no change. Along with features like live translation, active noise reduction and a longer battery life, Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 will be available in five sizes. The new device will fit people's ears better than previous versions of the AirPods, and they will contain translation features, said Kate Bergeron, Apple vice president of hardware engineering. The new earbuds also have improved spatial audio features. "No matter what headphones you've used before, with AirPods 3, you'll have the world's best active noise cancelation of any in ear wireless headphones, transparency enables you to hear your surroundings and now your own voice and people speaking to you will sound more natural than ever," Bergeron said. Bergeron said there will be longer battery life, and will last 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6 hours previously. "It doesn't just translate individual words," Apple's presenter said. "The meaning of each phrase is translated for you. When you need to talk, just speak naturally." Live translation has emerged as one of the first major consumer features powered by artificial intelligence. Google announced several live translation features, including the ability to automatically translate phone calls in the user's voice, at its event last month. "Design goes beyond just how something looks or feels. Apple's most famous designer, Jony Ive, who left the company in 2019, is now working with rival OpenAI on new competing hardware products. That figure shows there is still intense consumer demand to learn about the latest Apple products. Investors will be apathetic towards the Apple event if there are no new major hardware updates, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on CNBC's Halftime Report on Tuesday. He predicts that Apple could raise iPhone prices due to tariffs. He hasn't been involved on a day-to-day basis in decades, but he's an important inspiration to Apple employees and fans. "End of the day, when it comes to iPhones or Apple products, in every survey we have run, the top two reasons people want to buy a new iPhone is: The battery life is very bad or they need a new screen," Daryanani said. "AI and Apple Intelligence is the fourth or fifth reason why they want to buy," he continued. Wall Street Journal tech columnist Joanna Stern said Apple's launch event has to deliver for investors and consumers, but price stability will be a key point of focus. "In a world of tariffs, in this world of the economy, that's pretty amazing for Tim Cook," Stern told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange." The prices of these phones: Are they inching upwards without any real significant feature increases? "People are going to upgrade because they need a new iPhone, but people are not going to be running out to buy these phones if they don't need a new phone," she said. It's dark and a cool 67 degrees at Apple's Cupertino headquarters ahead of the iPhone maker's "Awe dropping" launch event. CNBC's Steve Kovach reports that staff are setting up breakfast before the crowds arrive. Andersen Capital Management founder Peter Andersen said he was disappointed in the iPhone maker's lack of attention to software and artificial intelligence ahead of the launch event. "As AI continues to develop, they are obviously standing in the background. Even if iPhone users aren't planning to buy one of the new devices the company announces on Tuesday, they should expect their phones to get a drastically different look later this week. That's because Apple will likely roll out its iOS 26 operating system after its iPhone event, and that software update will include the most drastic visual change to the iPhone's interface in a decade. Revealed in June, Apple has created a new visual language that it calls Liquid Glass. The new look replaces formerly opaque static buttons throughout the iPhone's operating system with transparent graphics designed by Apple to have detailed, liquid-like animations. So far, Liquid Glass has had mixed reviews from early adopters who have tried it out in beta versions, but when Apple releases the new software this month, millions of people will experience it for the first time. Apple is hoping that they will find it "delightful." The biggest question Apple investors and customers have about this year's iPhones is how much they will cost. Consumer products, including apparel, footwear, coffee and game consoles, are seeing price increases driven by tariff costs. Some Wall Street analysts are counting on Apple to follow. Most analysts expect Apple to raise prices on some of its models as it grapples with the Trump administration's tariffs. The company said in July that tariffs could cost it over $1 billion this quarter. But if Apple does raise prices on its phones, don't expect the company to blame the change on tariffs. It's also possible that Apple might eliminate the entry-level version of some of its phones, forcing users to get more storage at higher starting prices. One possibility, JPMorgan analysts have said, is that Apple could eliminate the 128GB version of the iPhone Pro, which currently costs $999 for the iPhone 16, meaning consumers would have to pay $1,099 for an iPhone 17 Pro that has more starting-level storage than its predecessor. Apple has released four new phones at its September events since 2020. But not all four iPhone models are equally popular. This year, it's been Apple's tweener model, the iPhone 16 Plus, which costs $899. That's higher than entry-level models with smaller screens but less than Apple's Pro models that feature higher-quality screens and faster chips. That Mini model also failed to produce strong sales. This year, analysts have said they expect Apple will mix up its lineup yet again, replacing the "Plus" with a slim model that could be called the "Air," like Apple's thin laptops and iPads. The idea behind the slim model is that consumers will give up some battery life and features, such as multiple camera lenses, for a more lightweight iPhone. Apple's expected entry into the market comes after rival Samsung released a similar device called the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has secured Nasdaq as a strategic investor ahead of its initial public offering this week, CNBC has confirmed. Nasdaq plans to invest $50 million in the crypto company in a partnership that will allow the stock exchange to offer Gemini's custodial services to its financial institution clients. Gemini will also become a distribution partner for Nasdaq's trade management system known as Calypso. The investment, first reported by Reuters early Tuesday, is separate from Gemini's planned initial public offering this week. The crypto company plans to raise up to $317 million Friday in its public debut on the Nasdaq. "We continue to expand our capabilities to serve our institutional clients and the broader investor universe as the regulatory landscape around crypto assets evolves," a Nasdaq spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. "To prepare for future developments while maintaining an open-ecosystem approach to market infrastructure, we will partner with Gemini on a non-exclusive basis as part of a broader strategy to offer multi-custodial and staking services for crypto assets. Additionally, we will work with Gemini as a distribution partner for Nasdaq Calypso, to serve firms seeking to benefit from its collateral management capabilities across traditional and digital assets." "The investment and partnership structure we have employed with Gemini is consistent with those that we typically structure through Nasdaq Ventures," they added. The news comes a day after Nasdaq filed a proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seeking a rule change that would allow for the trading of tokenized stocks and exchange-traded products. While interest in tokenization has grown in recent months, a formal rule change would allow Nasdaq to become the first major traditional stock exchange to allow tokenized securities trading. In crypto, tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple made some big product announcements during its "Awe dropping" event in Cupertino, introducing an iPhone 17 line-up that included a slimmed-down model called the iPhone Air. The fall event is Apple's biggest day of the year, as CEO Tim Cook and other executives have a chance to make their annual sales pitch for why customers should upgrade devices. Apple also said the Air was its most durable iPhone to date. While the iPhone Air doesn't feature as powerful a camera system or internal chip as the iPhone 17 Pro, and it packs a smaller battery, the device will likely appeal to early adopters and those looking for a lighter iPhone — or those who want to stand out with a flashy new device. Wall Street was also closely watching to see if Apple would increase the price of its iPhone lineup. Spoiler alert: It did, but only for the high-end Pro variant. Powering the new lineup will be iOS 26, Apple's revamped operating system featuring its transparent-themed "Liquid Glass" aesthetic touted at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple also showed off the new AirPods Pro 3 earbuds with an impressive video demo showcasing two people wearing the headphones and communicating in different languages thanks to its new live-translation feature. As Tim Cook bids people farewell and the fall event comes to a close, Wall Street doesn't appear too happy with what was shown off. Apple's stock price was down around 1.44% in intraday trading as the event wrapped up. Apple has a new material for its iPhone case that it's calling "TechWoven" — a departure from the poorly reviewed "FineWoven" cases it previously debuted and then quietly appeared to discontinue. Apple says the new woven textile is crafted with a process that uses multiple yarn colors to create "a sophisticated look, while a protective coating provides resistance to scratches and stains. All three rear cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro are 48 megapixels for the very first time, Apple says, and they're also all fusion cameras. The new rear camera module includes a sensor that is 56% larger than the previous generation, which improves sharpness in bright light and provides better detail. Apple says it filmed its event using the iPhone 17 Pro. Apple says that at the heart of the new thermal management system is an Apple-designed vapor chamber that carries deionized water to move heat away from the components, allowing for higher sustained performance. "It also delivers a dramatic leap in performance that makes this the most powerful iPhone ever, by far, and it starts with an entirely new approach to thermal management," Apple says. Cook says it's the most advanced iPhone ever. While the iPhone Air is Apple's thinnest iPhone, the Pro model is its most powerful, carrying its most powerful mobile chip. Apple says it features a new approach to thermal management. No physical SIM cards in the iPhone Air — it sounds like there isn't room. With iOS 26, the iPhone Air gets new power-saving features like adaptive power mode, which learns your usage patterns and anticipates when you might run low on battery, to know when to conserve your battery. The iPhone Air features the 48-megapixel fusion camera that Apple touts as an advanced system that puts four lenses in your pocket. A dual-camera feature will also be available, allowing users to record video from both the front and back cameras simultaneously. The iPhone Air is launching in four colors: space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue. To introduce us to the iPhone Air, Apple shows the new phone, coming in at 5.6 millimeters, surviving a fall. It's the most durable iPhone yet, according to Apple. The main rear camera delivers 48 megapixels of resolution for capturing fine details, Apple says. Apple says the iPhone 17 display is its "best yet," with a larger 6.3-inch screen. Apple says the new Ultra 3 has the "largest display" of an Apple Watch, with an always-on display that won't affect battery life. It gets up to 42 hours of battery life, and features satellite connectivity. You can pre-order all the new models today, and they will be available starting September 19. The new Apple Watch SE will have an always-on display, 18-hour battery life, and fast-charging (two times faster than the previous model). Apple says it developed a "ground-breaking" feature that can detect high blood pressure using an algorithm to identify hypertension in users. The Series 11 will have 24 hours of battery life. It will run on WatchOS 26 and have the new "Liquid Glass" design aeshetic. We're seeing people explain how the Apple Watch helped them hit fitness goals or in emergency health or rescue events. If you're using the hearing-aid features in transparency mode, that extends to 10 hours. AirPods Pro 3 will have the ability to monitor your heart rate during a workout, using what Apple calls its "smallest heart rate sensor." It'll also become more integrated into Apple's fitness features to track workouts. For those with the original AirPods Pro, Apple says it's a night and day difference, with up to 4x improved active noise cancellation. The new earphones will also aid in Live Translation using Apple Intelligence when triggered by a gesture. Two people wearing the AirPods Pro 3 will be able to communicate in different languages while Live Translation seamlessly translates, Apple says. Apple also says they're the "best-fitting AirPods ever." Apple CEO Tim Cook shouts out Liquid Glass right away and hints at big iPhone news. Liquid Glass, the software design that Apple showed off at WWDC earlier this year, is a key part of the upcoming iOS 26. And as for iPhone, Cook says Apple is taking the "biggest leap ever." The event begins with an opening video of quick cuts showing various Apple products and features. We're only 5 minutes away from Tim Cook's keynote kicking off. You can also watch the event along with us. While Apple's stock price has seen some recent gains (it's up 2.86% this month), shares are still trading down 5.79% since the start of the year. As Apple continues to play catch-up in the AI race, a strong showing from its iPhone 17 slate could provide a much-needed lift, especially if Wall Street analysts end up impressed by the expected thinner Air model's potential to drive upgrades. Apple shares are trading down a little less than 1% heading into Tim Cook's 1 p.m. One big question about the rumored "Air" model is how popular it will prove to be. I suspect early adopters (like me) will lead the charge. I've got an iPhone 13 Pro and haven't seen much reason to personally upgrade to previous models, but I'm intrigued by the idea of having a significantly thinner phone in my pocket — even if the camera isn't quite as crisp as the Pro. The Air will likely also appeal to those who simply want to broadcast they have the latest iPhone — something that visibly stands out when they use it at school, around friends, or on the subway to work. The potential issue there is that signaling becomes a lot harder to do when you have a protective case on your phone, which adds bulk. And if you choose to risk it and go case-less, be prepared to pay more for Apple Care + so accidental drop damage repairs aren't as pricey. They're being served light bites before the main event kicks off on campus. The iPhone's new operating system was a major talking point at this year's WWDC, and today's event unveils the devices it was built to serve. In June, Apple showed off its new "Liquid Glass" design language within iOS 26 that redesigns the iPhone's software aesthetic to a more transparent layout for toolbars and apps on the Home Screen. Apps like the Phone app are also getting overhauled. In the new version, voicemails, recents, and favorites are combined. There's also a new Call Screening feature that will allow Apple to silently answer unknown calls and give you info to know if it's worth answering. Analysts say they aren't expecting any major surprises today. They'll also be keeping an ear out for price hikes between $50 and $100 on new iPhone models, as EMARKETER writes that tariffs could lead to an iPhone that's "even more expensive than before." One topic that they don't expect to get much airtime is Apple Intelligence or the delayed AI-powered Siri overhaul. Analysts from Morgan Stanley predict that Apple won't focus on AI as much at the event — which typically highlights new gadgets since Apple spotlighted its new software earlier this year at WWDC. After all, Apple loves to highlight "one more thing" at the tail-end of its events. Some Wall Street analysts are predicting higher price tags for the iPhone 17 family, estimating some models could cost $50 to $100 more than previous versions. Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales in its most recent earnings report. As a result, the president signaled that Apple would be treated well in future trade agreements. And in September, a judge decided that Google's search deals with tech giants like Apple could continue — boosting Apple's stock price. Days like today are some of the most exciting moments at Apple. Cook posted his signature sunrise picture over the Apple campus to let followers know he's up and ready for the event.</p>

Apple said it had improved its display, satellite connectivity and added 5G coverage. It starts at $799, the same price as its predecessor. A ceramic coating on the glass makes it harder and more scratch resistant. The Apple Series 11 will have a battery that can last 24 hours, and it will come available in colors like jet black, silver, rose gold and a new gray version. Apple positions its Apple Watch as a health aid, and its biggest medical improvement this year in its Series 11 models is that it can now monitor people with hypertension, or high blood pressure. The company said that its algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure in the background, by reviewing data over 30-day periods. Apple said its technology was based on a series of medical studies with 100,000 participants. "Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond," said Sumbul Desai, Apple's health vice president. However, she warned that it won't detect all instances of hypertension. Apple has announced its first price of the day — and there's no change. Along with features like live translation, active noise reduction and a longer battery life, Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 will be available in five sizes. The new device will fit people's ears better than previous versions of the AirPods, and they will contain translation features, said Kate Bergeron, Apple vice president of hardware engineering. The new earbuds also have improved spatial audio features. "No matter what headphones you've used before, with AirPods 3, you'll have the world's best active noise cancelation of any in ear wireless headphones, transparency enables you to hear your surroundings and now your own voice and people speaking to you will sound more natural than ever," Bergeron said. Bergeron said there will be longer battery life, and will last 8 hours on a single charge, up from 6 hours previously. "It doesn't just translate individual words," Apple's presenter said. "The meaning of each phrase is translated for you. Live translation has emerged as one of the first major consumer features powered by artificial intelligence. Google announced several live translation features, including the ability to automatically translate phone calls in the user's voice, at its event last month. "Design goes beyond just how something looks or feels. Apple's most famous designer, Jony Ive, who left the company in 2019, is now working with rival OpenAI on new competing hardware products. That figure shows there is still intense consumer demand to learn about the latest Apple products. Investors will be apathetic towards the Apple event if there are no new major hardware updates, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on CNBC's Halftime Report on Tuesday. He predicts that Apple could raise iPhone prices due to tariffs. He hasn't been involved on a day-to-day basis in decades, but he's an important inspiration to Apple employees and fans. "End of the day, when it comes to iPhones or Apple products, in every survey we have run, the top two reasons people want to buy a new iPhone is: The battery life is very bad or they need a new screen," Daryanani said. "AI and Apple Intelligence is the fourth or fifth reason why they want to buy," he continued. Wall Street Journal tech columnist Joanna Stern said Apple's launch event has to deliver for investors and consumers, but price stability will be a key point of focus. "In a world of tariffs, in this world of the economy, that's pretty amazing for Tim Cook," Stern told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange." The prices of these phones: Are they inching upwards without any real significant feature increases? "People are going to upgrade because they need a new iPhone, but people are not going to be running out to buy these phones if they don't need a new phone," she said. It's dark and a cool 67 degrees at Apple's Cupertino headquarters ahead of the iPhone maker's "Awe dropping" launch event. CNBC's Steve Kovach reports that staff are setting up breakfast before the crowds arrive. Andersen Capital Management founder Peter Andersen said he was disappointed in the iPhone maker's lack of attention to software and artificial intelligence ahead of the launch event. "As AI continues to develop, they are obviously standing in the background. Even if iPhone users aren't planning to buy one of the new devices the company announces on Tuesday, they should expect their phones to get a drastically different look later this week. That's because Apple will likely roll out its iOS 26 operating system after its iPhone event, and that software update will include the most drastic visual change to the iPhone's interface in a decade. Revealed in June, Apple has created a new visual language that it calls Liquid Glass. The new look replaces formerly opaque static buttons throughout the iPhone's operating system with transparent graphics designed by Apple to have detailed, liquid-like animations. So far, Liquid Glass has had mixed reviews from early adopters who have tried it out in beta versions, but when Apple releases the new software this month, millions of people will experience it for the first time. Apple is hoping that they will find it "delightful." The biggest question Apple investors and customers have about this year's iPhones is how much they will cost. Consumer products, including apparel, footwear, coffee and game consoles, are seeing price increases driven by tariff costs. Some Wall Street analysts are counting on Apple to follow. Most analysts expect Apple to raise prices on some of its models as it grapples with the Trump administration's tariffs. The company said in July that tariffs could cost it over $1 billion this quarter. But if Apple does raise prices on its phones, don't expect the company to blame the change on tariffs. It's also possible that Apple might eliminate the entry-level version of some of its phones, forcing users to get more storage at higher starting prices. One possibility, JPMorgan analysts have said, is that Apple could eliminate the 128GB version of the iPhone Pro, which currently costs $999 for the iPhone 16, meaning consumers would have to pay $1,099 for an iPhone 17 Pro that has more starting-level storage than its predecessor. Apple has released four new phones at its September events since 2020. But not all four iPhone models are equally popular. This year, it's been Apple's tweener model, the iPhone 16 Plus, which costs $899. That's higher than entry-level models with smaller screens but less than Apple's Pro models that feature higher-quality screens and faster chips. That Mini model also failed to produce strong sales. This year, analysts have said they expect Apple will mix up its lineup yet again, replacing the "Plus" with a slim model that could be called the "Air," like Apple's thin laptops and iPads. The idea behind the slim model is that consumers will give up some battery life and features, such as multiple camera lenses, for a more lightweight iPhone. Apple's expected entry into the market comes after rival Samsung released a similar device called the Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft just set a new return-to-office mandate, and an internal document shows it's rolling out an even stricter policy for employees who work within its Microsoft AI organization under the group's CEO, Mustafa Suleyman. Effective January 26, Microsoft AI employees who live within 25 or 50 miles of an office (depending on location) "are required to be in the office 4 days a week," the document states. The policy applies to those who live within: Any exception must be approved by an executive who reports to Suleyman directly, according to the document, and any exceptions will be reviewed annually. Microsoft on Tuesday notified employees via an internal email from HR chief Amy Coleman that the company is mandating employees to work from offices at least three days a week. That email, viewed by Business Insider, stated, "Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations." Other teams working on AI have comparatively less strict guidelines. Executive Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organization has no org-specific return to office guidelines or considerations, according to the documents, and Jay Parikh's Core AI group will apply the three-day-a-week guidance for all offices in February, with the exception of GitHub. The new mandate for the AI organization comes as Microsoft tries to become more competitive in luring AI talent amid the talent wars with OpenAI, Meta, Google, and others. Suleyman's organization has a special recruiting team to handle competitive offers, and the company is trying to poach AI engineers and researchers with multimillion-dollar pay packages from its AI rivals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House used revised jobs data released Tuesday as fodder to criticize three frequent targets of President Donald Trump: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, former President Joe Biden and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. "Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. "This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS's data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions," she said. "Much like the BLS has failed the American people, so has Jerome 'Too Late' Powell – who has officially run out of excuses and must cut the rates now." Annual revisions to nonfarm payrolls data for the year showed a reduction of 911,000 from initial estimates, according to the initial report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trump abruptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer in August, just hours after BLS released initial employment data for July that included two months' of downward revisions to job growth data from earlier in the year. Trump argued that those revisions — which are common in jobs reports — showed that the BLS was manipulating employment data for political purposes. His firing of McEntarfer drew sharp rebuke from economists and some lawmakers. Powell was nominated by Trump in 2017 to serve as chair of the central bank. But ever since the start of Trump's second term, the chairman has become a frequent target of the White House, as the president's frustration has grown over Powell's refusal to lower interest rates. In August, however, Powell said that uncertainty in the U.S. economy may warrant interest rate cuts later this month. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Big Tech's last remaining RTO holdouts is officially sending employees back to the office. Microsoft is mandating employees work from offices at least three days a week, according to an internal email the company sent to staff on Tuesday. The mandate will happen in three phases, beginning at the end of February 2026, with Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office. February 23 was one of the start dates Microsoft considered, but it hasn't been decided yet. Coleman's email didn't include details about how such exceptions may work. Business Insider reported in August that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy mandating three days a week in the office. Microsoft sells software that enables remote work, such as its popular Teams workplace chat and meeting app. Even Zoom sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023. Microsoft first introduced a flexible work policy when it brought employees back to the office in late 2020 after pandemic-forced closures. That policy officially allowed employees to work from home at least half of the time without approval, but in practice it was even more flexible and most employees worked remotely most of the time. It has fired thousands of employees deemed low performers this year and introduced a new performance improvement plan meant to exit low performers more quickly. While working on the new RTO policy, Microsoft appears to have scrubbed a blog post that once heralded the benefits of remote work for retaining employees and boosting their productivity. And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do." The link to that blog post now redirects to one published on July 31 calling out how "hybrid work created new challenges for employee engagement" and how AI can solve them. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time. We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together. We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US. Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs. For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work. Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19. Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint. All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise. Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint. As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBCUniversal just gave its staffers an ultimatum: return to the office four days a week in 2026, or take a severance package. Business Insider first published NBCU's return-to-office memo, and now we have exclusive details about the company's "voluntary exit assistance package." According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, those who ask their manager about the severance package by October 3 will get the following offer: eight weeks of their base salary and continued healthcare coverage (medical, dental, and vision) for three months after their exit. Plus, they'll remain eligible for their full bonus. This severance offer is available for NBCU employees VP level or below who are based in the US and UK and are working hybrid. NBCU's parent company, Comcast, is spinning off most of its cable networks — including MSNBC and CNBC — into a new company called Versant by the end of the year. Employees designated for the spinoff, who still work for NBCU as of now, didn't get this new RTO mandate or severance offer, two current employees said. Notably, NBCU's severance offer isn't based on an employee's length of employment. Severance packages are often based on the number of years an employee has worked. "We want to ensure employees who continue with us in 2026 will comply and are aligned with our collective goal of fostering more in-person collaboration," this document said. An NBCU spokesperson declined to comment on internal communications and policies. RTO orders have become increasingly common across corporate America. Paramount's new CEO, David Ellison, just called his employees back in person five days a week, and major companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan have previously done the same. Some of these in-person directives may be "a stealth alternative to layoffs," Business Insider's Aki Ito wrote earlier this year. The rise of AI may tempt companies to get by with smaller workforces. NBCU's chief operating officer, Adam Miller, said in a memo that its decision was about improving collaboration across teams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin issuer Figure Technologies is increasing the size and upping the price of its initial public offering as retail investors bid up crypto-related stocks, a person familiar with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The company is considering a new IPO price range of $20-$22 a share — from $18-$20 a share — and raising the number of shares to 31.5 million from around 26 million, this person said, asking not to be identified because the information isn't public yet. The exact amounts were still in flux late Monday night and could be adjusted again before its IPO on Thursday, this person said, cautioning that the decision to revise the IPO plan wasn't yet final. Figure didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The blockchain firm, which initially targeted a valuation of $4.1 billion, is scheduled to start trading on the NASDAQ on Thursday under the symbol FIGR. The Trump administration's embrace of the crypto industry has prompted investors to pour money into digital assets, especially following the successful debuts of crypto exchange Bullish, and stablecoin issuer Circle in recent weeks. Co-founded in 2018 by technology entrepreneur Mike Cagney, Figure operates a blockchain-native platform for lending, trading and investing in consumer credit and digital assets. The company says it funds home equity loans in just 10 days, compared to the industry average of 42 days. It swung to a profit of $29 million for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $13 million in the same period a year earlier. We want to hear from you.

Attention turns to Cupertino today, with Apple's launch event taking place at the company's California headquarters at 1 p.m. Investors, analysts and consumers alike will be watching for the latest releases from the tech titan. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged to a fresh all-time closing high yesterday, and the good vibes didn't stop there: The Dow and S&P 500 also both posted gains. The moves come as investors await the release of closely followed inflation data on Wednesday and Thursday, which could help determine the Federal Reserve's course of action when it meets next week. While Fed funds futures are largely pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut, CNBC's Jeff Cox reports that there's a small chance of a larger, half-point decrease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), an AI-focused research university established by the United Arab Emirates, announced on Tuesday the release of a new, low-cost reasoning model to rival OpenAI and DeepSeek. It comes after DeepSeek, a Chinese AI lab, earlier this year shocked the world with the release of a reasoning model called R1 which it said could outperform OpenAI but with far less training costs. At just 32 billion parameters, MBZUAI's model, dubbed K2 Think, is much smaller than competing systems from OpenAI and DeepSeek. It was built on top of Alibaba's open-source Qwen 2.5 model and is run and tested on hardware provided by AI chipmaker Cerebas. For context, DeepSeek's R1 has a total of 671 billion parameters, which is essentially another term for the variables that an AI language model learns to understand and generate language. OpenAI doesn't disclose the parameter counts of its AI models. K2 Think was developed in partnership with G42, the buzzy UAE-based AI firm backed by U.S. tech giant Microsoft. They include long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning — a method of step-by-step reasoning — as well as so-called test-time scaling, which is a technique for improving performance by allocating extra computing resources during "inferencing" — or, applying learned knowledge to data it's never seen before. "What was special about our model is we treat it more like a system than just a model," Liu told CNBC. It's more like a system method work where all these methods combined delivered the final result," he added. America's tech giants and startups like OpenAI led the early momentum with so-called foundation models, which aim to fulfill a wide range of tasks by relying on vast amounts of training data. However, DeepSeek's breakthrough with R1 earlier this year reinforced China's position as a formidable AI player in its own right. More recently, the UAE has sought to position itself as a global leader in AI in a bid to enhance its geopolitical influence and diversify its economy beyond crude oil dependency. The region can point to its AI development firm G42 as an example of how it's gaining ground in the space. However, it faces fierce competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is looking to develop full-stack AI capabilities via Humain, a company launched under the Public Investment Fund in May. Microsoft's investment and partnership with G42 last year attracted a great deal of scrutiny in the U.S. related to the company's relationship with China. More broadly, the UAE's AI industry still has a long way to go to reach the scale of its U.S. and Chinese counterparts. OpenAI and the Big Tech players have enjoyed a good head start with their respective foundation AI models, while Beijing has long considered AI a strategic priority. While K2 Think demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI, the system's developers say the aim is not to build a chatbot like ChatGPT. Richard Morton, managing director for MBZUAI's Institute of Foundation Models, explains the model is intended to serve specific uses in fields like math and science. "With this particular application, instead of taking 1,000, 2,000 human beings five years to think through a particular question, or go through a particular set of clinical trials or something like that, this vastly condenses that period." It could also expand the reach of advanced AI technologies in regions that don't have access to the kind of capital and infrastructure U.S. firms possess. "What we're discovering is that you can do a lot more with less," Morton said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As workers head back into offices, many are encountering the same frustrations they did pre-pandemic: endless stretches of fluorescently lit cubicles, limited space for hybrid meetings, and generally depressing design. "People and companies know that offices are changing and that offices need to start feeling maybe a little bit more like hotels, with great service, seamless technology, inspiring design, and workplaces that create a true sense of place," Dean told Business Insider. "When offices are positioned and built to draw people in, then community develops. And that's really important for business — among other things." Dean made a name for herself studying flexible work. Until recently, she oversaw Atlassian's real estate and workplace experience teams, as well as a research lab investigating new ways of working. Last week, however, Dean started a new, decidedly in-person role: chief strategy officer for the building operations and experience division at CBRE, the world's biggest commercial real-estate services firm. In this role, Dean will oversee a new project, called the CBRExIndustrious Building Experience Lab, which the company announced Tuesday. The lab will partner with client companies to collect data about how workplaces are being used and then create research and products to advance "how workplaces operate for the people and teams that use them," said Dean. Forty million people come into an office every day run by CBRE, the real-estate services firm said. That means there's a huge amount of potential data to collect through partnerships. CBRE's lab is launching at a time when more companies are requiring employees to return to the office, whether employees are on board — or not. In July, foot traffic data indicated more US employees were working from an office than at any point since the pandemic. "It's very easy to position this as coercive and coming from employers, but we are also in a cultural moment, I think, where people are feeling disconnected." Employers are looking to ensure offices create opportunities for collaboration, said Hodari, who cofounded flexible coworking space Industrious, which was acquired by CBRE in January. And some part of that mix is being in-person together," he said. "Real estate has been a really big part of my career and life," said Dean, whose father was an architect. "I'm just really interested in what buildings mean for people." "We have an opportunity to build a world that's better for people," said Dean.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That puts him just behind Warren Buffett, who has a $148 billion fortune, even though Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is worth about a quarter as much as Nvidia, and Buffett has gifted more than half of his Berkshire stock to foundations since 2006. Bernard Arnault ranks eighth with a $164 billion fortune, despite LVMH being worth under $300 billion, or less than a 10th of Nvidia. Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has an estimated net worth of $383 billion and could extend his lead if his proposed $1 trillion pay package is approved. That's striking as the two companies that make up the lion's share of Musk's wealth, Tesla and SpaceX, are together valued around $1.6 trillion — less than 40% of Nvidia's market value. There's one reason Huang, who cofounded Nvidia in 1993 and has been the chipmaker's CEO ever since, isn't richer: dilution. That stake would be worth over $500 billion today. While it's typical for founders to sell shares and see their ownership diluted when their companies go public, Huang has seen a far more significant and prolonged decline in his stake. Huang's percentage ownership has dropped by more than two-thirds primarily because Nvidia has issued vast amounts of shares to provide equity for its employees. Nvidia has offset some of the dilution through stock buybacks, but its outstanding shares have surged from a split-adjusted 1.7 billion when it went public, to north of 23 billion now — a roughly 14-fold increase. Many companies, especially in the tech space, award employees with stock or stock options to incentivize them to increase the value of the company and its stock, while discouraging them from decamping to rivals. It's a way to attract and retain talent without spending cash. Huang's stake has also shrunk because he's sold shares, including a prearranged trading plan to dispose of up to 6 million shares this year, worth about $1 billion at Nvidia's current stock price. The rich list changes as companies' market caps fluctuate, but Huang's smaller stake means he's unlikely to top it anytime soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ByteDance believes it is worth more than Chevron, General Electric, and Coca-Cola. One of the world's biggest investors thinks it's even more valuable than that. Fidelity, which invested in TikTok's parent company in 2020 through its massive Contrafund, valued the company at more than $385 billion at the end of July, filings show. According to reports in late August, ByteDance is offering a share buyback program for employees looking for liquidity and valued itself at more than $330 billion, a 5.5% increase from earlier this year, when the company marked itself at $315 billion. But for $6.4 trillion Fidelity, the Chinese company's valuation of itself is low. Fidelity's valuation of the company considers ByteDance more valuable than public companies such as defense tech firm Palantir and Wall Street staple Bank of America. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There are plenty of reasons why the company might depress its valuation when offering buybacks to employees, primarily to accumulate its own equity at a discount in case it is needed for fundraising down the line. The company has a looming deadline that would materially change its standing. President Donald Trump's June executive order postponed the date by which ByteDance would need to sell its US TikTok operations to September 17, though he has hinted at that deadline being extended.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla just did the first major refresh of its best-selling Model Y more than five years after the compact SUV was announced in 2019. Since then, the Model Y has fended off challenges from major automakers like Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia to become one of the top-selling vehicles in the world. Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million vehicles last year, and the automaker has an ambitious target of 20-30% sales growth this year. A refreshed $45,000 Model Y could help it hit that lofty target as its remaining lineup begins to show its age. The EV market is now getting much more crowded, with a parade of new competitors, including crossover SUVs, every few months. Here are seven new models — from China and Europe, mostly — that are coming for the Model Y's crown. Price: Not yet listed, but expected around $50,000. (A current hybrid model starts at $60,300.) Availability: GLC400 in late 2026, and GLC300+ early 2027 Show-stopping feature: An optional panoramic "Hyperscreen" powered by the MB.OS supercomputer. Show-stopping feature: The iX3 is the first SUV to be built on BMW's Neue Klasse platform, which was designed specifically for EVs. Show-stopping feature: Xiaomi makes a lot of other consumer products in China, creating a robust tech ecosystem for users. Availability: Third quarter of 2025 in China and Australia. Show-stopping feature: Beyond the dazzling tech (which can recognize more than 1,630 voice commands), the L90 uses Nio's proprietary ultra-comfortable seat platform. Availability: Introduced last year in China and Europe, with India and other additional markets arriving throughout 2025. Show-stopping feature: The cabin is spacious, and the center screen rotates, which is pretty cool.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2003, Ghislaine Maxwell gifted Jeffrey Epstein a scrapbook for his 50th birthday. In between memorabilia from childhood friends, heartfelt letters from family, and photos of nude women, some of the world's wealthiest men and most prominent business leaders wished Epstein a happy birthday. Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive and associate of Bill Gates, sent several photos of animals having sex and with erect penises. A copy of the book, which spans over 200 pages, was released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday after it was obtained from Epstein's estate. The book includes apparent messages from now-President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as from childhood friends and family members. Wide swaths of it are redacted under sections titled "Girlfriends," "Children," and "Girl-friends." Inclusion in the book is not an indication of wrongdoing. Palm Beach police didn't start investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of girls until several years after Epstein received the book, in a case that culminated in a 2008 guilty plea on prostitution charges. A jury later found Maxwell guilty of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex, and she's serving a 20-year prison sentence. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the book in July, writing that it included a "bawdy" letter from Trump with a cryptic message that said "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," bracketed with an outline of a naked woman and the now-president's signature in the place of pubic hair. On Monday, a White House spokesperson said Trump didn't write the letter. The former Apollo Global Management CEO — and one of Epstein's only known financial clients — wrote a handwritten poem in Epstein's honor in the "friends" section. "Let's all give a cheer, for today he's Fifty!" Another rhyme reads "Blonde, Red or Brunette, spread out geographically" followed by "With this net of fish, Jeff's now 'The Old Man and The Sea,'" with "Old Man" underlined. Black has previously said he regrets his association with Epstein and wasn't aware of any sexual misconduct. An Apollo-commissioned investigation found that Black paid Epstein over $150 million between 2012 and 2017 for financial advice, including for tax maneuvers that saved him around $600 million. Black's 2003 letter appears to reference Epstein's forte with taxes: "Green eyeshades, schemes and plans, a unique tax strategy," it reads. "As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you," Epstein replies. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," Trump says. Trump's lawyers described the letter as "nonexistent" in a defamation lawsuit against the Journal after it published its story in July. On Monday, a representative for Trump's personal legal team directed Business Insider to a statement from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who described reporting about the letter as a "hatchet job." "As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it," Leavitt wrote. Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, wrote a brief note to Epstein in honor of his 50th birthday, the card shows. Underneath that text is an illustration of what appears to be a woman's breasts, followed by Wexner's signature. Wexner was one of Epstein's biggest and earliest financial clients, paying him tens of millions of dollars between the 1980s and the 2000s to manage the billionaire's personal financial life. Wexner said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007, amid a Florida law enforcement investigation into his sexual abuse of girls. In the process, Wexner said, he learned that Epstein "had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family." Elkus was a trustee at the organization's founding in 1991. In his note to Epstein, Elkus recounted a time in 1988 when Epstein visited him in Fairfield, Iowa, where he said he was managing the money of a wealthy local family. "It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women," Elkus wrote. "But not many people know that he can create them out of thin air." In an email on Tuesday, Elkus told Business Insider the event he recalled in the birthday letter was "long before any articles ever came out about Epstein, good or bad" and that the reference to girls and hogs jokingly cited an "old folk saying." Elkus recounted in his letter that, while visiting a local bookstore, "a spectacular tall blonde woman" approached Epstein, who then "did his magic, and she ended up going home with him to New York for the weekend." "I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow arranged the whole episode through some long-distance escort service" before being proven wrong after meeting the woman in Manhattan a week later, Elkus wrote. Elkus wrote in his email to Business Insider that the story referenced in the letter was not meant to be viewed nefariously. "I did not say that Epstein did anything inappropriate (and he didn't do anything inappropriate that I could see then or at any time before or after this incident)," Elkus wrote. One of the many lewd entries was from Nathan Myhrvold, who was listed as a friend of Epstein. At the time, Myhrvold had retired from his role as Microsoft's chief technology officer and was working as the CEO of Intellectual Ventures, a firm that incubates and markets inventions. He would go on to found the global health organizations Global Good and the Institute for Disease Modeling with Bill Gates. In an introductory letter published in the "friends" part of the book, Myhrvold wrote that he "agonized long and hard about what to write." "They seemed more appropriate than anything I could put in words," he wrote. A spokesman previously told The Wall Street Journal that Mhyrvoid didn't recall the submission and "regularly shares photos of and writes about animal behavior." "Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure, and watching his meteoric success has given me many vicarious thrills," Greenberg wrote in his note, which was included in the book's considerably less scandalous "business" section. She said that her husband "would never say no" if he were asked to write a birthday message. Another former Bear Stearns CEO, James "Jimmy" Cayne, handwrote a brief note to Epstein. Like Greenberg's note, it was published in the "business" section. The finance exec wished him a happy birthday and added what seems to be an inside joke: "From a 'six' to another 'six.'" His daughter did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. At the time of his death, he had no publicly known wife or children. The note is followed by a photo of then-President George W. Bush with his face blurred out, as well as a mock tabloid article headlined "International funny man of history revealed as alien in disguise." Epstein and Zuckerman briefly worked together on different media ventures. The pair, along with Harvey Weinstein and other investors, led a failed bid to buy New York Magazine in the early 2000s. Epstein and Zuckerman later briefly financed the celebrity magazine Radar. Zuckerman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the birthday letter or his relationship with Epstein. Representatives for US News & World Report, where he is the editor in chief, and Boston Properties, where he is the chairman, did not respond to requests for comment either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Karen Hastie, the 60-year-old founder of the Chamber Perks App in Ontario, Canada. It has been edited for length and clarity. After graduating, I started my first business in the fitness industry, a fitness store that expanded throughout Northern Ontario. I ran that company for over 30 years. When the pandemic hit, I sold it in a seven-figure deal and made enough to retire comfortably. However, it just didn't feel right. I've always been passionate about helping small businesses, so I began consulting and mentoring entrepreneurs in my community. It felt like the perfect next step: solving a real problem, supporting small businesses, and doing it on my terms. I built a strong and capable team from scratch. My CTO, who has experience working in Silicon Valley with tech startups and unicorn companies, is based in Calgary, and my daughter's company handles all our marketing. She's been in social media marketing for years, so it's a natural fit for us to work together. Tech is dominated by younger people, so I hired accordingly for my account manager and developers. Some challenges I've faced while working with younger employees include adjusting my work habits to accommodate their needs, learning to respect their work-life balance, and avoiding micromanagement. My clients are Chambers of Commerce and Boards of Trade around the world, starting with 400 in Canada and 7,500 in the US. I start my day at 8 a.m. by meeting with clients, speaking at conferences, and working with my team. My daughter's generation prioritizes work-life balance differently than mine. I'll easily work a 60 to 70-hour workweek and not consider that long, but when you love what you do, it's enriching. I love to golf and travel, but that isn't fulfilling for me. For me, retirement means having the freedom to do work you love without the pressure of providing for your family. That's the most significant gift of building my first business: I don't have to stress about money anymore. I'm doing this because it matters to me. The company was bootstrapped and has no debt. We're now launching the second suite of services, a CRM for chambers called Chamber Member Pro. These two services are expected to grow over the next year, and I'll then provide myself with a salary. The long-term goal is to grow, scale, and sell. With Chamber Perks, I'm already thinking ahead. This isn't another 30-year run for me — God willing, I'll still be around at 90, but the plan is to position the company for an acquisition or a more hands-off role for me within the next few years. My advice to anyone thinking about launching a business later in life is to find something you love, surround yourself with people who complement your skills, and don't be afraid to take the leap.</p>
