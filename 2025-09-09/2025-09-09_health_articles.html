                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the COVID-19 pandemic wound down, so did the federal government's funding to states that allowed all Medicaid enrollees to keep their coverage even if they no longer would have been eligible otherwise. This "great unwinding" at the end of March 2023 meant that more than 25 million people-about 30 percent of all Medicaid recipients-were removed from the program. Knowing whether payment comes from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance or the patient is important for health care organizations because it affects their financial bottom line." Daniel Marthey, PhD, a health policy expert and study author at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health Commercial insurance pays more than Medicare, while treating uninsured patients increases a hospital's uncompensated care costs and bad debt. For their study, published in Health Services Research, the team analyzed data on all 7.6 million patients younger than 17 who visited 472 emergency departments in Texas from April 2021 (before the Medicaid unwinding) through May 2024 (after the unwinding). Other Texas A&M researchers involved in the study were Benjamin Ukert, PhD, with the School of Public Health and Laura Dague, PhD, with the Bush School of Government and Public Service, along with colleagues from the University of Alabama and Penn State University. "The share of Medicaid-insured visits declined by 7.2 percentage points during the period studied, for a relative reduction of 11.7% from baseline," Marthey said. In addition, a lack of health insurance might lead to delays in children receiving routine health care, which could also increase the need for emergency department visits in the future, especially for the nearly half a million Texas children with asthma. Small, rural hospitals experienced the biggest declines in Medicaid patients and the largest increases in uninsured patients. "These hospitals are an important safety net for people in areas underserved in terms of health care access," Ukert said. "Many of them already have low or negative profit margins and risk closure." A rough calculation showed that while the unwinding led to fewer Medicaid-covered emergency department visits and more uninsured children, the loss in revenue may have been fully offset by higher payments from commercially insured visits. This estimate does not account for other shifts in payer distribution. Marthey noted that these findings might not apply elsewhere since Texas is one of the more populous states and since Medicaid eligibility and requirements can differ from state to state. "Our study underscores the need for policies that target transitions to other health programs so that the impact of the loss of health insurance coverage is minimized," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large portion of the global population with diabetes remains undiagnosed or is not receiving optimal care, according to a new study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. Underdiagnosis was greatest among young adults-despite facing higher risks for long-term complications. However, of those receiving treatment, only 42% had their blood sugar levels managed optimally. This translates to just 21% of all people with diabetes globally having their condition under optimal management. High-income North America had the highest rates of diagnosis, while high-income Asia Pacific showed the highest rates of treatment among diagnosed individuals. Southern Latin America had the highest rates of optimal blood sugar management among those treated. In contrast, Central sub-Saharan Africa faced the largest gaps in diagnosis, with less than 20% of people with diabetes being aware of their condition. By 2050, 1.3 billion people are expected to be living with diabetes, and if nearly half don't know they have a serious and potentially deadly health condition, it could easily become a silent epidemic." Given the pace at which cases are rapidly rising, the research underscores the urgent need for investment in screening programs for younger populations and access to medications and glucose-monitoring tools, especially in underserved regions. In 2022, the WHO set a target to have 80% of people with diabetes clinically diagnosed by 2030. Stafford, L. K., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In-hospital strokes — defined as those occurring during hospitalization for another diagnosis — are relatively common, affecting between 35,000 and 75,000 patients each year in the US. While the hospital may seem like the optimal setting for a stroke to occur to ensure good care and outcomes, these strokes actually have worse outcomes than those occurring in the community, said Fernando D. Testai, MD, PhD, professor of vascular neurology and fellowship director at UI Health, Chicago. Testai is also a co-author of the recent American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on best practices to improve in-hospital stroke care. “Patients who experience a stroke during hospitalization are more likely to experience delays in symptom recognition and initiation of treatment and worse outcomes compared to strokes occurring in the community,” Testai said in an email interview with Medscape Medical News. Hospitalists, he said, can play an important role in improving that scenario. Like other non-neurologists, they can “serve as the first line of defense in recognizing new signs and symptoms of stroke and engaging the stroke team,” he said. “Beyond the acute setting, they play a critical role in delivering comprehensive, longitudinal healthcare,” he said, helping patients manage vascular risk factors and encouraging lifestyle modifications to reduce recurrent stroke risk — both for those patients affected after they have been admitted and those who arrive seeking treatment for a suspected stroke. In years past, options to treat acute stroke were limited, and management was largely supportive, Testai said. “This led to a somewhat nihilistic attitude toward acute stroke management in the medical community. Testai recommends that hospitalists maintain a high index of suspicion about stroke when caring for patients and that they promptly engage the stroke team if needed — because that will maximize the chances of timely treatment, in the process minimizing brain injury and improving patient outcomes. In a session at the Society of Hospital Medicine's CONVERGE conference, neurohospitalist Joseph “Caleb” McCall, MD, MBA, Neurohospitalist Division chief and clinical assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, discussed the past, present, and future of stroke care, citing studies, guidelines, and developments that hospitalists should know about. The micro is for each patient, and that's hard to encapsulate in an overview. Hospitalists should become familiar with the resources of their own hospital, McCall said. Hospitalists will generally be providing care outside that hyperacute window, McCall said. Be aware of your facility's policy for when a patient needs referral to a higher level of care, whether to the ICU or another hospital, he said. Become familiar with tools such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. “For stroke patients, every decision we make as hospitalists carries the profound power to shape their future,” said Gurdeep Singh, DO, a hospitalist and associate professor at The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who currently serves as the past president of the Society of Hospital Medicine's New Mexico chapter. “While we may care for 16 or more patients in a single day, each patient often has only one doctor — and, in that moment, our presence and attention can mean everything.” As a result, he said, there is substantial variability among hospitals in terms of what constitutes stroke education for staff and how widely it is disseminated in each institution. “Stroke care captures the very essence of what it means to be a hospitalist,” Singh said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obstructive sleep apnea have a higher risk of death, but treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may reduce that risk by around 26%, according to new research being presented at this year's Annual Meeting of The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), Vienna (15-19 Sept). Obstructive sleep apnea is when throat muscles relax during sleep, blocking the airway, causing a person to wake up repeatedly to breathe. This disrupted sleep pattern can lower oxygen levels, affecting the brain. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart trouble, and T2D. In people with T2D, sleep apnea is associated with more than a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease (including heart failure and stroke) and a 24% higher risk of dying from any cause compared to those without sleep apnea. Despite the substantial impact of obstructive sleep apnea on cardiovascular disease and survival, it often goes undiagnosed in people with type 2 diabetes and is not routinely addressed as part of diabetes management. Previous studies in patients with both T2D and obstructive sleep apnea have been limited by short follow-up periods and a focus on metabolic endpoints, rather than on longer-term clinical outcomes such as survival. To answer these questions, Swedish researchers analysed data from five Swedish national registers between 2010 and 2024 to identify 12,388 T2D patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had been prescribed CPAP and 737,911 T2D patients (whose obstructive sleep apnea status was unknown) who were never prescribed CPAP, to compare long-term survival. Dr Agholme explains, "Despite potential dilution from including individuals without obstructive sleep apnea in the control group, the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in people with T2D, together with the higher risk of illness associated with having both T2D and obstructive sleep apnea, should allow any clinically relevant associations of CPAP to be detected." The CPAP treatment group included less women ( 31% vs. 43%), was younger (average age 58 years vs. 65 years), but had a higher average body mass index (BMI, 34.7 kg/m² vs. 30.6 kg/m²). After adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, and prior cardiovascular disease, as well as factors that may vary during follow-up including BMI, smoking, cholesterol, kidney function, blood pressure, and pharmacological treatment, they found that patients who were prescribed CPAP had a 26% lower risk of dying from any cause over the 14-year period, compared with patients who never received CPAP. "This new study using real-world data highlights the potential benefits of CPAP in people with T2D and obstructive sleep apnea, a clinical conundrum that has long awaited answers," said Dr Agholme. "The findings suggest that CPAP may play an important role in improving patient outcomes and survival, and they underline the value of early OSA diagnosis in people with T2D. Still, more rigorous research is needed to determine the causal effect of CPAP treatment. " The authors also acknowledge that data on CPAP adherence were only available for a small subset of patients, so the analyses followed an intention-to-treat principle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large-scale survey conducted by Lung Cancer Europe (LuCE) has identified critical communication barriers that affect information access, understanding, and shared decision-making among lung cancer patients and caregivers across Europe. The study, based on 2,040 valid survey responses from 34 WHO European Region countries in 20 languages, evaluated three key areas: general knowledge about lung cancer, access to information, and involvement in decision-making. Lung Cancer Europe (LuCE) is a nonprofit, patient-led organization that serves as the umbrella group for lung cancer advocacy organizations across Europe. Patients need information that is understandable, timely, and supports meaningful participation in their care. Despite best intentions, current systems often fall short of empowering patients and caregivers to make informed decisions." Montague reported that 65% of participants delayed seeking care due to unrecognized symptoms and 22% were unaware of biomarkers, while 24% did not understand their prognosis. "Patients told us that common barriers included information processing (39%), lack of clarity (33%), and complexity (33%)," she said. Montague reported that the top obstacle to shared decision-making was complex medical language (49%). Montague said she encourages healthcare providers, policymakers, and advocacy groups to collaborate to improve early diagnosis, enhance communication, and prioritize shared decision-making. "Health providers must enable and implement shared decision-making to help enhance quality of life. Improved communication strategies are critical to deliver person-centered care," Montague said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) demonstrates that monitoring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can refine and personalize the use of consolidation immunotherapy in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). The research, led by scientists at the National Cancer Center of China, assessed ctDNA in 177 patients with LS-SCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), 77 of whom received consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This is the first study to show that early ctDNA detection after induction chemotherapy can help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from consolidation immunotherapy. The study used next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a 139-gene lung cancer panel to assess ctDNA at ultra-deep coverage (30,000×). Advanced statistical models including time-dependent Cox regression were employed to eliminate immortal time bias. "These findings offer a compelling rationale for integrating ctDNA-based stratification in future LS-SCLC trials and may help guide real-time decisions on the use of consolidation ICIs," Dr. Bi said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For most broken bones, bone cells regrow on their own while patients wear a cast or brace to keep the injury steady. But for complex or severe fractures, surgeons may intervene by placing grafts or scaffolds made of biocompatible materials, or by using metal fixation devices to ensure proper bone healing and alignment. Collaborating with orthopedic surgeons, a team led by biomedical engineering researchers at Penn State created CitraBoneQMg, an implantable biodegradable scaffold to support bone regrowth made by combining magnesium and glutamine with citric acid. "By integrating magnesium and glutamine - two small molecules found naturally in the body and in food - with citric acid, we found that the molecules work together to promote bone growth by encouraging increased intracellular energy metabolism," said first author Hui Xu, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, who is advised by co-corresponding author Su Yan, assistant research professor of biomedical engineering. "The molecules concurrently regulate the two energy pathways, which is different than what normally happens – usually they act as a seesaw, one speeding up while the other slows down," Xu said. "The scaffold essentially powers up a bone cell: both nutrients act in a synergistic relationship with the citric acid to give stem cells more energy to grow and differentiate to bone cells, leading to better bone regrowth." To test CitraBoneQMg, the researchers implanted their experimental scaffold into a cranial defect of the skull of rats and compared its resulting bone growth to rats with a citric acid only-based scaffold implant and one with a traditional bone material implant. "The three molecules work as a healing recipe for the bone, paving the way for a new way of thinking of bone repair," Yan said. "Alongside rapid bone growth, we also saw nerve regeneration and antiinflammation properties at the site of the scaffold, two elements that are important to long-term healing of the bone." Additionally, the researchers discovered that the polymer scaffold contains inherent photoluminescent and photoacoustic properties, which allows it to be easily imaged after it is implanted at the injury site. "With photoacoustic properties, CitraBoneQMg has great potential for in vivo tracking, where it can be detected by ultrasound underneath deep tissue," Xu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discovery could open the door to much-needed new approaches to diagnose glioblastoma early, track its progress and treat it more effectively. The study was led by Dr. Benjamin Werner at Queen Mary University of London and Professor Paul Mischel at Stanford University, both part of Cancer Grand Challenges' team eDyNAmiC, as well as Professor Charlie Swanton at The Francis Crick Institute. Glioblastoma is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with median survival remaining at around 14 months and little improvement in recent decades. New approaches for earlier detection and more effective treatment are urgently needed. ecDNA is emerging as a potentially important player in many adult and paediatric cancers, including glioblastoma, but its role is complex and mysterious. In 2022, they funded team eDyNAmiC – a $25m international, cross-disciplinary consortium of experts in cancer, clinical research, evolutionary biology, computer science and mathematics – to decipher ecDNA's role and identify ways to target it. The current study marks an important advance in team eDyNAmiC's work. We studied the tumors much like an archaeologist would. Rather than taking a single sample, we excavated multiple sites around the tumor, allowing us to build computational models describing how they evolved. We simulated millions of different scenarios to reconstruct how the earliest ecDNAs emerged, spread, and drove tumor aggressiveness, giving us a clearer picture of the tumor's origins and progression." Dr. Benjamin Werner, senior author, group leader at the Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London The analysis revealed that most ecDNA rings contained EGFR, a potent cancer-driving gene. "These subtle mechanisms show that there may be a window of opportunity to detect and treat the disease between the first appearance of EGFR ecDNA and the emergence of these more aggressive variants," suggests Dr. Magnus Haughey, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr Werner's group and one of the paper's lead authors. The study confirmed that ecDNA can carry more than one cancer gene at a time, each of which may uniquely shape how tumors evolve and respond to treatment. This highlights the potential value of tailoring treatments based on a tumor's ecDNA profile. "These findings suggest that ecDNA is not just a passenger in glioblastoma, but an early and powerful driver of the disease. Paul Mischel, MD, the Fortinet Founders Professor and professor and vice chair of research in the pathology department at Stanford Medicine, says: "These findings reveal an important new insight into the role of ecDNA in tumor development and progression. Previous work from our collaborative team and other researchers, has shown that ecDNA can arise early in tumor development, including at the stage of high-grade dysplasia, and it can also arise later to drive tumor progression and treatment resistance. The findings here show that in glioblastoma, there is an early event driven by ecDNA that could potentially be more actionable, raising the possibility that glioblastoma is another cancer for which earlier detection and intervention based upon ecDNA may be possible." This study exemplifies the bold, boundary-pushing science Cancer Grand Challenges was created to support. By unravelling the evolutionary history of ecDNA in glioblastoma, team eDyNAmiC is not only deepening our understanding of one of the most devastating cancers but also illuminating new paths for earlier detection and treatment. It's a powerful reminder that when we bring together diverse disciplines and global talent, we can begin to solve the toughest problems facing cancer research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study published in Engineering has shed new light on the potential therapeutic effects of berberine (BBR), a natural compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, in treating diabetic encephalopathy (DE). The research, conducted by a team from the State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, reveals that BBR can significantly improve cognitive function and protect cerebral vessels in type 2 diabetic encephalopathy mice by modulating the gut microbiota. Diabetic encephalopathy is a condition characterized by cognitive impairment due to chronic hyperglycemia, often leading to severe neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenesis of DE is complex and involves factors like cerebrovascular inflammation, which can be exacerbated by the activation of inflammatory pathways such as Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The study investigates the role of BBR in mitigating these effects by targeting the gut microbiota, which has been increasingly recognized for its influence on neurological health.The researchers used a type 2 diabetic encephalopathy KK-Ay (2DEK) mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of BBR. After ten weeks of treatment, the cognitive functions of the mice were assessed using novel object recognition and step-down tests. These findings suggest that BBR can protect cerebral vessels from hyperglycemia-induced damage.The study also explored the mechanism by which BBR exerts its protective effects. By reducing δ-VB levels, BBR interrupts this inflammatory pathway, thereby protecting cerebral blood vessels and improving brain function.To further validate the role of the gut microbiota, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed using gut microbiota from BBR-treated mice. The results showed that BBR increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Akkermansia, which are known to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These SCFAs are known to have anti-inflammatory effects and may contribute to the overall therapeutic benefits of BBR. Conversely, BBR reduced the levels of harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella, which are associated with increased inflammation.The study provides compelling evidence that BBR can protect cerebral vessels and alleviate diabetic encephalopathy by modulating the gut microbiota and reducing the production of harmful metabolites like δ-VB. Future research should focus on clinical trials to further explore the therapeutic potential of BBR in human patients with DE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black adolescents with mental distress are less likely to use mental health services than their White peers, and Black girls are the least likely to access care, according to new research published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241733. "Adolescence is a crucial developmental stage and a critical period for onset of mental health problems," writes Mercedes Sobers, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto and research coordinator at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, Ontario, with coauthors. "In Canada, Black adolescents disproportionately access services through crisis situations, such as justice system interactions or when intensive care is required, suggesting they are less likely to access mental health care until intense intervention is needed." There is a lack of data on mental health services usage in Canada for Black youth and other racialized populations. The study, which included data on 12 368 middle- and high-school students (grades 7–12) who identified as Black or White from the 2015, 2017, and 2019 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, encompassed schools from as many as 52 school boards in Ontario. The researchers found distinct trends for Black males and females. In general, Black youth (both male and female) who were more distressed were less likely to report using services than their White peers. "Black adolescent mental health must be discussed with consideration of the interaction between being Black, sex, and mental distress," write the authors. Many barriers may reduce access to care, such as a lack of culturally competent care, inaccessible services, racism, and cultural stigma that can contribute to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and misconceptions that foster mistrust in the system. When Black males exhibit signs of psychological distress, they are more likely to be met with disciplinary or punitive responses, sometimes with fatal consequences, rather than mental health support. This may also explain why, once they overcome access barriers, their care frequency matches that of White peers," write the authors. They call for specific policy and practice changes to help equalize mental health service use. "Intersectional strategies that tackle racism and the specific mental health challenges faced by Black students are needed. Enhancing mental health service utilization for Black adolescents demands culturally responsive and sex-specific adaptations to care."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Australian study suggests that mandatory folic acid fortification may have unintended consequences, linking excess folate to rising gestational diabetes and calling for urgent policy reassessment. Study: Maternal Folate Excess, Placental Hormones, and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Findings from Prospective Cohorts Before and After Mandatory Folic Acid Food Fortification. The study leveraged a “natural experiment” comprising two large groups of pregnant women (n = 2,464; SCOPE and STOP cohorts) before and after Australia mandated folic acid food fortification. Study findings revealed that post-fortification, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) rates tripled, maternal folate stores rose by 259%, and levels of key placental hormones were altered in ways that may affect glucose metabolism. These findings suggest that widespread maternal folate excess may be associated with the Australian GDM epidemic. Beyond GDM: While GDM surged post-fortification, other complications like preeclampsia and preterm birth showed no similar increase, pointing to a specific link with glucose metabolism. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of high blood sugar that develops specifically during pregnancy and can pose severe health risks to both the mother and her unborn child. While factors like rising maternal age and obesity are known contributors to GDM, their prevalence fails to account for the steepness of this trajectory, leading scientists to seek other potential environmental drivers and modifiable risk factors. Folic acid, the synthetic form of vitamin B9 (folate), and a known crucial requirement for normal foetal neural tube development, presents an unlikely prime candidate. To ensure adequate vitamin B9 intake, Australia implemented a mandatory folic acid (FA) fortification program for bread-making flour (2009). This policy, combined with a sharp increase in the use of high-dose prenatal supplements, has successfully reduced Australia's previous folate deficiency. However, a growing body of observational and animal evidence suggests that the overconsumption of folic acid may trigger gestational complications, including GDM. Validating these accounts would help inform future public health policy within the nation, potentially reducing the risk faced by millions of mothers and children. Triglycerides also played a role: Within the post-fortification group, high triglyceride levels were actually a stronger independent predictor of GDM risk than folate itself. The present study aims to meet this knowledge requirement by leveraging a “unique natural experiment” comparing two large prospective cohorts of pregnant women recruited from the same hospital, one before and one after Australia's 2009 folic acid fortification mandate. Analytically identical data from the Screening Tests to identify poor Outcomes of Pregnancy (STOP) cohort (1,300 participants), recruited between 2015 and 2018, were used to synthesize the post-fortification group dataset. Long-term folate data (RCF) for the pre-fortification period were not available from SCOPE and were instead derived from a separate contemporaneous cohort at the same hospital using identical protocols. Between-group comparisons were conducted within a meta-analytic framework, utilizing log-binomial regression with inverse probability weighting models. Folate deficiency also showed a hint of risk: While numbers were very small, the single case of GDM among the few women with folate deficiency suggests a potential U-shaped risk curve. Log-binomial regression with inverse probability weighting revealed a dramatic shift in both GDM rates and folate levels between the STOP and SCOPE participants. GDM incidence was observed to triple from 5.0% (SCOPE) to 15.2% in post-fortification STOP, mirrored by an unprecedented surge in maternal folate levels. Long-term folate stores, measured by RCF, were 259% higher in the post-fortification group (p < 0.0001). Most alarmingly, between-group comparisons revealed that the proportion of women with RCF levels above the established clinical reference range increased from 0.5% before fortification to 57.6% afterward, indicating a nationwide scenario of folate excess. Serum folate was also 18% higher in the post-fortification group. Subsequent analysis directly linked this folate excess to the risk of GDM. For every 500 nmol/L increase in RCF, the risk of developing GDM was observed to rise by 34% (p = 0.04). Its findings suggest that high folate levels may alter placental hormone production, potentially disrupting the mother's ability to regulate blood sugar during pregnancy. While folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy remains essential, this research underscores the need to reassess current fortification and high-dose supplementation policies. Future public health policy in Australia should prioritize establishing an upper safe limit for folate intake during pregnancy, as it is crucial to balance the prevention of congenital disabilities with the protection of maternal metabolic health.
