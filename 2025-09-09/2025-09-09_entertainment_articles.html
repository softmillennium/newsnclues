If nothing else, it's always wonderful to see a new Steven Soderbergh movie with some actual life in its bones. I never would have guessed that the answer to Soderbergh's listlessness might be an 86-year-old man, but Ian McKellen — delivering what's easily his most essential screen performance since “The Lord of the Rings” — is so full of vim and vigor in “The Christophers” that he threatens to revitalize his director by osmosis. Related Stories ‘Dust Bunny' Review: Bryan Fuller's Directorial Debut Is a Wonderfully Whimsical and Deliciously Macabre Modern Fairytale Chloé Zhao Knows How to Make You Cry: The ‘Hamnet' Director Digs Deep on Her Surefire Oscar Contender McKellen stars as the fading artist formerly known as Julian Sklar, a once-revered painter who peaked in the '90s with a series of portraits of his ex-lover — the titular Christopher — before losing his luster, becoming the Simon Cowell of a ludicrous reality competition show, and finding himself on the wrong side of “cancel culture” for unspecified reasons. Now supposedly dying from some terminal illness, Julian has gone total hermit mode inside of his cluttered London apartment, where the walls are festooned with the relics of his success and the backrooms are a junk pile of painful memories. Painful memories like his relationship with Christopher, which left Julian rich but scarred; his work began to suffer along with their romance, to the point that the last eight pieces of his signature series have remained unfinished in a dusty corner of his home for the last 30 years. His grubby adult kids (James Corden and Jessica Gunning) — still stinging from the casual cruelty he inflicted upon them as children, and well-aware that Julian's withholding nature will extend to their inheritance — would sure love it if they found a previously unknown trove of three million dollar paintings among their father's stuff when he died, and so they hire the best art forger in Britain to apply for an assistant job in the hopes that she can nick the unfinished “Christophers” and complete them with Julian's original materials (thus making it impossible to identify them as fakes). Julian is no easy mark, and Lori (a smart, sly, and deeply felt Michaela Coel) has reasons for wanting to fuck him over that have nothing to do with money. The competing agendas of Ed Solomon's script set the stage for a fun and prickly chamber piece that's hiding a dozen booby traps in every room, and Soderbergh is so excited about the prospect of setting them off that his camera literally shakes the moment he steps foot into the tomb-like apartment where most of this story takes place, as if the director — again doing his own cinematography under the guise of “Peter Andrews” — was getting a contact high just from being that close to a vintage Ian McKellen performance. It starts with Julian recording a rapid-fire series of Cameo-like internet videos for $149 a pop, and scatters around the duplex from there until what's left of his legacy is placed into a firepit in the backyard. In between, both the flamboyant painter and the business-like job applicant who comes to his door lay all of their cards on the table, as what seems to be the premise for another Soderbergh heist movie instead gives way to a broader and frequently withering — sometimes even Pinter-esque — pas de deux about all of the things that people take from each other. A rascally old coot who's lost everything besides his ability to piss people off (a talent that he nurtures like a virtue), Julian knows that he fell off as an artist, but his growing irrelevance has been difficult for him to reconcile with the increasing smallness of his life; the world may have moved on, but he's still the center of his own universe. In a performance as layered as the unfinished canvases that Julian keeps in storage, McKellen inhabits the character as a bloody prick who takes pleasure in his cutting wit, but also endows him — absent the slightest trace of sentimentality — with the wounded resignation of a man who only hurts people because he doesn't know how to help them. (Details are few and far between in a movie that doesn't make a lot of room for exposition, but there are telling references to a public stunt where Julian gave a middle finger to the art community by selling his work to people on the street.) In Lori, Julian finds someone who knows how to put him back on defense. The rare forger capable of perfectly imitating Julian's style, but also an art burnout who's lost faith in her ability to produce meaningful work of her own, Lori offers Julian a most unexpected kind of mirror. Young, Black, poly, and so petrified of vulnerability that she handles every interaction in a cool-headed monotone, Lori is the living emblem of who an old white artist might blame for their irrelevance, and yet — for reasons that don't become fully clear until the end of the film, via a clumsy flashback that's only redeemed by the ambiguity it still leaves behind — she and Julian are as tightly intertwined as a needle sewn into a canvas. Yes, the movie could still be mounted as a piece of theater without much need for adaptation, and yes, it still feels more like Soderbergh is testing his own talent for efficiency than it does like he's trying to make a meaningful piece of pop art, but “The Christophers” at least has an answer for that. Real or fake, finished or not, a genre exercise or a full-hearted statement of purpose, the things we create have an impact on the world that no market could ever be able to measure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Stressed Out” duo, set to release its eighth studio album later this week, says the site is a “veritable swamp of infringing and otherwise illegal products,” including many that are “blatant copies” of its merch. “Temu is widely understood to be one of the most unethical companies operating in today's global marketplace,” the band's lawyers wrote in a complaint obtained by Billboard. Temu, which means “Team Up, Price Down,” is an online marketplace that boomed in 2024 by selling low-priced goods directly to American consumers. But Twenty One Pilots (composed of singer Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun) says many of those goods are fakes that violate U.S. intellectual property. In one, an exact replica of a $35 t-shirt that features the two stars standing back to back, is shown on Temu at the price of just $7.54. Artists are increasingly using legal measures to crack down on counterfeit merch. Last month, Benson Boone and Tate McRae's merchandise partners each filed separate lawsuits over fake gear sold outside their concerts. Before that, Nirvana, Harry Styles, Rod Wave and many others had filed similar cases. But such cases can be tricky: In late 2023, Luke Combs accidentally sued a superfan who was selling decorative tumblers and quickly won a $250,000 judgment against her. Other artists have chosen to target major online platforms that allegedly facilitate such sales. Monday's case was filed by the same lawyers who filed a similar case against Temu last month on behalf of the estate of MF Doom, leveling many of the same accusations. Like that earlier case, Twenty One Pilots' new allegations reach well beyond intellectual property by including claims that the company sells the products of forced labor, has aided the Chinese Communist Party and has sold toxic lead products. The suit also claims Temu has sold goods tied to “homophobia, inciting violence, and violent criminal gang activity,” featuring an image of a shirt purportedly promoting the gang MS-13 and another that reads, “I'm Violently Homophobic.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Childhood fears are often extremely personal in how they manifest internally, but many are universal in the outward shape they take; fear of darkness and the monsters lurking within that unknown void being one of the most common. “Dust Bunny,” the debut feature film from prolific television creator Bryan Fuller (“Wonder Falls,” “Pushing Daisies,” “Hannibal”) takes a simple question: “What if the monster under the bed is real?” and crafts a thrilling and heartfelt action-horror-comedy that brings his trademark mixture of whimsical maximalism and macabre humor effortlessly to the big screen. The film stars newcomer Sophie Sloan as Aurora, a young girl whose belief in the monster under her bed is so strong that the creature actually comes to life in physical form, at first as cute, yet sinister collection of dust shaped like a bunny before morphing into a giant room-sized furry piranha-like menace that eats people in one swallow, brought to life through thrilling CGI-enhanced puppetry. Related Stories Chloé Zhao Knows How to Make You Cry: The ‘Hamnet' Director Digs Deep on Her Surefire Oscar Contender Sales So Far Out of Venice, TIFF, and Telluride: Gus Van Sant's ‘Dead Man's Wire' Goes to Another New Distributor Enter Resident 5B, played with irrepressible charm and agility by long-time Fuller collaborator Mads Mikkelsen, Aurora's neighbor from across the hall. Convinced that she saw the man slay a dragon in Chinatown one night, Aurora attempts to hire him to kill the monster under her bed after it eats her parents. But because of his actual profession — he's a hired hitman — he thinks perhaps one of his monsters may have accidentally axed her parents thinking they were him, and will come for Aurora next. The art direction has nods to the luxury of “Hannibal” season three with the vibrant color palette of “Pushing Daisies.” Viewers familiar with Fuller's television work will not be surprised by the many shots of delicious food, including a dim sum dish that looks like a cute little bunny, which was styled by Janice Poon, whose work on “Hannibal” was the cherry on top of its aesthete horror vibe. Old fashioned filmic techniques like split diopter shots, iris wipes, and chiaroscuro lighting add another layer of maximalist flare to the whole affair. Eccentric touches, like the bunny dim sum moving slightly before being eaten or a taxidermied chicken with an egg in its butt as a lamp or a swinging church choir wearing Pam Am style uniforms, firmly place “Dust Bunny” inside the whimsical world of the Fullerverse, although the uninitiated may find it all a bit too much. Mikkelsen, in one of the most tender performances of his career, and Sloan, whose expressive eyes stay impossibly wide for the duration of the film, craft an easy chemistry together, his mordant humor matching hers like a glove. The ending might not sit well with everyone, it's both on-the-nose and a little overly simple, but as someone who had rage issues as a child, I felt it deeply in my bones. As far as Fuller is concerned, the best we can do is accept that part of ourselves, and find more constructive ways to feed it. Like making emotionally resonant, visually resplendent, and ridiculously gruesome art about the power of chosen family. “Dust Bunny” premiered in Midnight Madness at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It will be released in theaters by Roadside Attractions on December 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor Orlando Bloom and Former “American Idol” judge and pop Icon Katy Perry are proving there's no bad blood after their split. The former couple, who recently ended their nine-year relationship, showed they remain on good terms when Perry shared Bloom's new movie “The Cut” with fans. On September 7, Perry shared the trailer on Instagram, captioning it, “proud of you @orlandobloom.” Bloom responded with a simple heart emoji, a gesture that showed appreciation for her support. You know when you leave everything on the field like I did in this movie, I feel grateful for all of it.” Bloom also made it clear that his bond with Perry remains strong. While Friday marked Bloom's first public comments about his split from Perry, the actor had previously shared uplifting quotes on his Instagram Stories on June 30, just days after news of their breakup became public. “Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on coparenting,” the rep shared. “They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is—and always will be—raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.” Bloom, who is also father to 14-year-old Flynn with ex-wife Miranda Kerr, has consistently spoken about the importance of family. Perry echoed that sentiment in an interview on Call Her Daddy, where she explained why their relationship worked for so long. “We want to evolve,” Perry said at the time. “That's what I think our relationship is for: to become better humans so we can raise this beautiful human being.” Even after their romantic chapter closed, Bloom and Perry continue to show that mutual love, respect, and shared dedication to Daisy will always come first.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Following his work on the Screen Gems video game adaptation Until Dawn, David F. Sandberg has inked a deal to tackle another beloved genre property, as director of a new Amityville Horror movie in development at Amazon MGM Studios. Fresh off the success of The Conjuring: Last Rites, which was released in theaters this past weekend and has already earned $187 million global, Ian Goldberg & Richard Naing have been tapped to write the script, described as a reimagining of the original horror classic. Further specifics as to the story here are under wraps. A year or so after the horrific crime, George and Kathy Lutz, along with their three children, move into the house, unaware of its dark past. And shortly after settling in, they claim to experience a series of unsettling paranormal phenomena. Clearly, there's great interest in Amityville right now as a jumping-off point for new feature stories. Only a couple of months ago, we reported exclusively that BoulderLight Pictures and Divide/Conquer — the producers of Weapons and Heart Eyes, respectively — are developing a new Amityville project set apart from the film canon, with roots in the public domain folk tale. Joseph and Vanessa Winter, the married writer-director duo behind the SXSW found footage horror movie Deadstream, will direct that one from their own script. Word of the Amityville projects comes at an opportune time, as it's been a while since we've seen a real breakout entry in the franchise. The most recent, semi-notable installment came last year with Amityville: Where the Echo Lives, a Lionsgate title with a no-name cast that went straight to Max. Prior to that, Dimension Films and Blumhouse were among the producers of Amityville: The Awakening, a title released through RADiUS-TWC that had a decent cast in Bella Thorne, Cameron Monaghan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Mckenna Grace and Thomas Mann, but grossed just a little over $8 million. In addition to Until Dawn and Annabelle: Creation, Sandberg is known for his work on the horror pic Lights Out, as well as both Shazam! He is repped by CAA, Gotham Group, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Naing is repped by Independent Artist Group, Circle Management + Production, and Del Shaw Moonves; Goldberg by WME, New Wave Entertainment, and Del Shaw Moonves.

I have 0 confidence in this after what happened to until dawn, how did he ruin that adaptation when it was one of the most cinemantic games ever created? You know, they COULD just write a brand new story about a haunted house that wasn't a sequel, requel, remake, reboot, reimagining, redo, revival, reintroduction… it could just be an ORIGINAl thing. You know, like how they used to make movies? Shouldn't you not being getting work after making Until Dawn? We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sabrina Carpenter took a trip to Los Angeles' Safari Records to chop it up with oddball Canadian interviewer Nardwuar, who loaded the “Espresso” singer with a satchel full of vintage vinyl and other musical keepsakes during their ramble. Nardwuar revealed that the singer's former label, Hollywood Records, only printed up 200 vinyl copies of her 2015 debut studio album, Eyes Wide Open, to distribute to press and VIPs. Expertly navigating Nardwuar's signature rapid-fire topic skipping , Carpenter took it all-the-way back to the beginning, telling him that as an eight-year-old one of the first musicians she really laser focused on while listening to her iPod Nano was Taylor Swift. “At that time I was so tapped in and I was really fascinated because it's like you're seeing a rainbow for the first time,” she said of her early musical discovery. “One of one of the first artists that I listened to on the school bus was Taylor Swift because my best friend Anna — who was my next door neighbor — played me ‘Our Song' in her headphones for me. He also piled on a Carpenter vinyl Man's Best Friend slipmat, a copy of 1957's Funny Face soundtrack from the film starring one of her favorite actresses, Audrey Hepburn and a Patti Smith vinyl single of “Hey Joe,” as well as the MC5's “Kick Out the Jams” and an vinyl album of Carole King covers. And, of course, he gave her an Earth, Wind & Fire “Let Me Talk” single in honor of Carpenter taking the stage with the legendary R&B band during her headlining set at Lollapalooza this summer. Given her Disney-affiliated background he handed over a copy of the 1961 Disney single “Heigh-Ho” from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, with Carpenter cheekily quipping that the phrase “has a new meaning now.” The interview ended with Carpenter asking the store's manager to find her a particular album by 1970s soft rockers Bread, the “underrated” band she predicted would be playing at her wedding some day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Ronson can see them everywhere: In Tribeca, there are remnants of New Music Cafe, where Ronson made the jump to flyer-billed headlining DJ at a party called Sweet Thang in his early twenties. That same address, where Brooklyn legends Jay-Z and Notorious B.I.G. heard him play — and where he became the first DJ to drop “Hypnotize” before its official release — became an oyster restaurant a few years back. “I have so many memories of pulling up to the club and seeing everybody already on line, excited for the night ahead,” the DJ turned Grammy Award-winning producer recalls. These days, Ronson is a bit of both. Now 50, a husband, and a father of two, he carries the memories in his bones quite literally: He has chronic neck problems and inflamed joints from countless nights spent hunched over turntables. “I hear Busta Rhymes ‘Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See,' and I'm instantly back in this club called Rebar on 16th and Eighth. “Music, even more than other forms of art, stays in your body because the bass and things like that somehow change the molecules in your body.” You have so many memories tied to these locations that shuttered or that don't exist in the same capacity that they once did.The book is about a lot of things. And then it's all about New York in the Nineties. But it's very much like a ghost story in some ways, because it's a New York that doesn't exist anymore, especially downtown New York. Some of those clubs opened and shuttered five times, even in the course of the Nineties when I was DJ'ing. New Music Cafe was the first place where I DJ'd, and Biggie would come down. I remember the first time he brought Jay-Z down, and Jay-Z only had, like, two songs to his name. I was a 21-year-old kid, and the people from my record sleeves are coming to life and just populating the party. Whenever I walk past that building, it's really crazy because I have so many memories from it, no matter what's in there now. The very end of the book is me walking around downtown with my two-year-old daughter strapped to me in a BabyBjorn, seeing all these shuttered places and trying to remember names. It's like when you have that static cling and your T-shirt lifts. Are there people you wish you kept in touch with?For the book, I interviewed like 150 people, because I knew that there was so much exciting shit going on around me, but I was stuck in this fucking booth most of the time. Some of the clubs were just some weird-ass thing where you're in the corner, and you can't even really see past there. And then I was straining my neck trying to fucking see where he is. Frank, who was at the door, [told] me this insane story that Biggie rolled up with 50 dudes, and they're holding all sorts of stuff. Mark Ronson Posts from Hospital Bed After a DJ Set Gone Wrong: 'Torn This Way' Mark Ronson to Chronicle Nineties Night Moves and DJ Glory Days in New Memoir He knew that he wasn't gonna get 50 of his boys in right away, but he stood there for like an hour with a big wad of cash he'd give Frank every five minutes to let a guy in. He waited till his entire crew was in. So I did reconnect with a lot of people from that era while writing the book, and it was nice. Do I just remember that they were dancing there all the time?” It's a bit of a ghost story. One of the standout scenes in Night People is when you dropped “Hypnotize” for the first time in a club. Part of the reason I think that I wrote the book was because kids kept coming to me like, “You were in New York in the Nineties?” This was maybe five to seven years ago, before Tyler, [the Creator] and a lot of people paid homage in their own ways. The Nineties didn't even sound that great. But then I understand why it's fascinating, why it's important, in hindsight, because it was this era in New York of Wu Tang, Biggie, [A] Tribe [Called Quest], Lil' Kim. New York was the epicenter at that moment. It was a really exciting place to be. Biggie would be in the club sometimes because I was playing. It was at that same party on Canal Street. There was a promotion guy from Bad Boy Records. Because I had the hot party on Tuesday, he came through with this acetate — which is a straight-from-the-factory piece of vinyl that could only be played 10 times and fucking self-destructs or something. He was like, “I got the new Biggie. The whole club was just like it had been hit by a meteor. There was something so sacred and special about this thing. It was like this fucking 500-person orgasm or something. Blu Jemz — my great friend who passed away four or five years ago, who the book is dedicated to — used to hang and DJ at this place called Le Bain. After he passed away, Le Bain wanted to throw a party. I was gonna DJ that night, and I remember sitting around in my room with all the records around. I'm like, “Why do I even keep these things?” There's something that's still meaningful to me about these old hip-hop 12-inches. Early in the book, there's a moment where you mention your first club experience, which was Keith Haring sneaking you and Sean Lennon into Area. There was this really iconic club in downtown New York called Area in the Eighties, and it was where the art world and hip-hop and everything came together. I don't know how much they “snuck us in” — we weren't in his coat, but obviously we're 12 years old and not supposed to be there. Sean's mom, Yoko, was good friends with Keith. I do remember just being in this very dark room, this ashy carpet, crawling around on the floor, running in between grown-ups — just doing shit that we weren't supposed to be doing, but feeling the fun, mischievous energy of what nightclubs do. I wasn't sneaking cocktails and downing them or anything, but it just felt a little electric. You describe Sean moving away as your first heartbreak, in a really sweet way. What was the significance of being able to share these memories with him?Because the book is really about clubs and stuff, when I was writing I was like, who cares about my fucking childhood? My parents were, God bless them, kind of party animals. Waking up to go to school at seven in the morning, my dad is still up playing chess with fucking Daryl Hall or some shit. Part of the book being called Night People is exploring that. What makes us all drawn to the night? I used to play music with Sean; he was my best friend growing up. He went to go to this fancy boarding school in Switzerland and I was kind of like, what the fuck do I do now? I'd put together this other band, and we just played high school parties and bars on Bleecker Street. But I wanted to get us this big gig for this thing called the New Music Seminar that used to happen in New York. It was a weeklong showcase where all the big bands would play. I ran up to this guy who threw this big night; he had Arrested Development and all these other people. And he was like, “What's your band called? No, sorry, you can't play our thing.” And I [said], “What if I get my friend Sean?” “Sean who?” I was like, “Sean Lennon.” So he came up, but actually the gig was a bit of a disaster. I always felt bad because I sold out my friend to get this gig and whatever else happened. He was like, “I don't remember if you really told me, but it's vaguely familiar, and I love you. When New York Magazine put you on its cover in 2000 and called you “The King of Spin,” the profile mentioned a moment where Sean is telling this story about you both hanging out with Michael Jackson. The way that he tells it is so different from the way that you tell it in Night People. He's like, “He was in town during the Bad tour, and we got him to record this melody. We turned it into this song, and we showed it to Roberta Flack.” It was this whole thing, and you're like, “Michael Jackson wanted to throw wet tissue at the walls.” He did. People were drawn to him, and he had all these cool friends. He just wanted to throw soggies out the window. Soggies are when you take a giant mound of wet toilet paper and then just chuck. He wasn't chucking [them] at people, but it was hitting the street and sounding like bombs were going off. In my mind, I was like, “This is all really fun, but I just need to get a hit song out of Michael Jackson. I was already, I guess, at that age more producer-minded.” I remember me and Sean being like, “Michael, Michael, sing us a bass line!” I'll never forget, he did the whole thing, like the hand out with the snap, and started to sing this bass line. He would have somebody come and he'd sing them all the parts, at least that's what I heard. We went back to my studio the next day — my stepdad had his home studio — and we made this song. It was pretty much just seven minutes of [Michael singing the bass line]. Thinking about it now and while I was writing the book, I was like, “Oh, he just kind of gave us some ‘Smooth Criminal' leftover.” But whatever, it's still a bass line from Michael Jackson. That night, we went to the Michael show. And because Sean also lived in the same building with Roberta Flack, she took us to the show. I know these stories sound so fucking crazy. Sean was like, “Roberta, listen to this song that we made! Michael gave us this bass line!” After the third minute, she's just like, “I mean, it's the same thing for a while, but James Brown did that. So you never know!” She was just trying to be friendly. And I think after like one more minute, she [hit] eject. I didn't even tell anyone at school the night that we hung out with Michael, because even I knew, at 13, at some level, that kids are just gonna fucking hate me. Even the fact that when the book started, Q-Tip is this hero, and DJ Premier is his hero, and I maybe brush shoulders with them in a record store or something. And DJ Premier, my producer hero, comes in the booth while I'm playing this song — the first record I produced, Nikka Costa — and he was like, “What is this?” I really thought he was coming in to be like, “Who made this? What is this fucking shit?” Because he was so influential to me, in my mind, it sounded like a disciple of his. To even have those experiences that I had, even at that age, is really, I understand it's very lucky. You mention feeling like the elder people within this scene thought that you hadn't paid your dues because your rise happened so quickly. But then you get a moment where Kid Capri is DJ'ing, and they want to take him off so you can get back on. There was no way not to talk about it, even with everything going on. To try and just pretend that that didn't exist and Puffy didn't have something to do with how New York changed at times, and even how it helped my career, would have been insincere, even though I didn't have a lot of personal interaction with him. All these clubs downtown that were these kind of exclusive, boring, model-type hang spots just suddenly were on fire and so many hip-hop parties. There was just this little moment in 1997 to 2001 or whatever the fuck. I kind of forgot all about it, really, because I've done a lot of other shit since then. I've drank a lot, and I did drugs and my brain is a cloudy mess at times. There's a lot of memories that I remember quite well. There's some that are a little more hazy. Luckily, all the ones where you think you're about to die stay in your head a little bit more. I never was fucked up at the gigs. But four o'clock, lights on, I was off to the after hours to fucking — not every night — but definitely get fucked up and party. I started to have these weird, insane anxiety attacks. I remember one night, some friends had drugs, and we all did it. I found out the next day that it was talcum powder. I didn't set out to make the book that personal. When I started, I was like, this is just a DJ book and it's gonna be about this time. Then I was like, I can't call this book Night People and talk about all the shit that makes us want to go out at night — not everyone was going out to get fucked up. Night gave some people an extra coat of armor, or swag, or whatever you want to call it. If your life was kind of fucked up, you could leave all your daytime shit behind and go out at night. I try to say in the book, there's people who enjoy a night out, and then there's night people. But for the people that I knew that really became my crew and my family at that time, we were all lovingly sort of derelict and a little cracked in our own ways. There's a lot of grief attached to that, as well. Before you decided to put all of this in a book, how often were you sitting around and catching up with people and telling these stories? Because each chapter is a different era, different people, I remember being like, “Oh, I'm gonna call [this person] when I get to that chapter.” And two or three people that I was really close to in that time passed away while writing the book. The book is dedicated to AM and Blu Jemz, who was the best night person I ever knew. He had a label called Night People, and the spirit of him is in this book. Fatman Scoop, DJ Neva, there's lesser-known DJs like my friend Paul Nice, Mister Cee — all these people that come in and out of the book were alive when I started it. There's one scene in the book where you throw a track on so that you can go see Missy Elliott and Timbaland with Aaliyah for a moment and then run back. Take me back to that and thinking, “Do I risk messing up the flow of this crowd just to have this moment?”When I met Aaliyah for the first time on a Tommy Hilfiger shoot, she had already made “One in a Million,” and it was already one of my favorite records. I remember just being like, “Holy shit, I'm not even really gonna look at her.” Even for the people that I had been around, she felt like another world. It wasn't someone I knew from the clubs around New York that happened to be famous. It's that one where she's behind the booth. We took a lunch break, and she came over and she wanted to fuck around with the turntables. They were still hooked up, so she was scratching. I think there's a picture of it that's an outtake. She was just like, “They're just cool,” as if she's talking about her favorite aunt and uncle or some shit, not amazing alien geniuses. So one time, a year later — I got to be friends with Aaliyah, we hung out on other occasions — I was DJ'ing this party at the Manhattan Ballroom. I was on the balcony, and I see these two towering dudes coming towards me with this little person in the middle. And I was like, “Oh, my God, it's Aaliyah.” I was like, “What are you doing here?” She's like, “Oh, I'm going up to the studio.” The studio that Missy and Timbland worked at that time was in Manhattan Center in that building. She was like, “Come upstairs!” I was looking down at 300 people dancing on the floor at some party I've been paid to play, not just go take a 20-minute bathroom break to go meet some famous people. And I was like, “I'd love to, I can't.” She walks away, and she turns back and gives me this one last look like, “What are you doing?” I think it was Donna Summer or Diana Ross, something. It was my first time in a really big, fancy recording studio like that, like a modern one, other than maybe being with my stepdad. She started singing something in her ear, whatever the melody was. And then I was just like, this is fucking crazy. I hung for three minutes and ran back downstairs. It is crazy to think that these people who feel so present — Aaliyah, you walk around New York and there's no way you're gonna make it to Fifth Avenue without seeing her on a T-shirt, and her music has just never been more relevant. Of course, we all wish she was here. It's amazing to think what she would still be doing if she was, but because of her music and how larger than life her legacy has been, it's like she also does still feel here. You appeared in Aaliyah's “More Than a Woman” video. What do you remember about shooting it?I just remember I'm wearing these really kind of cheesy tinted shades, but that I thought looked so cool at the time. I remember Aaliyah calling me and being like, “I want you to come be in the video.” I just remember being like, “I really don't want to fly out to L.A. for the day, but it would be nice to see her. Why not?” I think it was maybe a week or two later that the plane crashed. What was it like revisiting the music from that time?Music was almost my best friend and tool creating this. Some of these things are from 30 years ago. Some of the memories are hazy, but music just does something to your body. When I was trying to was trying to remember things, I'd listen to a certain song, a Tribe song, or Busta song, and it was instantly like, “Oh, right, it was in that room, and there was this guy down there smoking a cigarette looking up at me when I dropped the record, and then he dropped his drink because he put his hands in the air.” The records were so important. I didn't put the celebrities or the famous people stories in as a hook to draw people in. What is this fucking Mark Ronson book?” It's obviously about a time before I was really successful in some ways, or certainly before I had any celebrity — I mean, at least outside of a little circle of New York. I really wanted it to be about the music. I remember some DJ said something funny that was like,  “When I try to talk to my grandmother about DJ'ing, all she understands is a wedding DJ or Calvin Harris.” But there's also this thing in between of what I was back then, which was a gigging DJ, going to work playing shit because you love music, and you need the check, and you're dealing with all the hassles and fucking cokehead club owners and lunatic drunk people making requests. And then some nights you go home having the best energy. And just to get across that feeling of being a DJ, the music side was important to at least try and paint as well as I could.

Emmy Awards 2025: A Complete Guide to Events and Parties (Updating) Working with Anderson has been decades in the making, after DiCaprio famously turned down 1997's Boogie Nights because he was already signed on to star in Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio has arrived to the premiere of #OneBattleAfterAnother pic.twitter.com/8oh9M8WRsM One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio as a washed-up revolutionary living off the grid who must spring into action when his daughter goes missing, with the help of his fellow former radicals. It's an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's anarchic 1990 novel Vineland and also stars Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti. Hall — who is also neighbors with Anderson — said getting a call from the filmmaker, “was a dream, he's one of my favorite directors. It's nice enough when you're a big fan of someone and you meet them and they're nice, that's already a win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After several stressful years of health challenges, including a diagnosis of Hashimoto's Disease, longtime Hallmark star Taylor Cole knew she needed a reset in early 2023. So she and her best friend, Nicole Marsel, headed to The Farm — a 200-acre retreat center near Nashville — for a nurturing week of good food, support, intentional movement, and reflection. Cole never imagined then that two-and-a-half years later, she'd find herself back at The Farm for another much-needed week of restoration, this time by herself. When Cole returned in June 2025, she was emotionally and physically drained — grieving Marsel's death six months earlier from breast cancer and exhausted after five rounds of IVF, hoping to start a family with her husband of five years. Fortunately, the week that the “Double Scoop” star spent at The Farm in June provided just what she needed to move forward, she shared on social media, noting that miraculously, “I felt trust in myself again. The Farm, Cole learned, was struggling to stay open. So, like a scene in a Hallmark movie, Cole turned to her big-hearted colleagues to team up and show up, with hopes of helping the small business thrive. But one of its biggest fans, Lizzie Tucker, couldn't bear to see guests from near and far lose access to the healing space, so she reopened it herself in April 2025, per Nashville Voyager. In a statement to Variety, Tucker said, “I reopened it for everyone who's ever needed a place to feel good again. They include Erin Cahill, Nikki DeLoach, Kristoffer Polaha, her recent “Double Scoop” co-star Ryan McPartlin, Andrew Walker, John Brotherton, Brooke D'Orsay, Colin Egglesfield, Stephen Huszar, Autumn Reeser, and Benjamin Ayres. That means anyone who books time at The Farm for the remainder of 2025 could very well wind up taking a yoga class or having a meal next to one of their favorite Hallmark stars. On September 8, Cahill shared via Instagram that she'd already spent several days there, thanking Cole for trying to save the retreat, calling it “absolutely incredible.” Cahill added, “I had never been to a wellness retreat before and within just a few short days it became one of my favorite places.” Cole's deep desire to save The Farm comes from experiencing it as a place of healing and hope in times when she's been navigating grief and overwhelm. Talking about her own hardships publicly is something she's slowly and bravely begun to do. The actress told EntertainmentNow that agreeing to film her 2022 Hallmark movie “Pumpkin Everything” began a shift for her; she had hesitated to sign on at first because it was about a woman who has to make the hard decision to move her beloved grandpa into a memory care center. These people will feel less alone because they're going through it. Cole's hoping that, just like in many of their movies, the Hallmark stars she's recruited to help bring attention and new faces to The Farm will see their efforts make a powerful impact. “I just feel like the world needs as much good news as possible right now,” she told EntertainmentNow, “and this is a feel good story with a potential happy ending.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After settling in court with his beloved family members, Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch, will continue in his role as the chairman of the Fox Corporation and Fox News' parent company, News Corp, positions he assumed in 2023 when Rupert retired. At the heart of it, Rupert wanted to prevent James, Prudence, or Elisabeth from taking control of America's most popular news channel, Fox News, fearing they could have cleaned up the company's politics and slowed down the country's abrupt descent into authoritarianism. (Or, in an even more unlikely scenario, TV fanatics might have speculated that Rupert Murdoch's sniveling midwestern son-in-law would assume the reins.)

Based on Lizard Music by Daniel Pinkwater, a children's book and young adult author, the film offers Johnson a chance to return to his gonzo Southland Tales roots. Much like Smashing Machine, the story of MMA fighter Mark Kerr, which echoes Johnson's relationship with combat sports as a member of a multi-generational pro-wrestling family and board member of UFC owner TKO, Lizard Music also offers Johnson a chance to explore a personal interest. “I'm your Chicken Man,” Johnson told Safdie after a 45-minute pitch on the film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, Yasmin Williams announced a free show at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C., for Thursday, September 18. Now, the Virginian composer and guitarist—who posted screenshots of a heated email exchange with Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell in April, and later elaborated on the experience in an interview with Pitchfork—has shared a statement explaining her decision to perform at the venue. According to Williams, her upcoming performance was planned prior to President Donald J. Trump's overhaul of the Kennedy Center board of trustees. “I'm doing it for the folks who were unjustifiably fired. I'm doing it for the elderly ushers who were told to not wear masks publicly while working, even facing backlash from higher ups if they wore one.” Read Williams' full message below. In February, President Trump was elected chairman of the Kennedy Center. He named Grenell as interim executive director and dismissed all 18 Democratic appointees from the traditionally bipartisan board of trustees. Dozens of artists, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rhiannon Giddens, and Issa Rae, subsequently canceled their scheduled performances. Williams emailed Grenell directly to inquire whether the Kennedy Center's “hiring practices, performance booking, and staffing” would be meaningfully impacted following the shakeup. “I thought that artists should continue to play there, mainly because I know a lot of people who work there and their incomes were being really, really negatively impacted from artists canceling shows.” Last month, President Trump announced the first class of Kennedy Center honorees since he took over as chair. Gloria Gaynor, Kiss, George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, and British actor Michael Crawford will be recognized at the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremony in December. Read about Yasmin Williams' 2021 album, Urban Driftwood, at No. After these events transpired and I saw people's (understandably) negative reaction toward the Kennedy Center, with people saying they wouldn't see a show there anymore, I began to doubt whether or not I should do the show at all. I wasn't sure if anyone would come… I'm still not sure about that… but I'm doing the show for all the Kennedy Center staff who formed their own union and are still working there, fighting to maintain the institution's integrity. I'm doing it for the folks who were unjustifiably fired. I'm doing it for the elderly ushers who were told to not wear masks publicly while working, even facing backlash from higher ups if they wore one.
