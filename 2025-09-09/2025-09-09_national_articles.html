                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamas says its top leaders survived the Israeli strike on Qatar and that five lower-ranking members died. A Qatari security personnel was also killed, the Hamas statement said. Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof its top leaders had survived. “Today's airstrike by Israel against Hamas leaders in Doha breaches international law and Qatar's territorial integrity, and risks a further escalation of violence in the region,” said Anouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the European Commission, in a statement posted online by the EU's diplomatic corps. We will continue to support all efforts towards a ceasefire in Gaza,” he said. The EU has been riven by deep disagreements over Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Mass protests have rocked European cities from Amsterdam to Barcelona calling for a ceasefire. “While the State of Qatar strongly condemns this assault, it confirms that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and the ongoing disruption of regional security, nor any act that targets its security and sovereignty,” she wrote in the letter obtained by The Associated Press. He was speaking at a news conference Tuesday after signing an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Cairo. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in a statement that he's very concerned about the safety of the hostages still held by Hamas. Germany is a staunch ally of Israel, though in recent months it has become increasingly critical of Israel's actions in Gaza. He said he has voiced his concern about the lives and safety of hostages held by Hamas, including German citizens, in a phone call with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar. Morocco, which maintains ties with Qatar and Israel, was the fourth Arab country to normalize relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in late 2020, in exchange for U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. “Every day, the importance of Arab and Islamic countries uniting to confront this aggression in all its forms becomes clearer, as well as the need to call on the international community to bear its responsibilities in immediately stopping these violations,” he said in a post on X. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's condemnation of Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar came a day before he is set to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in the U.K. “I condemn Israel's strikes on Doha, which violate Qatar's sovereignty and risk further escalation across the region,” he said. Downing Street confirmed that Starmer's meeting with Herzog will go ahead Wednesday. It cannot go on any longer,” a spokesman said. In response, diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff passed along a warning to the Qataris. President Donald Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the attack, Leavitt said, and “made his thoughts and concerns very clear.” Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof they had survived. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the attack targeting Hamas leadership as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability. The ministry said in a statement that Pakistan is in “complete solidarity” with Qatar and urged the international community to hold Israel accountable. Pakistan reaffirmed its support for Qatar's sovereignty and territorial integrity, vowing to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Gulf nation's leadership and people. The Israeli military says a missile has been launched from Yemen. Sirens are sounding in several areas across the country. Air raid sirens are heard in Jerusalem as the Israeli military says it identified the launch of a missile from Yemen. Sirens are sounding in several areas across the country. Benjamin Netanyahu told a U.S. Embassy party that Israel acted “wholly independently” and takes “full responsibility.” Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, stressed that all 193 U.N. member nations are required by the U.N. Charter to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country. She called for intensified diplomatic efforts toward an immediate and permanent ceasefire, improved humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza by the Israeli government, and the release of all hostages held by Hamas. The U.S. military did not participate in the Israeli strikes that took place in Doha, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Syria's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leadership represented “a dangerous escalation that would undermine security and stability in the region.” Israel has been suspicious of Syria's new Islamist-led authorities, and Israeli forces have seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites since Assad's fall. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Israeli strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar. Israel alerted the U.S. ahead of time, according to an Israeli official, a White House official and another person familiar with the matter. All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Pentagon officials referred questions about coordination to the White House. And the White House officials did not respond to request for comment. Congressional leaders appeared caught off guard by Israel's strike. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., departs a news conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, July 15, 2025. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., talks after a policy luncheon on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington. “I'm not sure about that development,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked about the situation at his weekly press conference Tuesday. Senate leaders Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican John Thune made no mention of the strikes in their opening remarks as the chamber convened. It was unclear if they had been briefed ahead of the action. Leo and the Vatican's top diplomats met Israeli President Isaac Herzog last week, when he called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and entry of humanitarian aid to famine-stricken Palestinians there. Since a ceasefire nominally put an end to the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November, Israel has continued to launch near-daily strikes in Lebanon. The Egyptian presidency said in a statement that the attack “targeted a meeting of Palestinian leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement” in Gaza. Foreign minister Badr Abdelatty said Israel should be held accountable for its “criminal aggression.” “This arrogance will not achieve security and stability for Israel. Rather it proves completely to the entire world that the State of Israel has no will and no desire to reach a political solution or a ceasefire,” he said during a news conference. Egypt has been a key mediator between Israel and Hamas. When asked if the British government had been told, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares, pointed to a statement by Israel's prime minister saying the attack was a solely an Israeli operation. Pares called Hamas “a vile terrorist organization,” but did not directly criticize the Israeli attack. Starmer is scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Wednesday. In a phone call with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described Israel's attack on Doha as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also condemned the attack as a violation of international law and Qatar's sovereignty. “Those who turn terrorism into a state policy will never achieve their goals,” Erdogan said in a social media post. “This cowardly operation was nothing but a deliberate assassination attempt against the negotiating delegation, a despicable effort to eliminate any prospect for peace, and an execution of any diplomatic hope in the region,” he said. According to the Houthi-run SABA news agency, Mahdi al-Mashat, head of the Houthis' supreme political council that runs rebel-held areas in Yemen, also commented. He said the attack was a “blatant statement that violates the sovereignty of a state ... and sounds the alarm bell for all Arab and Islamic countries, so pay attention before it is too late.” Danny Danon defended his country's strike on Hamas' headquarters in Doha, saying “there is no hiding place for terrorists.” “The precise strike in Doha targeted senior Hamas leaders who planned the October 7 massacre and celebrated while our citizens were abducted,” Danon posted on X. “I commend our security forces for this courageous and precise operation.” In a televised address Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Israel's attacks in Gaza an “extermination of a defenseless people.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez looks on during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer inside 10 Downing Street, in London, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. Sánchez also announced he was formalizing an arms embargo on Israel and prohibiting ships carrying fuel for Israel's armed forces from using Spanish ports. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres poses for a photograph at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday, July 22, 2025, in New York. “We are just learning about the Israeli attacks in Qatar, a country that has been playing a very positive role to achieve a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,” Guterres told reporters at a press conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York. “I condemn this flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” he said, adding “all parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.” It remains unclear what regional reaction will come from the strike. Immediately afterward, Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan wrote online: “Full solidarity with our dear Qatar.” That comes as the United Arab Emirates has already warned Israel that its possible annexation of the West Bank threatened the Abraham Accords, an agreement by which Abu Dhabi normalized relations with Israel five years ago. In a statement, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abou Gheit said the attack violated Qatar's sovereignty. He said Israel “does not care about the consequences of its shameful actions.” It also calls into question whether any negotiations will immediately continue. Qatar's vast Al-Udeid Air Base, home to the U.S. military's forward headquarters for its Middle East-based Central Command, came under Iranian attack during the 12-day Iran-Israel war that saw American bombers attack Iranian nuclear sites. President Donald Trump speaks at the Al Udeid Air Base, Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Doha, Qatar. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar said that it had “instituted a shelter-in-place order for their facilities.” Earlier this week, Trump said that he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regarding a possible ceasefire, as Arab officials described a new U.S. proposal. A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said that it would discuss the proposal and respond within days. Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar, officials said, further widening its campaign against the militant group. It wasn't immediately clear how the attack was carried out, though an Israeli military spokesman referred to Israel's air force carrying out the strike. Qatar Airways continued landing in Doha amid the strike, even as at least one Qatari air force aircraft took off on patrol over the country.</p>

Kelly joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the Trump administration's 'Operation Midway Blitz' in Illinois as Democrats continue to push back against the possibility of a Trump-sanctioned crime crackdown. A federal raid in upstate New York led to the arrests of 57 illegal workers, five of whom now face criminal charges for illegally reentering the U.S. after previously being deported. Five of the illegal immigrants were charged by criminal complaint with illegally reentering the country: Alex Ben Chipin, 39, Argentina Juarez-Lopez, 50, Luis Jom-Morales, 27, and Gregorio Baldemar Ramirez-Perez, 45, all of Guatemala, and Francisco Salvardo-Mora, 22, of Mexico, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York. The remaining 52 illegal immigrants were detained administratively pending immigration proceedings, officials said. Acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III said the Sept. 4 raid in Cayuga County, New York, was one of the largest worksite enforcement actions in recent history. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents look over lists of names and their hearing times and locations inside the Federal Plaza courthouse before making arrests on June 27, 2025, in New York. He added employers across the Northern District of New York must understand they risk criminal investigation if they are employing noncitizens who are not authorized to work in the U.S. "Across Upstate and Central New York, there are hard-working Americans in need of well-paying jobs, especially in Cayuga County where unemployment is relatively high," Sarcone wrote in a statement. "Our worksite enforcement actions will ensure that those jobs go to people who are authorized to work in the United States, and not to aliens who illegally re-enter our country after prior deportations." Erin Keegan, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Buffalo special agent in charge, reiterated the agency's goal of uncovering possibly dangerous or abusive business practices. Authorities said workplaces risk criminal investigation if they are employing non-citizens who are not authorized to work in the U.S. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File/AP Photo) "While this continues to be an active and ongoing criminal investigation, HSI remains committed to protecting the rights of workers and upholding U.S. laws, including by identifying and addressing exploitation in the workplace, ensuring compliance with labor and immigration laws, and safeguarding the integrity of our nation's workforce," Keegan wrote in a statement.

The Department of Justice announced Tuesday that Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., the suspect in the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee, has been federally charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. FIRST ON FOX: Federal authorities announced Tuesday that Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., the suspect in the stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a North Carolina train, has been federally charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the DOJ will seek the maximum penalty for Brown, saying that the Aug. 22 attack was a "direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people." "I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute DeCarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder," she said. "We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence — he will never again see the light of day as a free man." "The brutal attack on Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte light rail was a disgraceful act that should never happen in America," FBI Director Kash Patel said. I want to thank Attorney General Bondi for her pursuit of today's federal charges, which are the first step toward delivering justice for Iryna and her family – as well as the millions of Americans who deserve to live in our great American cities free from being targeted by violent criminals." FBI Director Kash Patel called the train attack a "disgraceful act." James C. Barnacle Jr., the FBI Charlotte special agent in charge, said he hopes the federal charge will "help bring her family a measure of justice." "Iryna Zarutska had likely taken that train ride many times before. She was probably tired after a day at work and just wanted to go home, but tragically she never made it," he said Tuesday. "We hope this federal charge will help bring her family a measure of justice and the courts will hold the subject charged in this horrific act accountable. Booking photo of Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., taken Aug. 28, 2025, days after the fatal light-rail stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska. Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., 34, is charged in the Aug. 22, 2025, stabbing death of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska aboard a Charlotte light-rail train. Brown was previously charged with first-degree murder in state court for allegedly stabbing Zarutska, 23, to death aboard a Charlotte light-rail train on Aug. 22. Court documents obtained by Fox News Digital say that Brown took out a folding knife and stabbed Zarutska, who was still dressed in her pizzeria uniform, three times. Brown is no stranger to the justice system. Court and prison records examined by Fox News Digital show that he has been convicted of crimes spanning a decade. By the time of Zarutska's killing, Brown had racked up 14 arrests over the years but was no longer under state supervision. His convictions include larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, as well as a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which he served more than six years in prison. He was released in 2020 and remained on parole until 2021. More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year.

Brown's extensive criminal history has drawn renewed scrutiny after police charged him with Zarutska's Aug. 22 murder. President Donald Trump seized on the case, calling Brown a "lunatic" and using the killing to push for tougher sentencing policies and stronger federal intervention. Zarutska fled Ukraine with her family in 2022 to escape the war before settling in Charlotte, according to her obituary. She was working at a local pizzeria, Zepeddie's Pizza, at the time of her death and was captured on the train's surveillance camera wearing her work uniform. Her family described Zarutska as a passionate artist and graduate of Synergy College in Kyiv, where she earned a degree in art and restoration. You can follow her on Twitter and LinkedIn.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt issues a statement from the Trump administration regarding the Israeli airstrikes in Doha, Qatar. The White House revealed Tuesday that President Donald Trump "immediately directed" his special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff to inform Qatar of the "impending attack" by Israel. Israel's military targeted senior Hamas leadership in Doha, launching what it described as a "precise strike." Khalil al-Hayya and Zaher Jabarin were the two targets of the explosion that rocked the Middle Eastern nation's capital, Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst said Tuesday, citing reports. "This morning, the Trump administration was notified by the United States military that Israel was attacking Hamas, which very unfortunately was located in a section of Doha, the capital of Qatar," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. "Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker peace does not advance Israel or America's goals." "However, eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal. President Trump immediately directed special envoy Witkoff to inform the Qataris of the impending attack, which he did," Leavitt added. CCTV footage shows an explosion in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025. Leavitt also revealed that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the strike. Smoke is seen billowing after explosions in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025. "The prime minister told President Trump that he wants to make peace and quickly. President Trump believes this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for peace," Leavitt said at the White House press briefing. He assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil." "The president has always made it very clear that he wants peace in the Middle East, just like he sought that and accomplished that in his first term. He expects all of our allies and friends in the region – that includes both Qatar and Israel – to seek peace as well," Leavitt also said. And he's working with all of our allies in the region to get that done." Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Supreme Court justices – a conservative and the court's senior liberal – appeared to shut down talk of a third term for President Donald Trump in separate appearances this week, with both suggesting that the two-term language included in the 22nd Amendment is clear. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who Trump appointed to the high court during his first term, told Fox News in an interview that aired Monday that it was “true” that the 22nd Amendment appears to limit a president's tenure – despite Trump's yearslong flirtations with a third term. “That's what the amendment says, right?” Barrett told Fox News “Special Report” host Bret Baier. Baier initially noted that the amendment says a president can run only two times. Trump has frequently teased the idea of running for a third term, and his company's website encourages people to “rewrite the rules” by purchasing a “Trump 2028” baseball cap. Whether the president is serious or just trying to enrage his critics, it's notable that two Supreme Court justices have been asked about the legality of the idea in separate interviews this week. No one has tried to challenge that,” Sotomayor said. Even as they do so, the Supreme Court is handling a flood of emergency cases dealing with Trump's efforts to consolidate power within the executive branch. Barrett, for the most part, appears to have voted with Trump in those cases. Sotomayor, who was named to the court by former President Barack Obama, has regularly dissented. Barrett's careful language in response to Baier – she declined to say directly whether the matter was “cut and dried” – drew some criticism on social media. But Sotomayor also suggested the matter was “not settled” because “we don't have a court case about that issue.” Justices virtually never discuss their thoughts on what's legal (or not) in public, so the statements from both Barrett and Sotomayor were notable.</p>

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson sits down for an exclusive interview with 'Fox & Friends Weekend' host Will Cain to discuss the state of the country and more. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson revealed the reason behind his recent slim down that left fans surprised. Johnson, 53, explained that he's been losing weight for an upcoming film called "Lizard Music." He described his character as "a very whimsical and eccentric 70-something-year-old man called the Chicken Man. And his best friend is a 70-something-year-old chicken." "I'm so excited because I get a chance to hopefully transform again like I was able to do in ‘Smashing Machine,'" he said at a Toronto International Film Festival event on Sept. 8, per People. "This is me slimmed down," Johnson said. I still have a long ways to go." Dwayne Johnson, seen left in 2024 and right in 2025, has been displaying a slimmer look during events. Johnson debuted his leaner look at the Venice Film Festival on Aug. 25. "Yep had to do a double take.." one X user commented. "The Rock slimming down and still owning every room… legendary glow-up unlocked," another chimed in. Emily Blunt co-stars in "The Smashing Machine" with Dwayne Johnson. Before slimming down, Johnson transformed into MMA fighter Mark Kerr for the sports drama "The Smashing Machine." In an interview with Vanity Fair, Johnson explained that this was the first role in years that made him nervous. He added, "I realized that maybe these opportunities weren't coming my way because I was too scared to explore this stuff." To properly take on the role, Johnson wore 13 to 14 prosthetics every day and would just "disappear" when he walked on set. "I just sat in front of that mirror for three to four hours and watched it all change. There were about 13 or 14 different prosthetics. By the time I got to set, I was Mark Kerr and I felt it, from how he walked to how he talked and how he looked at life," he said. Fox News Digital's Janelle Ash contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, right, and Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, right, during a statement at Marienborg, Denmark, April 27, 2025. COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — More than 350 Greenlandic Indigenous women and girls, including some 12 years old and younger, reported that they were forcibly given contraception by Danish health authorities in cases that date back to the 1960s, according to an independent investigation's findings released Tuesday. The Inuit victims, many of them teenagers at the time, were either fitted with intrauterine contraceptive devices, known as IUDs or coils, or given a hormonal birth control injection. The victims described traumatic experiences that left some with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, ranging from pain and bleeding to serious infections. The governments of Denmark and Greenland officially apologized in a statement last month for their roles in the historic mistreatment in an apparent attempt to get ahead of the highly anticipated report. An official apology event in Greenland's capital is set for Sept. 24. Nearly 150 Inuit women last year sued Denmark and filed compensation claims against its health ministry, saying Danish health authorities violated their human rights. The alleged purpose was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. Greenland took over its own health care programs on Jan. 1, 1992. The investigation's conclusion comes as Greenland is in the headlines alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he seeks U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland. He has not ruled out a military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. Denmark's foreign minister recently summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country for talks after the main national broadcaster reported that at least three people with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland. Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark's crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity. The policies included the removal of young Inuit children from their parents to be given to Danish foster families for reeducation and controversial parental competency tests that resulted in the forced separation of Greenlandic families. The investigators received reports from 354 Greenlandic women who were between 48 and 89 years old when they spoke to authorities for the independent investigation, which began June 1, 2023 following a media outcry. Almost all victims were between 12 and 37 years old at the time. One girl was under 12, but her exact age was not made public in Tuesday's report due to anonymity concerns. An attorney representing some of the victims could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a letter sent Tuesday to Chief District Court Judge Roy Wiggins, obtained by the Washington Examiner, 10 Republican members of Congress urged formal removal proceedings under North Carolina law, citing what they called “willful and persistent failure” by Stokes to protect the public. They said her decision to release DeCarlos Brown Jr. without bond earlier this year directly enabled the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte Area Transit System. “North Carolina's justice system failed Iryna Zarutska,” Rep. Tim Moore (R-NC) said. “She came to Charlotte looking for safety and a better life, but instead, she was brutally murdered by a repeat offender who never should've been let back on the streets. Brown, 34, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was arrested in January after repeatedly calling 911 and insisting that officers examine what he described as “man-made” substances inside his body that he believed were controlling his movements. “Teresa Stokes has failed the people and must be removed. Other lawmakers tied the case to a broader trend of leniency in urban court systems. “Magistrate Stokes' rulings highlight exactly why liberal soft-on-crime policies are failing our communities locally and nationwide,” Rep. David Rouzer (R-NC) said. They also requested a review of Stokes's bond decisions in other cases. “Pro-crime judges must be held responsible for their failure to carry out the most basic, commonsense duties. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), a Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, called for Democratic Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles to resign and warned South Carolinians to avoid the city. Lyles has called the murder a “tragic situation” that “sheds light on problems with society safety nets related to mental healthcare and the systems that should be in place,” according to WSOC-TV, but has defended the CATS as “by and large a safe transit system.” The Washington Examiner reached out to her and Wiggins for comment. to NC District Ct Re Teresa Stokes Removal  by  reportoftheday</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a tornado destroyed his home, Buddy Anthony lived in his truck for weeks, awaiting the federal aid that would eventually help him buy a new home. (AP) — As an ominous storm approached Buddy Anthony's new home, he took shelter in his Ford F-250 pickup parked under a nearby carport. On average, it took less than two weeks for a governor's request for a presidential disaster declaration to be granted in the 1990s and early 2000s. That rose to about three weeks during the past decade under presidents from both major parties. It's taking more than a month, on average, so far during Trump's current term, the AP found. The delays mean individuals must wait to receive federal aid for daily living expenses, temporary lodging and home repairs. Delays in disaster declarations also can hamper recovery efforts by local officials uncertain whether they will receive federal reimbursement for cleaning up debris and rebuilding infrastructure. “It's a fundamental shift in the position of this country.” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Trump is making sure federal tax dollars “are spent wisely to supplement state actions, not replace them,” during disasters. “President Trump provides a more thorough review of disaster declaration requests than any Administration has before him,” Jackson said in a statement to the AP. About three-fourths of people want the U.S. government to play a major role in providing aid to communities and helping them rebuild after natural disasters, according to a June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The Federal Emergency Management Agency often consults immediately with communities to coordinate their initial disaster response. Trump has approved more than two dozen major disaster declarations since taking office in January, with an average wait of almost 34 days after a request. The average wait is up from a 24-day delay during his first term and is nearly four times as long as the average for former Republican President George H.W. Bush, whose term from 1989-1993 coincided with the implementation of a new federal law setting parameters for disaster determinations. Former Democratic President Joe Biden, in his last year in office, averaged 26 days to declare major disasters — longer than any year under former Democratic President Barack Obama. Others familiar with FEMA noted that its process for assessing and documenting natural disasters has become more complex over time. Disasters have also become more frequent and intense because of climate change, which is mostly caused by the burning of fuels such as gas, coal and oil. The letter also lamented that the Trump administration has stopped maintaining or removed long-term planning tools focused on extreme weather and disasters. Shortly after taking office, Trump floated the idea of “getting rid” of FEMA, asserting: “It's very bureaucratic, and it's very slow.” FEMA's acting chief suggested more recently that states should shoulder more responsibility for disaster recovery, though FEMA thus far has continued to cover three-fourths of the costs of public assistance to local governments, as required under federal law. FEMA pays the full cost of its individual assistance. A collapsed roof and insulation cover what used to be Buddy Anthony's kitchen on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Tylertown, Miss. The tornado that struck Anthony's home in rural Tylertown on March 15 packed winds up to 140 mph (225 km/hr). It was part of a powerful storm system that wrecked homes, businesses and lives across multiple states. Mississippi's governor requested a federal disaster declaration on April 1. Trump granted that request 50 days later, on May 21, while approving aid for both individuals and public entities. In most cases, more than a month had passed since the requests and about two months since the date of those disasters. On July 22, Trump issued another big batch of major disaster declarations covering seven states. If a presidential declaration and federal money had come sooner, Anthony said he wouldn't have needed to spend weeks sleeping in a truck before he could afford to rent the trailer where he is now living. His house was uninsured, Anthony said, and FEMA eventually gave him $30,000. In nearby Jayess, Dana Grimes had insurance but not enough to cover the full value of her damaged home. After the eventual federal declaration, Grimes said FEMA provided about $750 for emergency expenses, but she is now waiting for the agency to determine whether she can receive more. “We couldn't figure out why the president took so long to help people in this country,” Grimes said. “I just want to tie up strings and move on. Jonathan Young said he gave up on applying for FEMA aid after the Tylertown tornado killed his 7-year-old son and destroyed their home. The process seemed too difficult, and federal officials wanted paperwork he didn't have, Young said. He made ends meet by working for those cleaning up from the storm. Historically, presidential disaster declarations containing individual assistance have been approved more quickly than those providing assistance only to public entities, according to the AP's analysis. That remains the case under Trump, though declarations for both types are taking longer. About half the major disaster declarations approved by Trump this year have included individual assistance. Some people whose homes are damaged turn to shelters hosted by churches or local nonprofit organizations in the initial chaotic days after a disaster. But some insist on staying in damaged homes, even if they are unsafe, said Chris Smith, who administered FEMA's individual assistance division under three presidents from 2015-2022. If homes aren't repaired properly, mold can grow, compounding the recovery challenges. Early morning light shines through the shell of Buddy Anthony's destroyed home on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, in Tylertown, Miss. That's why it's critical for FEMA's individual assistance to get approved quickly — ideally, within two weeks of a disaster, said Smith, who's now a disaster consultant for governments and companies. “You want to keep the people where they are living. After the Tylertown tornado, faith-based groups served food and laid tarps on homes while local residents helped each other with power saws to clear downed trees. “That's the only thing that got us through this storm, neighbors helping neighbors,” said Les Lampton, a volunteer firefighter and insurance agent in Walthall County, where Tylertown is located. Unlike individual assistance programs that provide cash upfront, FEMA's public assistance programs reimburse governmental entities only after their bills are paid — and only if they followed guidelines for hiring and documenting the work. Long waits can stoke uncertainty and lead cost-conscious local officials to pause or scale-back their recovery efforts. In Walthall County, officials initially spent about $700,000 cleaning up debris, then suspended the cleanup for more than a month because they couldn't afford to spend more without assurance they would receive federal reimbursement, said Royce McKee, the county emergency manager. “We're hopeful that we'll get some money by the first of the year, but people are telling us that it could be (longer).” It knocked out electricity for 80% of the municipal utility's customers and damaged 120 power poles. Crews worked to restore power within a couple weeks, racking up hefty bills paid from the utility's reserve funds. As the wait for a presidential disaster declaration kept growing, “we were getting a little nervous,” said Rodney Bourne, general manager of Rolla Municipal Utilities. Delays in federal declarations also can force local officials to choose between needed repairs — perhaps fixing some roads and culverts washed out by floods while delaying other projects, said David Fogerson, a public safety consultant who retired last year as Nevada's emergency management chief. “For a lot of the smaller states and smaller jurisdictions, when you get that, `Yep, this is a disaster declaration, we've got federal money coming,' it helps you feel better, more confident about spending that money,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qatar, an energy-rich U.S. ally hosting thousands of American troops, has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas for several years, even before the war. Qatar's Interior Ministry said Tuesday one of its security personnel was killed in the attack. The future of the long-stalled ceasefire talks was more uncertain, as Israel gears up for a major offensive aimed at taking over Gaza City. That escalation has been met with heavy international condemnation and opposition within Israel from those who fear it will doom the remaining hostages. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the attack targeting Hamas leadership as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability. The ministry said in a statement that Pakistan is in “complete solidarity” with Qatar and urged the international community to hold Israel accountable. Pakistan reaffirmed its support for Qatar's sovereignty and territorial integrity, vowing to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Gulf nation's leadership and people. The Israeli military says a missile has been launched from Yemen. Sirens are sounding in several areas across the country. Air raid sirens are heard in Jerusalem as the Israeli military says it identified the launch of a missile from Yemen. Sirens are sounding in several areas across the country. Benjamin Netanyahu told a U.S. Embassy party that Israel acted “wholly independently” and takes “full responsibility.” Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, stressed that all 193 U.N. member nations are required by the U.N. Charter to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country. She called for intensified diplomatic efforts toward an immediate and permanent ceasefire, improved humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza by the Israeli government, and the release of all hostages held by Hamas. The U.S. military did not participate in the Israeli strikes that took place in Doha, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Syria's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that the Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leadership represented “a dangerous escalation that would undermine security and stability in the region.” Israel has been suspicious of Syria's new Islamist-led authorities, and Israeli forces have seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites since Assad's fall. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Israeli strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar. Israel alerted the U.S. ahead of time, according to an Israeli official, a White House official and another person familiar with the matter. All four officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Pentagon officials referred questions about coordination to the White House. And the White House officials did not respond to request for comment. Congressional leaders appeared caught off guard by Israel's strike. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., departs a news conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, July 15, 2025. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., talks after a policy luncheon on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, at the Capitol in Washington. “I'm not sure about that development,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said when asked about the situation at his weekly press conference Tuesday. Senate leaders Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican John Thune made no mention of the strikes in their opening remarks as the chamber convened. It was unclear if they had been briefed ahead of the action. Leo and the Vatican's top diplomats met Israeli President Isaac Herzog last week, when he called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages and entry of humanitarian aid to famine-stricken Palestinians there. Since a ceasefire nominally put an end to the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in November, Israel has continued to launch near-daily strikes in Lebanon. The Egyptian presidency said in a statement that the attack “targeted a meeting of Palestinian leaders in the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement” in Gaza. When asked if the British government had been told, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman Dave Pares, pointed to a statement by Israel's prime minister saying the attack was a solely an Israeli operation. Pares called Hamas “a vile terrorist organization,” but did not directly criticize the Israeli attack. Starmer is scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Wednesday. In a phone call with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described Israel's attack on Doha as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law.” Omer Celik, the spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party, described the attack as a “barbaric act of terrorism.” “This cowardly operation was nothing but a deliberate assassination attempt against the negotiating delegation, a despicable effort to eliminate any prospect for peace, and an execution of any diplomatic hope in the region,” he said. According to the Houthi-run SABA news agency, Mahdi al-Mashat, head of the Houthis' supreme political council that runs rebel-held areas in Yemen, also commented. He said the attack was a “blatant statement that violates the sovereignty of a state ... and sounds the alarm bell for all Arab and Islamic countries, so pay attention before it is too late.” Danny Danon defended his country's strike on Hamas' headquarters in Doha, saying “there is no hiding place for terrorists.” “The precise strike in Doha targeted senior Hamas leaders who planned the October 7 massacre and celebrated while our citizens were abducted,” Danon posted on X. “I commend our security forces for this courageous and precise operation.” In a televised address Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Israel's attacks in Gaza an “extermination of a defenseless people.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez looks on during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer inside 10 Downing Street, in London, Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. Sánchez also announced he was formalizing an arms embargo on Israel and prohibiting ships carrying fuel for Israel's armed forces from using Spanish ports. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres poses for a photograph at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday, July 22, 2025, in New York. “We are just learning about the Israeli attacks in Qatar, a country that has been playing a very positive role to achieve a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,” Guterres told reporters at a press conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York. “I condemn this flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” he said, adding “all parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.” It remains unclear what regional reaction will come from the strike. Immediately afterward, Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan wrote online: “Full solidarity with our dear Qatar.” That comes as the United Arab Emirates has already warned Israel that its possible annexation of the West Bank threatened the Abraham Accords, an agreement by which Abu Dhabi normalized relations with Israel five years ago. In a statement, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Abou Gheit said the attack violated Qatar's sovereignty. He said Israel “does not care about the consequences of its shameful actions.” It also calls into question whether any negotiations will immediately continue. Qatar's vast Al-Udeid Air Base, home to the U.S. military's forward headquarters for its Middle East-based Central Command, came under Iranian attack during the 12-day Iran-Israel war that saw American bombers attack Iranian nuclear sites. President Donald Trump speaks at the Al Udeid Air Base, Thursday, May 15, 2025, in Doha, Qatar. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar said that it had “instituted a shelter-in-place order for their facilities.” Earlier this week, Trump said that he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regarding a possible ceasefire, as Arab officials described a new U.S. proposal. A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said that it would discuss the proposal and respond within days. Israel launched a strike targeting Hamas' leadership in Qatar, officials said, further widening its campaign against the militant group. It wasn't immediately clear how the attack was carried out, though an Israeli military spokesman referred to Israel's air force carrying out the strike. Qatar Airways continued landing in Doha amid the strike, even as at least one Qatari air force aircraft took off on patrol over the country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A senior White House official confirmed to the Washington Examiner that Israel gave President Donald Trump and his national security team “advance notice” of the airstrike but did not say if Israel asked Trump to sign off on the operation. Israeli Foreign Minister Ron Dermer additionally met with Trump's Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and former White House adviser, on Monday in Miami, Florida. Hamas leaders reportedly gathered in Qatar, which has been acting as a third-party mediator alongside the United States, to discuss the Trump administration's latest ceasefire proposal and hostage return. Trump warned on Sunday that he would not tolerate Hamas rejecting another ceasefire. The Israelis have accepted my Terms,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one! “Despite conflicting media accounts, we are confident that this was a unilateral military strike conducted by Israeli forces, without advance consultation of the United States,” the statement reads. “An unprovoked military attack on a sovereign state, a Major Non-NATO ally of the United States that hosts a large presence of American military forces and American civilians, is unacceptable and must be condemned.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France's prime minister has quit after losing a confidence vote that toppled his government, plunging the country into a new political crisis. François Bayrou submitted his resignation to President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, who accepted it. A day earlier, 364 out of 573 lawmakers had voted against Bayrou's government – well above the 280 needed – after his attempt to force through an unpopular plan to tame France's ballooning budget deficit. Macron will appoint a successor “in the coming days,” according to the Élysée Palace, his fifth prime minister in less than two years. Before he was ousted, Bayrou warned that getting rid of him would not resolve France's challenges. But it didn't have to be this way. The new constitution gave broad powers to the executive and set up a majority system to avoid short-lived governments. As a result, for decades, two mainstream political parties on the left and right alternated in power. Re-elected in 2022, he soon lost his parliamentary majority as voters flocked to the extremes. But the left's hopes of forming a minority government collapsed when Macron refused to accept their choice of prime minister. Unlike Germany or Italy, France has no tradition of coalition building, instead its politics have been shaped for more than 60 years by a presidency-dominated system. There's a French saying that goes “Les mêmes causes produisent les mêmes effets” – the same causes produce the same consequences. And for Macron, history does indeed risk repeating itself unless he can find a prime minister able to broker compromise. The problem is that, after three failed centrist prime ministers whose tenures ranged from between three to nine months, the opposition parties are in no mood to give another one a chance. So Macron is caught in a political vise, with the far left calling for his resignation, the far right demanding a snap election and the mainstream left and right remain unable to reach consensus. But by choosing a premier from his own ranks Macron risks sounding tone-deaf, a sign that he has yet to fully accept the reality of his snap election defeat. Bayrou as a centrist barely managed to walk that tightrope, Lecornu, positioned further to the right, may not be as agile. One potential saving grace is that neither the left nor the right wants the snap election far-right figurehead Marine Le Pen is pushing for, since both political wings would risk losing seats. This gives them an incentive to cooperate, but not at any price. Away from politics, wider economic turmoil has rattled French investors. Yields on French government bonds – or the interest rate demanded by investors – have risen above those of Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds, which were once at the heart of the eurozone debt crisis. A possible downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating review Friday would deliver another blow to the country's economic standing in Europe. Yet, following these turbulent years, the political climate is also bleak. Many in France now assume the far right will eventually take power – if not now, then after the 2027 presidential election – though few believe such an outcome would solve the country's problems. The far left has called nationwide protests for Wednesday against austerity, under the banner “Bloquons tout” (Let's block everything), and vow to paralyze the country with roadblocks and civil disobedience. The outgoing interior minister has warned of “intense disruptions.” Trade unions are planning another wave of mobilization on September 18 with strikes expected in hospitals and across rail services. Dominique Moïsi, a senior analyst at the Paris-based think tank Institut Montaigne, says he cannot recall a moment of such profound deadlock in the Fifth Republic. “De Gaulle survived assassination attempts, there was the Algerian war, in May '68 the slogan was ‘La France s'ennuie,' (France is bored). But today France is frustrated, furious, full of hatred towards the elite,” he told CNN. “It sounds as if a regime change is inevitable, yet I can't see how it will come about and who would do the job.</p>

President Donald Trump warned future flyovers could be met with lethal force on Friday. At a news conference in Caracas last week, Maduro announced he was deploying troops along the coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia. “And that was Tren de Aragua, a narco-terrorist organization designated by the United States, trying to poison our country with illicit drugs.” That exchange prompted Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) to chime in, “JD ‘I don't give a shit' Vance says killing people he accuses of a crime is the ‘highest and best use of the military.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If there's one thing a large majority of Americans have consistently agreed on this year, it's that the Democratic Party sucks. Unfavorable views of the party seem to keep rising with every passing month of President Donald Trump's second term and that discontent has reached a new height this summer. More than 60 percent of American adults view the Democrats with derision, according to weekly tracking polls conducted by YouGov. Looking at this another way, positive views of the Democratic Party have now crumbled to a historic low, with only about one-third of the country seeing them in a good light, per Wall Street Journal polling that shook the political world in July. It's a broad-based dislike: Republicans, independents, and disaffected Democrats are dragging down the party's brand. Since there's no one explanation for why everyone seems to hate the Democrats right now, it's useful to break this question up into a few charts to visualize the complicated position of the Democratic Party in 2025. Poll after poll shows a unique, historically unusual dynamic where Republicans are very satisfied with the state and performance of their political party while Democrats are significantly less happy with their own side. It's a highly unusual dynamic, Gallup notes; Republicans tend to be more unfavorable toward their party, so this unity is surprising. Democrats, meanwhile, historically tend to be more supportive of their party. For most of the last year, Democratic voters were sending signals to their leaders that they wanted more aggressive resistance and opposition to Trump — something they feel like their party is not doing well. Consider this chart with responses to a prompt from an August Associated Press-NORC poll. “Weak,” “tepid,” “ineffective,” and “broken,” came up the most among Democrats and were used by Democrats to describe their party much more frequently than by Americans in general. Pew Research Center data from this spring showed an overwhelming majority of Democrats thought it was “extremely” or “very” important that their leaders resist Trump and his policies. That was most pronounced among very liberal Democrats, 85 percent of whom said this resistance was “extremely” important — higher than the response from liberal, conservative, or moderate Democrats. Ideologically, there's evidence that the party's negative perceptions are motivated, in part, by its members not being united on what direction their party should go. After many pre- and post-election surveys found that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party suffered from being viewed as too radical or too liberal, discussions within the party centered on whether the party needed to ideologically change direction. Gallup studied this question earlier in the year and found mixed results, but definitive significant changes from four years ago. Democrats, and Democratic-leaning independents, are divided over whether the party should change or not. More of these partisans want the party to be more moderate than in 2021, but a majority would still prefer it stay the same or move left. This, again, matches trends in other polls and correlates with surveys finding that a majority of Americans think their party is “somewhat” or “very” divided, while Democrats themselves are split in half on that question. Dislike of a political party flows from there. Relatedly, a third way to visualize this dislike for the Democratic Party is to see it as a reflection of the unpopularity of its leaders. If the party base, and American voters in general, have strong negative feelings about a party's elite — those spokespeople who stand in for and speak for the party — then it makes sense for those feelings to be applied to the party in general. A similar dynamic emerges when looking at Democrats in Congress. They are viewed much more negatively in general by their own voters than Republicans are by their own voters. Meanwhile, individual Democratic representatives and Democratic candidates tend to be viewed more favorably than Democrats as a whole or Republican candidates and the Republican Party. This would also explain why Democrats continue to see a modest advantage on the generic congressional ballot — voters are still more likely to vote for a Democrat in next year's midterm elections, even if they dislike the party as a whole. In addition to these three buckets of explanations, there are some more natural dynamics at play: Partisanship and polarization explain why Republicans still strongly dislike the Democratic Party, while it's normal for a political party to go through a period of wandering in the wilderness after a presidential loss (Democrats were in a similar polling position in 2017 before surging in the fall into 2018). So while Democrats seem to be hated by everyone right now, they aren't doomed yet. Why you should care about Trump's crypto ventures. ICE gets the go-ahead for indiscriminate immigration stops in LA. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. Few countries better exemplify how life has actually improved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Walkinshaw, a Democrat who served as Connolly's chief of staff and is currently a Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member, is likely to defeat Republican Stewart Whitson, a former FBI special agent and Army veteran. The current House margin is three seats, with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. If Walkinshaw is victorious, the majority will shrink to a two-seat margin, meaning the speaker can only afford to lose two GOP votes and still pass legislation along party lines. This is a small but significant blow to Johnson, particularly as the government funding deadline approaches on Sept. 30. Over a dozen conservatives are often against short-term spending deals, or continuing resolutions, so razor-thin margins give Johnson's right flank an easy advantage to prevent any bills they don't like from coming to or passing on the floor. Other upcoming special elections threaten to narrow Johnson's majority, as well. Another special election will be held to replace former Republican Rep. Mark Green, which could give the GOP a boost ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Grijalva's special election, set for Sept. 23, won't change the majority if a Democrat wins, due to House numbers. But a special election in Green's old district, set for Dec. 2, would give Republicans a slight reprieve heading into the new year. The former congressman has endorsed Matt Van Epps, an Army veteran and the former commissioner of Tennessee's Department of General Services. Van Epps is facing 10 other men vying for the GOP nomination. Democrats have won a majority of special elections in 2025, but President Donald Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024, so the GOP is likely to hang onto this seat.</p>

That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Emergency response's newfound sluggishness, explained by earthquakes and landslides. By the time the earthquake struck, flattening mud-brick homes across Afghanistan's eastern mountains last week, many nearby health clinics had already been shuttered for months. He woke the next morning to a horrifying death toll slowly trickling in. First, 200 lives lost; then 500; 800; 1,000; and finally, by Thursday, there were over 2,200 confirmed deaths, with some rural villages still unreachable by rescuers. As his team searched for survivors, he wondered what could have happened if the gutting of the US Agency for International Development hadn't forced four of their clinics in the country's hardest-hit province to close earlier this year, cutting off 60,000 rural Afghans from care. How many lives could be saved if the emergency aid came rushing in like it did before? Because of those cuts alone, the country's GDP will likely shrink by a full 5 percent this year, cutting off food, shelter, and medical care for millions of Afghans. In 2022, after a magnitude 6.1 quake hit southeastern Afghanistan the US gave $55 million for food, health, and sanitation supplies. Globally, we are at risk of unraveling decades of progress in making disasters less deadly, driven by investments in infrastructure, early warning systems, and better coordination between the patchwork of actors and agencies that kicks into gear when crisis strikes. Foreign aid has always been a critical part of that puzzle in low-income countries like Afghanistan. A steady flow of foreign aid helps facilitate the kind of development — the roads and resources — needed to make emergency response truly effective when disaster strikes. The US isn't alone in slashing aid. As a result of the worldwide retreat in funding lifesaving development programs, every disaster is now deadlier than it needs to be — and every aid worker is left navigating an increasingly dysfunctional system. If the money was there like it used to be, he told Vox that he “would be on the ground working side by side with my team right now. Then, a hodgepodge of NGOs, United Nations agencies, and foreign governments would spring into action. Sometimes, the US would even lend out one of its highly specialized search and rescue task forces to respond to a disaster overseas, as it did to Haiti, Turkey, Peru, the Bahamas, Nepal, and Japan after earthquakes, flooding, and hurricanes over the past decade. Most humanitarian organizations didn't even wait for the contracts to be signed before flying their teams straight into the epicenter to work with local agencies and nonprofits on the ground. After decades of collaboration, most humanitarian organizations trusted that “the US government would pay its bills” or reimburse them eventually for the costs incurred, said Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran USAID's disaster assistance branch under the Obama administration and now leads the advocacy group Refugees International. By having those relationships at the ready, a response can kick in much faster when disaster strikes. “Sometimes you need the relief to move faster than our grant processes.” That trust didn't come overnight, nor did USAID's capacity for responding quickly to global disasters, he said. “It became this really amazing professional operational, deployable machine.” What makes the most difference in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is not an injection of emergency donations. Instead, long-term infrastructure projects — often fueled by foreign aid — are what really wax the wheels of disaster relief, ensuring that help can come as fast and efficiently as possible. Achieving those goals through global cooperation has been extremely important for low-income countries, where disasters are still far more deadly than in rich countries, despite efforts to improve early warning systems worldwide. But, they have made progress, which helps explain why earthquakes, cyclones, and floods used to kill far more people a century ago than they do today, despite there being way more people now, more data reporting, and more disasters tied to climate change than before. But now, with the death of USAID and plenty of other countries taking sledgehammers to their own aid agencies, everything about disaster relief has gotten a lot more sluggish. So did the leader of a local rebel group in Sudan last week, after a devastating landslide killed over 1,000 people in a region already ravaged by war and famine. “As a functional matter, the US government is simply out of the business of disaster aid globally,” and “it's done huge damage.” Those search and rescue task forces the US used to send? They're still technically on retainer, but in what Konyndyk called an “entirely insane” twist, the Trump administration cancelled the emergency transport contracts that used to get them where they needed to go — meaning that it's now basically impossible to get them overseas, especially on a time crunch. It took four days to get those task forces to Texas after the floods this summer — the same first responders that made it to Syria and Turkey after the 2023 earthquake in just two days. Not that it seems to be doing much anyway. Previous earthquakes had led to the deployment of a full US-led rescue team with dozens of rescuers, search dogs, and heavy machinery that could pull people out alive. This time, the US flew in a team of just three aid workers to assess the damage and then promptly fired them all via email mere days after their arrival as they slept in the rubble-strewn streets of the earthquake zone. “You just name any crisis — we are seeing it over here,” said Khan, who's especially worried about how damage to water and housing infrastructure could increase the prevalence of disease and make it impossible for families to weather the coming winter. It would be one thing if this were the only crisis on his plate, but the earthquake is only the latest in a series of crises, including a severe drought that has left about one-third of the population facing acute food insecurity and the millions of Afghans forced out of neighboring nations. Saving more lives is about more than money for any individual disaster; it's about addressing a brewing logistical nightmare that's making the world less safe and far less prepared to respond to all different kinds of crises. Western media didn't even report on the deadly landslide that occurred there — which destroyed an entire village — until two days after the disaster hit. It ruptured longstanding relationships, unceremoniously firing some of the only people with the logistical expertise needed to navigate such tricky terrain. No matter what comes next, it won't be easy to build back. “We are facing a huge loss of capacity and trust,” said Patricia McIlreavy, head of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, who has spent decades working in humanitarian aid, including in Sudan. “There may be others who fill those gaps. There's something very human — apolitical, even — in the impulse to support one another in the wake of such tragedies. Afghanistan offered $100,000 to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Mexico sent dozens of firefighters to Los Angeles when wildfires broke out earlier this year. Hundreds of Canadian workers descended on North Carolina to help restore power after Hurricane Helene. And with climate change accelerating the pace and intensity of natural disasters around the world — but especially in places like Afghanistan and Sudan — like it or not, we are all in this together. Granted, the US used to anchor a vast global emergency response infrastructure, and individual donations are absolutely no replacement for that. But in Sudan — where local volunteer networks have managed to bring lifesaving relief to places that many western donors gave up on years ago — anything is still better than nothing, especially if you choose to support for the long haul. The same is true in Afghanistan, where aid workers have trudged for hours in search of survivors to pull from the rubble.
