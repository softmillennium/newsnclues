                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dunn, prosecutors have alleged, threw a sub-style sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer one evening in early August, calling them “fascists” and yelling and cursing at the officers gathered. His attorney declined to comment on the charge. The office of US Attorney Jeanine Pirro did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Previously, the Justice Department said in court it was charging Dunn with a felony assault charge but, after a grand jury declined to hand up an indictment in the case, have now filed a lesser misdemeanor charge, cutting the maximum sentence from 8 years in jail to 1 year. Since prosecutors filed the charges by information – instead of by complaint as they previously did – they can skirt around using a grand jury and instead go right to the judge, who would need to decide whether there is probable cause and the case can proceed. Dunn has not entered a plea, and his case has been passed to a federal judge in DC, who will preside over the case. Dunn was arrested on August 10, right after he allegedly threw the sandwich. He was then released the next morning, his attorney said in court earlier this month, and attempted to get an attorney to turn himself in when he learned of a warrant for his arrest. Instead, 20 officers came to Dunn's apartment and arrested him there, his attorney told the magistrate judge initially in charge of the case. Her assertions would later be proven when the White House posted a propaganda film of decked-out deputy US Marshals and other law enforcement, including FBI agents, showing up at Dunn's door with guns drawn and a riot shield deployed to arrest him. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A meeting of the Mexican Senate descended into violence Wednesday, after one of its members apparently became enraged at not getting a chance to speak. The scuffle broke out between two high-ranking senators toward the end of a session that had included a heated debate on the possibility of US military intervention in the country. Noroña later identified the man in the green shirt as a member of his team. The man appeared alongside Noroña at a press conference, wearing a neck brace and bandages around his arm. Moreno said on social media that he had confronted Noroña because the ruling party had changed the agenda of the session to prevent the opposition from speaking out. Let it be clear: the first physical aggression came from Noroña,” he said, claiming the Senate president started the altercation by shoving him. For his part, Noroña insisted the opposition senators were to blame. They will say that this is freedom of expression,” he said. He said that during the session they had debated topics including US military intervention, which he had accused opposition parties of supporting. He also said he intended to file a complaint against Moreno, claiming Moreno had threatened to kill him. He also said he would seek the expulsion of Moreno and other opposition members involved in the altercation. CNN has reached out to Moreno for comment. Violence in Mexico's Congress is rare but not unheard of. In 2006, a brawl erupted between lawmakers ahead of the inauguration of President Felipe Calderon after a disputed election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diageo's Amherstburg facility, which bottles Crown Royal products, will close in February.Sean Vokey/The Canadian Press Spirits maker Diageo DEO-N will cease operations at its bottling facility in Amherstburg, Ont., early next year, as it shifts some bottling volume to the U.S., the company announced on Thursday. The facility, which bottles Crown Royal products, will close in February in a move aimed at improving its North American supply chain. “This was a difficult decision, but one that is crucial to improving the efficiency and resiliency of our supply chain network,” Marsha McIntosh, Diageo's president of North America supply, said in a statement. Diageo said it will engage with the community and find ways to support its employees through the transition, and work alongside Unifor to assist unionized workers. The company said it will still maintain a “significant” footprint in Canada – including its headquarters and warehouse operations in the Greater Toronto Area, and bottling and distillation facilities in Manitoba and Quebec. McIntosh added the company's Crown Royal products will continue to be mashed, distilled and aged at its Canadian facilities.

Wednesday night, Russia staged its largest attack on Ukraine since President Donald Trump started the so-called peace process. Moscow launched 598 drones and 31 missiles on targets in Ukraine. Most of them were shot down, but many others still evaded Ukraine's air defense systems, hitting over 20 locations in the capital, Kyiv, and severely damaging a building next to the European Union mission. Thus, despite the recent two summits that Trump called to reach a peace deal, Russia is in fact escalating its war on Ukraine. In Alaska, Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an arrest warrant on his head from the International Criminal Court. Trump has promised to orchestrate another meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, something that now seems highly unlikely, as Ukraine opposes the imperialist conditions Russia expects from any settlement — annexation of land and a veto for Moscow on any security guarantees against future Russian attacks. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Trump wanted to cut a deal with Putin for the partition of Ukraine. He hoped that would ensure U.S. corporations opportunities to plunder Ukraine's mineral reserves and profit from the neoliberal reconstruction of the country. Likely above all he wanted a settlement so that he could turn Washington's attention to its main imperial rival, China. Trump and Putin planned to bully Zelenskyy into accepting “land swaps,” essentially agreeing to Russia's illegal conquest of a whole swathe of Ukraine in return for peace. Moreover, 70 percent of Ukrainians oppose any such land for peace deal. They know such a compromise would likely doom people under occupation to brutal oppression and that Putin will at best pause his war only to start it again to achieve his stated goal of subordinating Ukraine in Russia's imperialist sphere of influence. During this charade of a peace process, Putin actually escalated the war with increased missile strikes and drone attacks with the aim of annexing more land. In the midst of Putin's escalation, Vermont State Senator Tanya Vyhovsky was in Ukraine on a speaking tour to build solidarity with the country's progressive movement. Vyhovsky is a Ukrainian American, clinical social worker, and a member of Vermont's Progressive Party and the Democratic Socialists of America. In this exclusive interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity and concision, she speaks with Truthout about conditions in Ukraine, its progressive forces, and why the U.S. left should rally to support the country's struggle for self-determination. Ashley Smith: You were in Ukraine on a speaking tour to build solidarity with the Ukrainian resistance to Russia's invasion and occupation of the country. It was a powerful experience to connect to the people fighting for real leftist social change in Ukraine amid a full-scale invasion. These were generally outside of the city center. All the cities' fountains have been turned off to save money. I couldn't stay in the city's hotels because they have been bombed by Russia. Dnipro was functioning much as usual, except that the windows all have sandbags and there are above-ground bomb shelters on nearly every corner. Three hours after I left the city, they suffered multiple ballistic missile attacks. In Lviv, it feels for the most part like there isn't a war. The statues are netted, people casually mention a church statue whose head fell off during a bombing, and there were occasional air raid sirens. But the curfew is very loosely adhered to. But the day after I left, there was a massive missile attack that killed people. I spoke to many soldiers about what it's been like for the past nearly four years. The vast majority of Ukrainians — from citizens to soldiers — oppose Trump's attempt to cut a deal with Putin for the partition of their country. If that deal were struck, many service members told me there would have been a revolt among the troops. While I was not able to go to cities on the front, I did speak to a lot of people particularly in Lviv that had been internally displaced from Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and Kherson. They described the horrors of living under constant bombardment, especially for their kids, and felt like they had no choice but to flee. These internally displaced people have put a strain on housing and the cost of living in the cities where they resettled. But everyone I spoke with said it was the duty of all Ukrainians to ensure that internally displaced people are welcomed, cared for, and protected. What were the various responses to these summits from Ukrainians? The plan they're putting forward is unacceptable on its face. Russia is making demands that Ukraine can in no way agree to. It is demanding that Ukraine give up sovereignty and accept occupation. So, with such diametrically opposed positions, it's hard for Ukrainians to take this so-called peace process seriously. Ukrainians often asked my advice on what Ukraine should do. Such a deal will simply pause Russian aggression until Putin has time to regroup and come back for more Ukrainian land. This is, of course, what happened after Russia's first invasion in 2014. Putin took Crimea and sections of Donbas, bided his time, cut a deal, and then launched the war again in 2022. Any deal will banish people in annexed areas to brutal Russian oppression. I really worry that an occupation will lead to full-scale genocide as it has in Palestine after 75 years of occupation. Finally, I worry about the implications for democracy and sovereignty if Putin's aggression is rewarded. People in the U.S. know little about Ukraine's progressive forces. What kinds of groups did you meet with? What were their main struggles, and how do they combine those with support for the liberation struggle? There is a surprisingly vibrant and diverse progressive movement. I talked with members of the student unions (both federated and independent). I also met with a new grassroots political party, as well as with leaders of the feminist movement, young LGBTQ activists, and small groups of volunteers making food and mats for the military. They are all organizing around their issues and demands. They all voiced demands for better working conditions, higher wages, fair taxation, and expanded rights and access to reproductive health care, as well as for a more representative government. Ukrainians have universal health care, strong public schools, and affordable if not always free university education. They are actually concerned that the West will condition its support for Ukraine with a pledge to enact a neoliberal reconstruction of the country with the usual requirements of privatization, deregulation, and austerity. But they know that their fight for expanded democratic rights and better social programs, wages and benefits cannot be separated from the struggle to defend the country. Various forces you met with played a major role in organizing the protests. I met with many of the leaders and participants in these protests. While they are of course thankful that this catastrophic law was halted, they all feel that these anti-corruption agencies need to be strengthened, not just returned to the status quo. We should recognize that these protests occurred under martial law. That shows the vibrancy of Ukraine's democratic freedoms even amid this war, something that Russian conquest — as we know from the occupied territories — would eradicate. People are very critical of Zelensky and his neoliberal policies. At this point, they said, there is also no major left party that has representatives in parliament or grassroots power to advance their demands. But people are trying to build such a party to ensure that their country does not become a carbon copy of the United States. As a Vermont State Senator, you are one of DSA's prominent elected officials. While the left has uniformly supported Palestine's struggle for self-determination, it has not extended the same solidarity to Ukraine's struggle. This leads some on the left to oppose not just the U.S. but also Ukraine's struggle for self-determination and, in some cases, even to support Russian imperialism. There are also those who oppose all funding of any war. They hold the naive belief that if Ukraine just stops fighting it will bring about peace. If Ukrainians didn't resist, Russia would simply conquer the country and impose dictatorial colonial rule. The truth is that if Russia stops fighting, there will be peace, but if Ukraine stops, there will be no Ukraine. Finally, there is a subset of the left that mistakenly thinks that Russia is not an imperialist power but a progressive force standing up to the U.S. In reality, Putin heads a neoliberal, capitalist dictatorship. So, people on the left have various justifications for not supporting Ukraine's struggle against occupation, genocide, and imperialism, but they are all wrong. In your meetings with Ukraine's progressive forces, what message did they want conveyed to the U.S. left? What do they want us to advocate here? The Ukrainian left wants the U.S. left to know that they exist, that they are strong and united, and that they cannot fight for leftist values and ideals under Russian occupation. They told me so many stories from the long history of Ukraine's struggle for freedom and justice all the way up to today. Finally, with Trump collaborating with Putin on plans to partition the country so he can turn his attention to Washington's imperial rivalry with China, what can people here in the U.S. do to materially support Ukraine's people? There are many opportunities for people to provide desperately needed material support. People can donate to campaigns that make freeze-dried emergency food for soldiers at the front and tarps to protect soldiers. The teachers need help to renovate their bomb shelter schools, and the feminists need funding for comprehensive reproductive rights education. There really isn't any part of civil society or the military in Ukraine that would not benefit from material support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jake Sullivan claims his stance has changed because Israel's “war” is different now than it was under Biden. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Top Biden administration officials have begun rewriting their ironclad support of Israel throughout the end of President Joe Biden's term, now claiming to oppose Israel's starvation policy in Gaza as it's officially tipped into famine — a famine that they fully laid the groundwork for over the first 16 months of the genocide. In an interview with “The Bulwark” published Wednesday, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that he now supposedly supports withholding weapons from Israel because, he claims, the situation in Gaza is different than it was last year. “I have in fact told a number of members [of Congress] who were thinking about the votes on these resolutions that the situation as it stands today, following the breakdown of the ceasefire in March, means that a vote to withhold weapons from Israel is a totally credible position. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. He claims that, throughout 2024, Israel was facing threats from other countries that it doesn't face today, and that a hallmark moment was when Israel showed its obstinance in unilaterally ending the ceasefire deal in March. These changes mean that current pro-Israel policies are less legitimate than the Biden administration's stance, he said. “My view is that people who, you know, thought this was wrong from the start didn't stare squarely at October 7th. Other times, they would outright lie about Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid. For instance, in October of 2024, Biden officials sent Israel an ultimatum demanding that it increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, or else the U.S. may end its military support. Israel, in turn, actually decreased the aid flow to record lows — and the administration said that it has not assessed that Israel was in violation of its ultimatum. Sullivan's argument that military aid to Israel was legitimate last year is also completely undercut by the International Court of Justice's opinion in January of 2024 that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide and ordered it to end the siege and lift the humanitarian blockade. Other former Biden officials have attempted to backtrack in recent weeks. In an interview with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner published Tuesday, Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, said that the situation now is “very, very different” from what it was under Biden with regards to starvation in Gaza — even as experts had warned countless times that there were potentially thousands of deaths to starvation and other causes not being counted in the official death toll. Like Sullivan, Lew also defended the genocide as it was conducted under Biden. When pressed, he said that the children killed in strikes on schools and shelters were acceptable collateral damage because they were often found to be family members of Hamas fighters.

MOSCOW, August 27. /TASS/. Russia will take tit-for-tat measures against Norwegian fishing vessels if Norway does not reconsider its position within one month, head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries Ilya Shestakov said.

"In case the Norwegian side does not reconsider its position within one month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone for Norwegian fishing vessels. Furthermore, fisheries and distribution of catch quotas in open waters of Barents and Norwegian Seas will be carried out on the basis of Russian national interests," Shestakov said, cited by the agency's press service.

In July 2025, Norway introduced the fishing ban in its exclusive economic zone for two Russian companies. This is a gross violation of effective agreements on joint management of reserves of aquatic bioresources, the press service told TASS.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexico's senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country's top politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion over the presence of foreign troops. “I'm asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly in the livestreamed video. When Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I'm going to beat the shit out of you, I'm going to kill you. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.” The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied. Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”. The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries. The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.</p>

While your visit in 2023 had a multilateral context, your current visit is seen as an important one for India-Japan relations. What should we look forward to during your two days in Japan? Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I am delighted to be in Tokyo once again, this time for the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit. I warmly thank Prime Minister Ishiba for his gracious invitation. India and Japan are not just two close partners. We are ancient civilizations, vibrant democracies and leading economies. Over the past decade, our ties have scaled new heights since they were elevated to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. During my meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, I look forward to charting the next phase of our partnership. I also look forward to visiting Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a region that symbolizes both resilience and innovation. I am confident that my visit, though short, will be long in impact. Yomiuri: What concrete steps are being taken under the India-Japan partnership to improve cooperation on semiconductors, and how will this collaboration help address supply chain challenges, boost domestic manufacturing in India and support the technological ambitions of both countries? We are working together on new and emerging technologies, with semiconductor being one of them. India's semiconductor sector is on the cusp of transformation. We have put in place a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework, backed by incentives, to build a strong semiconductor and display ecosystem. Already, six semiconductor units are taking root in India, with four more on the way. By the end of this very year, “Made in India” chips will be in the market, a clear demonstration of India's design and manufacturing capabilities. Japanese companies, with their technological strengths and global leadership, can play a pivotal role in this journey. By combining India's scale and capabilities with Japan's advanced technologies, we can build a resilient and trusted semiconductor value chain. This collaboration will support the technological ambitions of both our countries, and enhance global supply chain security. I see semiconductor cooperation emerging as a major pillar of the India–Japan partnership. After all, in this digital century, chips are not just about computers, they are about competitiveness, credibility and confidence in the future. Yomiuri: India has an expansive vision for space exploration, and we understand that your government has recently approved the Chandrayaan 5 Mission, and that this will be done in collaboration with Japan. From Chandrayaan-3's historic landing on the moon's south pole to our advances in interplanetary missions, India has consistently demonstrated that space is not the final frontier, it is the next frontier. Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between ISRO and JAXA, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launch pads, and from research to real-world applications. The impact of space science is linked to progress in our daily lives, from agriculture, disaster management, to communications and beyond. I am confident that our scientific teams will be working together to push the boundaries of space science. Modi: Collaboration in the defense sector has been a strong success story for India and Japan. Both countries have a shared interest in peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. Today, our partnership spans across all three services. In recent years, Indian defense products are rapidly expanding their global footprint. Japan also has a proven record in the field of defense technology. Together, with political trust and natural complementarities, we can design and produce next generation defense platforms not just for ourselves, but also for the world. The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to be adopted during my visit will further military modernization and defense industry collaboration, and advance our ambition for shaping a secure and stable Indo-Pacific for generations to come. Yomiuri: How do you evaluate the economic partnership between India and Japan? As the world's leading economies, we have been contributing to each other's growth, competitiveness and dynamism. Japan has been a trusted partner in India's infrastructure development across generations. Japan has also been a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment for India in key sectors including automobiles, electronics, telecom, chemicals, finance and pharmaceuticals. The number of Japanese firms in India has grown steadily to around 1,500, while more than 400 Indian companies operate in Japan. We maintain important trade relations, but it has not yet reached the levels envisaged under our CEPA [Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement]. I am confident that with renewed efforts, we can diversify our trade basket, make it more balanced and open up new frontiers as well. The 20th century saw Japan emerge as a major partner in India's infrastructure development. I am confident that the 21st century will see Japan as a major partner in India's innovation, manufacturing, and global value chains. Yomiuri: Some Japanese companies are positioning their production bases in India as hubs for third-country markets such as Africa. How would India support the efforts of such companies? We have removed compliance burdens, rolled out incentives and ensured a large skilled work force for companies to set base in India. Many global companies, including from Japan, are setting up their production in India not only to cater to our domestic market, but also for the world. Just a couple of days back, I was at the Suzuki plant in India where we flagged off electric vehicles to be exported to a hundred countries, including Japan. Steps like “Japan-India Cooperation Initiative for Sustainable Economic Development in Africa” combining Japan's technological and financial expertise with India's developmental partnership and long-standing goodwill in Africa are good efforts in the right direction. India is well placed to play the role of a bridge connecting Japan's capabilities with Africa's growth and development priorities. We are aiming to have the passenger services start in a few years' time. While the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is on its way, we have unveiled a bigger ambition: to have a 7,000-kilometer-long network of high-speed rail in our country. Much of it will have to be through Make in India, so that the program is sustainable and viable. I welcome active participation by Japanese companies in this endeavour. There is also potential to expand our cooperation beyond high-speed rail to cover other areas of mobility including sectors such as ports, aviation, shipbuilding, road transport, railways and logistics where India has launched ambitious initiatives. Clearly, Japan's technological edge in many of these areas, together with India's scale, manufacturing and innovation power, can create enormous value for both sides. Yomiuri: People-to-People exchanges between India and Japan have become an important area of cooperation. Can you tell us more about how India and Japan plan to take this forward? Modi: Immense mutual goodwill and friendship between the people of India and Japan is at the heart of our ties with Japan. There is great receptivity toward our cultures and cuisines in both countries. Professionals from Japan are well respected in India and have built a niche for themselves. Whether it is Indian IT professionals or Indian scientific manpower, greater presence of the Indian diaspora in Japan can help stimulate new industries and new fields of knowledge where our two countries have so much at stake. We have also etched important agreements under Japan's Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) program and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to enhance the advanced manufacturing skills of our workers. Our focus has also been in promoting language education in India which would also allow our people to connect better with each other and to tap into the complementarities. I look forward to discussing this aspect of our relations at the Summit. Yomiuri: What can Japan and India do to help establish international rules for the reliable use of AI? India sees AI as a medium to enhance human progress. But we are equally conscious of the risk it poses. We believe that resolving concerns and encouraging innovation should be given equal importance in AI Governance so that we only promote Responsible AI. AI Governance must go beyond mitigating risks; it should also encourage fair access and foster inclusive progress for all, especially in the Global South. India's Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) has democratized digital commerce and addressed key data protection issues through techno-legal solutions. In a data-driven world, international collaboration is crucial for effective AI governance and secure and transparent cross-border data exchange. India and Japan should seize this opportunity to deepen our partnership, promote interoperability while respecting sovereignty, harmonize standards through techno-legal solutions and identify convergence between regulatory approaches. India will be hosting the AI Impact Summit in 2026. Yomiuri: What are your views on the Japanese government's concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific? Modi: There is a strong convergence between Japan's vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and India's own approach encapsulated in our Indo-Pacific vision, in the Vision MAHASAGAR and the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative. Both our countries have strong and extensive linkages with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and we both engage with some of them in plurilateral formats to give expression to our shared objectives. Yomiuri: You are visiting China after your visit to Japan. What is the importance of improving relations with China at this time? Modi: At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, I would be traveling to Tianjin from here to take part in the SCO Summit. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, steady and positive progress has been made in our bilateral ties. India is ready to advance bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges. Yomiuri: You recently held consecutive phone conversations with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Modi: India has maintained a principled and humanitarian stance on the conflict which is equally appreciated by both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. I have already indicated India's willingness to support meaningful efforts aimed at achieving peaceful resolution of the conflict. I believe, by virtue of our good relations with both sides, including key stakeholders, we can strengthen efforts dedicated to the restoration of an early and lasting peace in Ukraine. Modi: The global community has made a commitment to create a more equitable world through achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. They continue to face myriad challenges involving global governance, climate change, food and energy security, debt and financial stress, all having significant impact on their development priorities. As members of the Global South, we clearly understand these concerns and their effects on people's lives. India attaches importance to its engagement with BRICS, which has emerged as a valuable forum for consultation, and cooperation and has helped promote mutual understanding, on a specific set of issues of common interest to emerging economies. We believe in building bridges of cooperation and friendship among nations. We greatly value Japan's role in strengthening the Quad's agenda and believe that together we can continue to deliver practical solutions and tangible outcomes that benefit not only our region but the wider world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces have hit the route three times in August alone. One of the world's longest energy networks, Druzhba spans roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), carrying oil from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Passing through Ukraine, it remains the primary route for deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Kiev's most recent attack nearly a week ago effectively halted Russian oil deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary, prompting the two EU countries to demand action from the Commission. On Wednesday, Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the pipeline was back online after a week-long disruption caused by Ukrainian strikes. The attacks have been condemned by both the Hungarian and Slovak governments, which have often criticized EU support for Kiev. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said earlier this week that the attacks jeopardize Hungary's energy security and called it “outrageous that the EC keeps on claiming there is ‘no supply risk'.” Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said the strikes not only directly undermined his country's national interests but also harmed Ukraine, noting that Kiev relies on diesel fuel supplies from Slovakia. According to a letter shared by Hungarian officials, US President Donald Trump also expressed frustration over the attacks, saying he was “very angry” about them. Moscow has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia attacked a Ukrainian Navy vessel, killing one crew member and injuring several others, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 28. Simferopol is a Ukrainian Navy reconnaissance ship of the Laguna-class. It was launched in 2019 and officially joined the fleet two years later. The vessel is designed for radio, electronic, radar, and optical reconnaissance, and was armed with a 30 mm AK-306 artillery system. While Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, reports of Ukrainian naval losses are extremely rare. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has targeted multiple civilian vessels in the Black Sea, including foreign ones. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The Aug. 28 call came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial strike on Ukrainian cities overnight. This marks the first time a vessel carrying fuel from the blacklisted facility has entered a Chinese import terminal. Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker. "This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves." "No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T reported a higher third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates but also booked restructuring charges as the bank works to shore up deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls and adjust to a cap on U.S. retail assets imposed by regulators. TD earned profit of $3.34-billion, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31. That compared with a quarterly loss in the same quarter last year after U.S. regulators hit the bank with a US$3-billion fine over serious lapses in its programs to prevent money laundering. Adjusted to exclude that one-time charge, TD said it earned $2.20 per share, which was higher than the $2.05 consensus estimate among analysts. The quarterly earnings were affected by $262-million incurred from TD's moves to restructure its U.S. balance sheet, which has included selling loans to stay under the regulatory asset cap. A bright spot in TD's third-quarter results was its Canadian retail banking division, which reported profit of $1.95-billion, up 4 per cent from last year. Profit from U.S. retail banking was $760-million, compared with a loss in the same quarter last year. Wealth management and insurance profit was $703-million, up 63 per cent from a year ago. “We are well positioned to build on this momentum as we compete, grow and build our bank for the future,” chief executive officer Ray Chun said in a statement. TD set aside $971-million in provisions for credit losses, or money earmarked to cover loans that may default. TD's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its resilience in times of stress, is 14.8 per cent. Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that TD earned profit of $3.37-billion in the third quarter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional comments from Ukrainian and Hungarian officials. In recent weeks, Ukraine carried out at least three attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily disrupting operations. "Ukraine knows very well that the Druzhba pipeline is vital for Hungary's and Slovakia's energy supply, and that such strikes harm us far more than Russia," Szijjarto said on X. Brovdi dismissed Budapest's decision and said the Hungarian leadership shares responsibility for Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities by "filling their own dirty pockets with sanctioned cheap raw materials." "I am Ukrainian, and I will arrive in my father's homeland after you," the commander said on his Telegram channel. "There are enough true Hungarians in Hungary, and one day, they will be sick to death of you." In his statement, Szijjarto made no mention of the Russian overnight mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv on Aug. 28, which killed at least 18 people, including four children, and injured almost 40 others. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Budapest "is on the wrong side of history." "Peter, if the Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed by Russia this morning, this is moral decay," he wrote on X. "If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to clarify the issue and "respond accordingly." Kyiv regularly carries out attacks on military and industrial facilities in Russia, targeting Russian oil infrastructure to undermine Moscow's revenue streams and weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine.

"No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said. European and U.S. military officials have been increasingly concerned over the flights in the German state of Thuringia, even as Russian sabotage operations in Europe declined in 2025, the New York Times reported. Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) hit a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Susan Monarez ousted ahead of announcement that could link immunisations with autism The chief of America's top public health agency is refusing to quit after she reportedly clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr over vaccine policy. Lawyers for Dr Susan Monarez have said she can only be fired directly by Donald Trump himself, even though the White House on Wednesday said she had been kicked out. Four other senior scientists also quit the agency, reportedly in apparent frustration at Mr Kennedy's leadership and sceptical stance on vaccines. Sources told CNN that Dr Monarez had clashed with Mr Kennedy over vaccine policies, including an upcoming announcement that could draw links between immunisations and autism. Mr Kennedy Jr's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Dr Monarez was “no longer” director, less than a month after her senate confirmation. “The attack on Dr Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” it said. The White House late on Wednesday announced that she had been fired. Kush Desai, the White House's deputy press secretary, said Dr Monarez was not “aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again”. Because she had “refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC”, he added. Dr Monarez refused to back down however, with her lawyer, Mark Zaid, saying: “As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her. We have notified the White House counsel of our position.” Dr Monarez said during her confirmation hearing that she had not seen evidence of such a link. In June, Mr Kennedy Jr dismissed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations. The CDC has also been targeted for hefty budget cuts as part of Donald Trump's campaign to cut back federal spending.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside. Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. O'Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation. “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school. It's little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon. Pope Leo XIV, who is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured in the “terrible tragedy”. Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. As police continue to search for a potential motive, O'Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter's devices. “Everything that we've seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC's Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O'Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing. At a briefing, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. Later, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he cowered in terror away from the gunfire, his friend Victor lay across him. Monday had been the first day back at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy neighbourhood about 5 miles south of downtown Minneapolis. But as the children took their seats, just before 8.30am (2.30pm UK) on Wednesday, transgender shooter Robin Westman was stalking the building outside. Dressed in black and camouflage and armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun, Westman barricaded church doors with wooden planks before firing his rifle at the children through the side of the building, their heads bent in prayer. Another 14 children aged six to 15 were injured, two critically. Among those rushed to hospital, where medics frantically moved patients out of rooms to make way for the victims, was Victor, who Weston says he thinks is “okay”. While officers had still not confirmed the number of bullets fired during Westman's rampage, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the number of rounds was “in the dozens”. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Mr O'Hara said. “Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “It was an automatic gun and I was near kids and we all got down,” Ms Mertens told NBC News. “He was just a normal, every day beat cop. No special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,” Mr McAdaragh said. After carrying out his twisted attack, Westman shot himself dead in the car park, according to the Minneapolis police chief. Officers found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. Before going on his killing spree, Westman had posted a series of YouTube videos showcasing his manifesto and large arsenal of weapons. Westman's mother Mary is believed to be a retired employee of the school. In one video, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun, and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over Westman's bed. Many of the first responders were “deeply traumatised by what they saw”, Mr O'Hara said. Hours later, terrified parents stood outside the reunification area, waiting for information about their children. Amid a crowd of heavy law enforcement later that morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school. Tearful students from neighbouring high schools that had been on lockdown began arriving in search of news about their friends and siblings who had been inside the church. Those who were reunited with their loved ones embraced their children before rushing them away from the scene. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senator, said one of her staff members' children had to tell her friend's father his daughter had been struck. “These kids are doing an all-school Mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot — one in the back, one in the neck,” Ms Klobuchar told MSNBC. “And they all got down under the pews and she, her daughter, of course, was not shot, but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.” “It's a neighbourhood where people come together”, she said. And those innocent children, they don't deserve to die like that”, she said. My heart goes out to the parents and those innocent kids.” “I don't know where He is,” Mr Simpson said.</p>
