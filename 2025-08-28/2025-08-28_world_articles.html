                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jake Sullivan claims his stance has changed because Israel's “war” is different now than it was under Biden. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Top Biden administration officials have begun rewriting their ironclad support of Israel throughout the end of President Joe Biden's term, now claiming to oppose Israel's starvation policy in Gaza as it's officially tipped into famine — a famine that they fully laid the groundwork for over the first 16 months of the genocide. In an interview with “The Bulwark” published Wednesday, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that he now supposedly supports withholding weapons from Israel because, he claims, the situation in Gaza is different than it was last year. “I have in fact told a number of members [of Congress] who were thinking about the votes on these resolutions that the situation as it stands today, following the breakdown of the ceasefire in March, means that a vote to withhold weapons from Israel is a totally credible position. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. He claims that, throughout 2024, Israel was facing threats from other countries that it doesn't face today, and that a hallmark moment was when Israel showed its obstinance in unilaterally ending the ceasefire deal in March. These changes mean that current pro-Israel policies are less legitimate than the Biden administration's stance, he said. “My view is that people who, you know, thought this was wrong from the start didn't stare squarely at October 7th. Other times, they would outright lie about Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid. For instance, in October of 2024, Biden officials sent Israel an ultimatum demanding that it increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, or else the U.S. may end its military support. Israel, in turn, actually decreased the aid flow to record lows — and the administration said that it has not assessed that Israel was in violation of its ultimatum. Sullivan's argument that military aid to Israel was legitimate last year is also completely undercut by the International Court of Justice's opinion in January of 2024 that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide and ordered it to end the siege and lift the humanitarian blockade. Other former Biden officials have attempted to backtrack in recent weeks. In an interview with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner published Tuesday, Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, said that the situation now is “very, very different” from what it was under Biden with regards to starvation in Gaza — even as experts had warned countless times that there were potentially thousands of deaths to starvation and other causes not being counted in the official death toll. Like Sullivan, Lew also defended the genocide as it was conducted under Biden. When pressed, he said that the children killed in strikes on schools and shelters were acceptable collateral damage because they were often found to be family members of Hamas fighters.

Award-winning journalist Mario Guevara, who had begun documenting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, has been detained since his arrest at a protest on June 14 in DeKalb County, Georgia. Guevara has spent almost all of his detention in ICE custody, although he is authorized to live and work in the United States. He immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. Guevara settled in Georgia and continued to work as a journalist, first for Mundo Hispánico, and then, in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MG News, which had recently begun filming ICE abductions. In a phone interview from an ICE jail in South Georgia, Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution that the agency is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” Some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. At a hearing on Wednesday, the judge did not rule on Guevara's petition and requested briefs from both sides. Guevara's saga began more than two months ago when he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest, which was part of a nationwide day of action to protest President Donald Trump. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. Video of his arrest shows that Guevara is wearing a red shirt underneath a vest clearly marked with PRESS on the front and back. After his arrest, ICE placed a detainer on Guevara. Although all criminal charges related to the protest have been dropped, federal prosecutors have fought to keep him locked up in ICE custody. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that ICE arrested Guevara because he is a journalist. The habeas petition quotes extensively from the government's filings to demonstrate that ICE is targeting Guevara because he is a journalist. “In the Notice of Appeal, the Government states that Mr. Guevara is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed' law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,'” it reads. Guevara is currently held in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day at the Folkston ICE Processing Center, according to the petition.

MOSCOW, August 27. /TASS/. Russia will take tit-for-tat measures against Norwegian fishing vessels if Norway does not reconsider its position within one month, head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries Ilya Shestakov said.

"In case the Norwegian side does not reconsider its position within one month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone for Norwegian fishing vessels. Furthermore, fisheries and distribution of catch quotas in open waters of Barents and Norwegian Seas will be carried out on the basis of Russian national interests," Shestakov said, cited by the agency's press service.

In July 2025, Norway introduced the fishing ban in its exclusive economic zone for two Russian companies. This is a gross violation of effective agreements on joint management of reserves of aquatic bioresources, the press service told TASS.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Democratic Socialists of America held their national convention this summer in the afterglow of arguably their biggest electoral victory to date: Zohran Mamdani's triumph in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor. They then passed a series of resolutions that Mamdani critics are now trying to make a political liability ahead of November's election. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, is calling attention to democratic socialist policies and argues Mamdani isn't being challenged enough on them. The DSA now bans its individual chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement, opposes measures that would fund border control and calls for a carbon-free economy and the returning of land to indigenous communities. Cuomo has pointed to DSA's calls to end criminal penalties for misdemeanor crimes and close prisons as well as its strident criticism of Israel. Mamdani lists himself as a democratic socialist in his social media profiles and has close ties to DSA officials in New York City and nationally. Mamdani reiterated to reporters that he does not support decriminalizing misdemeanors or defunding the police, despite his past tweets criticizing the New York Police Department. “My specific policy proposals are the ones that I talk about, the ones that I share on my platform, on my website,” Mamdani said Thursday when asked about the DSA's resolutions. But they say they are proud of Mamdani and resist the notion that his affiliation with socialism is a liability. “While sometimes, especially with older generations, there is sometimes the big scary ‘S' word, socialism, younger folks really see that capitalism is not working out for them. And these policies really resonate with voters,” said Megan Romer, co-chair of the DSA. Another DSA co-chair, Ashik Siddique, said in a statement that the group was “proud to count Zohran as a member.” “While we are proud that Zohran works closely with NYC-DSA, we also understand his platform for mayor is not identical to the DSA National platform,” Siddique said. The DSA at its August national convention passed an exhaustive compendium of resolutions, more than 300 pages long. Here's a look at the DSA and what it laid out in its policy resolutions. “We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear,” they explain on their website. “We want to win ‘radical' reforms like single-payer Medicare for All, defunding the police/refunding communities, the Green New Deal, and more as a transition to a freer, more just life.” By extension, DSA members cannot be in law enforcement. Their vision for a “Democratic Socialist Republic” includes “replacing existing law enforcement agencies with a public safety force run by local communities for de-escalation and protecting democratic and social rights.” They also call for banning former officers from joining the organization and eliminating qualified immunity. When asked about these policies, Romer, the DSA national co-chair, characterized them as more of their long-term goals for society and less of the rigid checklist that it comes across as outlined in the compendium. For his part, Mamdani is not actively campaigning on antagonizing   police despite his past support for the defund movement. I am not running to defund the police,” he told reporters in July. They also call for supporting “the student intifada,” demonstrations of Palestinian solidarity on college campuses. Supporters of Israel see calls for an “intifada” as glorifying violence against Jews.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mexico's senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country's top politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion over the presence of foreign troops. “I'm asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly in the livestreamed video. When Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I'm going to beat the shit out of you, I'm going to kill you. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.” The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied. Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”. The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries. The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.</p>

While your visit in 2023 had a multilateral context, your current visit is seen as an important one for India-Japan relations. What should we look forward to during your two days in Japan? Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I am delighted to be in Tokyo once again, this time for the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit. I warmly thank Prime Minister Ishiba for his gracious invitation. India and Japan are not just two close partners. We are ancient civilizations, vibrant democracies and leading economies. Over the past decade, our ties have scaled new heights since they were elevated to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. During my meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, I look forward to charting the next phase of our partnership. I also look forward to visiting Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a region that symbolizes both resilience and innovation. I am confident that my visit, though short, will be long in impact. Yomiuri: What concrete steps are being taken under the India-Japan partnership to improve cooperation on semiconductors, and how will this collaboration help address supply chain challenges, boost domestic manufacturing in India and support the technological ambitions of both countries? We are working together on new and emerging technologies, with semiconductor being one of them. India's semiconductor sector is on the cusp of transformation. We have put in place a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework, backed by incentives, to build a strong semiconductor and display ecosystem. Already, six semiconductor units are taking root in India, with four more on the way. By the end of this very year, “Made in India” chips will be in the market, a clear demonstration of India's design and manufacturing capabilities. Japanese companies, with their technological strengths and global leadership, can play a pivotal role in this journey. By combining India's scale and capabilities with Japan's advanced technologies, we can build a resilient and trusted semiconductor value chain. This collaboration will support the technological ambitions of both our countries, and enhance global supply chain security. I see semiconductor cooperation emerging as a major pillar of the India–Japan partnership. After all, in this digital century, chips are not just about computers, they are about competitiveness, credibility and confidence in the future. Yomiuri: India has an expansive vision for space exploration, and we understand that your government has recently approved the Chandrayaan 5 Mission, and that this will be done in collaboration with Japan. From Chandrayaan-3's historic landing on the moon's south pole to our advances in interplanetary missions, India has consistently demonstrated that space is not the final frontier, it is the next frontier. Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between ISRO and JAXA, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launch pads, and from research to real-world applications. The impact of space science is linked to progress in our daily lives, from agriculture, disaster management, to communications and beyond. I am confident that our scientific teams will be working together to push the boundaries of space science. Modi: Collaboration in the defense sector has been a strong success story for India and Japan. Both countries have a shared interest in peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. Today, our partnership spans across all three services. In recent years, Indian defense products are rapidly expanding their global footprint. Japan also has a proven record in the field of defense technology. Together, with political trust and natural complementarities, we can design and produce next generation defense platforms not just for ourselves, but also for the world. The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to be adopted during my visit will further military modernization and defense industry collaboration, and advance our ambition for shaping a secure and stable Indo-Pacific for generations to come. Yomiuri: How do you evaluate the economic partnership between India and Japan? As the world's leading economies, we have been contributing to each other's growth, competitiveness and dynamism. Japan has been a trusted partner in India's infrastructure development across generations. Japan has also been a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment for India in key sectors including automobiles, electronics, telecom, chemicals, finance and pharmaceuticals. The number of Japanese firms in India has grown steadily to around 1,500, while more than 400 Indian companies operate in Japan. We maintain important trade relations, but it has not yet reached the levels envisaged under our CEPA [Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement]. I am confident that with renewed efforts, we can diversify our trade basket, make it more balanced and open up new frontiers as well. The 20th century saw Japan emerge as a major partner in India's infrastructure development. I am confident that the 21st century will see Japan as a major partner in India's innovation, manufacturing, and global value chains. Yomiuri: Some Japanese companies are positioning their production bases in India as hubs for third-country markets such as Africa. How would India support the efforts of such companies? We have removed compliance burdens, rolled out incentives and ensured a large skilled work force for companies to set base in India. Many global companies, including from Japan, are setting up their production in India not only to cater to our domestic market, but also for the world. Just a couple of days back, I was at the Suzuki plant in India where we flagged off electric vehicles to be exported to a hundred countries, including Japan. Steps like “Japan-India Cooperation Initiative for Sustainable Economic Development in Africa” combining Japan's technological and financial expertise with India's developmental partnership and long-standing goodwill in Africa are good efforts in the right direction. India is well placed to play the role of a bridge connecting Japan's capabilities with Africa's growth and development priorities. We are aiming to have the passenger services start in a few years' time. While the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is on its way, we have unveiled a bigger ambition: to have a 7,000-kilometer-long network of high-speed rail in our country. Much of it will have to be through Make in India, so that the program is sustainable and viable. I welcome active participation by Japanese companies in this endeavour. There is also potential to expand our cooperation beyond high-speed rail to cover other areas of mobility including sectors such as ports, aviation, shipbuilding, road transport, railways and logistics where India has launched ambitious initiatives. Clearly, Japan's technological edge in many of these areas, together with India's scale, manufacturing and innovation power, can create enormous value for both sides. Yomiuri: People-to-People exchanges between India and Japan have become an important area of cooperation. Can you tell us more about how India and Japan plan to take this forward? Modi: Immense mutual goodwill and friendship between the people of India and Japan is at the heart of our ties with Japan. There is great receptivity toward our cultures and cuisines in both countries. Professionals from Japan are well respected in India and have built a niche for themselves. Whether it is Indian IT professionals or Indian scientific manpower, greater presence of the Indian diaspora in Japan can help stimulate new industries and new fields of knowledge where our two countries have so much at stake. We have also etched important agreements under Japan's Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) program and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to enhance the advanced manufacturing skills of our workers. Our focus has also been in promoting language education in India which would also allow our people to connect better with each other and to tap into the complementarities. I look forward to discussing this aspect of our relations at the Summit. Yomiuri: What can Japan and India do to help establish international rules for the reliable use of AI? India sees AI as a medium to enhance human progress. But we are equally conscious of the risk it poses. We believe that resolving concerns and encouraging innovation should be given equal importance in AI Governance so that we only promote Responsible AI. AI Governance must go beyond mitigating risks; it should also encourage fair access and foster inclusive progress for all, especially in the Global South. India's Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) has democratized digital commerce and addressed key data protection issues through techno-legal solutions. In a data-driven world, international collaboration is crucial for effective AI governance and secure and transparent cross-border data exchange. India and Japan should seize this opportunity to deepen our partnership, promote interoperability while respecting sovereignty, harmonize standards through techno-legal solutions and identify convergence between regulatory approaches. India will be hosting the AI Impact Summit in 2026. Yomiuri: What are your views on the Japanese government's concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific? Modi: There is a strong convergence between Japan's vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and India's own approach encapsulated in our Indo-Pacific vision, in the Vision MAHASAGAR and the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative. Both our countries have strong and extensive linkages with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and we both engage with some of them in plurilateral formats to give expression to our shared objectives. Yomiuri: You are visiting China after your visit to Japan. What is the importance of improving relations with China at this time? Modi: At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, I would be traveling to Tianjin from here to take part in the SCO Summit. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, steady and positive progress has been made in our bilateral ties. India is ready to advance bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges. Yomiuri: You recently held consecutive phone conversations with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Modi: India has maintained a principled and humanitarian stance on the conflict which is equally appreciated by both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. I have already indicated India's willingness to support meaningful efforts aimed at achieving peaceful resolution of the conflict. I believe, by virtue of our good relations with both sides, including key stakeholders, we can strengthen efforts dedicated to the restoration of an early and lasting peace in Ukraine. Modi: The global community has made a commitment to create a more equitable world through achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. They continue to face myriad challenges involving global governance, climate change, food and energy security, debt and financial stress, all having significant impact on their development priorities. As members of the Global South, we clearly understand these concerns and their effects on people's lives. India attaches importance to its engagement with BRICS, which has emerged as a valuable forum for consultation, and cooperation and has helped promote mutual understanding, on a specific set of issues of common interest to emerging economies. We believe in building bridges of cooperation and friendship among nations. We greatly value Japan's role in strengthening the Quad's agenda and believe that together we can continue to deliver practical solutions and tangible outcomes that benefit not only our region but the wider world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian forces have hit the route three times in August alone. One of the world's longest energy networks, Druzhba spans roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), carrying oil from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Passing through Ukraine, it remains the primary route for deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia. Kiev's most recent attack nearly a week ago effectively halted Russian oil deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary, prompting the two EU countries to demand action from the Commission. On Wednesday, Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the pipeline was back online after a week-long disruption caused by Ukrainian strikes. The attacks have been condemned by both the Hungarian and Slovak governments, which have often criticized EU support for Kiev. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said earlier this week that the attacks jeopardize Hungary's energy security and called it “outrageous that the EC keeps on claiming there is ‘no supply risk'.” Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said the strikes not only directly undermined his country's national interests but also harmed Ukraine, noting that Kiev relies on diesel fuel supplies from Slovakia. According to a letter shared by Hungarian officials, US President Donald Trump also expressed frustration over the attacks, saying he was “very angry” about them. Moscow has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.</p>

BERLIN, August 28. /TASS/. The German government has no "final opinion" regarding the possibility of expropriating frozen Russian assets, Foreign Minister of Germany Johann Wadephul said at a press conference.

The possibility of using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine will be discussed at the forthcoming informal meetings of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen on August 29-30. "This will be one of the items for discussion at the informal ministerial meeting in Copenhagen. There is a need to shed the light on difficult legal issues and implications for the financial market stability," Wadephul said.

The EU is already expropriating revenues from refinancing of illegally frozen Russian assets, the minister noted. "We will continue discussions," he added.

The greater portion of immobilized Russian assets, slightly more than 200 bln euro, is blocked with the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The depository repeated spoke against the expropriation of assets, cautioning that it may entail the seizure of European or Belgian assets by Russia through courts in other parts of the globe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing to keep her job on the board, which helps set interest rates, after President Donald Trump said he was removing her from her role earlier this week. Cook's lawsuit, filed Thursday morning in federal court in Washington, DC, asks for a judge to rule that Trump's attempt to remove her is unlawful and that she remains an active member of the Federal Reserve. The White House, however, said that Trump's firing of cook was lawful. “The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Thursday. Trump's firing of Fed's Lisa Cook tests Supreme Court's limits on presidential power Cook is claiming in her lawsuit that Trump's abrupt firing of her violated her due process rights under both the Constitution and federal law, which she says include receiving proper notice of her alleged wrongdoing and a hearing through which she can respond to the allegations. “This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook's Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven.” She also argues that Trump is attempting to redefine the meaning of “cause” in a way that would allow him to fire any board member “with whom he disagrees about policy based on chalked up allegations.” “President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally redefine ‘cause' – completely unmoored to caselaw, history, and tradition – and conclude, without evidence, that he has found it,” her attorneys wrote. On Monday, Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire the central bank official. The letter cited accusations of mortgage fraud first raised by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence. The Trump administration has said it is investigating other perceived political opponents of the president for alleged mortgage fraud, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff of California. The Justice Department has said it plans to investigate Pulte's allegations. Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Cook is also asking the court to declare that “an unsubstantiated allegation of mortgage fraud prior to a Governor's confirmation is not cause for removal” under federal law. Cook's situation may be legally complicated around her dismissal, given Trump's belief he can fire her for cause even if allegations are unproven and an investigation isn't complete. The 24-page complaint, filed at a federal court in Washington, DC, accuses Trump of using fraud allegations in an attempt to end-run federal law intended to protect her from such interference by the president. ‘It's a genie you can't put back in the bottle': Economist on Trump targeting Federal Reserve's independence “This is a big case,” said Jane Manners, an associate professor at Fordham School of Law who researches presidential power. The majority conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed Trump to fire leadership of independent government agencies this year. A court would have the power to say whether Cook can continue serving in her role now or must step aside until the legal proceedings are resolved in a fuller way later. The Fed said in a statement on Tuesday it will abide by a court's decision in Cook's challenge of her attempted firing. “Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,” the Fed said. The president has the power to fire any Fed governor for cause, but it's unclear whether unproven allegations meet that threshold. If Cook is allowed to remain a Fed governor, without any restrictions, she'll be able to vote at the Fed's upcoming September 16-17 meeting. Cook hasn't publicly spoken about the economy since Pulte raised accusations of mortgage fraud against her. She said that the weak streak of job growth in recent months was “concerning” and that the labor market could be at a turning point. This story has been updated with additional developments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia attacked a Ukrainian Navy vessel, killing one crew member and injuring several others, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 28. Simferopol is a Ukrainian Navy reconnaissance ship of the Laguna-class. It was launched in 2019 and officially joined the fleet two years later. The vessel is designed for radio, electronic, radar, and optical reconnaissance, and was armed with a 30 mm AK-306 artillery system. While Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, reports of Ukrainian naval losses are extremely rare. Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has targeted multiple civilian vessels in the Black Sea, including foreign ones. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The Aug. 28 call came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial strike on Ukrainian cities overnight. This marks the first time a vessel carrying fuel from the blacklisted facility has entered a Chinese import terminal. Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker. "This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves." "No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T reported a higher third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates but also booked restructuring charges as the bank works to shore up deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls and adjust to a cap on U.S. retail assets imposed by regulators. TD earned profit of $3.34-billion, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31. That compared with a quarterly loss in the same quarter last year after U.S. regulators hit the bank with a US$3-billion fine over serious lapses in its programs to prevent money laundering. Adjusted to exclude that one-time charge, TD said it earned $2.20 per share, which was higher than the $2.05 consensus estimate among analysts. The quarterly earnings were affected by $262-million incurred from TD's moves to restructure its U.S. balance sheet, which has included selling loans to stay under the regulatory asset cap. A bright spot in TD's third-quarter results was its Canadian retail banking division, which reported profit of $1.95-billion, up 4 per cent from last year. Profit from U.S. retail banking was $760-million, compared with a loss in the same quarter last year. Wealth management and insurance profit was $703-million, up 63 per cent from a year ago. “We are well positioned to build on this momentum as we compete, grow and build our bank for the future,” chief executive officer Ray Chun said in a statement. TD set aside $971-million in provisions for credit losses, or money earmarked to cover loans that may default. TD's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its resilience in times of stress, is 14.8 per cent. Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that TD earned profit of $3.37-billion in the third quarter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional comments from Ukrainian and Hungarian officials. In recent weeks, Ukraine carried out at least three attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily disrupting operations. "Ukraine knows very well that the Druzhba pipeline is vital for Hungary's and Slovakia's energy supply, and that such strikes harm us far more than Russia," Szijjarto said on X. Brovdi dismissed Budapest's decision and said the Hungarian leadership shares responsibility for Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities by "filling their own dirty pockets with sanctioned cheap raw materials." "I am Ukrainian, and I will arrive in my father's homeland after you," the commander said on his Telegram channel. "There are enough true Hungarians in Hungary, and one day, they will be sick to death of you." In his statement, Szijjarto made no mention of the Russian overnight mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv on Aug. 28, which killed at least 18 people, including four children, and injured almost 40 others. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Budapest "is on the wrong side of history." "Peter, if the Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed by Russia this morning, this is moral decay," he wrote on X. "If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to clarify the issue and "respond accordingly." Kyiv regularly carries out attacks on military and industrial facilities in Russia, targeting Russian oil infrastructure to undermine Moscow's revenue streams and weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine.

European and U.S. military officials have been increasingly concerned over the flights in the German state of Thuringia, even as Russian sabotage operations in Europe declined in 2025, the New York Times reported. Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) hit a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Susan Monarez ousted ahead of announcement that could link immunisations with autism The chief of America's top public health agency is refusing to quit after she reportedly clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr over vaccine policy. Lawyers for Dr Susan Monarez have said she can only be fired directly by Donald Trump himself, even though the White House on Wednesday said she had been kicked out. Four other senior scientists also quit the agency, reportedly in apparent frustration at Mr Kennedy's leadership and sceptical stance on vaccines. Sources told CNN that Dr Monarez had clashed with Mr Kennedy over vaccine policies, including an upcoming announcement that could draw links between immunisations and autism. Mr Kennedy Jr's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Dr Monarez was “no longer” director, less than a month after her senate confirmation. “The attack on Dr Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” it said. The White House late on Wednesday announced that she had been fired. Kush Desai, the White House's deputy press secretary, said Dr Monarez was not “aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again”. Because she had “refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC”, he added. Dr Monarez refused to back down however, with her lawyer, Mark Zaid, saying: “As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her. We have notified the White House counsel of our position.” Dr Monarez said during her confirmation hearing that she had not seen evidence of such a link. In June, Mr Kennedy Jr dismissed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations. The CDC has also been targeted for hefty budget cuts as part of Donald Trump's campaign to cut back federal spending.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside. Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. O'Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation. “This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school. It's little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon. Pope Leo XIV, who is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured in the “terrible tragedy”. Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian.

As police continue to search for a potential motive, O'Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter's devices. “Everything that we've seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC's Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O'Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing. At a briefing, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. Later, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activists and supporters of publisher Jimmy Lai gather for the national security trial in Taipei, Taiwan, on Aug. 24.ChiangYing-ying/The Associated Press The case against Hong Kong newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai is “detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis” and rife with “Orwellian Doublespeak,” his lawyers said in their closing submission, as Mr. Lai's marathon national security trial wrapped up this week. Mr. Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 amid a crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, after months of often-violent protests the year before prompted Beijing to impose a draconian national security law on the semi-autonomous territory. Since then, he has spent more than 1,600 days in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, and almost two months testifying on the stand, as prosecutors sought to paint him as a key instigator of the 2019 protests and a nefarious agent of the West. It is not wrong to support human rights,” said barrister Robert Pang. Opinion: As the democratic world lines up behind Jimmy Lai, Canadian leadership is badly needed Founded in 1995, two years before Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, Apple Daily was by far the territory's most-popular tabloid before it was closed down in 2021. At its best a muckraking investigative outlet that pulled few punches, at its worst a celebrity and scandal-focused pioneer of paparazzi snooping, Apple Daily was always a strident advocate for greater democracy in Hong Kong, cheering on multiple protest movements and holding China's government to account for promises it made in assuming control over the former British colony. Hong Kong pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai was provided with medication and a heart monitor for the start of his final submissions in a landmark national security trial, following health concerns over heart palpitations. Mr. Lai's son Sebastien has said he fully expects his father to be found guilty, and his focus is on securing some kind of compassionate release after conviction. The younger Mr. Lai has been lobbying Western governments to take up Jimmy Lai's case, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who this month promised Washington would “do everything we can” to help, even potentially raising his case with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. And yet, going on court proceedings alone, Mr. Lai's conviction could feel like less than a done deal. The national security law is not retroactive, and prosecutors have struggled to make their case that an alleged conspiracy by Mr. Lai and others to lobby for international sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials – a crime now but not before July, 2020 – continued beyond the legislation being enacted. “Its allegations keep getting wilder, detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis. Prosecutor Anthony Chau argued last week that Mr. Lai had an “unwavering intent” to solicit sanctions through collaborations with foreign officials that were “long-term and persistent,” and extended beyond the passage of the national security law. The panel of three judges overseeing the case, all hand-picked by Hong Kong leader John Lee to handle national security trials, have at times seemed skeptical of the prosecution's case, though they have also forcefully challenged Mr. Pang on several occasions. Last Friday, Justice Esther Toh pointed to recent arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States and Britain to dismiss Mr. Pang's assertion that Mr. Lai's criticisms of China were legally protected speech, arguing all countries had limits on what could be said. As well as the national security charges, which carry a potential life sentence, Mr. Lai is also accused of breaching a colonial-era sedition law – in force since 1938 – which has been resurrected and widely used by prosecutors since the 2019 protests. Serious questions have been raised about Mr. Lai's health after his long incarceration, and proceedings were delayed earlier this month so he could be fitted with a heart monitor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he cowered in terror away from the gunfire, his friend Victor lay across him. Monday had been the first day back at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy neighbourhood about 5 miles south of downtown Minneapolis. But as the children took their seats, just before 8.30am (2.30pm UK) on Wednesday, transgender shooter Robin Westman was stalking the building outside. Dressed in black and camouflage and armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun, Westman barricaded church doors with wooden planks before firing his rifle at the children through the side of the building, their heads bent in prayer. Another 14 children aged six to 15 were injured, two critically. Among those rushed to hospital, where medics frantically moved patients out of rooms to make way for the victims, was Victor, who Weston says he thinks is “okay”. While officers had still not confirmed the number of bullets fired during Westman's rampage, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the number of rounds was “in the dozens”. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Mr O'Hara said. “Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “It was an automatic gun and I was near kids and we all got down,” Ms Mertens told NBC News. “He was just a normal, every day beat cop. No special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,” Mr McAdaragh said. After carrying out his twisted attack, Westman shot himself dead in the car park, according to the Minneapolis police chief. Officers found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. Before going on his killing spree, Westman had posted a series of YouTube videos showcasing his manifesto and large arsenal of weapons. Westman's mother Mary is believed to be a retired employee of the school. In one video, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun, and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over Westman's bed. Many of the first responders were “deeply traumatised by what they saw”, Mr O'Hara said. Hours later, terrified parents stood outside the reunification area, waiting for information about their children. Amid a crowd of heavy law enforcement later that morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school. Tearful students from neighbouring high schools that had been on lockdown began arriving in search of news about their friends and siblings who had been inside the church. Those who were reunited with their loved ones embraced their children before rushing them away from the scene. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senator, said one of her staff members' children had to tell her friend's father his daughter had been struck. “These kids are doing an all-school Mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot — one in the back, one in the neck,” Ms Klobuchar told MSNBC. “And they all got down under the pews and she, her daughter, of course, was not shot, but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.” “It's a neighbourhood where people come together”, she said. And those innocent children, they don't deserve to die like that”, she said. My heart goes out to the parents and those innocent kids.” “I don't know where He is,” Mr Simpson said.</p>
