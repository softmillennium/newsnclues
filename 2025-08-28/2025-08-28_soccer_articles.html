                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I spent the earlier part of this week living under the stars, in a tent deep inside Yellowstone National Park, with only a patchy cellphone signal, no internet or television. You have time to break free from the constant demands of everyday life, to refocus and renew before re-emerging with fresh energy. But when I came out of the retreat and saw Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the upcoming games against South Korea and Japan, I wondered for half a second if I wasn't now living in an alternative reality. Almost half of Pochettino's 23-man squad is made up of players from Major League Soccer ,as he continues to experiment with new players while the likes of Weston McKennie at Juventus, Johnny Cardoso of Atlético Madrid, Yunus Musah at AC Milan and Tanner Tessmann at Lyon have been left out. Of course, there is always room for bringing in a form player or two or trying out alternative options and testing the depth of his roster. And there is some validity in Pochettino's likely goals here – broadening the pool, lighting a fire under those excluded and perhaps giving European-based players the chance to focus on their club situations for now. But the benefits of a player being allowed to stay with a European club are limited when you remember that during the international break, large numbers of the first-team squad at clubs like Milan, Juve and Atlético, are away with their national teams anyway, weakening the significance of those training sessions, which are mainly for reserves and other non-internationals. Two things really concern me about this roster. With no qualifying games, these friendlies should be treated as seriously as possible, to get the squad truly competitive encounters – to test them and help them grow. As we saw with the debacle of June's 4-0 crushing by Switzerland in Nashville, if the opposition is high-level and comes in motivated, the outcome for an experimental team can be ugly. There is already a worrying lack of enthusiasm bordering on apathy in the USMNT's fan base at a time when positivity and optimism should be growing in anticipation of this huge moment in American soccer. I don't even want to think about what the impact would be of another heavy loss at home. Secondly, while the time for ‘sending messages' should be over by now, I also worry about exactly what kind of message Pochettino is sending by his selection of MLS players who few people, if any, were clamoring for. When I played for the national team under Bob Bradley, there was an unwritten rule for emerging American MLS talent. It led people like me to turn down, after college, a Generation Adidas contract with MLS and head to Europe. It's not easy as an American walking into a European locker-room, proving yourself, earning a starting place and keeping it. It meant the national team coach got players who had been forged by that experience, hardened and sharpened. It also gave players in MLS something to aim for. You might be performing well enough for your club, but were you playing well enough to attract the attention of European scouts? With all due respect, have the likes of Roman Celentano, Tristan Blackmon, Nathan Harriel and Sean Zawadzki really been performing at such a consistently high-level in MLS that they simply could not be ignored? Have they really thrust themselves into contention for World Cup places? Even if you were looking to MLS-based players, it is surprising that some of these new faces are being picked ahead of the likes of Djordje Mihailovic (11 caps), DeJuan Jones (10 caps) and Chicago's exciting talent Brian Gutierrez (two caps). When I see a player like Paxton Aaronson, who after trying to make it at Eintracht Frankfurt took on the challenge of a loan spell at Utrecht and earned a starting place at a top-four club in the Dutch league, take a move back to MLS, it leaves me thinking the players have understood that under Pochettino you'd actually be better off in MLS. But what other conclusion could we draw from the fact that a promising player like Aidan Morris, who was rightly called up due to his excellent form with the Columbus Crew, is now ignored despite being a regular in the highly competitive Championship with Middlesbrough? Morris won two MLS Cups with the Crew before, at the age of 22, going to play for then-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick, a great coach to learn from, given he played in Morris's midfield role. Morris could now be forgiven for thinking that he would have been better off, from a national team perspective, staying with the Crew, never having to worry about losing his place, never having to push himself, under pressure, every week in the grind of that league. If the aim is to give players in new club environments space to settle, then why call up Tim Weah? He is in his first season with Marseille, adapting to a new system under Roberto De Zerbi and new teammates, and yet he is (deservedly) included in the roster. And he should be, because Weah is a vital piece of the U.S. puzzle. His speed, quickness, timing, 1-v-1 ability, two-way commitment and World Cup experience (including scoring against Wales in Qatar) make him unique in this group. The reality is that outside of him, the USMNT simply doesn't have another wide player with that blend of qualities. His inclusion underscores just how inconsistent the logic is when other Europe-based players in similar or even stronger club situations are left behind. That is a relief, but I think not going with a full-strength squad for these games is another missed opportunity for the coach and the team. Thankfully, Christian Pulisic is on the roster, and I really hope that he and everyone else can now put this summer's unpleasant conflict behind them. No one blinked an eye when it was announced that Musah was missing the Gold Cup for ‘personal reasons,' and few would have objected if Christian's absence was put down to muscle fatigue or a minor injury. I'll never understand why it was instead described by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker as the player asking to “step back” this summer due to the volume of games. The whole thing could have been avoided with different language. Christian had a new coach coming in at AC Milan and it was important for him to be at the Milanello training ground fresh and ready to go on day one of preseason and not coming in late or tired from the Gold Cup and playing catch-up ahead of the new season. He's central to World Cup hopes, and whatever people think of his decision this summer, it is time to put it behind us and get behind our best player. Just as it's time for Pochettino to get behind his best players, period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Partly to mostly cloudy skies overnight; a spotty shower late at night in the Poconos or far North Jersey. Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi controls the ball during the second half of a Leagues Cup semifinal soccer match against Orlando City, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Lionel Messi has not yet announced when he plans to retire, but he knows that next week's match against Venezuela could be his last one playing at home in a World Cup qualifier with Argentina's national team. “It's going to be a very, very special match for me because it's the last qualifying match,” the 38-year-old Messi said Wednesday night after Inter Miami progressed to the Leagues Cup final by beating Orlando City. Argentina, with a spot already secured in next year's World Cup, will host Venezuela next Thursday at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires for the penultimate round of South American qualifiers. Its last match will be at Ecuador on Sept. 9. Messi has hinted that he will retire from the national team after next year's World Cup, where Argentina is going to defend the title they won in Qatar 2022. Following Messi's statements, CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, wrote on social media that “the last dance is coming,” with a picture of Messi in an Argentina shirt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea will welcome Barcelona to Stamford Bridge in the league phase of the Champions League, while Arsenal host Bayern Munich. As was the case last season, all 36 teams in the competition will compete in one big league and each play eight fixtures. Chelsea have a trip to Bayern Munich to look forward, but the standout fixture for the Blues is a home clash against Barcelona. Alongside those two fixtures, there will be a reunion with former boss Antonio Conte when they travel to take on Napoli. Tottenham, meanwhile, are back at Europe's top table and take on holders Paris Saint-Germain, who were fortunate to beat them in the UEFA Super Cup earlier this month. They travel to take on Eintracht Frankfurt, beaten on the way to Europa League glory last season, as well as Bodo/Glimt, who Spurs saw off in the semi-finals of that run. Liverpool face another heavyweight showdown with Real Madrid, in what is a swift return to Anfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Manchester City will be at the Bernabeu to take on the 15-time champions, while they host Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and Galatasaray. The Magpies have tricky away trips, including against PSG, Leverkusen and Marseille, while Barcelona will be hosted at St James' Park. Exact order of the games and kick-off times still TBC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could Folarin Balogun deliver for the United States in September? That'll be top of mind as the U.S. Men's National Team gears up to face Korea Republic and Japan in the September FIFA window. This window and the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup also give Balogun a chance to answer another question: Can he stay healthy? He last competed with the National Team in September 2024, just as Pochettino was hired. However, this isn't Balogun's first call-up under the head coach. Balogun was one of five forwards selected to the roster for June camp, but he sustained an ankle injury before reporting for National Team duty. This will give Pochettino a chance to evaluate the 24-year-old forward more thoroughly. Though, the forward has proven to be efficient for both club and country. Balogun has racked up five goals in 17 caps with the USMNT. On the club side, he recorded four goals in 16 appearances for AS Monaco last season. Josh Sargent, Damion Downs and Tim Weah are forwards on this September roster who have played the No. This September camp gives Pochettino a chance to look at several different players as decisions for the upcoming World Cup roster need to be made.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before there was a chance for any controversy to emerge surrounding Folarin Balogun's omission from Mauricio Pochettino's latest U.S. men's national team (USMNT) roster, the Monaco forward was belatedly called up. Balogun earned his chance to face South Korea and Japan in a series of friendlies after Vancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White pulled out through injury. The 29-year-old sustained a hamstring strain during last weekend's victory over St. Louis, creating a gap in the roster which many already expected to be filled by Balogun. After getting back on the pitch in spring, Balogun was initially included in this summer's Gold Cup roster only for an ankle injury to force him out. Balogun's most recent international appearance came back in September 2024, before Pochettino's reign even began. The 24-year-old had previously been considered to be USMNT's first-choice No. 9 and will be competing for a starting spot in September with Southampton's Damion Downs and Norwich City frontman Josh Sargent. The top flight of North American soccer is widely considered to be inferior to Europe's elite divisions, yet the Argentine coach offered an impassioned counter-view at his squad announcement. “We need to give MLS the value, because I think competing there, I think players can show that they can perform in the national team,” Pochettino told assembled media this week. Because sometimes MLS, under my assessment, maybe is more competitive than some leagues in Europe.” Grey Whitebloom is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This marks the Italian coach's second international break in charge, and he has named an exciting squad. Brazil will play at the FIFA 2026 World Cup next summer, but Ancelotti's job is to make this group a contender for the title, not just a participant. However, the young full-back has huge potential and keeps improving at club level. Since that tricky night in Buenos Aires, Wesley has performed incredibly for Flamengo in Brazil, earning a $29 million move to Italian Serie A outfit Roma. Kaio Jorge is the top scorer in the Brazilian league so far this season and he is leading a title charge for his club. The forward has notched 15 goals and five assists in 20 league matches. Jorge has been a revelation in domestic football this year and will likely be rewarded with his first ever minutes for Brazil on the international stage. Jorge probably won't start ahead of the likes of Chelsea's João Pedro or Tottenham's Richarlison, but given that Ancelotti wants to experiment with his team, the boss will surely give the Cruzeiro star a chance to prove his worth. Jorge will have to take every chance he gets if he wants to keep a spot in the national team. Estêvão enjoyed a short cameo in Chelsea's first Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace. The winger then registered an assist against West Ham on matchday two. The kid who shone in Brazil for Palmeiras, and impressed against Chelsea at the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the summer, is showing his quality faster than many expected. Just a couple of weeks into the season fans can expect 18 year-old Estêvão to play regular football for Chelsea and Ancelotti's Brazil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to PreCrime Labs, the threat research team at BforeAI, a cybersecurity company specializing in proactive threat prevention, many domains used this year have already been registered for the FIFA World Cup 2026. “This highlights two key tactics used by attackers: they either repurpose old domains for new campaigns or register new ones well in advance,” said the researchers. “By ‘aging' these domains for a year or more, attackers can better avoid detection and improve their success rates as the event nears. We even discovered domains registered for the FIFA tournaments in 2030 and 2034.” In their report, PreCrime says it has analyzed a set of 498 domains that contain FIFA, football (soccer), and World Cup-related brand terms (e.g., “worldcup,” “fifa,” “football”). This is a common trend observed around mega sporting events, where adversaries abuse trending keywords to maximize search visibility and social media spread. The page content is in Mandarin Chinese, but FIFA and official broadcasters don't actually use such channels for promotions. Prominent use of celebrity pictures and “official partner” keywords are used to establish legitimacy, which is not verifiable with FIFA's actual sponsor list. Claims like “ 巴 西 圣 保 罗 ” (Brazil São Paulo official partner) are used, but in Mandarin, to enhance credibility. In fact, the campaign obviously aims to collect personally identifiable information through a B2B phishing scheme. Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. In this case, fake branding elements, especially those of payment partners (VISA), flags, and FIFA logo lookalikes, were strategically added to the domains. Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. Major events tournaments such as global soccer events or huge concert tours predictably trigger spikes in fraud infrastructure: fake ticketing, counterfeit merchandise, unlawful streaming, betting lures, and generic “fan guide” pages used as lead-gen or phishing launchpads. Cybernews researchers have discovered severe misconfigurations affecting two Tencent sites, exposing sensitive credentials and internal source code. The critical flaws could potentially grant full access to internal services and backend infrastructure within Tencent Cloud.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arsenal and USWNT defender Emily Fox admits she was surprised to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or. The NWSL's transfer window is officially closed, and for the second straight time, it involved a world-record deal -- this time for an incoming player. Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle moved from Tigres to the Orlando Pride last week and set the new women's global transfer record at $1.5 million, per ESPN sources. But there have been several other high-profile transfers involving NWSL players and some U.S. women's national team hopefuls, too. Outgoing transfers and intra-league trades can still take place, but the transfer window is now closed for new summer arrivals in the NWSL. Let's grade them and dig into what these moves mean for the future. - How women's transfer record skyrocketed with Ovalle move - NWSL Power Rankings: Orlando Pride are officially in a slump - USWNT debutants ranked: All 24 players with first caps under Hayes Her move to the NWSL in her prime at 25 years old will give her a global platform to showcase those skills and, if all goes to plan, fully insert herself into the conversation as one of the world's best. Alexis Nunes and Ali Krieger discuss the potential record signing of Lizbeth Ovalle to Orlando Pride. She'll have at least a few months (if not more) to play alongside six-time World Player of the Year Marta. The recent season-ending injury to Barbra Banda also means that Ovalle will be needed even more immediately if the Pride want to repeat. To be there and to be a prominent player for United States coach Emma Hayes (who signed her at Chelsea), Fishel needs more consistent reps as a bona-fide starting forward for her club. That is what Seattle expects from her, evidenced by an NWSL record cumulative salary and that should play out in the long term. She has played limited minutes off the bench in three games for Seattle. There are valid short-term questions about how Sentnor fits into an already stacked Kansas City roster. Sentnor was the focal point and franchise player in Utah; in Kansas City, she is not a guaranteed starter, as talented as she is. Alexis Nunes is joined on Futbol W by Emily Keogh to discuss the rise of Utah Royals' Ally Sentnor. But this move is about the future for a 21-year-old rising star -- which is why Kansas City paid an intra-league record $600,000 (plus potential add-ons) to sign her. Sentnor will be coached by Vlatko Andonovski, arguably the NWSL's most successful coach and a former USWNT coach who knows what is needed in that environment. Watt became the first signing for 2026 NWSL expansion team Denver Summit FC, which is a nice touch of history for the Colorado native. She's also an important part of the Pride's push to repeat as NWSL champions. Watt is exactly the type of player NWSL expansion teams need to establish success. Yes, there are likely more splashy signings to come, but Watt is a hard worker who contributes offensively with dynamic wing play, and she brings championship, veteran experience to Denver. And can establish herself as an early leader at the club. On one hand, Sanchez is a loss for San Diego and the NWSL. The reality, however, is that Sanchez was fighting for minutes on an overhauled Wave roster being guided by a new head coach in Jonas Eidevall. Sanchez started in only three of her last eight games for the Wave before making the move back to Tigres, where she played earlier in her career. Sanchez already has five goals for Tigres, which is among the league leaders. That's all a net positive for her, even if she has moved around a fair amount to end up back at Estadio Universitario. Cantore joined the Spirit from Juventus after a strong showing with Italy at Euro 2025, which further boosted her celebrity, and has settled into life in Washington nicely, already after scoring in her second NWSL appearance. The 25-year-old fills a void on a Spirit team that has dealt with endless injuries or other absences, including at the forward position, and combines well with her new teammates, as she showed again in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bay FC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer's governing body is spending millions on out-of-home advertising for the 2026 World Cup before a ball has even been kicked. That early push signals how global live events are becoming OOH's new frontier. It is an early signal of how the governing body intends to use public space to build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup, now less than a year away. Anna Bager, president and chief executive of the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA), framed it this way in the group's latest report: OOH “mirrors the cultural and social moments that shape how people spend their time and is where brands show up to connect with audiences at scale.” For Fifa, that connection starts now. Recent tournaments show how OOH becomes indispensable during shared cultural moments. At Euro 2024, brands spent more than €313m on OOH campaigns across Europe's biggest markets, turning fan zones and city squares into branded stages. Beyond static signage, activations included live score updates on digital screens, creative that shifted with match outcomes and branded experiences embedded directly into public viewing areas. These executions helped transform city centers into extensions of the stadium experience. Programmatic buying now allows advertisers to adjust messaging in real time, align creative with match results and target audiences by location or context. The flexibility of digital formats means campaigns can scale quickly while remaining responsive to the highs and lows of live sport, something static placements cannot achieve on their own. This evolution highlights why OOH has become one of the most engaging channels for fans during major events. Stadium crowds and fan festivals are not just gatherings of spectators; they are cultural canvases where brands can establish visibility and presence at scale. Financial services, communications, and real estate brands were among the fastest-growing categories. Tech and direct-to-consumer companies made up more than a quarter of the top 100 OOH advertisers, with names such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon leading the way. Fifa's heavy spend puts it in line with those top-tier players but also highlights the unique role of live sport. From city-center fan festivals to screens outside stadiums, out-of-home gives the World Cup a physical presence months before kickoff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City. Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium. There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence. "These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial." It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game. "We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this," Douglas said. There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners. The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup. "We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area," Douglas said. "We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have." Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest. Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport. FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England face Andorra at Villa Park and Serbia away in World Cup qualifiers; John Stones, Phil Foden, Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw among familiar faces available again after June defeat to Senegal; Jack Grealish, Mason Mount will hope for call, as well as U21 stars such as Adam Wharton Thomas Tuchel will be without key players Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham when he names his squad for September's World Cup qualifiers but familiar faces will be pushing for a recall as preparations for next summer ramp up. The June camp ended in embarrassment for Tuchel and England, with the team soundly beaten by Senegal after an underwhelming 1-0 win away to Andorra. England's squad announcement takes place at 2pm on Friday - follow it on Sky Sports News and the Sky Sports website and App. This will be his most substantial block of training and game time with his squad before the tournament - assuming England complete what now looks like a straightforward qualification - and also a period where players will be aiming to carve out clear roles in the head coach's plans. It is significant, then, that of players who missed the previous squad, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Marc Guehi, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden are fit and available. Jack Grealish will also hope his two assists for Everton at the weekend will help to nudge him back into the frame. His inclusion or absence will be a major talking point either way. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mason Mount may feel his prospects of adding to his 36 caps are on the rise after his involvement for Manchester United this term and the long chat he had with Tuchel after the opening-weekend defeat to Arsenal. Interestingly, Myles Lewis-Skelly, who had come in at left-back for England, has begun both Arsenal games on the bench. Djed Spence, meanwhile, has helped Tottenham make a fast start with his performances at left-back. But will Delap dislodge surprise summer pick Ivan Toney? Dominic Solanke will also be waiting on a recall after being omitted in June, despite helping Tottenham to a Europa League success. Kobbie Mainoo's lack of game time at Manchester United will surely count against a player once seen set to become an important figure in the middle of the park for his country. James Maddison certainly won't be involved, given his injury lay-off, while Levi Colwill is another out for the long term. It also looks probable Ben White's international absence will continue, with the right-back - who finally made himself available for selection again in the summer - missing Arsenal's game last weekend with injury. Conor Gallagher - a favourite of Tuchel's at Chelsea - has played just over an hour's worth of football so far this season for Atletico Madrid. Aaron Ramsdale has since moved to Newcastle but is currently behind compatriot Nick Pope in the club pecking order. Tuchel has thrown those up in each squad he has named so far - but the expectation is that a clearer idea of his primary World Cup contenders will emerge with his selections this week. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The 15-year-old winger has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games. But for that to happen, because he is still a minor, it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal. His development will be carefully managed - by club and country. His team-mate Ethan Nwanieri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21s in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness. He went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's side as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches. The feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken. Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: "There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life. However, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1 2026. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal. Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite. Rather concerningly, this is an injury that Palmer has been carrying for some time, which means it may well have been exacerbated by Chelsea going all the way at the Club World Cup and the scaled-back pre-season that followed, with the gruelling summer tournament only reaching its conclusion in mid-July. We will see if it's something important or not. He tried tonight, but it was not very good." Palmer was underwent a scan on Tuesday, although it remains to be seen when the results of those tests will be revealed with Chelsea not due to play again until Saturday lunchtime when they host neighbours Fulham, by which time eight days will have passed since he pulled out of the West Ham clash. According to Chelsea reporter Si Phillips, the attacker could be sidelined for up to six weeks, although there is optimism that his layoff will be shorter and that he might even be available immediately after the upcoming pause for World Cup qualifying action. Although England almost certainly won't have Palmer at their disposal, Chelsea will consider the international break to be well-timed as their players prepare to disperse after the Fulham game. However, their key man could still miss Premier League clashes against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton in September, while the Blues will be desperate to have him available for the visit of champions Liverpool on Saturday, October 4, in just under six weeks' time. Whatever the result of the scan, this injury is a crushing blow for Chelsea at such an early stage of a season that had offered renewed hope. It's common knowledge that Palmer has been a revelation since joining the Blues less than two years ago, emerging as a creative and goal-scoring force, but his durability is an underrated attribute. Since his arrival from Manchester City, you can count the number of games he has missed at club level on one hand; in 2023-24 he only missed the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal through illness, and there was some strange symmetry last season as he sat out the same fixture due to a hamstring problem. His international record is strangely more patchy; after being sidelined for two England games following the defeat at the Emirates in March, Palmer has only featured in three of his country's last 10 games, having withdrawn from two squads during Lee Carsley's interim reign following Euro 2024, and he is now set to miss another camp. The attacker's club might think the international break comes at a good time, but this could still be his longest absence since joining Chelsea, and his most significant since a serious foot injury he suffered during his time at City in 2022. There is little doubt that this is an injury that Palmer could have avoided or would have been less severe if it wasn't for Chelsea's run to unexpected glory at the Club World Cup, where the 23-year-old was their hero once again as he dismantled European champions Paris Saint-Germain almost singlehandedly in the final. Ironically, it was a performance that led to much of the optimism around Stamford Bridge at the start of the new season, which has now been diminished in light of Palmer's setback. It is believed that this groin problem flared up at some point during the tournament, where matches were invariably played in excruciating and physically draining heat and humidity. It's easy to forget that he was involved in the completely misguided post-season England camp in June, too, needlessly playing in what should have been a routine win over Andorra before warming the bench against Senegal. In normal circumstances, Palmer would have had ample time in pre-season to recover, but going all the way at the Club World Cup has come at a cost. After the final on July 13, the squad was afforded just three weeks off before reporting back for training in early August as part of their scaled-back warm-up plans, with Palmer playing more than 100 minutes across their two friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan on the same weekend when, evidently, he wasn't fully fit. Inevitably, Palmer's imminent absence has led to scepticism over how Maresca's men will handle their upcoming games. Speaking before the West Ham clash, Sky Sports pundit and Chelsea fan Paul Merson said: "If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea. The ex-Arsenal man continued: "It's not just all on Palmer because the coach has to come up with solutions, too. Nevertheless, it was a victory that led Maresca to effuse that Chelsea are not the one-man team that some of their detractors believe them to be, as his side delivered a cohesive performance despite the absence of their lynchpin, with five different names on the scoresheet. "The ones that say we are 'just a Cole team', for sure Cole is our best player no doubt," the Italian said. "For sure with Cole we are (a) much better team, but I think we already showed last year in the two or three months where Cole was not 100%, when we achieved top four that no one expected." And in fairness, if this injury is a precursor to Palmer being unavailable or ineffective more often, then the contributions of Estevao Willian and Joao Pedro in particular will be very encouraging. Behind the scenes, Chelsea may well be working on a more permanent solution. However, it seems his arrival will be contingent on outgoings. Meanwhile, Barcelona's Fermin Lopez is the latest creative player to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge as the Blues look to capitalise on a bloated midfield in Catalunya, with talks opened with his representatives and a €50 million (£43m/$58m) offer supposedly lodged. Again, that clearly suggests Chelsea view acquiring cover for their talisman as something of a priority, before it's too late. They might get away with this particular injury being a minor one, but as the fixtures pile up and the season progresses, they risk losing Palmer for a much longer period after a rest-less summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino named a U.S. national team roster for the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan that left out some familiar names and top emerging players. That sparked short-term questions — how will the USA fare against a pair of Asian powers? — and long-term speculation about Pochettino's selection process heading toward the 2026 World Cup. Pochettino helped explain during Tuesday's media call with several key statements. First, he quantified the USMNT player pool and said he was tracking 60-65 players on a weekly basis to monitor their progress. Second, he said this was the last camp with the possibility of bringing in new faces (at least in significant numbers). Third, and most importantly, he addressed the nature of needing roster spots to become more competitive within the squad. In a specific point that addressed the nature of the roster, he said he didn't have “A team” players or “B team” players as the media and fans like to refer to teams. Often this leads to the assumption that only a few players are competing for roster spots while others are “locks” who can take their spots for granted. “We respect and have full respect for all the players who can be called by us,” Pochettino said. If we want to be a team that is really competitive, we cannot nominate 13, 14, 16 players and say for sure these guys will arrive at the World Cup and the rest need to fight for a place. “Come on, that is not the real sport of football. When you see national teams that have won World Cups, you really understand what that means. “Players need to feel the threat from your teammates They need to defend their place every single possibility they have with the national team.” Many fans were critical of the roster. Even giving full respect to a coach of Pochettino's stature, some of the picks were tough to comprehend. But critics of the roster must ask: What, exactly, makes this team exempt from an overhaul? The few new faces that would occasionally emerge would then have a harder time finding their way because the large core would dictate the culture. This camp is about making players work for call-ups, and when they get back into camp, having a new tone. It is sending a message to players. An important takeaway: the players not in camp are just as important as the players who are on this roster. Pochettino wants to see those who were left off respond the way Josh Sargent has (scoring goals in each of Norwich's first four games this season). Pochettino wants to see desperation for call-ups, not players simply assuming they'll be invited. It's not about a few simple tactical adjustments but rather more drastic measures. We don't yet know how the team will look in October. But the players in this camp have a huge opportunity to boost their stock. The players not in this camp simply have to work harder and perform better. Pochettino and his staff are watching their club performances. Pochettino has turned the goalkeeping position on its head. Not since Tim Howard or Brad Guzan were in the picture has the USMNT willingly dropped Matt Turner, Zack Steffen or Ethan Horvath in a FIFA calendar window. Then, on top of that, 2024 Olympic team goalkeeper Patrick Schulte has also been dropped. With Pochettino wanting to look at different options beyond Turner, Freese was given the starting Gold Cup spot when Schulte and Steffen were injured. A bad mistake against Haiti aside, he took advantage of the opportunity. He's now fighting to possibly be a World Cup starter. Enter the code sent to your email.</p>
