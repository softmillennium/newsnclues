'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

See which driver's got the smarts in the final episode of Grill the Grid for 2025.

We like to think our Grill the Grids are pretty fiendish – but our producers really had it in for the F1 drivers with the final round of the series for 2025.

The current field were asked to guess the Grand Prix and the year in which it took place from some pretty opaque descriptions – with each question involving three separate clues, and points on offer from three down to one depending on how many of those clues the drivers required.

It was tricky enough to make Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg plead “help me” to his press officer waiting in the wings – as the drivers' efforts set the final scores for the 2025 Grill the Grid championship.

Hit play on the video above to see who aced the final round of Grill the Grid – and find out which driver was crowned the series champion for 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast. Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue. Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery. A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1. Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid. Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar Piastri remains at the top of the Drivers' Championship ahead of Round 15, but his lead now stands at just nine points from McLaren team mate Lando Norris following the Briton's victory last time out in Hungary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more. With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season. First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31. Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well... “For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop. “The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium. Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far. It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans? Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort. James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented. In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation. It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix. Watch how it all unfolded in the video player below...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will resume their intra-team fight at the upcoming Dutch Grand Prix. Oscar Piastri has taken a moment to reflect on his battle against McLaren team mate Lando Norris this season, with the championship situation finely poised ahead of the decisive 10-round run-in. While there have been some dramatic moments, such as a collision at the Canadian Grand Prix and close calls during wheel-to-wheel scraps in Austria and Hungary, the two drivers have maintained cordial relations. “Our relationship hasn't really changed,” Piastri, who leads Norris by a slender margin of nine points, explained in an interview for the official McLaren website. That is not lost on either of us. Healthy competition is important, of course, but it is important to keep the team united, and I think we both have that in the back of our minds.” Piastri, who is navigating his third season in F1, compared to Norris' seventh, also reflected more generally on how he has dealt with the weight of being in contention for the title. “Obviously, you don't want to give away points, but it has been far too early to be thinking of the season in that way. Looking ahead, though, Piastri admitted: “The pressure is only going to increase from here. While Piastri and Norris' head-to-head looks set to rumble on, McLaren are cruising towards back-to-back Teams' Championship titles for the first time since 1991 – boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari in the standings.</p>
