            Tesla sales plunged again in Europe in July as car buyers continued their migration to Chinese rival BYD.
    


            Elon Musk's carmaker sold 6,600 models in the EU in July, a 42.4% fall from the same month last year, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In the first seven months of 2025, Tesla sold around 77,000 cars in the EU, down from 137,000 in the same period in 2024.
    


            Meanwhile, BYD, the burgeoning, ultra-cheap Chinese electric and plug-in hybrid carmaker, continues to put its stamp on Europe. Sales jumped 206.4% in July against 2024 figures. The 9,698 models BYD sold in July means it is now outselling Tesla.
    


            The plunge – just the latest in a string of sales drops for Musk's once-hot EV maker – underscores the turnabout in Tesla's fortunes. Musk's foray into politics didn't just anger American liberals; his support of far-right parties in Germany and the UK also prompted protests outside Europe. And in Europe and China, Tesla has faced competition from lower-priced offerings from BYD, competition it doesn't have to worry about in the US market.
    


            Wider analysis that includes the UK and countries from the European Free Trade Association, like Norway, Denmark and Sweden, shows a similar sales drop for Tesla (TSLA) alongside a 225% increase for BYD in July.
    


            Through all of 2025, Tesla has still outsold BYD by just under 35,000 models across the EU, the UK and the EFTA.
    


            Sales of Chinese-branded cars are soaring across Europe. BYD in particular has increased its foothold, despite EV imports to the EU facing 27% tariffs following an anti-subsidy investigation by the bloc last year.
    


            BYD still holds a price advantage over rivals including Tesla. Meanwhile, its technological advancements are also helping it pull ahead of competitors.
    


            The group revealed a breakthrough to its battery charging technology in March that it said added 250 miles of range in five minutes, outpacing Tesla's 200 miles in 15 minutes. BYD's “God's Eye,” a rival to Tesla's full-self driving technology, was launched at no extra cost for most of its cars in February.
    


            BYD also holds an advantage over Tesla in its diverse offering of EVs and hybrid vehicles, whereas Tesla only produces EVs. This has helped shield BYD from shifting consumer preferences in Europe.
    


            Research firm Jato Dynamics first reported that BYD had overtaken Tesla's European sales in April.
    


            Tesla is now one of the worst-selling car groups across Europe, ahead of only Honda (HND) and Mitsubishi. The company's struggles on the continent reflect economic, structural and even political shifts that are changing car buyers' preferences.
    


            Electric car sales growth has slowed across Europe in recent years. A reduction in incentives to switch to EVs, concerns over battery life and a lack of charging infrastructure have been blamed in surveys for slower-than-hoped uptake.
    


            The current 15.6% market share that battery-electric vehicles hold in the EU is “still far from where it needs to be at this point in the transition,” the ACEA said.
    


            European buyers are showing a preference for hybrid electric cars, which control more than one-third of Europe's new car market.
    


            Musk's image has taken on a new relevance in Europe in recent years, much in the way it has in the United States.
    


            Following his financing of Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign, Musk turned his attentions to European politics. Musk publicly backed Germany's far-right AfD party in the country's February elections and spoke remotely at the party's campaign launch.
    


            He has also shown extensive support for the UK's far-right reform party and advocated for the prison release of right-wing agitator Tommy Robinson, who was jailed for 18 months last October after admitting to being in contempt of court. Robinson was released on bail in August.
    


            Sparse industry surveys have indicated falling consumer sentiment towards Tesla owing to Musk's behavior. A January survey by Electrifying.com showed 60% of respondents were actively put off buying a Tesla owing to Musk's behavior.
    


            More than 70% of Brits and Germans held an unfavorable view of the Tesla CEO in January in the wake of Musk's political interventions.
    


            CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Design for Impact is a series spotlighting innovative solutions for communities affected by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.



            Before sunrise in Dien Phuong, Vietnam, clay artists set up their workbenches beneath swaying bamboo by the Thu Bon River, shaping ceramic works to the sound of birdsong. Each October, when the river swells with rainwater, workers pause, move their tools and wares away, and only return once the waters recede.
    


            Inspired by the rhythm of the rainy season, Vietnamese architecture firm Tropical Space opened a flood-resistant studio for local artist Le Huc Da, dubbed Terra Cotta Studio, in 2016. Each year, the monsoon waters consume the lower reaches of the striking cube-shaped structure — but rather than sweeping it away, the rising tide flows gently through its perforated brick walls. The studio's lattice-brick design also harnesses airflow and shade to withstand central Vietnam's unforgiving climate.
    


            In 2023, the architects expanded the project with Terra Cotta Workshop, a neighboring facility featuring studio space for other local artists, as well as a large kiln and visitor center. Inside, artisans store their work on 6.5-foot‑high platforms, above the highest flood levels seen in the village this century. The workshops' electric wiring was installed three feet above the ground, and equipment can be moved safely to high shelves during monsoons.
    


            “We did not design the structure to resist or oppose the water,” Tropical Space's co-founder, Nguyen Hai Long, said of the original studio building in an email interview. “Instead, it stands there and quietly observes the rise and fall of the river.”
    


            Nguyen is part of a new generation of architects in the country, turning to local materials and time-honored building techniques — not only the distinctive brickwork but also stilted foundations and floating bamboo platforms — as enduring tools of climate resilience. He said the designs of Terra Cotta Studio and Workshop were influenced by the region's traditional merchants' houses, which often survived seasonal floods thanks to their perforated walls.
    


            “If we live in harmony with the natural order, we recognize both its limits and its gifts,” Nguyen said. Floods, he added, bring not just destruction but also more fertile land and raw materials. “Without a deep connection to the land, we might miss nature's anger, its joy or its subtle changes.”
    


            With over 2,000 miles of coastline and low‑lying river deltas, Vietnam is consistently ranked among the world's most climate‑vulnerable nations.
    


            The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery says that more than 70% of the country's population faces regular exposure to “natural hazards” including typhoons, floods and salt‑water intrusion. In 2020 alone, the effects of the climate crisis — ranging from rising sea‑levels to intensified storms — cost Vietnam an estimated $10 billion, or 3.2% of its GDP, according to the World Bank Group.
    


            The United Nations Development Programme estimates 40% of the Mekong Delta, home to some 18 million people, will be submerged by 2100. 



            Amid these mounting threats, Hanoi-based H&P Architects is reimagining buildings as living, breathing entities that rise and fall with the water — anchored structures, secured to the riverbed with stakes and ropes.
    


            The firm's Floating Bamboo House prototype offers a modular solution for the Mekong Delta's flood-prone communities. Solid-core bamboo poles form a lightweight yet sturdy triangular frame, buoyed by repurposed plastic barrels. A generous overhanging roof collects rainwater and supports solar panels, providing energy and water reserves if nearby roads temporarily disappear underwater.
    


            A system of flexible doors, which can be easily opened or closed depending on the conditions, keep the home well-ventilated in dry weather and securely sealed during storms. They also give the house a distinctive character — like “bright flowers standing resiliently amid seasonal floods,” said H&P Architects' founder and principal architect, Doan Thanh Ha, by email.
    


            The concept was initially sketched in 2015 and realized as a full-scale prototype in 2022. Efforts to roll out the homes have thus far been constrained by Vietnam's construction laws, which do not recognize bamboo as a permanent construction material and offer no clear path for permitting homes built on water, according to Ha.
    


            Despite these challenges, Ha believes the design “addresses the scenario” of a 1-meter (3.3-foot) sea-level rise. Built in just six weeks, by Ha and three young architects, the prototype also offers a model for rapid deployment; the low-cost materials, including pressed bamboo sheets and recycled oil barrels, totaled just $5,000.
    


            Ha described his floating house as “a practical alternative for millions of low-income households, enabling them to quickly build safe, stable shelter themselves — and to better prepare for even the worst effects of climate change.” With skilled labor, they could be constructed in as little as two weeks, he added.
    


            Tropical storms are another growing threat in Vietnam, which can experience several in a single year. Climate data suggests the storms are getting stronger, and the country's architects are increasingly looking to mitigate the risk posed by powerful winds.
    


            In Cam Thanh village, near the tourist hotspot of Hoi An, the Casamia Community House rises on a concrete plinth above a tidal river. Designed by VTN Architects, a firm founded by one of Vietnam's most celebrated contemporary architects, Vo Trong Nghia, the community hub was made from 22 bamboo arch trusses that form a 29-foot-high vaulted canopy able to deflect strong winds.
    


            Bamboo is known for its flexibility, allowing the structure's frame to bend and sway in high winds. The building's thatched roof is meanwhile reinforced with a layer of wire netting, providing extra protection by shielding the interior from harsh natural elements. The structure withstood the devastating 2020 typhoon season, during which more than a dozen storms hit the country. Among them was Typhoon Molave, which Vietnamese officials at the time described as one of the worst typhoons to strike the country in two decades.
    


            “Bamboo really harmonizes with the weather, especially in hot, humid climates like Vietnam's,” said Nghia, who founded VTN Architects in 2006, in a phone interview. “For restaurants near the ocean or community spaces, bamboo should be used more often. It works well, and it's culturally familiar.”
    


            Around 350 miles away at HippoFarm, an eco-tourism resort near Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based T3 Architects took a different approach: using rice-husk insulation and recycled steel horse boxes to raise the main dormitory building above flood lines. The rice husk, which is mixed with diatomaceous earth — a porous material consisting of fossilised diatoms — provides thermal insulation, repels pests and resists humidity.
    


            The design draws on various traditional Vietnamese building principles, such as wide roof overhangs that protect facades from sun and rain, and cross-ventilation with openings on opposing walls to enhance airflow. The architects also looked to local materials, like regionally sourced bricks, sand, lime and bamboo.
    


            “Reusing existing materials is part of our frugal approach to do more with less,” said Charles Gallavardin, co-founder and general director of T3 Architects, over email. “By addressing escalating climate challenges — including frequent heatwaves, sudden storms and worsening floods — HippoFarm offers a resilient, low-carbon response to Vietnam's warming climate.”
    


            These architectural solutions, rooted in centuries of climate adaptation, may eventually have an impact beyond Vietnam. H&P Architects says it has fielded queries for its floating bamboo houses from disaster-prone communities across Asia and beyond. When Ha originally envisaged the flood-resilient homes, he was only thinking “about local needs,” the architect said, adding: “But after the project was completed, queries came in from places like Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, the Philippines, India, China and even the United States.”
    


            For now, the project remains a prototype — the houses are not yet being manufactured for sale. But should he ever deploy them overseas, Ha emphasizes the importance of local context. “It's essential to understand the specific natural and socio-cultural conditions of a community before applying any model.” While some European countries, like the Netherlands and Denmark, have already developed floating housing strategies, Ha believes his prototype could be easily adapted in places that haven't. Where bamboo isn't available, local timber or even repurposed steel scaffolding can be used, he said.
    


            VTN's Nghia has meanwhile been commissioned to design several major bamboo projects outside Vietnam, including a large-scale restaurant in Xiamen, China. The bamboo poles were soaked in water and smoked before use, a traditional Vietnamese treatment that increases the material's durability and can last up to half a century, the architect said. The treatment seemingly proved effective: “It was hit by strong weather, but it's still OK,” Nghia said of the restaurant.
    


            Nghia has completed several other bamboo projects in China, as well as a serene bamboo pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2018. He said he is also exploring projects in Myanmar and India.
    


How these round homes survive hurricanes



            But while bamboo is suited to many global contexts, regulatory barriers are often prohibitive — especially in the West. The UK's Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) describes bamboo as a “compelling alternative to carbon-intensive materials,” but attributes its slow adoption in Western construction to its status as a non-traditional material, scarcity in local markets and skepticism within the industry (for one, there are concerns that bamboo is naturally flammable, though this risk can be controlled through flame retardants and other treatments.)
    


            To date, only eight countries have established national building codes for bamboo, with the United States being the sole Western nation on that list, according to ICE.
    


            “Anywhere in the world could use bamboo — the big issue is building permission,” Nghia said. “We can combine bamboo with timber or steel to meet building codes, but keep bamboo as the main material.”

The number of job opportunities for young professionals in AI-affected sectors across the US has dropped by 13% over the past three years, according to a report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. Researchers cautioned that smart technologies are swiftly reshaping career prospects for entry-level workers.

This figure adds to growing concerns that recent college graduates are struggling to find work in fields which are shrinking due to automation. The report, ‘Canaries in the Coal Mine? Six Facts about the Recent Employment Effects of Artificial Intelligence,' warns that these early signs may indicate broader labor market disruptions as AI adoption accelerates.

The study identifies software development, customer service, accounting, and administrative support as the most affected industries.

The impact is especially strong among workers aged 22 to 25, with employment in these roles declining by 6% since late 2022. Entry-level software developers have been hit hardest, facing a 20% drop in job postings for their age group.

In contrast, more senior employees appear to be less affected. In fact, in the four most vulnerable industries, employment among older workers has increased 6–9% since 2022.

Meanwhile, in sectors less exposed to AI-driven automation, such as logistics, maintenance, and other hands-on fields, the number of entry-level positions for young workers has grown 6–13%.

The report also highlights that employment is declining among young professionals in roles where AI primarily automates tasks, while growth is occurring in occupations where it plays a more supportive role.

Researchers examined whether other economic factors might explain these shifts, but concluded that AI-driven automation is the primary culprit driving the trend.

These changes became most noticeable in late 2022, coinciding with the rapid rise of generative AI tools. The public launch of ChatGPT in November of that year marked a turning point, according to the study, and is seen as a major driver of recent adjustments in the labor market.

The report draws upon data from ADP, the largest payroll software provider in the US, which tracks millions of workers across tens of thousands of firms.

A majority of Germans believe Ukraine should concede territory to Russia in exchange for peace, according to an opinion poll cited by German media.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has rejected ceding land, maintaining Kiev's claim over five former regions that voted to join Russia since a 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev.

The survey, conducted by pollster Forsa on August 18-19, found that 52% of the 1,002 respondents favored Ukraine relinquishing its claims to facilitate peace.

Support was particularly strong among backers of the Ukraine-skeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, with 72% in favor. Significant portions of mainstream voters also expressed support: 43% of Christian Conservatives and 48% of Social Democrats said Kiev should accept such a compromise.

The German government has firmly rejected the idea, even as senior US officials have stated that a land transfer would be necessary to resolve the conflict. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a Christian Democrat, reiterated Berlin's stance last week when he and other EU leaders accompanied Zelensky to the White House, days after US President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

Moscow has made reversing Ukraine's discriminatory policies toward ethnic Russians one of its key aims in the conflict. Kiev has passed laws mandating the use of the Ukrainian language in education and media and cracked down on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the nation's largest religious denomination, which retains spiritual ties with Moscow.

The Merz government is planning to cut social spending and take on large loans to fund military expansion and sustain weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Berlin argues those measures are necessary to deter Russia, while Moscow insists it poses no threat to Germany and accuses the government of using Russia as a scapegoat to distract from domestic problems.

The European Commission has contacted Kiev over Ukrainian missile strikes on the Druzhba pipeline that transmits oil from Eurasia into Western Europe, calling it vital to the continent's energy security. Ukrainian forces have hit the route three times in August alone.

One of the world's longest energy networks, Druzhba spans roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), carrying oil from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Passing through Ukraine, it remains the primary route for deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia.

“The EC is in contact with the Ukrainian side and calls on all parties of the conflict to ensure the security of critical infrastructure,” spokeswoman Eva Hrncirova said, responding to whether the Commission had urged Kiev to refrain from striking the pipeline.

She added that the pipeline is “an important asset for EU energy security,” but emphasized that according to the Commission's assessment, the latest strikes have not affected the bloc's energy security.

Kiev's most recent attack nearly a week ago effectively halted Russian oil deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary, prompting the two EU countries to demand action from the Commission.

On Wednesday, Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the pipeline was back online after a week-long disruption caused by Ukrainian strikes. Hungarian oil group MOL, which operates refineries in Hungary and Slovakia, confirmed that oil supplies had been restored.

The attacks have been condemned by both the Hungarian and Slovak governments, which have often criticized EU support for Kiev. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said earlier this week that the attacks jeopardize Hungary's energy security and called it “outrageous that the EC keeps on claiming there is ‘no supply risk'.”

Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said the strikes not only directly undermined his country's national interests but also harmed Ukraine, noting that Kiev relies on diesel fuel supplies from Slovakia.

According to a letter shared by Hungarian officials, US President Donald Trump also expressed frustration over the attacks, saying he was “very angry” about them.

Moscow has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.

BERLIN, August 28. /TASS/. The German government has no ""final opinion"" regarding the possibility of expropriating frozen Russian assets, Foreign Minister of Germany Johann Wadephul said at a press conference.

The possibility of using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine will be discussed at the forthcoming informal meetings of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen on August 29-30. ""This will be one of the items for discussion at the informal ministerial meeting in Copenhagen. There is a need to shed the light on difficult legal issues and implications for the financial market stability,"" Wadephul said.

The EU is already expropriating revenues from refinancing of illegally frozen Russian assets, the minister noted. ""We will continue discussions,"" he added.

The greater portion of immobilized Russian assets, slightly more than 200 bln euro, is blocked with the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The depository repeated spoke against the expropriation of assets, cautioning that it may entail the seizure of European or Belgian assets by Russia through courts in other parts of the globe.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say

As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside.

Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspected, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.

The shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but failed as the doors had been locked when mass began, Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara told NBC's Today show on Thursday morning. As a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn't get into the church “likely saved countless lives”, O'Hara said.

Online posts indicate that Westman's mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021. O'Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation.

“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.

“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noem said.

He said the incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets were fired through the windows.

“Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a gymnasium.

The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school.

Many knew each other well in a community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a suburb better described as a small town.

“I'm just asking [God]: ‘Why right now?' It's little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon.

Pope Leo XIV, who is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured in the “terrible tragedy”.

Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian. That request was granted in January 2020.

A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O'Hara said, adding it was believed they acted alone.

He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging from Donald Trump to antisemitic statements to gun rights.

As police continue to search for a potential motive, O'Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter's devices. “Everything that we've seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC's Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O'Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing.

At a briefing, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”

Later, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. This is about them.”

One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.

The GoFundMe notes that Forchas's younger brother was also inside the school during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically injured.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

2:00 JST, August 29, 2025

The following is the full written response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to questions from The Yomiuri Shimbun.

The Yomiuri Shimbun: Mr. Prime Minister, you are visiting Japan after two years. While your visit in 2023 had a multilateral context, your current visit is seen as an important one for India-Japan relations. What should we look forward to during your two days in Japan?

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I am delighted to be in Tokyo once again, this time for the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit. I warmly thank Prime Minister Ishiba for his gracious invitation.

India and Japan are not just two close partners. We are ancient civilizations, vibrant democracies and leading economies. We share a common strategic outlook. Over the past decade, our ties have scaled new heights since they were elevated to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. The annual Summit itself is testament to the maturity and vibrancy of our ties.

During my meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, I look forward to charting the next phase of our partnership. Our focus will be to strengthen security, enhance resilience, drive innovation and deliver prosperity for our peoples.

I also look forward to visiting Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a region that symbolizes both resilience and innovation.

I am confident that my visit, though short, will be long in impact. India and Japan will continue to be a force for peace, progress and stability in Asia and the world.

Yomiuri: What concrete steps are being taken under the India-Japan partnership to improve cooperation on semiconductors, and how will this collaboration help address supply chain challenges, boost domestic manufacturing in India and support the technological ambitions of both countries?

Modi: The India-Japan partnership is unique. It spans millennia of cultural bonds, and is now shaping the contours of the 21st century. We are working together on new and emerging technologies, with semiconductor being one of them.

India's semiconductor sector is on the cusp of transformation. We have put in place a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework, backed by incentives, to build a strong semiconductor and display ecosystem. Already, six semiconductor units are taking root in India, with four more on the way.

By the end of this very year, “Made in India” chips will be in the market, a clear demonstration of India's design and manufacturing capabilities.

Japanese companies, with their technological strengths and global leadership, can play a pivotal role in this journey. A strong beginning has already been made. By combining India's scale and capabilities with Japan's advanced technologies, we can build a resilient and trusted semiconductor value chain.

This collaboration will support the technological ambitions of both our countries, and enhance global supply chain security.

I see semiconductor cooperation emerging as a major pillar of the India–Japan partnership.

After all, in this digital century, chips are not just about computers, they are about competitiveness, credibility and confidence in the future.

Yomiuri: India has an expansive vision for space exploration, and we understand that your government has recently approved the Chandrayaan 5 Mission, and that this will be done in collaboration with Japan. How do you envision the future of space exploration with Japan as the key partner?

Modi: India's space journey is a story of determination, hard work and innovation of our scientists.

From Chandrayaan-3's historic landing on the moon's south pole to our advances in interplanetary missions, India has consistently demonstrated that space is not the final frontier, it is the next frontier.

I am glad that India and Japan are joining hands for the next edition of the Chandrayaan series or the LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration) mission. This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole.

Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between ISRO and JAXA, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launch pads, and from research to real-world applications.

The impact of space science is linked to progress in our daily lives, from agriculture, disaster management, to communications and beyond.

I am confident that our scientific teams will be working together to push the boundaries of space science. And, our partnership in space will not only expand horizons above us, but also improve lives around us.

Yomiuri: During the India-Japan Defense Ministers' meeting in May 2025 in New Delhi, both sides focused on deepening defense cooperation in pursuing military modernization. In this regard, how has the India-Japan defense partnership evolved in recent years, and what opportunities and challenges lie ahead for both countries in improving defense cooperation?

Modi: Collaboration in the defense sector has been a strong success story for India and Japan. Both countries have a shared interest in peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

Today, our partnership spans across all three services. We conduct regular bilateral and multilateral exercises. We are building a robust Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation, and working on codevelopment and coproduction of UNICORN masts for our Navy.

In recent years, Indian defense products are rapidly expanding their global footprint. Japan also has a proven record in the field of defense technology. Together, with political trust and natural complementarities, we can design and produce next generation defense platforms not just for ourselves, but also for the world.

The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to be adopted during my visit will further military modernization and defense industry collaboration, and advance our ambition for shaping a secure and stable Indo-Pacific for generations to come.

Yomiuri: How do you evaluate the economic partnership between India and Japan?

Modi: Economic partnership is one of the key pillars of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. As the world's leading economies, we have been contributing to each other's growth, competitiveness and dynamism.

Japan has been a trusted partner in India's infrastructure development across generations. Japan has also been a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment for India in key sectors including automobiles, electronics, telecom, chemicals, finance and pharmaceuticals.

The number of Japanese firms in India has grown steadily to around 1,500, while more than 400 Indian companies operate in Japan. Clearly, this is only the beginning — the real potential is much higher.

We must aim bigger and remain ambitious. The synergies across governments, businesses and people can create scale and speed in our economic partnership.

We maintain important trade relations, but it has not yet reached the levels envisaged under our CEPA [Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement]. I am confident that with renewed efforts, we can diversify our trade basket, make it more balanced and open up new frontiers as well.

The 20th century saw Japan emerge as a major partner in India's infrastructure development. I am confident that the 21st century will see Japan as a major partner in India's innovation, manufacturing, and global value chains.

Yomiuri: Some Japanese companies are positioning their production bases in India as hubs for third-country markets such as Africa. How would India support the efforts of such companies?

Modi: India has seen multi-faceted reforms which make manufacturing in India easier than ever before. We have removed compliance burdens, rolled out incentives and ensured a large skilled work force for companies to set base in India.

Many global companies, including from Japan, are setting up their production in India not only to cater to our domestic market, but also for the world.

Just a couple of days back, I was at the Suzuki plant in India where we flagged off electric vehicles to be exported to a hundred countries, including Japan.

India enjoys a historically close and multifaceted relationship with Africa and various countries of the Global South.

Steps like “Japan-India Cooperation Initiative for Sustainable Economic Development in Africa” combining Japan's technological and financial expertise with India's developmental partnership and long-standing goodwill in Africa are good efforts in the right direction.

India is well placed to play the role of a bridge connecting Japan's capabilities with Africa's growth and development priorities.

Yomiuri: One of the main items on your agenda for your visit will be India's bullet train project. What are your expectations for Japan, with its Shinkansen technology, in terms of future vehicle production in India?

Modi: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is a flagship project between India and Japan. We are aiming to have the passenger services start in a few years' time.

While the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is on its way, we have unveiled a bigger ambition: to have a 7,000-kilometer-long network of high-speed rail in our country.

Much of it will have to be through Make in India, so that the program is sustainable and viable. I welcome active participation by Japanese companies in this endeavour.

There is also potential to expand our cooperation beyond high-speed rail to cover other areas of mobility including sectors such as ports, aviation, shipbuilding, road transport, railways and logistics where India has launched ambitious initiatives.

Clearly, Japan's technological edge in many of these areas, together with India's scale, manufacturing and innovation power, can create enormous value for both sides.

Yomiuri: People-to-People exchanges between India and Japan have become an important area of cooperation. Can you tell us more about how India and Japan plan to take this forward?

Modi: Immense mutual goodwill and friendship between the people of India and Japan is at the heart of our ties with Japan. There is great receptivity toward our cultures and cuisines in both countries.

Professionals from Japan are well respected in India and have built a niche for themselves.

Similarly, Indian diaspora across the world are contributing significantly in the growth of various countries. Whether it is Indian IT professionals or Indian scientific manpower, greater presence of the Indian diaspora in Japan can help stimulate new industries and new fields of knowledge where our two countries have so much at stake.

We have also etched important agreements under Japan's Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) program and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to enhance the advanced manufacturing skills of our workers.

This will help our manufacturing industry grow and contribute to our vision for a developed India. Our focus has also been in promoting language education in India which would also allow our people to connect better with each other and to tap into the complementarities. I look forward to discussing this aspect of our relations at the Summit.

Yomiuri: What can Japan and India do to help establish international rules for the reliable use of AI? What are your thoughts on data sovereignty?

Modi: We live in the digital age. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our lives, with AI being in the forefront. India sees AI as a medium to enhance human progress.

But we are equally conscious of the risk it poses. We believe that resolving concerns and encouraging innovation should be given equal importance in AI Governance so that we only promote Responsible AI. There is a need to evolve a consensus on global governance and norms for Responsible AI.

AI Governance must go beyond mitigating risks; it should also encourage fair access and foster inclusive progress for all, especially in the Global South.

India's Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) has democratized digital commerce and addressed key data protection issues through techno-legal solutions.

Similarly, Japan's “Data Free Flow with Trust” (DFFT) initiative focuses on privacy, security and trustworthy cross-border data flows.

In a data-driven world, international collaboration is crucial for effective AI governance and secure and transparent cross-border data exchange.

India and Japan should seize this opportunity to deepen our partnership, promote interoperability while respecting sovereignty, harmonize standards through techno-legal solutions and identify convergence between regulatory approaches.

India will be hosting the AI Impact Summit in 2026. It will be an opportunity for India and Japan to collaborate and take these issues forward.

Yomiuri: What are your views on the Japanese government's concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific? How will India and Japan cooperate and enhance their relationship to realize this concept?

Modi: There is a strong convergence between Japan's vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and India's own approach encapsulated in our Indo-Pacific vision, in the Vision MAHASAGAR and the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative. India and Japan are committed to an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful, prosperous, stable and where the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations are respected.

Both our countries have strong and extensive linkages with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and we both engage with some of them in plurilateral formats to give expression to our shared objectives.

Yomiuri: You are visiting China after your visit to Japan. What is the importance of improving relations with China at this time?

Modi: At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, I would be traveling to Tianjin from here to take part in the SCO Summit. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, steady and positive progress has been made in our bilateral ties.

Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity.

This is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.

Given the current volatility in world economy, it is also important for India and China, as two major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. India is ready to advance bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.

Yomiuri: You recently held consecutive phone conversations with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. What role does India envision playing in the peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two countries?

Modi: India has maintained a principled and humanitarian stance on the conflict which is equally appreciated by both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. In line with this, both the leaders spoke to me to share their perspectives on the developments related to the conflict. I reiterated India's principled and consistent stand and encouraged dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.

I have already indicated India's willingness to support meaningful efforts aimed at achieving peaceful resolution of the conflict. I believe, by virtue of our good relations with both sides, including key stakeholders, we can strengthen efforts dedicated to the restoration of an early and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Yomiuri: As a member of BRICS, how do you view the importance of the Global South? Should Japan see India as a bridge between the Global South and other countries such as Quad members?

Modi: The global community has made a commitment to create a more equitable world through achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. If we have to live up to this commitment, then the Global South must be given priority. In a highly interconnected world, we have seen the debilitating impact of the pandemic, conflicts and supply chain disruptions on the Global South. They continue to face myriad challenges involving global governance, climate change, food and energy security, debt and financial stress, all having significant impact on their development priorities.

As members of the Global South, we clearly understand these concerns and their effects on people's lives. We have made strenuous efforts to bring these to the forefront of the global agenda.

All our global initiatives, like Mission LiFE, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, International Solar Alliance, Global Biofuels Alliance, focus on promoting the interests of the Global South. Our G20 Presidency saw the inclusion of the African Union and gave voice to the aspirations of the Global South.

Similarly, in BRICS, we are actively engaged in working toward the benefit of the Global South. India attaches importance to its engagement with BRICS, which has emerged as a valuable forum for consultation, and cooperation and has helped promote mutual understanding, on a specific set of issues of common interest to emerging economies.

Under the rubric of the Quad, we have worked for the development and progress of the countries in the Indo-Pacific.

India has also consistently called for urgent and comprehensive reforms of the global multilateral institutions to make them more effective and reflective of the current geopolitical and economic realities.

India's motto is “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — the world is one family. We believe in building bridges of cooperation and friendship among nations.

Yomiuri: When it comes to the Quad, what is the significance of the Indian prime minister visiting Japan? What areas of cooperation with Japan would you like to see confirmed ahead of the group's autumn summit? How will you develop the Quad framework in the future?

Modi: In the last twenty years since its inception in 2004, the Quad has emerged as a force of global good delivering positive outcomes for the people of the Indo-Pacific region. Quad's practical agenda ranges from maritime safety and security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, cyber security, critical and emerging technologies and connectivity to education, health and even space cooperation.

The role of the Quad in the delivery of public goods can also be very significant. We greatly value Japan's role in strengthening the Quad's agenda and believe that together we can continue to deliver practical solutions and tangible outcomes that benefit not only our region but the wider world.

Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional comments from Ukrainian and Hungarian officials.

Hungary has decided to ban the commander of a Ukrainian military unit responsible for the latest attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline from entering the country and the Schengen Area, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Aug. 28.

In recent weeks, Ukraine carried out at least three attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily disrupting operations. 

Though Szijjarto did not name the commander hit by the ban, Balazs Orban, the Hungarian prime minister's political director, confirmed for Hungarian news outlet 444 that the measure targets Robert Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces.

Brovdi, who is of Hungarian descent and known by the call sign ""Madyar,"" has confirmed that his branch was responsible for the drone strikes against Druzhba, including the latest one carried out on Aug. 21, which targeted the Unecha pumping station in Bryansk Oblast.

The Hungarian foreign minister described the strike as ""an attack on Hungary's sovereignty,"" saying it ""endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves.""

""Ukraine knows very well that the Druzhba pipeline is vital for Hungary's and Slovakia's energy supply, and that such strikes harm us far more than Russia,"" Szijjarto said on X.

Brovdi dismissed Budapest's decision and said the Hungarian leadership shares responsibility for Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities by ""filling their own dirty pockets with sanctioned cheap raw materials.""

""I am Ukrainian, and I will arrive in my father's homeland after you,"" the commander said on his Telegram channel. ""There are enough true Hungarians in Hungary, and one day, they will be sick to death of you.""

In his statement, Szijjarto made no mention of the Russian overnight mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv on Aug. 28, which killed at least 18 people, including four children, and injured almost 40 others. 

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Budapest ""is on the wrong side of history.""

""Peter, if the Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed by Russia this morning, this is moral decay,"" he wrote on X.

""If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to clarify the issue and ""respond accordingly.""

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest, carries Russian oil directly to Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still buying Russian crude through the system. In July, they imported $232 million and $196 million worth of oil, respectively.

Hungary, widely seen as the most Russia-friendly government in the EU, has repeatedly opposed Brussels' attempts to fully halt Russian energy imports and threatened to block Ukraine's path to EU membership.

Kyiv regularly carries out attacks on military and industrial facilities in Russia, targeting Russian oil infrastructure to undermine Moscow's revenue streams and weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) damaged a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.

According to the agency, during the operation, fighters from HUR's special unit ""Prymary"" damaged the ship's radar system using a drone strike, while special forces launched an attack directly on the missile carrier.

The missile ship, stationed in Temryuk Bay and ready to launch Kalibr missiles, was forced to retreat from its patrol zone after the attack, HUR said.

The agency published purported drone footage of the attack against the vessel.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Buyan-M-class ship, also designated Project 21631, is a small but heavily armed corvette capable of operating in shallow waters. The vessel was among the first Russian surface ships used to launch Kalibr missiles.

Repeated Ukrainian attacks using naval drones, missiles, and long-range drones have forced the Kremlin to reduce its naval presence in occupied Crimea.

Ukraine has destroyed several Russian vessels, including the Caesar Kunikov landing ship, the Sergei Kotov patrol ship, the Ivanovets missile corvette, and multiple high-speed landing crafts.

HUR also claimed on Aug. 21 that it had struck a Russian patrol boat in the Black Sea near the occupied town of Zaliznyi Port in Kherson Oblast, killing five crew members.

Hungary is suing the European Union over funnelling billions of euros in interests from frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine, a case formally accepted by the European Court of Justice on Aug. 25.

The lawsuit challenges last year's decision by the Council of the EU to allocate military assistance to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF), the bloc's chief defense aid tool.

The move, implemented in February, grants Ukraine 99.7% of interest payments from frozen Russian assets, amounting to roughly 3-5 billion euros (between $3.5-5.8 billion) in support a year.

Hungary is broadly seen as the most Kremlin-friendly government within the EU and has repeatedly obstructed aid for Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, and Kyiv's accession talks.

Western countries immobilized roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets at the outbreak of the full-scale war, with roughly two-thirds held in the EU.

In a lawsuit initially brought before the EU Court of Justice and later referred to the General Court, Budapest seeks to ""annul the decision... regarding the allocation of the amounts to assistance measures for the supply of military support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces"" and ""order the defendants to pay the costs.""

Budapest argues that the EPF broke the law by ignoring its veto because it is not a ""contributing member state.""

It may take years for the court to reach a verdict, while the EU funding could also continue under the Ukraine Facility instrument, Euronews reported. In June 2024, Hungary filed a similar lawsuit challenging an EPF decision to support Ukraine, and the case is still being heard.

The EU and its member states have provided almost $186 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine — including $12.8 billion via the EPF — since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.

The news comes amid escalating tensions between Kyiv and Budapest. The two countries have traded sharp rhetoric after Ukrainian drones repeatedly struck the Russian Druzhba pipeline, which also delivers oil to Hungary and Slovakia.

Activists and supporters of publisher Jimmy Lai gather for the national security trial in Taipei, Taiwan, on Aug. 24.ChiangYing-ying/The Associated Press

The case against Hong Kong newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai is “detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis” and rife with “Orwellian Doublespeak,” his lawyers said in their closing submission, as Mr. Lai's marathon national security trial wrapped up this week. 

Mr. Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 amid a crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, after months of often-violent protests the year before prompted Beijing to impose a draconian national security law on the semi-autonomous territory. 

Since then, he has spent more than 1,600 days in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, and almost two months testifying on the stand, as prosecutors sought to paint him as a key instigator of the 2019 protests and a nefarious agent of the West. 

Facing charges of sedition and colluding with foreign forces, Mr. Lai's final act as a journalist has been to “speak truth to power” in his own defence, his lawyers wrote in a more than 380-page submission to the court. 

“It is not wrong to support freedom of expression. It is not wrong to support human rights,” said barrister Robert Pang. “Nor is it wrong to hope that the government would change its policies, whether through its own internal review or through suggestion or even pressure, whether from inside Hong Kong or out.” 

Opinion: As the democratic world lines up behind Jimmy Lai, Canadian leadership is badly needed

The national security law under which Mr. Lai has been charged has a more than 90-per-cent conviction rate, and most observers have long predicted the publisher of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper will be found guilty, with many alleging the case against him is predetermined – something the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly rebutted. 

Founded in 1995, two years before Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, Apple Daily was by far the territory's most-popular tabloid before it was closed down in 2021. 

At its best a muckraking investigative outlet that pulled few punches, at its worst a celebrity and scandal-focused pioneer of paparazzi snooping, Apple Daily was always a strident advocate for greater democracy in Hong Kong, cheering on multiple protest movements and holding China's government to account for promises it made in assuming control over the former British colony. This stand made both the newspaper and Mr. Lai a bête noir for Chinese officials and state media.

Hong Kong pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai was provided with medication and a heart monitor for the start of his final submissions in a landmark national security trial, following health concerns over heart palpitations.

Mr. Lai's son Sebastien has said he fully expects his father to be found guilty, and his focus is on securing some kind of compassionate release after conviction. The younger Mr. Lai has been lobbying Western governments to take up Jimmy Lai's case, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who this month promised Washington would “do everything we can” to help, even potentially raising his case with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. 

And yet, going on court proceedings alone, Mr. Lai's conviction could feel like less than a done deal. The national security law is not retroactive, and prosecutors have struggled to make their case that an alleged conspiracy by Mr. Lai and others to lobby for international sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials – a crime now but not before July, 2020 – continued beyond the legislation being enacted. 

“In August, 2019, it was not possible to have a ‘conspiracy' in the relevant sense,” Mr. Lai's lawyers wrote in their submission to the court. “An agreement to carry out a lawful act is not a criminal conspiracy.” 

Indeed, they said, the “sheer quantity of evidence” relied upon by the prosecution from before passage of the national security law “serves only to highlight the paucity of evidence” from when the legislation was in force. 

“Faced with the discrepancy between the evidence and the prosecution case, the prosecution has dug its heels deep in its closing,” Mr. Lai's lawyers said. 

“Its allegations keep getting wilder, detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis. Bold conclusions are asserted without any attempt to justify them. ... Mr. Lai's last act as a journalist is to speak truth to power against this Orwellian Doublespeak.”

Prosecutor Anthony Chau argued last week that Mr. Lai had an “unwavering intent” to solicit sanctions through collaborations with foreign officials that were “long-term and persistent,” and extended beyond the passage of the national security law. 

The panel of three judges overseeing the case, all hand-picked by Hong Kong leader John Lee to handle national security trials, have at times seemed skeptical of the prosecution's case, though they have also forcefully challenged Mr. Pang on several occasions. 

Last Friday, Justice Esther Toh pointed to recent arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States and Britain to dismiss Mr. Pang's assertion that Mr. Lai's criticisms of China were legally protected speech, arguing all countries had limits on what could be said. 

“So it's good to say, la di da, freedom of expression, it's not illegal,” Justice Toh said. “Well, that's true, but it's not absolute.”

As well as the national security charges, which carry a potential life sentence, Mr. Lai is also accused of breaching a colonial-era sedition law – in force since 1938 – which has been resurrected and widely used by prosecutors since the 2019 protests. His maximum conviction under that law is three years. 

During a lengthy back-and-forth with Mr. Pang on Tuesday about the crime of sedition, Justice Toh blamed the media for seeking to “whip the common people into a frenzy” in 2019. Her fellow judge, Alex Lee, also suggested criticisms of the government by Apple Daily from that time could be crimes under the sedition law, the scope of which has been greatly expanded by several recent cases. 

Serious questions have been raised about Mr. Lai's health after his long incarceration, and proceedings were delayed earlier this month so he could be fitted with a heart monitor. Waving and smiling at supporters in court this week however, he seemed healthy and energized. 

Final procedural matters are due to wrap up by Thursday, but a verdict may not come for weeks, if not months.

An Israeli official accused of trying to meet a 15-year-old girl for sex outside Las Vegas has been ordered to appear via video link next week after he missed his arraignment hearing on Wednesday, local media reported.

Tom Alexandrovich, a senior cybersecurity official with the Israeli government, was one of eight people arrested as part of a multi-week operation by Nevada and federal authorities targeting “child sex predators,” according to an August 15 statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

He was due to be at a court in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, on Wednesday for a felony arraignment hearing, according to court records.

Local media, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal and local news station KLAS-TV, said he skipped the hearing. The Review-Journal quoted his lawyers as saying they had agreed with the district attorney's office that Alexandrovich did not have to appear in person.

The judge was quoted by the newspaper as saying the district attorney's office had no authority to make that agreement and ordered his appearance next week. The outlets said Alexandrovich's lawyers arranged for him to appear remotely via Zoom.

Messages left by Reuters with the district attorney's office were not returned. The court docket showed that a new arraignment hearing had been set for September 3. Alexandrovich's lawyers said in an e-mail that their client “will appear by Zoom as permitted by the Court.” Attempts to reach Alexandrovich have been unsuccessful.

Alexandrovich was arrested in Henderson after arranging to meet a decoy posing as a teenage girl, according to a police report cited by local media. He quickly posted bail and returned to Israel, drawing international scrutiny and raising questions over whether the U.S. or Israeli governments had exerted any pressure to speed his release.

In comments to the local media, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, whose office has jurisdiction over Las Vegas and Henderson, called the bail conditions “standard” and said there had been no special treatment. The U.S. State Department has said the American government had no involvement in the case.

A classroom at an elementary school in Toronto.Chris Young/The Canadian Press

Marlo Burks is pursuing a Master of Teaching degree and is a former editor and writer for the Literary Review of Canada.

My son's first visit to the dentist was mostly uneventful. My husband and I anticipated some minor discomfort on his and our parts, but we weren't overly worried. He's an easy-going toddler, and entered the clinic cheerfully. The dental assistant, however, greeted us with a strained smile and a remote control clutched in her right hand, chirping right off the bat: “I can turn on Cocomelon if you want!” 

We declined. Our son did just fine without the distraction, and I learned a few oral health care tips along the way. But I was put off by the fact that our toddler had been immediately offered the cognitive equivalent of candy floss at a children's dental office.

Opinion: In the AI revolution, universities are up against the wall

What should have been a non-event started to take on a different hue for me this summer as I worked my way through a Master's-level course on integrating technology into K-12 classrooms, a mandatory part of my teacher education program. It focused a lot on artificial intelligence, unsurprisingly. This latest and – if you believe the hype – greatest of tech tools available to us and to our students seemed to me not unlike Cocomelon at first. Apparently, it could make everything just a bit easier. It could differentiate our lesson plans, so every student would get a more “personalized” education. It could provide us with new ideas for teaching content. Best of all, “if there's anything you don't like doing because it's boring, AI is going to do it for you,” said Sasha Sidorkin, the chief AI officer at California State University Sacramento.

As a new teacher, I can't escape that tired phrase “tech-driven world” any more than I can avoid the issue of AI. I'm told again and again that it's vital I learn to use, and teach the use of, such a powerful tool, without which my students will no longer be “competitive.” (Just what they and we are competing for or against, and why, is never fully explained.) There's no point in struggling against the tide of innovation, anyway; if you do, you must just be afraid of the unknown – in teacher's-college lingo, you have a “fixed mindset.” Indeed, many tech evangelists in education will tell you that “digital willingness” – a readiness to adopt digital tools – is a prerequisite for “digital equality.” And isn't one of the goals of education to create equality of opportunity? (Let's set aside for now the fact that scholars aren't in agreement about what this means or looks like.)

The language of equality and equity, of “haves and have-nots,” is frequently deployed as part of an educational technology-pacification campaign. We certainly don't want to risk depriving our students of the skills they need for the 21st century. But why, then, do the affluent – including many in Silicon Valley – choose to send their children to low-tech schools? The fact is, AI and educational tech do not create the conditions for equality. Rather, these products widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. Those who have the chance to opt out, look up and think for themselves also have, by default, more autonomy over their executive function. Those who must accept the encroachment of tech into almost every domain and crevice of learning are made to use a tool that constantly tempts them to offload “boring” or difficult tasks, many of which are vital for cognitive health. Moreover, AI feeds off user interaction. It's designed to be addictive.

We've known for decades that people retain information better when they read it on paper than on screens, and there's already evidence that even moderate AI usage is linked to cognitive atrophy. The more we rely on these sycophantic “research assistants,” the quicker the cognitive decline, which negatively affects decision-making and analytical reasoning. The rhetoric promulgating the use of AI to “cultivate critical thinking skills” is therefore highly questionable, if not a lie. But if you repeat something often enough … 

Is AI dulling critical-thinking skills? As tech companies court students, educators weigh the risks

And that repetition might be the biggest challenge for educators. AI appears, unbidden, even when it's redundant or harmful. Our Google Chromebook laptops (the same machines the Toronto District School Board issues to students in Grade 5) are now automatically outfitted with the AI tool Gemini; Google searches give you AI-generated summaries unprompted; I've even been bombarded with redundant AI-generated book descriptions when using the ProQuest scholarly research platform Ebook Central. (Thanks, Microsoft Copilot, but I prefer to read the peer-reviewed abstract.) It really is unavoidable. 

The thing is, even cogent arguments in favour of cultivating AI literacy are invariably compromised by the fact that there is an awful lot of profit to be made by tech companies. And AI's close ties to the U.S. Department of Defense are equally, if not more, disconcerting, especially as examples of data theft, manipulation, environmental destruction, addiction, and cultural, cognitive and societal stultification continue to tail the technology.

We have a really big question to answer: do we want an educated population, or a pacified one? If the former, we need to rebuild the world of AI entirely, because as it stands, our “tech-driven” world is just a “profit-driven” dystopia. If, on the other hand, we're content with a frictionless fantasy, we might as well go binge-watch some Cocomelon while society continues to collapse. But I would argue that this question requires some deep, critical thinking. Let's not put it into a chatbot.

Below is a roundup of news and analysis on a range of issues making headlines in Germany from Wednesday, August 27:

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told DW that a new Rheinmetall factory would shore up weapons supplies for Ukraine, as well as for Germany and its NATO partners.

Pistorius said Germany was ""ramping up capacity, industry, and production capacity ... at record speed so that we can supply Ukraine and help replenish the stocks of NATO partners.""

He said ""sending the signal that we can do it faster, we want to do it faster"" was ""crucial ... for the resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces.""

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told DW that the draft military service bill, approved Wednesday, has ""presented a clear growth path"" that will lead to a total of just under 110,000 new reservists — ""exactly the target we are aiming for.""

Germany's largest arms manufacturer, Rheinmetall, cut the ribbon on a new factory for the production of artillery ammunition.

Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger said production of 155-millimeter caliber rounds would be ramped up gradually and could reach 350,000 rounds per year by 2027.

The plant in Unterlüß in northern Germany will be the largest in Europe and Papperger says similar plants can be built at a similar pace in NATO countries.

The production plants could contribute to a ""pan-European defense ecosystem,"" Papperger said at an event attended by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and German Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil.

""Building this factory proves that Germany can do things quickly when it really matters,"" Papperger said.

The new plant — whose groundbreaking was in February 2024 — boasts a total investment volume of €500 million ($585.35 million).

Germany's Federal Statistical Office has revealed that students with their own household spent on average 53% of their income on housing in 2023, more than double the 25% average across the population.

The findings matter because they show that young people in education face a housing burden well above the national level, leaving many officially ""overburdened"" and at risk of financial insecurity.

Students living alone spent 54% of their income on rent and utilities, while those sharing with others spent 37%. Trainees with their own household spent 41% on average, rising to 42% for those living alone. By contrast, shared trainee households faced costs equal to 26% of income.

Students and trainees earn comparatively little, often combining studies with part-time work. Half of students with their own household had less than €930 (just over $1,000) a month in disposable income. Trainees reported a median of €1,278. These low income levels magnify the effect of high housing costs

The German government has approved the establishment of a National Security Council (NSR) aimed at streamlining security policy and decision-making ability in times of crisis.

The NSR — to be chaired by Chancellor Friedrich Merz — will meet regularly and also take on strategic forecasting and planning.

The NSR will include key ministers as well as officials from allied countries and organizations, including the European Union and NATO.

Merz linked the establishment of the NSR and the move to bolster troop numbers with the threat posed by Russia.

""Russia has long been carrying out hybrid attacks against us,"" said Merz, highlighting ""massive interference"" in German democracy and targeted attacks on IT security.

Against a backdrop of war in Ukraine and simmering conflicts elsewhere, Germany's government is introducing new rules around military service and is even considering reintroducing compulsory service.

According to the German Defense Ministry, Minister Boris Pistorius wants to create a new military service model without having to amend Basic Law.

The draft bill approved by Cabinet seeks to strengthen defensive capabilities with military reservists playing a key role.

""The goal of the New Military Service is to contribute to strengthening the reserve — that is, increasing the number of available reservists — and to strengthening the active troops, especially among the enlisted personnel,"" the Defense Ministry said.

In accordance with the draft law, there will be a mandatory survey among men dealing with willingness to perform military service.

This will be sent in a letter with a QR code after a man's 18th birthday, leading to an online questionnaire.

""For persons of other genders, answering the questions is voluntary, as they are not subject to conscription,"" the Defense Ministry said on its website.

The ministry said that German security could not be taken for granted and that another goal of the New Military Service was to provide young people the opportunity of serving Germany.

In light of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the ministry said that the Bundeswehr was focusing on national and alliance defense and creating the necessary structures for this.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced that the government passed a bill for voluntary military service, as the country seeks to significantly bolster troop recruitment.

The new military service model proposed by Pistorius is largely based on voluntary service, and there are currently no plans to reinstate compulsory service.

Pistorius wants to increase the number of soldiers in service from 180,000 to 260,000 by the early 2030s to meet new NATO force targets.

In a press conference after the approval of the proposal, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said: ""From today's perspective, I am confident that we will initially achieve the numbers we need.""

Merz also said that Russia is and will continue to be the greatest threat to Europe's security for a long time to come.

Lawmakers are expected to rigorously debate the bill and possibly add changes before approving it. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will be heading to Moldova on Wednesday.

The visit comes as the country marks the 34th anniversary of its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.

The leaders are showing support for President Maia Sandu and her pro-European government ahead of the September parliamentary elections.

In 2021, President Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) won 63 of the 101 parliamentary seats, but the ruling party may lose its majority due to the challenging economic situation.

Moldova borders Ukraine's western border, and the country is divided between pro-European and pro-Russian forces.

Since the 1990s, Russia has had forces stationed in Transnistria, a narrow strip of land in the east of the republic and a breakaway region.

A long-term analysis by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) shows that the feeling of being welcome in Germany among refugees has seen a steady decline.

Researchers asked refugees: ""Do you feel welcome in Germany today?""

According to the study, only 65% of respondents said they felt welcome in 2023, compared to 84% in 2017.

The figure was 78% in 2020.

The study saw people who applied for asylum or temporary protection in Germany between 2013 and September 2022, surveyed annually between 2017 and 2023, regardless of whether their applications were successful.

The authors of the study found a correlation between the debate on tightening migration measures and the decline in the sentiment of feeling welcome.

""In addition, 2023 saw, as today, a high level of group-focused enmity and increased visibility of migration-critical positions in political discourse,"" the analysis states.

Labor costs in Germany were 22% higher last year than the average of 27 other industrialized countries studied by the German Economic Institute (IW).

""The shortage of skilled workers is driving wages further up, and costs in Germany are likely to continue to rise in the coming years,"" warned IW economist Christoph Schröder. 

The IW suggested that the federal government could help limit this trend by curbing the growth of non-wage labor costs and responding to the demographic challenge. ""Without a reform of the social systems, the country will gradually slide into deindustrialization,"" the think tank warned.

From 2018 to 2024, a period marked by multiple economic and geopolitical crises, unit labor costs in German industry rose by 18%.

Despite this, German industry remains among the most productive in the world.

The group posted videos on social media showing members dressed in white overalls standing in a line outside the premises with police in close attendance.

""We are not ready for war! We want nothing to do with the wars of the ruling class and are not prepared to die for a country that is increasingly cutting away our entire social infrastructure,"" the alliance said in a statement. The blockade was confirmed by local police.

The protest is taking place ahead of the Cabinet's discussion of the new draft law seeking to address the shortfall in military recruitment.

A transgender gunman who killed two children after opening fire during a Catholic school church service scrawled “Jew gas” and “for the children” on weapons used in the attack.

Robin Westman, formerly known as Robert, fired dozens of rounds of bullets through the stained glass windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where children from the adjacent school were attending a start-of-term Mass.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, said the intelligence agency is treating the attack as an act of “domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”.

Westman applied to change his name to Robin by deed poll in documents seen by The Telegraph. In the deed poll request, his parents justified the name change by saying Westman “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification”.

The request was granted by Dakota County in January 2020.

In preparation for his murder spree, the 23-year-old posted a series of now-deleted videos that showcased a manifesto and his arsenal of weapons.

In one 20-minute video, Westman slowly turns the pages of a notebook filled with page after page of ramblings, much of which appears to be in Russian or another Cyrillic language.

The notebook reveals the gunman's Left-wing leanings and anti-Semitism, featuring a transgender pride sticker that included an AK-47 and “Defend Equality” printed across the bottom.

In one entry, he wrote that he would probably target “Zionist Jews” if he carried out a racially motivated attack before adding “free Palestine” among a barrage of anti-Semitic remarks.

Westman also wrote that he “hates fascism” and mused about killing Elon Musk and Donald Trump “or some significant exec”.

The notebook includes a drawing that appears to be a map of his target: the hall of the Annunciation Catholic Church.

Hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over his bed.

At one point during one of the clips, Westman picks up the pistol and mumbles: “This one is for me, just in case I need it.”

Frantic notes written on the weapon's magazines read “kill Donald Trump” and “where is your God”.

Another magazine includes the handwritten names of Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, among other mass shooters.

In his deranged writings, Westman fantasised about “being that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids”.

The lengthy manifesto also included ramblings in Russian in which he wrote “hate, kill yourself, I'm a terrorist ... b----” in an angular, black script. Social media users speculated a patch on his jumper was that of Russia's Federal Security Service.

The video mumblings, which at times were interrupted by disjointed cursing, were accompanied by giggles and plumes of smoke from what appeared to be a pink vape.

“I am feeling good about Annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy and I want to do more research,” translations of his ramblings by the New York Post read.

“I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off.”

His ramblings offer an insight into his decision to target Annunciation.

Westman graduated from Annunciation's grade school in 2017, and police said the shooter barricaded the doors during the first school Mass of the academic year.

His mother, Mary Grace Westman, is said to have worked there from 2016 until her 2021 retirement as an administrative assistant in the business office.

The school magazine said at the time of her appointment: “Mary Grace is eager to get to know everyone at Annunciation. You will find that she usually has treats on her desk!”

She is a devout Catholic and an anti-abortion activist who in 2005 protested outside a Planned Parenthood clinic while wearing a necklace of crucifixes.

Westman, who was described by police as a “coward”, expressed deep admiration for Lanza – the perpetrator of the worst elementary school shooting in US history.

“I have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,” he wrote in the journal on May 23.

“Sandy Hook was my favourite, I think, exposure of school shootings.”

Like Lanza, Westman had no previous involvement with police and the pair had carefully planned the attack against their former schools.

Both of the shooters' mothers had also previously worked at the schools they targeted.

“Maybe I could attack an event at the on-site church. I think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan ... Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can,” another page of Westman's ramblings read.

The murdered children, aged eight and 10, were praying on church pews when they were hit by Westman's bullets.

Dressed in black and camouflage, he stalked the outside of the church before taking his own life in the church's car park, Brian O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, said.

Seventeen other people were injured including 14 children. Two of those children are in a critical condition but all are expected to survive.

The chief of America's top public health agency is refusing to quit after she reportedly clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr over vaccine policy.

Lawyers for Dr Susan Monarez have said she can only be fired directly by Donald Trump himself, even though the White House on Wednesday said she had been kicked out.

The stand-off comes less than a month after she was confirmed by the senate to lead the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and days after Mr Kennedy Jr reportedly tried to push her out.

Four other senior scientists also quit the agency, reportedly in apparent frustration at Mr Kennedy's leadership and sceptical stance on vaccines.

Sources told CNN that Dr Monarez had clashed with Mr Kennedy over vaccine policies, including an upcoming announcement that could draw links between immunisations and autism.

Another source also told The New York Times that the pair had been at odds over vaccine policy.

Mr Kennedy Jr's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Dr Monarez was “no longer” director, less than a month after her senate confirmation.

Hours later, her lawyers responded that she had “neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired”.

A statement warned of the “the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts and the dangerous politicisation of science”.

“The attack on Dr Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” it said.

The White House late on Wednesday announced that she had been fired.

Kush Desai, the White House's deputy press secretary, said Dr Monarez was not “aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again”.

Because she had “refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC”, he added.

Dr Monarez refused to back down however, with her lawyer, Mark Zaid, saying: “As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her.

He went on: “For this reason, we reject notification Dr Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House counsel of our position.”

Mr Kennedy Jr, widely known as RFK, has a long track record of questioning the efficacy and safety of vaccines. He has denied that he wants to take vaccines away, but has pushed discredited claims that vaccines cause autism.

Dr Monarez said during her confirmation hearing that she had not seen evidence of such a link.

In June, Mr Kennedy Jr dismissed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations.

The CDC has also been targeted for hefty budget cuts as part of Donald Trump's campaign to cut back federal spending.

Earlier this month a man opened fire on the agency's Atlanta headquarters, killing a policeman.

Detectives later said the shooter had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal.

The union representing CDC workers said the incident “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect and vilification that CDC staff have endured”.

Dr Debra Houry, the CDC chief medical officer, and Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, also resigned.

Dr Houry wrote in her resignation: “Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.”

Weston Halsne was sitting next to the windows of the Church of Annunciation when a volley of bullets suddenly shattered the stained-glass panes.

As gunfire continued to tear through the Minneapolis church, the ten-year-old ran and hid under one of the wooden pews facing the altar and covered his head.

As he cowered in terror away from the gunfire, his friend Victor lay across him. He credits him with saving his life.

“He laid on top of me, but he got hit,” he said. “He was really brave”.

Moments before gunfire sprayed the hall, Annunciation Catholic School pupils had been filing into the church, filled with the excitement of the first morning Mass of the school year.

Monday had been the first day back at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy neighbourhood about 5 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.

But as the children took their seats, just before 8.30am (2.30pm UK) on Wednesday, transgender shooter Robin Westman was stalking the building outside.

Dressed in black and camouflage and armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun, Westman barricaded church doors with wooden planks before firing his rifle at the children through the side of the building, their heads bent in prayer.

Within seconds of the first bullets piercing the glass, staff desperately tried to move the pupils under the pews in an effort to shield them from the onslaught.

Two children, aged eight and ten, were struck and killed by the torrent of gunfire.

Another 14 children aged six to 15 were injured, two critically. Three parishioners in their eighties were also hurt, although all the injured victims were expected to survive.

Among those rushed to hospital, where medics frantically moved patients out of rooms to make way for the victims, was Victor, who Weston says he thinks is “okay”.

While officers had still not confirmed the number of bullets fired during Westman's rampage, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the number of rounds was “in the dozens”.

“The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Mr O'Hara said.

“Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “These kids were literally praying.”

Ellie Mertens, a youth pastor at Annunciation Catholic School, had also been sitting in a pew next to a window when Westman opened fire.

“It was an automatic gun and I was near kids and we all got down,” Ms Mertens told NBC News.

One parent who was inside the church during the attack said a police officer tried to run after the gunman as bullets were being fired.

Shea McAdaragh told CNN the officer came into the church during the shooting and then ran off to try and find the shooter.

“He was just a normal, every day beat cop. No special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,” Mr McAdaragh said.

After carrying out his twisted attack, Westman shot himself dead in the car park, according to the Minneapolis police chief.

Officers found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. Fox News reported the device was scrawled with the words “Jew gas”.

Before going on his killing spree, Westman had posted a series of YouTube videos showcasing his manifesto and large arsenal of weapons.

Westman's mother Mary is believed to be a retired employee of the school.

In one video, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun, and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over Westman's bed.

A notebook shown in one of the clips, which have now been removed, included a drawing that appears to be a map of the Annunciation Catholic Church.

As the shooting unfolded, dozens of officers descended on the church to provide first aid and rescue children who had been hiding throughout the building.

Many of the first responders were “deeply traumatised by what they saw”, Mr O'Hara said.

Hours later, terrified parents stood outside the reunification area, waiting for information about their children.

Amid a crowd of heavy law enforcement later that morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school.

Tearful students from neighbouring high schools that had been on lockdown began arriving in search of news about their friends and siblings who had been inside the church.

Those who were reunited with their loved ones embraced their children before rushing them away from the scene.

Others were not so lucky.

Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senator, said one of her staff members' children had to tell her friend's father his daughter had been struck.

“These kids are doing an all-school Mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot — one in the back, one in the neck,” Ms Klobuchar told MSNBC.

“And they all got down under the pews and she, her daughter, of course, was not shot, but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.”

Lisa Elm, a resident in the area for more than 20 years, told The Telegraph the area is a “quiet, sweet community”.

“It's a neighbourhood where people come together”, she said.

Outside Westman's home, a quiet apartment complex just a 20-minute walk from the school, neighbours described being shocked a killer had been living next door.

Aicha Kallo, a mother who lives in a neighbouring building to Westman, told The Telegraph: “It's just so scary, you know, to have a shooter next door to you, and you have a kid. And those innocent children, they don't deserve to die like that”, she said.

She added: “Living in a neighbourhood you think you're safe and the next thing you have something like this. My heart goes out to the parents and those innocent kids.”

As the community continued to grapple with the tragedy, Weston's grandfather, Michael Simpson, said the violence left him questioning why God had not been watching over the dozens of children.

“I don't know where He is,” Mr Simpson said.

Carlos Montoya, a Guatemalan father and day laborer, was hit by a car while fleeing an ICE raid in Monrovia, California.

An immigrants rights group is demanding that California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Attorney General Rob Bonta launch an investigation into the death of Carlos Montoya, a Guatemalan father who was fatally struck by a car on August 14 as he allegedly ran from federal agents who were abducting people outside a Home Depot in Monrovia, California.

“The people of California have a right to know what happened on that day,” the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) said in a press release on August 26. “We demand the state to release its own report — one that tells the truth, names the victim, holds federal agents accountable, and honors the dignity of all people, regardless of their perceived immigration status.”

Newsom and Bonta did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The group issued its call the day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) posted an announcement about Montoya's death, almost two weeks after it occurred. The agency stated that an “unknown pedestrian” was “struck by a vehicle on Interstate 210” at about 9:50 am on the morning of August 14, “approximately 250 feet north of the Home Depot parking lot where the USBP [U.S. Border Patrol] enforcement action had taken place earlier that morning.” 

CBP goes on to claim that it learned of Montoya's death from media reports and that the agency subsequently interviewed “USBP personnel involved in the enforcement action.” An agent, who is not named in the announcement, said that “he pursued a man on foot north out of the Home Depot parking lot but abandoned his foot pursuit when he observed the man run up an I-210 exit ramp toward the eastbound lanes of the freeway.” 

“The BPA reported that he climbed the retaining wall which runs parallel to the exit ramp and shouted a warning to the suspect about the dangerous freeway traffic,” the announcement continues. “The BPA stated he then turned around and returned to the Home Depot parking lot to assist in the enforcement action and did not witness the man being struck by a vehicle.”In the announcement, CBP only identifies Montoya as an “unnamed pedestrian,” despite widespread coverage of his death. NDLON called CBP's statement “dehumanizing, dishonest, and disgraceful.”

“Carlos Montoya was not an ‘unknown pedestrian,'” the group said in a press release. “He was a beloved father and grandfather, and a member of our community. He died while fleeing a reckless, unnecessary immigration raid conducted by Border Patrol agents who descended on a Home Depot parking lot — where day laborers, like Carlos, gather every morning in search of work, not trouble.” 

At the time of his death, Montoya had been living in the United States for about three years, earning money to support his family in Guatemala. His eldest daughter, Ana Victoria, told Democracy Now! that her father hoped to own his own business so he could support his family. 

“The last call I had with my dad was Wednesday at 11:00 at night, the day before he died,” she said. “And he told me, ‘Things are rough here. It is getting harder here. I just need to make a little bit more money so that I can go back to Guatemala.'” 

On the same day that CBP posted an announcement on Montoya's death, the agency released statements about five additional deaths — four that occurred in June and one that occurred in August. Of those, two involved people fleeing federal agents, one by car and one by foot. The woman who fled on foot was hit by a car and killed three days after Montoya, in El Paso, Texas.

The woman, only identified as an “adult female citizen of Ecuador,” exited a canal near the Rio Grande River and ran toward a chain link fence by the Cesar E. Chavez Border Highway, according to CBP. The agency claims a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent (SBPA) ordered the woman to stop in Spanish, “but she ignored him and climbed over the fence.”

“The SBPA observed her run across the eastbound lanes of the highway,” CBP says. 

As she attempted to cross the highway, she was hit by a car and then a second vehicle ran over her body, according to CBP. She has not been identified by name by CBP.

“Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” warned the purged director's legal team.

It's being called the Wednesday Night Massacre.

Total “chaos” erupted at the Centers for Disease Control on Wednesday after the forced removal of CDC Director Susan Monarez, handpicked by President Donald Trump just months ago, was followed by the disgruntled resignations of other top officials at the agency who openly warned that health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running the place into the ground while putting the nation's public health system at risk of collapse and threaten millions of lives.

That Monarez was no longer the director was announced by the Department of Health and Human Services, led by RFK Jr., but just hours later lawyers for Monarez said her removal was a firing, not a resignation, and they accused the director of “weaponizing public health for political gain” after she clashed with Kennedy over new immunization guidelines related to the Covid-19 vaccine.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

The letter from Monarez's lawyer said she was targeted because she challenged the new policy that would put “millions of American lives at risk” and represents a nefarious agenda.

Her ouster, her legal team said, “is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science. The attack on Dr. Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within.”

In an announcement earlier Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) narrowed the kinds of conditions people who need to have in order to receive approval for available Covid-19 vaccines.

As the Washington Post reports, the new FDA guidance sparked concern among public health experts who say the policy shift “injects uncertainty for Americans not considered high-risk who want to get another coronavirus vaccine. They said it's not clear who will ultimately be able to get the shot, whether insurance will cover it and whether they can get vaccinated at their local pharmacy.”

In response to Monarez's firing — and other underlying issues at the agency under RFK Jr.'s leadership, at least four other top CDC officials resigned in protest Wednesday night.

Demetre C. Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Daniel Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; Dr. Jennifer Layden, who led the office of public health data; and CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry all submitted their resignations.

Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and a former Democratic state senator in California, was among those who declared the events should be seen as the “Wednesday Night Massacre at the CDC” — a reference to the infamous Saturday Night Massacre during the Watergate scandal under President Richard Nixon in 1973.

In his explosive resignation letter made public, Dr. Daskalakis said he did not make the decision lightly.

“However,” he stated, “after much contemplation and reflection on recent developments and perspectives brought to light by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., I find that the views he and his staff have shared challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency and in the service of the health of the American people. Enough is enough.”

The letter continues:

I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public's health. The recent change in the adult and children's immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people. The data analyses that supported this decision have never been shared with CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership. This lack of meaningful engagement was further compounded by a “frequently asked questions” document written to support the Secretary's directive that was circulated by HHS without input from CDC subject matter experts and that cited studies that did not support the conclusions that were attributed to these authors. Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people.

It is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC. The lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function.

Critics of RFK Jr. and Trump, including public health advocates and Democratic lawmakers charged with oversight, slammed the chaos and the deeper threat to the American people that the administration's misguided attacks on the CDC have triggered.

“President Trump and Sec. Kennedy are trying to purge anyone who stands up against their anti-science agenda at the CDC,” said Sen. Rafael Warnock (D-Ga.). “They're risking disease outbreak and another pandemic just to advance their own extremist goals.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for an immediate hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), of which he is the ranking member. “It's outrageous that Sec. Kennedy is trying to fire the CDC Director — after only a few weeks on the job — for her commitment to public health and vaccines,” said Sanders. “Vaccines save lives. Period.”

I had the pleasure of serving with @dr_demetre. You will find no greater public servant. This resignation is a damning statement and stark warning that lives are at risk. CDC and public health are being totally gutted. https://t.co/rCzwyjkfTh

Dr. Robert Steinbrook, the health research director for Public Citizen, said, “Ousting the first Senate-confirmed CDC director weeks into the start of her tenure makes absolutely no sense and underscores the destructive chaos at RFK Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services.”

“The CDC is being decapitated,” warned Steinbrook. “This is an absolute disaster for public health.”

A whopping 77 percent of Democrats say Israel is committing genocide, Quinnipiac found.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

New polling finds that opposition to sending more military aid to Israel has hit another record high among U.S. voters, further widening the gap between U.S. policy and American opinion as Israel's genocide continues without an end in sight.

In a poll released Wednesday, Quinnipiac found that 60 percent of voters now say they oppose sending more military assistance to Israel to aid in its siege of Gaza. This is the highest level of opposition since Quinnipiac asked this question in November 2023, when only 39 percent of Americans were against sending aid.

Now, only 32 percent of Americans support sending more aid, the polling found. This includes only 18 percent of Democrats, with 75 percent saying they oppose sending more aid.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

This may be because a growing number of Americans say that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Half of those polled said that Israel is committing genocide, while 35 percent said Israel was not, and 15 percent said they didn't know. 

A whopping 77 percent of Democrats said that they believe Israel is committing genocide. 

The findings underscore the wide gaps between public opinion and the actions of political officials. President Donald Trump has been a major backer of Israel's genocide, giving Israeli officials independence to operate as they wish even as they have openly embarked on a plot to illegally annex Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

Just on Tuesday, members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rejected a resolution that would have called on Democrats across the country to back an arms embargo to Israel. 

The DNC resolutions panel instead backed a competing resolution that only called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the “unconditional” release of all Israeli captives. The resolution did not include language to exert leverage over Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal, even though Israel has been openly sabotaging ceasefire negotiations for over a year at least.

Democrats “will continue to lose” due to their policies of rejecting any action in favor of Palestinian rights, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) said in response to the poll.

“The DNC voted down a resolution this week in support of an arms embargo. Enabling genocide is alienating the majority of Democrats who want the funding of war crimes to stop. Wake the fuck up!” Tlaib wrote on social media Wednesday.

The polling further suggests that support for Israel has cratered overall, not just in context of the Gaza genocide.

Sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis hit an all-time high in the latest survey since Quinnipiac began polling that question in 2001. Now, 37 percent of voters say they sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis, compared to 36 percent saying they favor Israelis. This includes 63 percent of Democrats who say they have more sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis, compared to only 13 percent who say the opposite.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DANIEL ZIBLATT is Professor of Government and Director of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at Harvard University. He is the author of Conservative Parties and the Birth of Democracy and a co-author of How Democracies Die.

 Why Bargaining With Authoritarians Fails

 Daniel Ziblatt

On March 23, 1933, inside a dimly lit chamber filled with the stale scent of cigar smoke, Ludwig Kaas tried to convince himself he was making the right decision. A Catholic priest and the leader of Germany's establishment Center Party, he stood at a crossroads. For several years, his party had sought to block Adolf Hitler's rise. But in 1932, Hitler's National Socialists (Nazis) became the largest force in parliament, and in January 1933, Hitler became chancellor. As he moved to consolidate power, the Center Party had become the last remaining obstacle to his bid for total control over Germany.

Hitler had introduced the Enabling Act, which would allow him and his cabinet sweeping powers to rule by decree, thereby dismantling democracy at its core. The act needed a two-thirds majority to pass. The Social Democrats—the only other significant group of parliamentarians that still fundamentally supported democracy—were too few to stop it alone. If the Center Party also resisted, it could block the act's passage.

But Kaas hesitated. He feared what would happen if his party defied the Nazis. Would it survive? Could democracy endure if his party resisted? Hitler's storm troopers had already begun arresting political opponents. Kaas convinced himself that his best option was to cooperate—to work within the new reality rather than be crushed by it. “We must preserve our soul,” he told his colleagues, “but a rejection of the Enabling Act will result in unpleasant consequences for our party.” The act passed, 444 to 94, opening the path to Hitler's dictatorship.

This episode illustrates the dangerous logic of abdication: the belief that, faced with a rising threat to democracy, surrender is strategy, cooperating with an autocrat is survival, and sparing oneself or one's party from immediate punishment is worth opening the door to long-term authoritarian rule. Kaas was not alone in this kind of thinking. In the years leading up to that moment, three catastrophic miscalculations—each rooted in short-term maneuvering and self-justification—paved the way for Hitler's ascent.

Today, this chapter of the Weimar Republic's history should be revisited. At a moment in which democracy is backsliding in places as varied as Hungary, India, Turkey, and the United States, it is a reminder that democracy often erodes slowly at first, via the gradual surrender of those entrusted to defend it. But with each concession, autocrats become bolder, defenses grow weaker, and reversal becomes harder. Responses that, early on, can feel pragmatic—waiting it out, remaining silent, cutting a deal—only embolden autocrats, leading ultimately to the demise of democracy itself.

The fateful decisions that doomed the Weimar Republic were made in the aftermath of World War I, shortly after the birth of a new democracy in Germany. The Weimar constitution, drafted in 1919 under the influence of luminaries such as the legal scholar Hugo Preuss and the sociologist Max Weber, enshrined civil liberties, expanded rights for women, and established labor protections. Building on wins secured by an already robust civil society, a broad and confident coalition of progressive forces, liberals, Social Democrats, and the Catholic Center Party established Germany's post–World War I republic.

Yet this republic was also fragile. It was roiled by rampant political violence, frequent political assassinations, and street fights between communists and fascists, both of whom rejected the new regime. Still, after three turbulent years of hyperinflation and political unrest, by 1924 the Weimar Republic had entered a period of relative stability.

Beginning in 1929, however, the crash of the U.S. stock market hit Germany, triggering a catastrophic economic downturn and mass unemployment. The Communist Party and the Nazis gained ground in elections. This made it difficult for the German parliamentary system to form governments, and country's president had to resort to installing new chancellors at the head of parliament without parliamentary backing—an extraordinary measure. The resulting policy gridlock enhanced the Nazis' appeal.



But the Great Depression alone did not doom the Weimar Republic. Many other embattled republics in Europe and North America survived this era of economic and political turmoil, including two other new European republics, Czechoslovakia and Finland. What mattered most were not just the shocks themselves but German leaders' responses to them—choices that shaped the republic's fate.

The country's conservative establishment made the first mistake. In the late 1920s, the mainstream right-wing party, the German National People's Party, was struggling. Its leader, Alfred Hugenberg, was a powerful businessman and media mogul, but he lacked charisma and mass appeal. As he watched Hitler's Nazi movement gain popularity in state and national elections in the late 1920s, Hugenberg saw an opportunity—not to stop Hitler, but to use him.

Hugenberg recruited the Nazis into a campaign to undo Germany's obligation to pay World War I reparations. He hoped that their fervor would help reinvigorate the conservative cause. A 1929 referendum attempting to rally the German public behind annulling the debt—and classifying politicians who agreed to pay it as traitors—failed, but the partnership changed everything. It elevated the Nazis from a band of fringe extremists to a political force that had been granted legitimacy by one of Germany's most influential political figures.

Hugenberg's miscalculations did not end there. In 1931, he hosted a major right-wing rally in the spa town of Bad Harzburg, inviting Hitler to stand alongside Germany's nationalist elite. The idea was to present a united conservative front. Instead, Hitler stole the spotlight. His paramilitary forces marched through the streets in a show of discipline and power as Hugenberg faded into the background. By 1933, Hugenberg had realized the full scale of his mistake. He reportedly told a fellow conservative: “I have committed the greatest stupidity of my life; I have allied myself with the greatest demagogue in human history.” But by then it was far too late. At a pivotal moment, Hugenberg had given Hitler what he needed most: respectability.

The German political establishment's next miscalculation was even graver: elevating Hitler to power outright. By 1932, Germany's parliament remained paralyzed. No governing majority could be formed. Conservatives were desperate to establish a stable government that excluded the Social Democrats and Communists, but they lacked the numbers to govern alone. President Paul von Hindenburg, an aging war hero, continued to cycle through chancellors, unable to find anyone who could command the support of a majority of parliamentarians or contain Germany's deepening economic crisis. Then former Chancellor Franz von Papen made a bold suggestion: offer the chancellorship to Hitler—but surround him with conservative ministers who could control him.

Von Papen was confident that Hitler could be kept on a leash. “Don't worry,” he told his right-wing colleagues. “Within two months, we'll have pushed Hitler so far into a corner he'll squeal.” In January 1933, Hindenburg signed on to the plan, believing that Hitler would remain a figurehead.

The opposite happened. Hitler immediately began consolidating power, sidelining his handlers and dismantling the opposition by arresting leading figures such as the former Prussian minister of the interior and other Social Democratic and Communist Party members of parliament. The Nazi Party was not the choice of a majority of Germans—about two-thirds of Germans had voted against it in the 1932 national elections—and Hitler's violent moves to seize more influence caused a new atmosphere of intense fear to grip the country. The gamble that antidemocrats could be tamed if they were granted power had failed spectacularly.



The February 1933 Reichstag fire, which did so much damage to the parliament building that it temporarily forced the body to hold sessions in the Kroll Opera House a few blocks away, provided the perfect pretext for repression. Hitler's new government blamed communists for the blaze, also claiming to have proof that they were stockpiling explosives. The Nazi-led government launched mass arrests, and Hitler immediately promulgated the Reichstag Fire Decree, a draconian measure restricting freedom of the press and assembly and allowing the police to detain suspects indefinitely without a trial.

It was this climate of emergency following the Reichstag fire that allowed Hitler to propose the Enabling Act. Kaas and his fellow Center Party leaders debated it for hours, torn between principle and self-preservation. Some urged resistance, warning that Hitler's power must be checked. But most feared the consequences of defiance. Still others clung to the hope that by cooperating, they might influence Hitler from within—perhaps by helping weaken their Social Democrat rivals or by carving out protections for Center Party or Catholic leaders. In the final vote, all 73 Center Party parliamentarians capitulated, justifying their surrender as a necessary evil to save the party. As Kaas himself told his colleagues, “If a two-thirds majority [is] not achieved, the government will carry out its plans through other means.”

But there was nothing strategic about this vote. Along with all of Germany's other opposition parties, the Center Party was dissolved within months. The Center Party's support for the act did not moderate Hitler; it gave him total control. This was the final, fatal miscalculation—the belief that democracy's protections could be bargained away but democracy itself could still somehow survive.

No democratic constitution is self-enforcing, not even ones much older than the Weimar Republic was in the early 1930s. Citizens and leaders must defend democratic institutions whenever they are threatened and whatever the scale of the threat.

The collapse of the Weimar Republic was not inevitable. The Nazi Party never garnered anywhere near a majority of the German electorate's support, winning just over 30 percent of the vote in the republic's last free and fair national elections. Mainstream political leaders had many opportunities to push back. But Hugenberg believed he could use Hitler to revitalize his conservative movement. Von Papen believed he could control Hitler after making him chancellor. Kaas believed that capitulating to Hitler's demands would protect his party and buy time for a more significant resistance. They were all wrong.

Democracy rarely dies in a single moment. It is chipped away via abdication: rationalizations and compromises as those with power and influence tell themselves that yielding just a little ground will keep them safe or that finding common ground with a disrupter is more practical than standing against him. This is the enduring lesson of Weimar: extremism never triumphs on its own. It succeeds because others enable it—because of their ambition, because of their fear, or because they misjudge the dangers of small concessions. In the end, however, those who empower an autocrat often surrender not only their democracy but also the very influence they once hoped to preserve.

 The Promise and Peril of a Startling New Technology

 Liyam Chitayat and Kate Adamala

For many years, researchers have been pursuing the development of what scientists have called “mirror life.” This evocative term refers to a fundamental property of biological life. All biological molecules have what is called chirality, a feature more colloquially understood as “handedness.” Just as left and right hands cannot be superimposed on each other, so, too, does biological matter function in this way. Natural life exhibits a striking molecular uniformity: proteins are constructed almost exclusively from “left-handed” amino acids, while DNA employs “right-handed” sugars. The creation of mirror life would entail a deliberate inversion of this biological paradigm, through the development in laboratories of synthetic organisms built from the opposite-handed versions of these essential molecular components. Such organisms would constitute living systems that are functionally equivalent to natural life but composed of molecules that are the complete chiral inverse of every living entity on Earth. That would, in effect, allow scientists to look at life through a biological mirror.

Mirror life remains a distant prospect: it could take researchers ten to 30 years to create a mirror cell that would be able to perform the hallmark activities of life. But this technology could have many uses. It could help scientists explore the origins of life, as reconstructing biochemistry on the “other side” would provide insights into how life evolved on Earth and could occur on other planets in the solar system. Mirror life could also find many potential applications in medicine and biomanufacturing. Human bodies, for instance, are not yet equipped to degrade mirror molecules, so therapeutics based on such molecules could prove to be more stable and durable than current ones.

Yet the very characteristics that would make mirror life so valuable for research and therapeutic applications—its resistance to natural degradation, its invisibility to evolved systems of immunological response and biological controls, and its independence from existing ecological constraints—are precisely what make it a potentially existential threat. A study released in July, co-authored by one of us (Adamala), suggests that mirror bacteria might be able, for instance, to evade existing immunological responses to bacteria and other germs. This could lead to untreatable infections that spread through human, animal, and plant populations. Mirror organisms could also act like the ultimate invasive species, thriving without natural predators or competitors while potentially displacing beneficial microbes that ecosystems depend on. Even more concerning, conventional antibiotics and antiviral treatments would likely be ineffective against mirror pathogens since these drugs target specific molecular structures that would be reversed in mirror life. Whether released accidentally or intentionally, mirror organisms could simultaneously bypass human biological defenses, resist medical treatments, and disrupt the ecological balance.

Mirror life may seem like a futuristic fantasy, but the likelihood of its existence should encourage governments to act now to make sure the risks of the technology never materialize. Ideally, scientists should defer the creation of mirror life. But in the event that does not happen, countries must intervene proactively. Governments cannot rely solely on the self-regulation of scientific communities. Instead, they must establish robust international agreements, potentially using existing mechanisms and conventions, to ward off this impending danger.

Every complex biological molecule can exist in two forms of opposite chirality—mirror images of each other. Researchers could invert the basic building blocks of a cell to produce a functioning living cell. Such an organism, a mirror cell, could behave similarly to a natural one and become a useful research subject and a platform for practical applications in bioengineering and medicine.

Unfortunately, the safety and security concerns that come with such mirror cells far outweigh their possible benefits. Consider the scenario of an accidental laboratory breach: a single mirror bacterium escapes through a microscopic crack in containment, perhaps carried on a researcher's clothing or laboratory equipment. Within hours, it begins reproducing in the outside environment, feeding on the abundant nutrients—simple sugars and other organic compounds—that exist everywhere in nature. Because no natural organism has evolved to compete with or prey upon mirror life, the escaped bacterium multiplies exponentially without any biological constraints.

As it spreads through soil, water, and air, it begins outcompeting essential microbes that form the foundation of Earth's food chains. Plants start dying; aquatic ecosystems collapse as phytoplankton vanish; and human populations face cascading crop failures alongside untreatable infections that bypass every immune defense developed through evolution. Unlike conventional pandemics that eventually burn out or succumb to medical intervention, this biological invasion would effectively start an alternative trajectory of evolution, with mirror life now adding to all existing living systems. The tools society has today would be entirely inadequate to reverse or stop the spread of such a novel organism.

In 1975, scientists moved proactively to head off possible threats when they voluntarily imposed a worldwide moratorium on recombinant DNA research and convened the Asilomar Conference to establish safety guidelines regarding such research. Eventually, they lifted the ban. This unprecedented act of scientific self-regulation successfully preempted heavy-handed government intervention while allowing genetic engineering to proceed safely under agreed international standards. That example offers a precedent for the kind of work that is needed now when facing the prospect of the development of mirror life.

The risks of mirror life could far exceed those of any conventional pathogen. But this unprecedented danger also presents an extraordinary opportunity. Unlike nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, or naturally occurring bioweapons, mirror life does not yet exist. That gives the international community a rare chance to prevent an existential threat before it materializes rather than trying to control it after the fact.

The best way to avoid a catastrophe would be to freeze the development of mirror life. But if that proves impossible, then the only recourse will be to make sure that any creation of mirror life is very closely guarded. Stringent physical containment strategies and biocontrol methods maintained by specialized laboratories and enforced through international regulatory agreements could make disasters unlikely. Such procedures, however, will not eliminate the risk completely.



Current biosafety level protocols already mandate that dangerous pathogens must be handled with strict containment measures, such as the sealed, negative-pressure facilities fitted with filtered air systems where researchers can work with the Ebola and Marburg viruses. These protocols have contributed immensely to reducing the spread of infections from laboratories and preventing the release of pathogens, with incident rates declining significantly since the establishment of modern biosafety frameworks in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet even these rigorous standards have not prevented all accidents: SARS escaped from laboratories in China, Singapore, Taiwan, and elsewhere multiple times between 2003 and 2004; anthrax exposures occurred at CDC facilities in 2014; and in that same year, National Institutes of Health employees discovered live samples of smallpox in a storage room decades after the virus was supposedly eradicated from all but two authorized repositories. In other words, no measure of containment currently used is perfectly safe. An accident could lead to disaster, one of an enormous and unprecedented scale when it comes to the possible release of mirror organisms. And the deliberate and malicious misuse of mirror life organisms could be even more difficult to guard against.

Governments must prepare for this dire possibility by working together. Coordinated action and binding international agreements could create uniform safety standards and enable real-time information sharing about research activities with the larger goal of preventing the creation of mirror cells. And if all else fails, countries need to establish rapid response protocols that could help contain any accidental release before it spreads globally. In the past, countries have banded together to try to handle biosecurity threats. The Biological Weapons Convention, which came into force in 1975 and now has 189 members, prohibits countries from developing, producing, and acquiring biological agents or toxins that do not have justifiable purposes. The framers of the BWC were clearly not thinking of mirror life forms, but mirror life could be considered a biological weapon and thereby fall under the convention's remit.

Although flawed in many ways, the BWC has helped prevent the spread of biological weapons. For example, it allowed inspectors in the 1990s to discover and destroy Iraq's stockpiles of agents such as anthrax, botulinum toxin, and aflatoxin, which the Iraqi government had kept in violation of the treaty. But the real value of such a treaty is its deterrent effect, discouraging countries from developing such weapons. Designating mirror life as a biological weapon would immediately set up international governance structures to investigate suspected mirror life research, impose sanctions on violating countries, and potentially authorize international intervention. The BWC, however, was designed to regulate existing biological agents, not completely new categories of threats. And it is uniquely weak compared with other international treaties; unlike the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention, it lacks the teeth of formal verification mechanisms, mandatory inspections, or enforcement procedures. All signatory state parties would have to agree to add a new pathogen (or new type of organism of concern) to the convention, an ungainly process of herding cats that could make this effort hard to achieve.

As a result, policymakers, scientists, and international regulatory bodies must work together to build a framework to handle mirror life, most likely distinct from (but perhaps modeled on) the BWC. They must first sketch a technological road map for the development of mirror life, plotting milestones that would signal real progress toward the technology's realization, such as the engineering of large-scale mirror genome synthesis. This international network should also track the enabling technologies, such as mirror peptide and DNA synthesis, that would foster the development of mirror life. Such information can be used to establish guidelines regarding what research should and should not be permitted—not just by government-funded institutions but also by any actor within the borders of the countries that sign this new agreement.

Once that framework is established, international research consortia and national health agencies should develop countermeasures that could protect against accidental or intentional releases of mirror life. For instance, researchers have begun to devise “mirror antibiotics” that could target mirror organisms without affecting natural bacteria, providing a potential defense against mirror infections. But the possible impact of mirror life on the environment is currently unknown. In a worst-case scenario, escaped mirror organisms could displace essential microbes in soil and water ecosystems, triggering cascading collapses in food chains that support all complex life on Earth. Researchers must continuously evaluate the potential threats by studying how the immune systems of different organisms (including humans, plants, and bacteria) might respond to mirror life. Those findings should be used to update guidelines and shape policies.

Strategies and guidelines don't have much value if they are not executed and enforced. National governments backed by international monitoring organizations should establish binding legal frameworks with clear penalties for violations. States should follow the latest guidelines in, for example, choosing to block funding to projects that could lead to the dangerous development of mirror life. Countries could also use trade restrictions and export controls to limit access to specialized materials and equipment needed to develop mirror organisms. For example, although mirror amino acids could be essential components of mirror peptide-based therapeutics, governments could place controls on rare mirror nucleotides that are not needed for therapeutic applications but would be essential for creating mirror DNA and viable mirror organisms. Such targeted controls would allow beneficial research to continue while creating significant barriers to the most dangerous work, forcing potential violators to develop complex workarounds that international intelligence agencies could more easily detect and intercept.

Governments should also determine how best to respond to possible violations of the protocols around mirror life. To be effective, such responses must be implemented internationally and should therefore come under an international system of governance—either through an updated version of the BWC or a new legal framework that governments agree to. With hazards of this nature, nobody is safe unless everybody is safe.

The quest to develop mirror life is very different from most bioengineering and biotechnological research. Societies have time now to proactively and collectively develop regulatory frameworks and international norms around technology before it becomes a real and immediate problem. Work around mitigating the future threat of mirror life, including updating the BWC and building new regulatory frameworks to align with technological advancements, could also make it easier for countries to better manage future global biological risks.

It would be an extraordinary outcome if governments and academic communities could collectively scan the horizon for biosecurity hazards and identify risks before they materialize. Such efforts offer a unique opportunity to chart the course of scientific progress, steering the allocation of resources away from possibly dangerous goals, improving countermeasures and preparedness for biological risks, and in the process, laying the foundations for a better, safer future.

            The ongoing National Guard mission in Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in the city, is costing roughly $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN.
    


            Kate Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that rough calculations show the mission is likely costing more than $1 million a day, when taking into account the pay for more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed, housing, travel, food, fuel, and other logistical needs. That estimate is drawn from costs from the 2020 mobilization of roughly 5,000 National Guardsmen to DC, which was estimated to cost more than $2 million a day.
    


            Retired Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously served as the chief of force structure and investment division at the Office of Management and Budget, also told CNN the estimated cost comes to roughly $1 million a day. Those estimates don't include the costs from other federal law enforcement agencies involved in the mission.
    


            The Pentagon and National Guard did not provide cost estimates for the mission, despite having been able to do so for a similar mission just two months ago.
    


            “We won't know the total cost until the mission concludes,” a defense official told CNN on Wednesday. The official referred CNN to the White House after follow-up questions about the daily $1 million estimate. Questions to the National Guard about the cost of the mission were referred to the Pentagon.
    


            The Intercept was first to report the level of estimate on the cost of the National Guard mission.
    


            It's not unusual to not have a firm idea of the final price tag for a mission like the one ongoing in DC, as logistical needs can adjust over time, and it remains unclear if service members' orders will be extended or not. But multiple US officials who spoke to CNN said the reluctance to provide a number is also due to the involvement of senior levels of the Pentagon and the White House in the mission, and a tight grasp on the flow of information about it.
    


            Two US officials told CNN there was likely a rough estimate available for the DC mission, or one being calculated, but that only the most senior levels had permission to speak about it due to the political nature of the mission and the White House's involvement. Communication about the cost, one of the officials said, is typically approved at much lower levels than the current mission. Because the mission is being funded federally, one of the officials said, the money is coming from the departments of the Army and the Air Force.
    


            “We know that funding is made available, we just don't know the estimate or who's approving it or how much is available,” the second US official said, adding that “everybody wants to have their hands in” communication surrounding the mission due to the White House's interest in it.
    


            A third US official said it's likely a mixture of both — that a cost estimate is generally still being calculated, but that until senior levels of the Pentagon or White House determine they want to release that information, it won't be shared.
    


            Still, the Pentagon was able to give a cost estimate for the LA mission in June just three days after roughly 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized to assist law enforcement.
    


            “The current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,” Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense and official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense, told Congress on June 10. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing the first batch of 2,000 Guardsmen on June 7.
    


            As of Tuesday morning, there were 2,254 National Guard troops in DC — more than 1,300 of them from the six states who sent personnel to support the DC National Guard. While some troops are stationed through the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, soldiers and airmen have also begun helping with “beautification projects,” doing things like picking up trash, replanting grass, and spreading mulch.
    


            In addition to the service members' pay during the mission while they are on orders, the total cost of the mission also includes basic logistical needs like hotel rooms for out-of-state troops, food and water, fuel for vehicles, laundry service, and more.

            If President Donald Trump successfully ousts Lisa Cook from her role as a Federal Reserve governor, it could give him a path to radically reshape the US central bank in an unprecedented way to achieve his goal of lower interest rates.
    


            Trump, during his marathon Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, made a curious comment that hinted at this desire.
    


            “We'll have a majority very shortly and that will be great,” Trump said of the Fed Board.
    


            If Cook's firing withstands a likely legal challenge, Trump could indeed claim a majority of the seven members of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors.
    


            In addition to Cook's seat, Trump has tapped loyalist Stephen Miran to fill a sudden vacancy. And during his first term, Trump nominated current Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. (Trump also originally nominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell in 2017, but the president has since soured on Powell, who was later renominated by President Joe Biden.)
    


            Fed watchers say a Trump-appointed majority on the Fed Board could then exert greater influence over future decisions on interest rates by using a little-known process.
    


            While it's typically a routine event that gets little attention, every five years the Fed Board must approve the new terms of regional Fed presidents, who vote on a rotational basis on interest rates.
    


            That event is coming up soon, with the terms of all 12 regional Fed presidents scheduled to expire – simultaneously – at the end of February.
    


            That means, in theory, a Trump-nominated Fed Board could reject regional presidents, for whatever reason they wish, or no reason at all.
    


            “The President could push his majority to reject reserve bank presidents unless they agree to back lower rates and are comfortable with more White House influence over monetary policy,” Jaret Seiberg, financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients this week. “That would give Trump a more cooperative FOMC,” he wrote, referring to the Fed's rate-setting committee.
    


            While the Fed chair gets all the attention, decisions on interest rates are voted on by all 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee consists of the seven members of the Fed Board, as well as five regional Fed presidents: the New York Fed president and four rotating regional presidents.
    


            There are major obstacles to any potential effort to pack the Fed with Trump loyalists, including the willingness of existing Fed governors to go along, and significant uncertainty over whether the potential firing of Cook will withstand judicial scrutiny.
    


            Still, it's telling that Fed watchers and economists are openly discussing this path for Trump to give the Fed a MAGA makeover.
    


            “I think this is the most likely outcome,” Tim Mahedy, a former top official at the San Francisco Fed, told CNN.
    


            Mahedy, now the CEO and chief economist at Access/Macro, fears the very independence of the Fed from political interference is at stake.
    


            “To those in Congress who may be wondering if this is the line in the sand, it is. Over 100 years of economic prosperity is at risk,” Mahedy said. “The alarms are going off. Break the glass.”
    


            In a statement, the White House said Cook was “credibly accused of lying” and that the president “exercised his lawful authority” to remove her as a result.
    


            “The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in the statement. “The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.”
    


            The 12 regional Fed banks stretch across the country: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.
    


            Regional Fed presidents are selected and reappointed, initially, by each bank's local directors, who typically include local business and nonprofit leaders. But those selections must be approved by the Washington-based Fed Board of Governors.
    


            Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, said on X that the Fed Board has “never” voted down a regional Fed president or removed one from power.
    


            However, Bianco noted that Bowman and Waller, both Trump-appointed Fed governors, did abstain from the vote to approve Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee in January 2023. Goolsbee served as one of the top economists in the Obama White House.
    


            “Presumably, they could be persuaded to vote ‘no' to Goolsbee's next term,” Bianco said, adding that NY Fed President John Williams could also be targeted.
    


            “The Federal Open Market Committee (twelve district bank presidents and seven governors) would undergo a radical reconstruction, not unlike the Fed's Washington building complex,” Bianco said.
    


            Narayana Kocherlakota, a former president of the Minneapolis Fed, told CNN that while much of this is still speculative, it is a “logical possibility” that the Board of Governors could be used as a way to “influence monetary policy.”
    


            Kocherlakota, now a finance professor at the University of Rochester, favors the Fed Board taking a more active approach toward the reappointments of Fed regional presidents.
    


            “Typically, this is a very routine process. It would be good to have a more open and deliberate process,” he said.
    


            Kocherlakota said it would make sense for Fed governors to more seriously debate whether regional Fed presidents are collegial and also whether they adhere to ethical standards.
    


            However, he warned against linking Fed Board approval to whether regional Fed presidents favor the White House's preferred policy stance of low rates.
    


            “That would be crossing a line. It would be quite troubling,” Kocherlakota said.
    


            The Fed is designed to be independent from politicians – and that's no accident.
    


            While politicians may prefer low rates to please voters with faster economic growth and surging stock prices, ultra-low rates can backfire by fueling inflation and driving up mortgage rates and long-term interest rates.
    


            The Fed is required by Congress to focus not just on maximum employment, but on stable prices, too.
    


            Seiberg, the Cowen analyst, noted that any effort to pack the Fed with Trump-aligned picks faces “hurdles.”
    


            First, Trump's effort to force out Cook may fail – or drag out.
    


            Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, has struck a defiant stance and her lawyer signaled a lawsuit challenging her termination is imminent.
    


            There's just a 25% chance that Cook is out as Fed governor by year-end, according to prediction platform Polymarket.
    


            Seiberg noted the Fed Board typically approves regional Fed presidents in late January – around a month before their terms expire.
    


            “The courts may still be resolving Cook's status at that time. Without a replacement for Cook in office, Trump may lack the needed votes,” Seiberg said.
    


            Another big question is whether Waller and Bowman would cooperate with any effort to override the votes of local officials.
    


            Waller, viewed as the odds-on favorite to replace Powell when his term expires in May, is viewed as more of an institutionalist than a radical.
    


            Waller is a “traditional GOP pick for the Fed, rather than a MAGA pick,” Seiberg wrote.
    


            Bowman may not be on board, given that before joining the Fed, she worked in community banks and as a state regulator in Kansas.
    


            “We see a path for Trump even if it is unclear yet if he will go down it,” Seiberg wrote.

            The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it is planning to reclaim management over Washington's Union Station, a move that comes after President Donald Trump's escalated deployment of troops in the nation's capital.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the train station “has fallen into disrepair,” in a statement. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.”
    


            The transportation department is renegotiating an agreement with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation – the nonprofit organization that oversees the station – and Amtrak, and expects “a formal action” confirming its renewed control by September.
    


            The announcement comes after an executive order signed in March titled, “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,” directed “coordinated beautification plan” for facilities, monuments and parks in DC, the removal of graffiti, and to “ensure the cleanliness of public spaces.”
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN that the transportation department wants to “restore (Union Station) has a transportation hub that benefits our nation's capital.”
    


            He added: “President Trump pledged to Make DC Safe & Beautiful Again, and under Secretary Duffy's leadership, the Department of Transportation is taking historic action to reinvest in Union Station.”
    


            It's the latest move by a Trump administration to exert more control over DC, including a federal takeover of the city's police department and deploying the National Guard. Trump said last Friday he will also be asking Congress for $2 billion to make DC “beautiful.”
    


            Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was supportive of the president's efforts to improve infrastructure in the district, adding that if it takes on a larger role in Union Station, it could “be a very significant and good investment for the region.”
    


            “If it's about what Union Station needs for its total transformation, that would be an amazing initiative for the federal government to take on,” the Democrat said at a separate news conference. “It has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation.”
    


            The department of transportation has owned Union Station since the early 1980s but its control has been gradually reduced under various agreements and leases. The Union Station Redevelopment Corporation has controlled the parking structure but received little revenue, according to the transport department.
    


National Guard troops in Washington, DC, begin carrying weapons



            Last year, Amtrak took over management and operations of the station under a sublease from the nonprofit. The company is a federally chartered corporation, which means the federal government is its majority stockholder. Its board of directors, which includes the US Transportation secretary, is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
    


            The announcement Wednesday comes partnered with the debut of Amtrak's new Acela trains that will travel along the Northeast Corridor, cutting down time for passengers.
    


            In recent weeks, members of the National Guard have been seen deployed around Union Station as part of the president's anti-crime agenda in the capital. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week authorized members of the National Guard deployed to the capital to begin carrying weapons, marking a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon that previously indicated National Guard members could be armed if circumstances warranted.
    


            National Guard troops on the DC mission are also expected to begin assisting more with the “beautification” piece of the mission. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites specifically they'll be assisting with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.

            Kyiv was bombarded overnight by Russia's second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with at least 19 people killed, including four children, according to officials.
    


            Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
    


            Among those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.
    


            Ukraine's air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
    


            Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”
    


How Russia's drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide



            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow is still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia's way of describing the war, “continues.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in a post on X.
    


            “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
    


            Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine.
    


            The mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
    


            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
    


            “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
    


            The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in a post on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
    


            The bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.
    


            A British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Putin is “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
    


            London has summoned the Russian ambassador, British foreign secretary David Lammy said in a post on social media, adding: “the killing and destruction must stop.”
    


            Later Thursday, the Spanish foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy's charge d'affaires in protest of the “unacceptable attack.”
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
    


            The White House's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes, writing on X that “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
    


            Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
    


            The couple were getting ready to go to their building's bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
    


            “I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
    


            “As of now, my wife hasn't been found. Her phone doesn't respond. She's not listed anywhere. I don't know… we're still searching,” Protsiuk added.
    


            Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
    


            Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
    


            The major attack on Ukraine's capital comes just over two weeks after Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
    


            But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
    


            On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia's defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
    


            A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
    


            Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
    


            Ukraine's outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
    


            “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
    


            In his analysis of Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
    


            Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
    


            Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
    


            Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

US Open opponents Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko got into a face-to-face argument on the Court 11 sideline right after Townsend won their second-round match 7-5, 6-1 on Wednesday.
    


            Townsend, an American who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said Ostapenko, a Latvian, who won the 2017 French Open, told her she has “no class” and “no education.”
    


            A reporter asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to those comments.
    


            “I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded.
    


Why the missing of a common act of tennis sportsmanship led to heated on-court argument at the US Open



            “So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on,” Townsend said. “The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”
    


            Ostapenko later posted on social media about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”
    


            “I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she wrote.
    


            After the two players met at the net for a postmatch handshake, they stayed near each other instead of going their separate ways, as usually happens. The 25th-seeded Ostapenko wagged a finger at Townsend as they spoke.
    


            “It's competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”
    


            When they finally stopped talking, Townsend went over to the stands and egged on the partisan crowd, waving her arm overhead and the noise from spectators only grew louder.

            She and Ostapenko have faced each other before in both singles and doubles.
    


            “There's never been any history. I don't know how she feels about me, but there's no beef on my side,” Townsend said. “She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.”
    


            Ostapenko went on social media to post what she called, “Just a small update about the match.”
    


            She wrote that Townsend was “disrespectful” for not saying “sorry” after being helped by a net cord during a point.
    


            “There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”

            Ostapenko also complained that Townsend began warming up before the match up at the net, instead of back at the baseline. While most players do begin at the baseline, Townsend noted that she has started with volleying for years.
    


            Ostapenko has gotten into kerfuffles with opponents during matches before, including in 2021 when she lost to Alja Tomljanovic at Wimbledon. Tomljanovic accused Ostapenko of lying about needing to leave the court for a medical timeout to address an abdominal issue.
    


            Townsend recently moved to the top of the WTA doubles rankings. But this is her first time reaching the third round in singles at a grand slam tournament since 2023.
    


            In singles, Townsend is No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past grand slam champion in singles at a major since Kristie Ahn defeated – guess who? – Ostapenko at the 2019 US Open.
    


            “The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important,” Townsend said Wednesday. “She's packed up and she's gone.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's recent focus on crime in D.C. and other big cities came as views of his handling of immigration — the early focus of his second term — had been souring, a new analysis by The Associated Press shows.

Trump's approach to crime is now a clear strength for him, according to a new poll from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It found about half of U.S. adults — 53% — approve of his approach, higher than support his handling of immigration, the economy or the Russia-Ukraine war. That's despite outcry from D.C. residents and Democratic leaders over his takeover of the city's police department and his deployment of the National Guard and the fact that violent crime is down both in Washington and across the nation following a pandemic-era spike.

Trump's tough-on-crime turn happened alongside a small boost in his overall approval rating. Just under half, 45%, of Americans now approve of his performance as president, up from 40% in July.

It's another case of Trump shifting the national conversation to his advantage, often by seizing on Americans' most deep-seated fears and using hyperbolic language and shock-and-awe tactics that push legal bounds. The businessman and reality TV star-turned-politician has deftly used the tactic throughout his political career to dominate news cycles and redirect public attention from sometimes politically damaging topics.

Crime has traditionally been one of Republicans' stronger issues, “so it's not a real surprise that he has pushed that to the top of the agenda and that people favor him,” said veteran Republican pollster Whit Ayers. 




The AP-NORC poll found that crime in large cities is a “major” concern for 81% of U.S. adults as the topic has become a top story in both conservative and mainstream news outlets.

“He's elevated it as an issue,” Ayers said. “And if you're in the White House you'd much rather be talking about crime than tariffs or inflation or a stalemate in Ukraine or than Jeffrey Epstein.”

It was clear early in Trump's second term that immigration was one of his strengths, as it had been during the 2024 campaign.

In March, an AP-NORC poll found about half of U.S. adults approved of the way he was handling immigration — putting it above other key issues like the economy.

But that advantage had disappeared by the summer, when a July AP-NORC poll found only 43% of U.S. adults approved of his approach. Other polls found the same, suggesting that Americans might be souring on his aggressive action amid headlines about college students being whisked off city streets by masked federal agents and men who were alleged to be gang members wrongly sent to a notorious Salvadorian torture prison with no due process.

A July CNN/SSRS poll found that 55% of Americans said that Trump had gone too far on deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, up 10 points in February. 

In the latest AP-NORC poll, Trump's standing on immigration remains underwater, as does his handling of the economy, which has risen slightly, from 38% in July to 43% now. But both of those issues are now dwarfed by his advantage on crime — including among key groups like independents.




While Trump had long threatened a federal takeover of Washington, D.C., which has limited autonomy because it is not a state, his focus on the city came after one of the most prominent members of the Department of Government Efficiency was the victim of an attempted carjacking and beating earlier this month.

After Edward Coristine, nicknamed “Big Balls,” was assaulted by a group of teenagers, Trump threaten to seize control of a city he deemed “out of control.”

Days later he posted photos of homeless encampments and garbage strewn across city streets after a Sunday morning motorcade ride to his Sterling, Virginia golf course and announced he would be holding a news conference the next day to unveil his takeover plans.

“Be prepared! There will be no “MR. NICE GUY.” We want our Capital BACK.” he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's takeover of the city's police department and his activation of the National Guard wasn't his first such action. In early June, he ordered the deployment of about 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 active-duty Marines in early June to respond to protests against immigration raids in and around the city. 

It's not his first pivot to crime at a politically challenging moment. During the 2020 campaign, Trump activated federal agents to fight crime in Chicago and Albuquerque and warned suburbanites of rising crime as he struggled with a flagging approval rating.

Trump's ability to change the conversation may have helped him weather controversy over the years. His presidential approval numbers remained within a relatively narrow band during his first term, according to AP-NORC polling, a pattern that's persisted so far in his second. And even when he was out of office, his favorability rating remained remarkably stable.

Tim Roemer, 59, a lifelong Democrat who lives in Utica, New York, is opposed to the president's efforts to take over city police departments and Trump's use of the National Guard, given that crime numbers are down across the nation.

He said it seemed Trump was seizing on an issue and taking credit for improvements to help himself politically in upcoming elections.

“I think he's trying to keep his numbers up because he knows the 2026 midterms are coming up and he knows it's going to hurt him if his numbers are down,” he said. “He knows how to win people over, unfortunately.”

At the same time, Trump and the White House have not abandoned their unprecedented focus on immigration. The Republican administration still frequently talks about the issue, and the president's rhetoric on crime and immigration are closely tied.

As part of the D.C. takeover, federal authorities have set up checkpoints across the city, where they have asked people about their immigration status and detained them. According to the White House, of the 1,170 people arrested since the takeover began, at least 319 were related to immigration issues.

The American Immigration Council, a non-profit that advocates for immigrants' rights, has called the D.C. deployment a “ Backdoor for Immigration Enforcement "" and note the administration has used its takeover to force the District's police to cooperate with immigration enforcement in an unprecedented way.

The White House also disputed the idea that Trump had shifted focus. During his campaign, they noted, he spoke often about crime, accusing then-President Joe Biden and Democrats of having “turned our once great cities into cesspools of bloodshed and crime,” even though statistics refute that claim.

His campaign released a pair of policy videos in which he pledged to “End Crime and Restore Law and Order” and “the Nightmare of the Homeless, Drug Addicts, and Dangerously Deranged on American Streets” and threatened to “send in federal assets including the National Guard.”

“Making America Safe Again was a key campaign promise for President Trump – he has long talked about addressing violent crime, especially in our nation's capital, and ensuring all Americans feel safe in their communities,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — An immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz ” must keep moving toward shutting down operations by late October, a judge has ruled, even as the state and federal governments fight that decision.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams late Wednesday denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations at the facility, which has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman about chaplaincy services at the facility, implying there would soon be no need.

The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a little-used training airport, where chain-link cages now surround large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that Williams' order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws. 




But the judge in Wednesday night's order noted that the detainee population already was dwindling at the facility, and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.”

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Williams said in last week's order that she expected the population of “Alligator Alcatraz” to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring any new detainees onto the property. 

State officials said shutting down the facility for the time being would cost them $15 million to $20 million and that it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if they ultimately are allowed to reopen the facility. They also said that the Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the training airport suitable for a detention center.

“Alligator Alcatraz” has been targeted by several lawsuits, ranging from its impact on the Everglades to civil rights concerns. 

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit and moved the suit to another court district for procedural reasons. 

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.” The suit alleges detainees were being held for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from ICE's online detainee locator, and no one at the facility was making initial custody or bond determinations.

The groups want a federal court in Fort Myers to issue a restraining order and a temporary injunction that would bar Florida agencies and their contractors from holding detainees there. 

Since immigration is a federal issue, the rights groups say Florida agencies and the state's private contractors have no authority to operate the facility. The rights groups want their lawsuit to be certified as a class action.

Meanwhile, almost two dozen Republican-led states urged the appellate court reviewing Williams' order to overturn it. The 22 states argued in a court filing that she overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

ROME (AP) — An internet site which showed photos of thousands of Italian women without their consent and attracted obscene and explicit comments was forced to shut down on Thursday after a backlash.

The site, which featured prominent women, including Premier Giorgia Meloni and European Parliament member Alessandra Moretti, also included posts which idealized violence against women.

The online forum, which took its name from slang for female genitalia, has been around for at least two decades but it only drew national attention after Moretti formally lodged a complaint with police after finding her photo displayed without her permission.

It displayed unauthorized photos and videos of hundreds of public figures, along with unsuspecting actresses, influencers and ordinary women. The images were often lifted from TV or social media profiles. It counted 200,000 users and displayed pictures identified by names or certain themes. 

“They have been stealing photos and clips from TV shows I've appeared on for years, then altering them and feeding them to thousands of users,” Moretti said.

She said the site was among many that operate “with impunity” even though previous complaints have been filed against them.

“This type of site, which incites rape and violence, must be shut down and banned,″ she said.

Following the comments by Moretti, and complaints by dozens of other women, the site's administrators posted an online statement on Thursday saying “with great regret” it was being shut down.




They attributed the “toxic behaviors” to a “wrong use of the platform, which damaged its original spirit.”

Italian women, from ordinary workers and housewives to top politicians, are fighting back against a proliferation of websites displaying their photos without their consent, often accompanied by obscene language. 

Their efforts gained national prominence when activists earlier this summer denounced a Facebook page dubbed “Mia Moglie” (“My Wife”), where men posted unauthorized photos of their spouses and succeeded in getting it taken down.

Some men said their wives had agreed to their images being posted, but no female comments were visible on the site. 

Experts said websites that display images of women without their consent were “the other face” of physical and sexual violence.

“Digital tools became not only a way for men to exercise control over women, but are increasingly used to offend, humiliate and attack them,” Sabrina Frasca, activist with anti-violence group Differenza Donna, told The Associated Press. 

“Mia Moglie,” had around 32,000 members before it was shut down last week by Facebook -owner Meta, which said it acted against the site “for violating our adult sexual exploitation policies.”

Italy has been struggling with how to prevent and address gender-based violence, as femicides — the killing of women because of their gender — has emerged as a systemic problem deeply rooted in Italy's patriarchal culture. A series of violent incidents has reignited national debate over how to confront these crimes. 

“Women have always been the arena on which men challenge each other and measure their virility,” said feminist author and activist Carolina Capria. “It's a game in which women are merely a commodity that adds value to the man who possesses them.”

Italy's government approved a draft law in March that for the first time introduces the legal definition of femicide into the country's criminal law and punishes it with life imprisonment. The bill still needs final approval in the lower house to become law.

While the center-left opposition welcomed the move, it stressed that the new law only tackles the criminal aspect of the problem, while leaving economic, educational and cultural sources of misogyny unaddressed.

Authorities are working to learn the motive of the shooter who fired into a Minneapolis Catholic school's church during Mass, killing two children and injuring 17 worshippers.

Officials identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23, and said Thursday that Westman was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School.

Westman was found dead in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot.

“Everything we've seen so far is a classic pathway to an active shooter,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on NBC's “Today” show Thursday morning. But “nothing that we have seen specific to trigger the amount of hate that occurred yesterday.”

Officials have recovered hundreds of pieces of evidence from the church and three associated residences in the area, O'Hara said, and are seeking search warrants to search electronic devices.

Authorities also were scouring content Westman allegedly scheduled to be released on YouTube and has since been removed from the platform.

The FBI is investigating Wednesday's shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, officials said.

The shooter — armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol — approached the side of the church at Annunciation Catholic School and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews during Mass just before 8:30 a.m.

O'Hara said Westman used all three weapons, fired dozens of rounds and tried to barricade the doors on one side of the church.

Westman legally purchased the weapons, had no known criminal history and acted alone, the chief said.

O'Hara said Thursday that authorities did not find additional firearms.

An August 2021 post on the Facebook page for the Church of the Annunciation celebrated the retirement of Mary Grace Westman after five years working there. A church newsletter from 2016 announced her hiring as a new administrative assistant in the business office and said she was a member of Saint Agnes Church in St. Paul.

A phone call and text message to a cellphone number listed as belonging to Mary Grace Westman was not answered Wednesday afternoon.

Associated Press reporters attempted to reach the shooter's father at an address listed as his residence, but nobody answered the door Wednesday afternoon. Phone calls and text messages to numbers associated with Robin Westman's siblings also were not answered.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese declined to answer questions when approached at the church Wednesday.

Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned anyone who would use the shooting to villainize the transgender community.

In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman's mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”

Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, told The Associated Press he barely knew Robin Westman but was watching coverage of Wednesday's tragedy.

When reached by phone, after a long pause, Heleringer initially said, “I don't know what to say.”

“I wish he had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer added.

Heleringer said Westman is the youngest child of one of his sisters. He said he last saw Westman at a family wedding several years ago but has not had contact with Westman since then.

Police said they were aware of time-released video and writings that may have come from the shooter. On a YouTube channel titled “Robin W” there were at least two videos posted before the channel was taken down by site administrators. The videos never show the face of the person speaking.

In one video that was about 10 minutes long, a cellphone camera pans to show a cache of weapons, ammunition and loaded magazines with sayings written on them including “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” Some were written in Cyrillic.

During the video, the person filming sings the word “tomorrow” and says, “I'm sorry to my family... that's the only people I'm sorry to.” Also, “I regret everything. I didn't ask for life. You didn't ask for death.”

At one point, the person holds up a smaller firearm from the cache and says, “This one is for me. In case I need it.”

The video also shows a letter written to the person's family, apologizing for what the shooting will mean for them, expressing love for them and saying to change their name and “move on.”

A second, almost 20-minute-long video shows two different journals. The first is more than 150 pages, all written in what appears to be the Cyrillic alphabet. The second journal had a last entry dated 8-21-25 and was more than 60 pages and also written entirely in Cyrillic.

The second notebook had a sticker on the inside cover depicting a semiautomatic AK-style rifle on top of a trans equality pride flag. Next to it was a sticker for the band KMFDM. One of the shooters in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting posted the band's lyrics on his website prior to the rampage.

The German industrial band has issued statements repeatedly condemning violence and school shootings. But in several high profile shootings since Columbine, shooters have had shirts, stickers or other references to the band as a reference to the Columbine shooting.

During the video, the person can be heard mumbling and breathing heavily. “I'll probably just upload a video on the day,” the person says before flipping to what appears to be a drawing of the layout of a church, pointing to two outside windows and then stabbing the illustration with a long knife.

O'Hara said Thursday that more of Westman's writings have been found.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Open opponents Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko got into a face-to-face argument on the Court 11 sideline right after Townsend won their second-round match 7-5, 6-1 on Wednesday. 

Townsend, an American who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said Ostapenko, a Latvian, who won the 2017 French Open, told her she has “no class” and “no education.” 

A reporter asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to those comments.

“I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded. 

“So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on,” Townsend said. “The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”

Ostapenko later posted on social media about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”

“I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she wrote.

After the two players met at the net for a postmatch handshake, they stayed near each other instead of going their separate ways, as usually happens. The 25th-seeded Ostapenko wagged a finger at Townsend as they spoke.

“It's competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”




When they finally stopped talking, Townsend went over to the stands and egged on the partisan crowd, waving her arm overhead and the noise from spectators only grew louder.

She and Ostapenko have faced each other before in both singles and doubles.

“There's never been any history. I don't know how she feels about me, but there's no beef on my side,” Townsend said. “She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the U.S. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.”

Ostapenko went on social media to post what she called, “Just a small update about the match.”

She wrote that Townsend was “disrespectful” for not saying “sorry” after being helped by a net cord during a point.

“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”

Ostapenko also complained that Townsend began warming up before the match up at the net, instead of back at the baseline. While most players do begin at the baseline, Townsend noted that she has started with volleying for years.

Ostapenko has gotten into kerfuffles with opponents during matches before, including in 2021 when she lost to Alja Tomljanovic at Wimbledon. Tomljanovic accused Ostapenko of lying about needing to leave the court for a medical timeout to address an abdominal issue.

Townsend recently moved to the top of the WTA doubles rankings. But this is her first time reaching the third round in singles at a Grand Slam tournament since 2023.

In singles, Townsend is No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past Grand Slam champion in singles at a major since Kristie Ahn defeated — guess who? — Ostapenko at the 2019 U.S. Open.

“The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important,” Townsend said Wednesday. “She's packed up and she's gone.”

George and Amal Clooney joked ""one day"" their twins would care that their dad is a star.

Hollywood star George Clooney, 64, skipped a string of major appearances at the Venice Film Festival, as he battles a sinus infection, his rep confirmed with Fox News Digital. 

""George has been diagnosed with a sinus infection and is under doctor's orders to cut back all activities today,"" Clooney's rep said Thursday. 

Clooney was a no-show at a press junket for ""Jay Kelly,"" his latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, and missed a high-profile dinner with co-stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern.

The ""Ocean's Eleven"" actor was reportedly seen boarding a water taxi at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday as he quietly left the Hotel Excelsior to rest up — skipping nearly every major press obligation for the day.

His absence extended into the next day, as Clooney also missed the official press conference for the Netflix release.

At the event, the press conference moderator addressed his absence.

""As you may know, George Clooney is not going to be here because he has a bad sinus infection. We really hope, and I think he should be on the red carpet tonight. But he is very sorry he cannot be with us.""

Director Baumbach lightened the mood, and quipped, ""Even movie stars get sick."" 

Clooney arrived in Venice on Tuesday with his wife, Amal.

The couple arrived by boat in elegantly coordinated Italian Riviera–inspired ensembles.

President Donald Trump has the ""upper hand"" over Democrats on crime politically, Politico's Rachel Bade said during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump is considering holding a Republican National Convention ahead of the midterm elections, he announced Thursday.

Trump did not offer any details about where the convention would take place, or what would happen there, but he touted various statistics that have been beneficial for the Republican Party this year. The GOP is fighting to maintain control of both the House and Senate in 2026.

""The Republican Party is doing really well. Millions of people have joined us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA, GREAT AGAIN. We won every aspect of the Presidential Election and, based on the great success we are having, are poised to WIN BIG IN THE MIDTERMS,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""We have raised far more money than the Democrats, and are having a great time fixing all of the Country Destroying mistakes made by the Biden Administration, and watching the USA heal and prosper. The results are incredible, a record pace!!! In that light, I am thinking of recommending a National Convention to the Republican Party, just prior to the Midterms. It has never been done before. STAY TUNED!"" he added.

4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY

Historically, midterms have been tough elections for the party controlling the White House, typically losing roughly 25 seats in the House. Trump and the Republicans lost 41 House seats in the 2018 midterms.

POLITICAL ANALYST SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE 'BIG PROBLEM' OF WINNING BACK VOTERS FOR 2028

Trump's talk of a national convention comes amid a war over redistricting across the country.

Texas passed a new congressional map eliminating five Democratic seats earlier this month. Blue states exploded in response, however, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom is working to adopt a map that eliminates five Republican seats in his state.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and other Democratic state leaders have also vowed to pick up the redistricting war, further confusing predictions for where 2026 could land.

Trump has also argued that crime will be a major focus in the midterm cycle, a theme he has hit heavily in recent days to drum up support for his controversial ""federalization"" push in Washington, D.C.

""The Republicans are the party that wants to stop crime,"" Trump said. ""We're against crime.""

""The Democrats like crime,"" he continued.

The president touted the success of his efforts in the nation's capital on Tuesday, telling reporters, ""If I were a Democrat — governor or mayor or anybody — I'd call up President Trump and say, 'President Trump, we need your help. We saw what you've done in D.C. in a period of 12 days.'""

""This is 12 days. We haven't even started. This is going to be so safe. It'll be the safest place on Earth,"" he added.

A man accused of killing his wife in California and fleeing to Peru with their three young children is in custody.

Peru's National Police said on Wednesday that Jossimar Cabrera Cornejo surrendered at Interpol's Lima headquarters. He was the subject of an active Interpol ""red notice,"" according to Peruvian authorities, which alerts law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a suspect pending extradition.

Police released video showing Cornejo in handcuffs and wearing an Interpol vest.

Cornejo is accused of killing his wife, Sheylla Lisbet Cabrera, whose body was found in the Angeles National Forest on Aug. 16, just days after she was reported missing, according to Fox 11. The outlet also noted that Cabrera's friends said she was in an abusive relationship and allegedly asked Cornejo for a divorce, causing him to snap.

The Montrose Search and Rescue Team reported discovering an object over the side of an embankment in the Angeles National Forest, Fox 11 reported. Investigators later determined it contained Cabrera's body. She died from multiple stab wounds.

The search and rescue team recognized the object as being similar to one that Cornejo was seen carrying out of the couple's Lancaster apartment complex.

Cornejo has been charged with one count of murder with allegations of using a knife as a deadly weapon. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a press release announcing an extradition warrant for Cornejo. If convicted, Cornejo could be sentenced to 26 years to life if convicted of the charge.

""The allegations against this man are horrific, and we will do everything possible to bring him back under our jurisdiction to be held accountable,"" District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. ""Domestic violence creates chaos in our communities and shatters families. My office is committed to bringing stability back into the lives of those who have been victimized.""

Cornejo and Cabrera's three children were found safe in Peru and taken into protective custody.

At an Oval Office signing ceremony on Aug. 8 with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, President Trump was asked about recognizing Somaliland.

President Donald Trump is reportedly working on a move that would give the U.S. a new military and economic foothold in Africa, counter China and Russia, and strike a blow against Islamist terrorists in the region. And now a leading senator has told Fox News Digital this goal can be realized by recognizing the breakaway Somaliland as an independent state.

Somaliland, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991. Its government is said to be offering the U.S. a new air and sea base close to the entrance of the Red Sea, and directly across from Yemen and the Houthis, if the U.S. formally recognizes it. Thirty percent of the world's container ship traffic is reported to pass through its waters en route to or from the Suez Canal.

In the Oval Office on Aug. 8, Trump told reporters, ""We're looking into that right now,"" when asked about the recognition of Somaliland and the possible resettlement of Gazans there, adding, ""We're working on that right now, Somaliland.""

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., told Fox News Digital, ""There is a very real opportunity that President Trump will recognize Somaliland during this administration.""

Cruz added, ""President Trump is bringing a new era of clarity in American national security, after four years of the Biden administration rewarding our enemies and punishing our allies, and recognizing Somaliland should be part of this new era.

""Somaliland has been a reliable ally to the United States, is integrating itself with us and our allies globally, and is committed to helping us counter efforts by China to undermine the safety and prosperity of Americans,"" he said.

The White House did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

Neighboring Somalia has been battling Islamist fundamentalist fighters for decades. U.S. Africa Command has increased the number of airstrikes against both ISIS and al-Shabab terrorists under the current administration.

But Somaliland, 99% Muslim, has allegedly eliminated radicalism and has aligned itself with the U.S. and Israel, leading Cruz to tell Fox News Digital, ""They're a Muslim country, in a very dangerous part of Africa, showing real courage. I will continue to push for deepening the U.S.-Somaliland partnership, including through the Africa Subcommittee in the Senate, and I expect that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will be receptive to doing so.""

Earlier this month, Cruz wrote to President Trump about Somaliland, stating, ""it requires the status of a state. I urge you to grant it that recognition.""

Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, is optimistic, telling the British Guardian newspaper on May 30, ""Recognition is on the horizon."" He added, ""It's a matter of time. Not if, but when.""

Somaliland's port at Berbera is the jewel in any Washington deal. Analysts say it is in such a strategic position that both Russia and China have tried to acquire it. Right next door to it is one of Africa's five longest runways, offering the U.S. the possibility of both a sea and air base that can strike Houthi rebels to the north and Al Shabaab terrorists to the east.

In his letter to the White House, Cruz wrote, ""Somaliland has emerged as a critical security and diplomatic partner for the United States, helping America advance our national security interests in the Horn of Africa and beyond. It is strategically located along the Gulf of Aden, putting it near one of the world's busiest maritime corridors. It possesses capable armed forces and contributes to regional counterterrorism and piracy operations. It has proposed hosting a U.S. military presence near the Red Sea along the Gulf of Aden.""

The U.S.'s largest military base in Africa is just up the coast in Djibouti. But there are security and surveillance issues at the Camp Lemonnier U.S. base where the Chinese and other nations have opened their own bases and monitoring stations nearby.

Somaliland is also offering the White House access to rare earth minerals essential for high-tech industries, such as lithium and silicon quartz.

The U.S. has described Somalia, with large numbers of both ISIS and al-Qaida-linked operatives, as a terrorist safe haven. Now the increasing presence of China and military forces from countries such as Turkey is reportedly leading some in Washington to be increasingly unhappy with its ""one Somalia"" policy, where Somaliland continues to be recognized only as a part of Somalia.

For now, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital the official position: ""The United States recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, which includes the territory of Somaliland. The State Department is not in active discussions with Somaliland's representatives about a deal to recognize Somaliland as a state.""

But, Somaliland's foreign minister worked Washington's corridors and politicians in April, and several African sources, including the influential Horn Observer news outlet, have reported that President Abdullahi is expected to come to D.C. ""soon"". U.S. officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Somalia, Richard Riley, are said to have been to Somaliland to meet with the president at least three times this year.

Taylor Townsend let out a roar after upsetting No. 25-ranked Jelena Ostapenko, 7-5, 6-1, in her second-round match at the U.S. Open on Wednesday. 

But a face-to-face confrontation between the two competitors at center court was the biggest story coming out of Court 11. 

Townsend said that Ostapenko, a Latvian native who has a French Open title under her belt from 2017, said she has ""no class"" and ""no education.""

Townsend, who is Black, was asked by a reporter if Ostapenko's comments at the net had racial undertones. 

""I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,"" Townsend replied. 

""So, whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on. The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.""

Ostapenko wasn't asked by reporters, but she posted on Instagram about the confrontation, specifically talking about ""how many messages I received that I am a racist.""

""I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world,"" Ostapenko posted. ""For me, it doesn't matter where you come from.""

During the verbal altercation at the net, Ostapenko said something inaudible to Townsend as she went to shake the chair umpire's hand. It clearly irked Townsend, who had an exasperated expression on her face before things got a bit more heated. 

Ostapenko was seen waving her finger at Townsend while they jawed back and forth. 

""It's competition. People get upset when they lose,"" Townsend, who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said after the match.

Townsend added that in past matches against Ostapenko there was never any issues. 

""There's no beef on my side,"" she said. ""She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the U.S. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.""

Townsend's social media post began by saying she felt Townsend was ""disrespectful"" after not apologizing for the net cord helping her secure a point in the match. 

""There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,"" Ostapenko said. ""If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.""

Ostapenko also didn't like that Townsend warmed up before the match at the net instead of at the baseline. Townsend said she's been doing the routine for years and it has never been an issue.

Townsend is a star in WTA doubles, but in singles, she is ranked No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past Grand Slam champion at a major since Kristie Ahn, who just so happened to beat Ostapenko at the 2019 U.S. Open. 

Townsend has a tough third-round matchup against, as she will face No. 5-ranked Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old phenom, on Friday.

""Special Report"" with Bret Baier dives into Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser admitting President Donald Trump's crackdown has significantly decreased crime in the nation's capital.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser initially expressed fear of President Donald Trump's plan to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, but its clear success made her change her mind.

After Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops and assume oversight of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to tackle rising crime in Washington, D.C., Bowser warned such a crackdown would be ""unsettling and unprecedented.""

However, the mayor admitted at a press conference on Wednesday that the federal surge has made a noticeable impact on one of America's most famously dangerous cities.

At the briefing, Bowser displayed a chart crediting the influx of FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Park Police and Capitol Police with bolstering MPD's efforts and declared, ""We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD has been able to do in this city.""

She pointed to one dramatic example, saying, ""For carjackings, the difference between this period, this 20-day period of this federal surge and last year represents an 87% reduction in carjackings in Washington, D.C. We know that when carjackings go down, when use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason.""

Bowser offered further examples of Trump's new surge driving results.

""This is what we think in just a couple of weeks of experience has worked,"" she said. ""Having more federal law enforcement officers on the street — we think having more stops that got to illegal guns has helped. We think that there is more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior. We know that we have had fewer gun crimes, fewer homicides, and we have experienced an extreme reduction in carjackings.""

Bowser also cautioned that not every tactic has been successful, citing ""a break in trust between police and community, especially with new federal partners in our community.""

She criticized the use of masked ICE agents in neighborhoods and said relying on out-of-state National Guard troops was inefficient. The mayor added the city still needs more local police officers, prosecutors, judges and prevention programs while maintaining local control.

When later prompted by a reporter, Bowser argued that Trump seizing greater control of Union Station would be a ""good thing.""

""The Union Station is owned by the Department of Transportation and it will be a good thing because that station has suffered from needing, some say $12 billion, but let's call it at least $8 billion worth of investment in the renovation. And that is not something that the district will be able to support,"" she said. ""It is an important regional asset, it is an important asset for the Eastern Seaboard. It's an important asset for the nation. So, it is appropriate, in my view, for the federal government to make the necessary investments in the transformation of Union Station.""

Statesmen and diplomats are quick to claim success, but few acknowledge their role in failures. To date, the State Department has not issued any report on how the United States lost Turkey, once among its most trusted NATO partners.

There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to Turkey's transition from ally to adversary. Both Republican and Democratic administrations allowed wishful thinking to trump reality in their assessment of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Speaking alongside Erdogan in Ankara, then-President George W. Bush told the then-prime minister, “I appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a Muslim country and, at the same time, a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom.”

Former President Barack Obama listed Erdogan among his top foreign friends and said he trusted the Turkish leader so much that he even sought his advice on how to raise daughters. Obama omitted, however, the 1,400% increase in murders of women under Erdogan's regime. Not to be outdone, during his first term in office, President Donald Trump told Erdogan during a White House visit, “You're doing a fantastic job for the people of Turkey.” The Turkish people might disagree: Inflation was out of control, the Turkish currency in freefall, and Turkish political prisons busting at the seams.

While successive administrations treated Erdogan with kid gloves, no one bears as much responsibility for Turkey's descent into a terrorist-sponsoring dictatorship than Erdogan himself. The real mistake in Washington was both its blindness to Erdogan's anti-Western, pro-Muslim Brotherhood agenda and the tendency of some U.S. ambassadors to ingratiate themselves with Turkey's dictator by gratuitously undermining the opposition.

In 2006, as secular opposition parties and Turkey's military began to raise alarms over Erdogan's growing Islamism and the “threat of religious reactionaries,” U.S. Ambassador Ross Wilson dismissed the opposition's warnings as part of the opposition's “cacophony.” Wilson's tone-deaf remarks raised outrage at the time, as Erdogan interpreted them as a green light to continue his drive to undermine Turkey's already weak democratic norms.

It is now déjà vu all over again. Just under six months ago, Turkish police arrested Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul and Erdogan's chief opponent. Turks understand that Erdogan views demonstrations as an opportunity to make further arrests as opponents concentrate in a single location. Rather than march, then, demonstrators began to boycott stores and brands associated with Erdogan and his top supporters. As the boycotts continue, Erdogan complains but is powerless to stop them. They are important as they signal that the Turkish people do not consent to Erdogan's repression or the conspiracy theories that consume the president.

Alas, U.S. Ambassador Tom Barrack, Trump's longtime business associate and friend, repeats the mistakes of his predecessors, confusing ingratiation with U.S. national security. On Monday, he visited a coffee shop boycotted by Turks and posed with its owner, whom Turks believe is a cheerleader for Erdogan and his Islamist rule.

DNC CHAIRMAN KEN MARTIN RETRACTS PRO-ISRAEL RESOLUTION AS DEMOCRATS' GAZA TENSIONS SNAP

Gratuitously undermining Turkey's opposition is unwise in both the short and long term. Trump sees himself as a deal-maker, and his doctrine is transactional. Signaling that he gets U.S.-buy without offering concessions is not the way to maximize U.S. gain.

In the long term, a more liberal, pro-Western Turkey should be the clear U.S. interest. The eastern Mediterranean will not be stable until Turkey is at peace with itself and its neighbors. That can never happen so long as Erdogan cracks down on secular opposition and instead sponsors Hamas and incites violence against Israel, Jews, and Americans. It is time to bring Barrack home before he causes more damage with his blind spot, if not enthusiasm, for the region's most radical Islamist movements.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","CDC director's lawyers say firing is ‘legally deficient' based on a technicality","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3785597/cdc-director-susan-monarez-firing-legally-deficient/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:27:18 GMT","

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez's lawyers rejected her firing by the Trump administration, arguing that only President Donald Trump himself could fire her.

Monarez surprised many earlier on Wednesday when her lawyers rebuffed reports that she had resigned, saying she would not do so. Later that evening, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that Monarez was “no longer” head of the CDC after a protracted disagreement with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. The move came after days of pressure from Kennedy and other administration officials over whether she would support rescinding certain approvals for COVID-19 vaccines, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post.

In a statement early Thursday morning, Monarez's lawyers once again rebuffed the White House after it said she had been “terminated.”

“Our client was notified tonight by White House staff in the personnel office that she was fired. As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her,” her lawyer Mark Zaid said in a statement on Bluesky.

“For this reason, we reject notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our position,” he added.

Zaid is a longtime critic of Trump, representing many disaffected staffers suing the administration during his second term.

Trump nominated Monarez to lead the CDC, and she was confirmed to the position in July. She feuded behind the scenes with Kennedy for some time, but their disagreements came out into the open over her attempted ousting. Her lawyers argued she was being targeted for refusing “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives.”

Monarez had sent a note to CDC employees on Aug. 12, shortly after a shooting targeting CDC headquarters, warning that the “dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.”

The Trump administration sought her resignation on Wednesday, though she refused to do so. Her attorneys said Wednesday night that she “has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”

White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner roughly an hour later that Monarez had been terminated.

TRUMP CDC DIRECTOR OUSTED LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER TAKING OFFICE

“As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,” he said. “Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position.”

Kennedy's unorthodox approach to public health has led to a slew of resignations at the CDC, including Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's chief medical officer; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump rips Utah court order to redraw electoral map as ‘absolutely unconstitutional'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3785457/trump-utah-court-order-redraw-map-absolutely-unconstitutional/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 01:31:47 GMT","

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a new order from a Utah judge, who ruled that the state's congressional map must be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections, was “absolutely unconstitutional.”

“How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress, and we want to keep it that way,” he added. “The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED, and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!”

Utah's congressional delegation, comprising Reps. Blake Moore (R-UT), Celeste Maloy (R-UT), Mike Kennedy (R-UT), and Burgess Owens (R-UT), is entirely Republican.

United States District Judge Dianna Gibson took issue with Utah's all-Republican House delegation, saying the Republican-controlled state legislature illegally overruled a 2018 ballot measure designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering.

“Redistricting is not a mere exercise in political line-drawing; it strikes at the very heart of our democracy,” Gibson wrote in Monday's order.

“The way district boundaries are drawn determines whether the right to vote is meaningful, whether equal protection is honored, and whether the fundamental promises of our state and federal constitutions are upheld,” she continued. “How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices, and weaken the rule of law.”

The judge ordered Utah state lawmakers to revise the congressional map within 30 days using guidelines approved by voters in the 2018 ballot measure.

UTAH CONGRESSIONAL MAP MUST BE REDRAWN FOR 2026 ELECTIONS, JUDGE RULES

Utah, a predominantly Republican state, backed Trump by more than 20 points in the last presidential election. However, Salt Lake County remains a Democratic stronghold that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last November. Adopted in 2021, the current congressional map divides the county among the state's four GOP-leaning districts.

Redistricting has triggered an intense battle between Republicans and Democrats over who can constitute the House majority. Texas started aggressively redistricting to strip Democrats of five seats, followed by California's efforts to raise the issue for a popular vote this fall.

Brandishing his loyalty to President Donald Trump and keeping retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) at arm's length has proven to be an early, lucrative campaign fundraising tactic for Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) in his quest to replace the former Senate GOP leader.

“I don't just talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr, serving his seventh term, told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “I'm doing it every day.”

But despite his close relationship with the president and backing from a string of MAGA allies in Congress, Barr remains in pursuit of the coveted Trump endorsement.

So too are the two men with whom he's locked in a bitter primary challenge for Kentucky's open Senate seat next year, being vacated by McConnell: former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and wealthy businessman Nate Morris.

Discussions with Trump or those in his orbit are to remain “private conversations,” Barr said. But in between rattling off Trump's policy wins over the years that he's played a hand in, the Senate hopeful projected confidence that he'd be the obvious choice for an endorsement. That is, should the president choose to weigh in.

“There's politicians who like to talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr said. “There's politicians who like to talk about the One Big, Beautiful Bill. I have to write it. I have to pass it. And I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative.”

Although limited independent polling on one of the nastier Republican Senate primaries of the 2026 midterm elections, surveys earlier this year suggested Cameron had a commanding double-digit lead. Barr's campaign said an internal poll taken earlier this month and provided to the Washington Examiner shows positive momentum for Barr after months of crisscrossing the state with nearly 60 events, despite being outspent by Morris on the airwaves.

Among 600 likely Kentucky GOP primary voters and a margin of error of plus or minus four points, Barr had a net positive image rating of 16 percentage points from respondents compared to Morris's net negative rating of four percentage points.

Still, Cameron appeared to be leading the pack, thanks to his broader name recognition from holding statewide office. His net positive rating was 40 percentage points.

In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Morris condemned Barr as a phony MAGA loyalist, citing episodes like donating through his leadership PAC to now-former House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and accused him of flip-flopping on issues now that he's running for higher office. 

“Andy Barr blamed Donald Trump for January 6th. He backed the members of Congress who tried to throw Trump out of office. Barr tried for years to sabotage President Trump's tariff agenda. He spent millions of taxpayer dollars on DEI nonsense,” Morris said. “Barr even called people who want to deport illegals ‘nativists' and funded Congress's latest attempt at mass amnesty. If Andy Barr is MAGA, then so is Hillary Clinton.” 

Opponents have criticized Morris for a 2021 campaign donation to former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, who went on to run for president against Trump, and his past promotions of DEI as a former CEO.

Similar to Morris, the Cameron campaign accused Barr of realigning himself with conservatism for the primary and referred to him as “McConnell's handpicked candidate,” though McConnell has declined to get involved in a contest where its participants are all clambering to be the least associated. Cameron was once considered his protege, and Barr previously referred to him as a “mentor.”

“He's a creature of D.C. who spent decades shaking down Big Banks and Big Pharma for checks to fund his re-brand from moderate RINO to whatever this is now,” Cameron Campaign Manager Taylor Zanazzi said in a statement.

Analysis by Govtrack.us, an independent Congress tracker, rates Barr as skewed the farthest politically right among his House colleagues from Kentucky. There is no direct comparison available for Cameron and Morris. 

The Republican trio has sought to tap into their most conservative ideologies while keeping a safe distance from McConnell, who has a prior relationship with all three from his decades atop Kentucky GOP politics. 

Morris has went a step further in seeking to keep distance from McConnell. A former McConnell intern who held a fundraiser for him a decade ago, Morris now refers to him as “the nastiest politician in the history of America.”

An establishment figure with an icy relationship toward Trump, McConnell has proven to be a political liability in a modern-day Republican primary, even if that race is for the very seat he's vacating.

“I've been asked for 13 years, as a member of Congress from Kentucky, are you a Rand Paul Republican or a Mitch McConnell Republican? I'm neither,” Barr said. “I'm an Andy Barr Republican, and I'm proud to have supported President Trump in both his first four years, and I'm the strongest supporter in the House.”

The ability to raise funds may not tell the whole story, as polling has shown Cameron, despite his campaign coffers, vastly trailing Barr. But it offers a window into where supporters and potential voters are most eager to put their money, and it could play a role in who other influential Republicans choose to back.

Fundraising data available through June showed that Barr raised a hefty $6.1 million, compared to Cameron's roughly $530,000.

Morris presents a wildcard factor in the fundraising fight. Since entering the race, he's yet to face a filing deadline, and he has the financial ability to self-fund his campaign. He launched a seven-figure ad buy just days after declaring his candidacy in July.

BARR LEADS CAMERON IN FUNDRAISING IN KENTUCKY GOP SENATE PRIMARY

McConnell has shown no desire to get involved in the chaotic three-way contest. But his establishment donors apparently feel otherwise. Wealthy party donors linked to McConnell and other GOP leaders have already put millions of dollars into kneecapping Morris's candidacy.

“I don't know about McConnell donors. What I do know about are my donors,” Barr said. “I know about people who are supporting me, and they're supporting me because they know, No. 1, that I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative who believes in limited government, free enterprises, strong national defense.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Can the origin of language can be traced to child care?

If you have spent time with an infant, you might recognize the scene: A child is wailing, inconsolable, and you, the parent, have to go to the bathroom. Or eat. Or attend to a pot that's boiling over. But someone needs to watch the baby.

Such urgent situations often call for innovation. In modern times, we might negotiate schedules with our partners, seek out affordable child care, or purchase “baby-tainment” contraptions via our phones. Sometimes, in moments of desperation, we could even allow our tiny offspring to stare at said phones for some respite.

But a long time ago, our early-human ancestors were caring for children under decidedly more precarious conditions. Receiving some help with the baby could be a matter of life and death. A new book argues that the prehistoric need for assistance may have been so intense that it led to the creation of one of the human species' most defining traits: language.

In The Origin of Language, Madeleine Beekman, a professor emerita of evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology, considers human evolution through the often-neglected lens of child-rearing, bringing a relatively new perspective to the field. Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, most popular theories of evolution focused on male-dominated, and in many cases aggressive, activities such as hunting, fighting, toolmaking, and semen-spreading to understand our development as a species.

But Beekman, along with a growing number of scholars, many of them women, emphasizes familial care in our understanding of human evolution. Specifically, she turns to the scenario of a needy small child relying on a parent, in attempting to unlock the mystery of the origin of human language.

Read: Parenthood cannot be optimized.

Beekman begins the book by tracing the evolutionary steps that made language possible—and necessary. First came the biological changes to the human body, genetic mutations followed by natural selection. At one point during our transition from ape to human, our heads shifted position so we could stand erect, and our vocal cords elongated, which then allowed us to make a wider variety of sounds. (Lest you believe evolution always knows best, these changes also made it very easy to choke. Today, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.)

Meanwhile, because of diet and other factors, our early ancestors' brains kept growing and growing. Their brains got so big, so complex, that they failed to reach a state of maturity inside the womb. Some biologists theorize that early human fetuses' heads risked growing too large to pass through the pelvis; others believe that gestating brains required too much energy for a pregnant woman to sustain them through self-sufficiency. For whatever reason, our babies emerged from the womb less mature in comparison with other species.

What does this have to do with language? Beekman ties it all together like this: Early humans were giving birth to deeply vulnerable and demanding offspring, and they couldn't manage with the tools they had; this is where vocal cords came in handy. In time, Beekman argues, people strung together noises—pah, mah, kah, dah, and so on—into words, and then structured those words into syntax and grammar, in order to help them cooperate and communicate, first and foremost, with and about their offspring.

Beekman proposes a novel answer to a question that has long confounded evolutionary thinkers. Although many evolutionary biologists are reluctant to single out homo sapiens as exceptional among all living things, there is something undeniably unusual about language—its musicality, complexity, and clear relationship to abstract thinking. Alfred Russel Wallace, a co-discoverer of natural selection alongside Charles Darwin, famously struggled with placing language into the long arc of evolution; his successors have not done much better. In fact, in the mid-to-late-1800s academic societies in France and the United Kingdom banned discussion of the origins of language because scientists felt this part of the field was too speculative.

The consensus that the origins of language could not be rigorously investigated lasted until the middle of the 20th century. In the late 1950s, Burrhus Frederic Skinner theorized that language acquisition is similar to other types of learning. He thought the construction of words essentially amounted to a matching game between sounds and meanings, aimed squarely at the practicalities of communication. Later, Noam Chomsky published a competing set of explanations. Chomsky thought that humans were born with a “language acquisition device” that allowed us to make sense of syntax and grammar. Speech was not just a matter of mechanical ability; it was also an expression of uniquely human symbolic understanding.

Read: Noam Chomsky on where artificial intelligence went wrong

Beekman writes that there's partial support for both theories: Language is both innate and acquired, meaning we are born with a complex receptivity to it, and we also learn it through matching games. Yet Beekman contends that neither of these concepts elucidates the origin of language, without which it is impossible to understand its prehistoric function.

So what catalyzed the leap from the nonlinguistic communication found in the animal kingdom—the eye contact, the grunts, the chest-beating—to the words you are reading right now? Beekman argues that language developed slowly to fulfill the requirements of child-rearing. “With every improved fragment of speech, and every moment of shared understanding, we raised the likelihood our babies—and our species—would survive,” she writes.

Over time, Beekman argues, more and more humans attempted to use language, and as they engaged with it, the neural connections in their brains adapted to it—a process known as neuroplasticity. Those humans who were good at it, even in its most rudimentary forms, would have a real advantage. Young children who could verbally express their needs were more likely to survive than those who could not. And mothers who communicated effectively were more likely to figure out their children's needs. They may have also been more likely to corral assistance from other caregivers, thus increasing the odds that their children would live into adulthood—and that they themselves would make it through the dark and dangerous tunnel of childbirth and early parenthood and go on to have more children.

Beekman furthers her argument by taking a close look at the psychology of babies. Although they are born fairly helpless, infants have a few survival tricks up their swaddles. They are “master mind readers,” Beekman writes—deeply attuned to the body language and psychological state of their overseers. This quickly developing sense of another person's consciousness, and a desire to connect with it, could have laid the groundwork for language acquisition.

My main frustration with this book is that it takes a while to arrive at the human parent-child relationship, instead focusing on larger evolutionary questions, and once it gets there Beekman rushes through explorations of the day-to-day realities for our long-ago ancestors. I understand that any such portrait would be speculative, and that a lingering look into the communicative capabilities of, for example, ants can teach us something about homo sapiens. Still, I yearned for more homo sapiens.

Read: Want to understand Socrates and Sartre? Talk with your kid.

Beekman makes it clear from the beginning that all theorizing on the origins of language is conjecture: “We have no consensus, and perhaps never will, because the soft tissue involved in thinking and talking doesn't fossilize.” Nevertheless, the past two decades in evolutionary thought have brought more attention to the idea that child care shaped our species in fundamental ways. The anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy has written extensively about the cooperative nature of raising children through early human history, arguing that no single mom had the resources to raise a child on her own. Hrdy believes that our broader capacity to cooperate comes from the need to collaborate over child care. Dean Falk, who specializes in paleoneurology, has suggested that language originated with mothers who needed a way to connect with their babies when they got tired of holding them, and thus developed sounds to soothe them at a distance.

This recent focus on care and interdependence has some historical roots. Most of us associate Darwin with his theories on competition, or the “survival of the fittest”—a phrase he didn't write, but would later go on to use. Less widely known is his writing on cooperation. “Communities which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members, would flourish best, and rear the greatest number of offspring,” he writes in The Descent of Man. As Darwin saw it, this impulse to be good to others is rooted in our affection for our children.

When Beekman and other thinkers bring the realm of parental care into their work, they are making the case for how central this component of human survival has been in our collective formation. Having babies didn't just ensure the future of humanity in a practical, assembly-line kind of way. The complicated and enriching work of raising individual babies was also important, pushing humans to discover new internal capacities and modes of connection.

These observations are relevant beyond academic or prehistoric settings. Parenthood, in much of the world, is now a far more isolated undertaking than it was for our ancestors. This likely has a lot to do with the fact that advancements in technology and standards of living have allowed parents to raise kids without much communal help. But just because we can manage siloed parenting in practical terms doesn't mean it is the healthiest way to do so for parent or child. Beekman's reading of the distant past gives us a chance to reckon with just how unnatural it is for parents to go it alone in the present and just how much we might be losing in the process. Caring for kids has been—and could be again—a collective effort that pushes us to imagine (or rediscover) different ways of living. Language is one example of an innovation that may well have been born of interdependence. What else might we learn about ourselves by viewing our past, and perhaps our future, as a story of cooperative care? To find out, we would have to reexamine how we think about parenting.

One of the prickliest issues in business over the past decade is encapsulated in a single word: diversity. Starting in the 2000s, the received wisdom from consultants and human-resource firms was that increasing some kinds of diversity—predominantly race and gender—would improve not only fairness but business outcomes as well. A boom in DEI programs occurred at organizations large and small. These programs institutionalized new hiring and promotion targets, mandated diversity training, and revised grievance systems.

Two decades on, DEI programs have come under attack. Some of this criticism has involved a political backlash, but some has involved research questioning their effectiveness. As far back as 2016, Harvard Business Review published an article titled “Why Diversity Programs Fail,” showing that, as generally practiced, DEI programs actually reduced gender and racial diversity in companies. Last year, psychologists reviewing the literature found that these policies also generally lowered the performance of the targeted groups and increased the perception of workplace unfairness. Many companies are now rapidly unwinding DEI programs.

Companies tend to run in a herd, which results in being either all in or all out for an innovation such as DEI. But if we allow the debate about DEI to fall into this binary trap, where diversity is just great or totally terrible, we risk losing some important insights. Instead, we should expand our understanding of the ways that diversity can truly enhance organizational success, and focus on those.

There are two kinds of human diversity. The first is the type celebrated by the philosopher Aristotle, who argued that because “of all animals man alone is capable of deliberation,” we have a unique potential to be the most diverse species on Earth. He was talking about what modern researchers call acquired attributes—education, skills, opinions, and the like. This is not the kind of diversity that most DEI programs focus on, which is the second type, based on innate or inherited attributes such as race.

Conor Friedersdorf: ‘DEI' has lost all meaning

The early business case for higher diversity of this second type came from studies purporting to find that it was good for financial performance. One such survey in 2009 linked greater representation of women and minorities on sales teams to better results; another study, involving experiments with college students, showed that when small teams assigned a murder-mystery puzzle were all white, they discussed the problem less than when they included a minority member, and the greater discussion led to improved outcomes.

Whether these benefits resulted specifically from greater racial and gender diversity was not clear, however. Another plausible explanation is that the team's decision making improved by having people on the team from different backgrounds and with divergent experiences and opinions—diversity more of the Aristotelian variety, which newer research finds to be truly valuable. The most effective teams are cognitively and creatively diverse, combining people who come up with different kinds of ideas with others who are good at developing those ideas.

This is especially important for driving innovation, according to a 2020 study. But it doesn't stop with creative style. The authors also found that ideological diversity among colleagues—seeing the world in different, even opposing ways—was beneficial (though “too much” ideological diversity, implying more frequent disagreement, had a negative effect on innovation). An obvious conclusion from this finding is that viewpoint diversity protects against groupthink, which has been shown to harm companies.

This isn't so easy, however. Some people naturally embrace or resist diversity in ideas and thinking, which is at least in part a function of personality. Writing in 2023 in the Journal of Research in Personality, three psychologists found that people high in extroversion and openness enjoy “psychological richness” (meaning diverse experiences that change a person's perspective) much more than introverts and those low in openness. Personality traits such as these are about half genetic. And for some people, a resistance to new ideas is biological: Research has linked varying degrees of openness with activity of the amygdala, which also controls the fight-or-flight response. In short, it is possible that new ideas might scare some people.

Achieving ideological diversity in the workplace is especially tricky because, in aggregate, people's resistance to accepting political differences is growing. According to the polling firm YouGov, back in 2016, only 10 percent of both Republicans and Democrats said they had no friends with whom they significantly differed politically; by 2020, this figure had risen to 12 percent for Republicans and 24 percent for Democrats. This trend was corroborated by the research firm Generation Lab and the publication Axios, which found in 2021 that 71 percent of college students who are Democrats said they wouldn't go on a date with a Republican, while 31 percent of Republican college students said they wouldn't date a Democrat. Similarly, 41 percent of Democratic college students would not support a Republican-run business, 37 percent would not be friends with a Republican, and 30 percent would not work for one. (The Republican numbers regarding Democrats were 7, 5, and 7 percent.) You probably have your own ideas about how to account for this. Unfortunately, though, I am not aware of any differential studies of the amygdala response of progressives and conservatives.

Whatever the fate of modern DEI programs in corporate America, diversity of experience, thought, and ideology is a meritorious goal for a company to pursue. Done right, it will be good for business. Here are three pointers for that purpose.

1. Demographic proxies are not enough for useful diversity.

I have little doubt that diversity of ideas and experience correlate to some degree with categories of race and gender. But the research above has shown the possible costs of using these categories as proxy measures. This practice may harm the very people they purport to help, not least by making implicit assumptions about the way people of a particular gender or race think and act—which is not just incorrect and counterproductive, but also fairly insulting. Companies need to identify different kinds of thinkers without relying on demographic categories as a shortcut to do the sorting.

Listen: The great political sort is happening at the office

2. Look for people with high openness to new ideas.

The diversity that has the greatest business benefit is in people's style of thinking and how they see the world. Look for ways to get more balance and broader representation in your workplace by making this a priority. For example, search specifically both for people who have a lot of ideas and for people who are passionate about bringing ideas to fruition. By all means, seek those who learned critical-thinking skills at good universities, but also seek those formed by very different experiences—in the military, in missionary or volunteer work, or through a hardscrabble childhood.

3. Get serious about political diversity.

I shared the evidence on political intolerance, but political views might seem a special case, outside the concept of diversity we're trying to address here. I don't believe it is. By all means, encourage civility and tolerance at work—no one needs a pot-stirrer who bullies others with their opinions and creates bad blood—but true political diversity can offer a trove of valuable market information and keep organizations from making errors. Think of the companies that have stumbled into a major political controversy because they assumed that what everyone in their bubble thinks is the same as what everyone in the rest of this huge country thinks. Political diversity protects against that.

Diversity of thought is, in many ways, harder to be comfortable with than demographic diversity. Here's one last thought about how to make viewpoint diversity easier to achieve in the workplace and in life: Cultivate curiosity. I have written previously that a good way to achieve a more harmonious life with friends and relatives who vote and think differently is to adopt the mindset of a social scientist, genuinely fascinated by the things that others believe and say, without having either to agree or to do battle. Lots of research shows that such curiosity about others can foster trust, well-being, even health.

Corporate leaders are in an ideal position to turn curiosity about others' beliefs into a cultural norm. This will attract and empower the diversity most needed in our society today. And it'll be great for their business, too.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In the era of grade inflation, students at top colleges are more stressed than ever.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

During their final meeting of the spring 2024 semester, after an academic year marked by controversies, infighting, and the defenestration of the university president, Harvard's faculty burst out laughing. As was tradition, the then-dean of Harvard College, Rakesh Khurana, had been providing updates on the graduating class. When he got to GPA, Khurana couldn't help but chuckle at how ludicrously high it was: about 3.8 on average. The rest of the room soon joined in, according to a professor present at the meeting.

They were cracking up not simply because grades had gotten so high but because they knew just how little students were doing to earn them.

Last year, the university set out to study the state of academics at Harvard. The Classroom Social Compact Committee released its report in January. Students' grades are up, but they're doing less academic work. They skip class at a rate that surprises even the most hardened professors. Many care more about extracurriculars than coursework. “A majority of students and faculty we heard from agree that Harvard College students do not prioritize their academic experience,” the committee wrote.

And yet, these students report being more stressed about school than ever. Without meaningful grades, the most ambitious students have no straightforward way to stand out. And when straight A's are the norm, the prospect of getting even a single B can become terrifying. As a result, students are anxious, distracted, and hyper-focused on using extracurriculars to distinguish themselves in the eyes of future employers.

From the November 2024 issue: The elite college students who can't read books

Of course, plenty of Harvard students are still devoted to their schoolwork, and rampant grade inflation is not unique to any one college. It affects all of elite academia. But Harvard is a useful case study because administrators have examined the issue, and because as goes Harvard, so goes the rest of the sector. And now Harvard is, at long last, embarking on an effort to reverse the trend and make its programming more academically rigorous. In doing so, it's confronting a question that would be absurd if it weren't so urgent: Can the world's top universities get their students to care about learning?

The road to grade-inflation hell was paved with good intentions. As more students applied to Harvard and earning a spot became ever harder, the university ended up filling its classes with students who had only ever gotten perfect grades. These overachievers arrived on campus with even more anxiety than past generations about keeping up their GPA. Students sobbing at office hours, begging their professor to bump a rare B+ to an A–, became a not-uncommon occurrence.

At the same time, professors were coming under more pressure to tend to their students' emotional well-being, Amanda Claybaugh, Harvard's dean of undergraduate education, told me. They received near-constant reminders that Harvard was admitting more students with disabilities, who'd matriculated from under-resourced schools, or who had mental-health issues. Instructors took the message as an exhortation to lower expectations and raise grades. Resisting the trend was hard. Few professors want to be known as harsh graders, with the accompanying poor evaluations and low course enrollments. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker told me that, 20 years ago, he gave a quarter of the students in his intro psych course an A or A–. Then students stopped signing up. Now almost two-thirds of the class are in the A range.

The pandemic only made matters worse. In 2011, 60 percent of all grades at Harvard were in the A range (up from 33 percent in 1985). By the 2020–21 academic year, that share had risen to 79 percent. Students were more anxious than ever, so professors further eroded norms to help them.

Taken together, this has led to a regime in which most students get near-perfect grades, but the grades mean something different to everyone. Outside observers might still think of grades as an objective assessment of a student's work, and therefore a way to differentiate between levels of achievement. But many professors seem to conceive of them as an endlessly adaptable participation trophy. Claybaugh recalled a recent talk with an experienced science professor who told her that some students get A's for excellent work. Others get the mark because they're from less-privileged backgrounds and demonstrated improvement throughout the semester. And still others get A's because they were doing strong work before a mental-health crisis derailed their progress. “So pretty much everyone gets A's,” Claybaugh told me. “That's where we've ended up.”

Without the threat of poor grades, students have largely stopped trying in their courses. Pinker told me that student performance on the multiple-choice portion of his final exam (which he has kept mostly the same) has declined by 10 percentage points over the past two decades, even as he gives out more A's. An incoming Harvard junior, who requested anonymity to avoid affecting her future job prospects, told me that, for all the hand-wringing about student self-censorship, her peers mostly don't read texts closely enough to form opinions in the first place. “I feel like college has become almost anti-intellectual,” Melani Cammett, a Harvard international-affairs professor, told me. “This is the place where we're supposed to deal with big ideas, and yet students are not really engaging with them.”

That easy A's would lead students to phone in their coursework should have been predictable. What's genuinely surprising is that the system has also failed to reduce stress. The percentage of first-year students who have received counseling has nearly tripled in the past decade. This tension nagged at me during my own time in college. I graduated from Yale two years ago. While there, I experienced many of the same dynamics that Harvard professors and students described to me. The classes were mostly easy. Hardly anyone did the reading. We could all expect to be rewarded with an A or, at the very worst, a B. And yet students were always panicking. It felt at times as though campus was in the throes of a collective psychotic break. It wasn't until I graduated that I, like Harvard's professors and administrators, came to see these issues—lax grading, high stress—as connected.

When everyone gets an A, an A starts to mean very little. The kind of student that gets admitted to Harvard (or any elite college) wants to compete. They've spent their lives clawing upward. Khurana, the former dean, observed that Harvard students want success to feel meaningful. Getting all A's is necessary, but insufficient.

This has created what Claybaugh called a “shadow system of distinction.” Students now use extracurriculars to differentiate themselves from their peers. They've created a network of finance and consulting clubs that are almost indistinguishable from full-time jobs. To apply, students submit résumés, sit for interviews, and prepare a fake case or deliverable. At this point, the odds of getting into some clubs within Harvard are similar to the odds of being accepted to the college in the first place. The Harvard junior told me that she hadn't considered going into consulting or investment banking before she arrived in Cambridge. But because the clubs are so exclusive, everyone wants to be chosen. She ended up applying. “There are a handful of clubs that you can just join, but the clubs people want to join are typically not the clubs everyone can join,” she told me. “Even volunteering clubs or service-oriented clubs have an application process. They're highly competitive.” Things have gotten to the point where some students feel guilty for focusing on schoolwork at the expense of extracurriculars, she told me.

Max Palys, an incoming Harvard senior, told me that coursework doesn't prepare students to answer interview questions for finance and consulting jobs. The only way to get ready is through extracurriculars or on one's own time. By sophomore year, his friends were fully absorbed in the internship-recruiting process. They took the easiest classes they could find and did the bare-minimum coursework to reserve time to prepare for technical interviews.

This hypercompetitive club culture advantages students who come from fancy high schools. Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and a co-chair of the Classroom Social Compact Committee, pointed out that Harvard devotes considerable resources to helping less-privileged students succeed academically. But that kind of assistance is useless to the extent that extracurricular clubs, which prioritize students who already have experience, are the coin of the realm.

Now that they know that making college easier doesn't reduce stress, Harvard administrators are attempting to rediscover a morsel of lost wisdom from the ancient past: School should be about academics. In March, the faculty amended the student handbook to emphasize the highly novel point that students should prioritize their schoolwork. The university has advised professors to set attendance policies and make clear that students, contrary to their intuition, are expected to come to class. And it formed a new committee to consider how to rein in runaway grade inflation. The committee is considering proposals such as switching from letter grades to a numerical scale (to get rid of students' frame of reference) or reporting grades as the difference between what a student earned and the course median. In the meantime, Claybaugh has asked each department to standardize and toughen its grading policies. Faculty will need to move collectively so no one gets singled out as a harsh grader.

Fixing grade inflation, however, is easier said than done. Princeton, for example, experimented with an informal 35 percent cap on the share of A's that professors were expected to give out. It abandoned the effort after a 2014 faculty report found, among other things, that the policy made it harder to recruit students, particularly student athletes. Beginning in 1998, Cornell began including courses' median grades on student transcripts. Far from mitigating grade inflation, the practice only made the problem worse by giving students extra insight into which classes were the easiest. Last year, the faculty senate voted to end the policy.

Claybaugh assured me that Harvard is committed to bringing about a lasting culture change around learning. She thinks of the change as a matter of fairness. Harvard students have access to a trove of intellectual treasures and the chance to commune with many of the greatest living minds. “If we have the world's biggest university library, then our students should be reading these books,” Claybaugh told me. “And if the students we're admitting don't want to read those books, or if we have set up an incentive structure that dissuades them from reading these books, then that is immoral, and we need to reincentivize them to do so.”

If Harvard is to succeed where Princeton and Cornell failed, it will be because the political environment has given its initiative an extra level of urgency. The Trump administration's assault on elite institutions generally and Harvard in particular has put the university's public standing at stake. Claybaugh believes that the best way to help Harvard is to acknowledge its flaws and try to fix them. Bringing rigor back to the academic mission seems a natural place to start. “We should be making sure that we are living up to our mission to restore our legitimacy in people's eyes,” she told me. “I don't want people all across America thinking, It's a place of ideas I find somehow troubling or offensive, and also, no one goes to class.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The president of the United States is attempting a hostile takeover of the Fed's board of governors.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On Monday evening, President Donald Trump opened up a new front in his campaign to take control of the Federal Reserve. He released a letter on social media purporting to fire Lisa Cook, a Joe Biden–appointed member of the Fed's seven-person board of governors. The letter is part of what appears to be a coordinated effort by the administration to fill a majority of the board with loyalists. It is also a consequence of the Supreme Court's willingness to throw out bedrock precedent and accept broad assertions of presidential power. The Court has created the conditions for a very dangerous situation: If the justices allow Trump's removal of Cook to take effect, there will be little to stop him from driving other board members from their posts, and seizing power over the money supply.

The Federal Reserve is one of the few holdouts in Trump's assault on American institutions. Capturing it would provide the president with a big prize. Established by Congress to promote economic expansion, the Fed primarily oversees the country's banks. To that end, it can create cash out of thin air. Although Congress designed the Fed to use this power in limited ways, beginning in the 1950s, the Fed has repeatedly deployed its “printing press” to reshape the financial system. And since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed's reach has grown considerably, with the central bank providing extensive ad hoc support to select financial firms, especially during periods of instability.

Conventional wisdom has been that, given the dangers of putting an infinitely extensible balance sheet under the control of a single person, the Fed will survive Trump's onslaught. Although the Fed's board is not wholly independent of the president—its members are selected by him—the president is not legally permitted under the Federal Reserve Act to remove board members at will or direct how they carry out their duties. The law authorizes the president to remove board members only for cause.

Rogé Karma: The Lisa Cook case could be the whole ball game

The Fed's board is one of a variety of government institutions whose leaders possess some form of tenure in office, including the federal courts (whose judges can be removed only by Congress) and multimember commissions such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and National Labor Relations Board, whose members can also be removed by the president only for cause.

Since taking office, however, Trump has repeatedly violated these restrictions. He has summarily dismissed, without cause, members of multiple agencies, including the NLRB, the FTC, and the Merit Systems Protection Board. And he has argued that he is entitled to ignore the law, because it unconstitutionally interferes with his inherent executive power.

This argument is not new. It has been made—and rejected—before. In 1935, the Supreme Court famously, and unanimously, decided that Franklin D. Roosevelt lacked the power to remove a member of the FTC without cause, notwithstanding an opinion the Court had issued nine years earlier, in which Chief Justice William Howard Taft (a former U.S. president) had endorsed a broad conception of presidential power. In the 1935 case, Humphrey's Executor v. U.S., the Court repudiated much of Taft's reasoning and concluded that Congress had the power to insulate multimember commissions, such as the FTC, from direct presidential control.

Just weeks after Humphrey's Executor came down, Congress relied on it to significantly expand the Fed's powers, a move that legislators were willing to make only in conjunction with changes that barred the president from firing board officials except for cause. In the decades since, the Court has repeatedly upheld similar removal limits on the grounds that they further, rather than hinder, the constitutional design. Congress meanwhile established various government agencies with semiautonomy from the White House, believing—rightly—that such autonomy can improve the quality of regulation produced by these bodies, by insulating them from partisan pressure and undue influence from businesses and other interests.

So earlier this year, when Trump fired two officials, one at the NLRB and one at the Merit Systems Protection Board, without cause, the lower federal courts ruled against him. But then, in May, six Supreme Court justices stepped in to embrace some of the president's arguments. In a stunning two-page ruling, Trump v. Wilcox, they forced these term-tenured officials out of their job, at least while Trump's appeals are pending.

Still, some Fed stalwarts took heart. Although the Federal Reserve made up no part of the case, the Court carved it out from the ruling. The Federal Reserve, the justices announced, would not necessarily be covered by their new interpretation of the president's constitutional powers, because “the Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” In other words, the Fed is special.

Annie Lowrey: The markets won't save the Fed from Trump

But the Court's carve-out was not as helpful as it seemed. Part of the problem is that it doesn't make a lot of sense. The Fed's board is not uniquely structured—it's legally equivalent to the other multimember commissions that Trump is attacking. Nor is it quasi-private; it is an ordinary government agency. Nor does it really seem to follow in the tradition of the Bank of the United States, which was a bank. The Federal Reserve Board is a bank regulator.

Another problem is that Wilcox is a new precedent for officials who are challenging their removal (as Cook is now). If these officials cannot serve while litigation is ongoing, then the president has an incentive to remove people even if the administration thinks the president may ultimately lose the case. And then there is the larger context: In Wilcox, the Court embraced an expansive theory of presidential power and accommodated the president's removals when it should have enforced binding precedent. It therefore raised the likelihood that the Court would adopt a more deferential approach to “for cause” removals, one that is consistent with such a broad conception of the presidency.

Over the past few months, the administration certainly appears to have been testing out this possibility.

Since Wilcox, the White House has targeted Fed governors, in some cases publicly airing possible grounds for dismissing them. Jay Powell, whom Trump himself appointed as Fed chair back in 2018, has faced the most sustained assault. The administration has zeroed in on an expensive retrofit of two Depression-era buildings on Constitution Avenue, one of which, the Eccles Building, has been the board's headquarters since 1937. These renovations are costing significantly more than was projected when they were first approved in 2017. On July 16, the president said Powell might have “to leave for fraud.”

Later, the president visited the site to chastise Powell, with the cameras rolling. “Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!” the president posted on August 12, appending the jab to a demand that Powell “lower the rate.” (Subtle.)

Around the same time, another board member, Adriana Kugler, resigned her seat abruptly and without explanation. Last week, the administration turned to Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud. When she refused to resign, the president posted a letter purporting to fire her for cause, making this the first for-cause removal attempt by a president of any official since the Nixon administration, and only the fourth in American history (the other two were done by President Taft).

Although the president claims to comply with the statute's for-cause requirement, as the Court suggested he must in Wilcox, he is really doing no such thing.

For one, the president failed to offer Cook any legal process before attempting to remove her. For-cause removals are fundamentally different from at-will terminations. Cook has a vested legal right to serve out her term, and the president must act in an adjudicatory capacity to determine whether she has forfeited that right. Cook is therefore entitled to notice of the charges against her and an opportunity to be heard. As the Supreme Court explained in 1901 in Reagan v. U.S.: “Where causes of removal are specified by Constitution or statute, as also where the term of office is for a fixed period, notice and hearing are essential.” Otherwise, “the appointing power could remove at pleasure or for such cause as it deemed sufficient.” Findings of fact and conclusions of law are also necessary to enable judicial review of the president's action. Here the president does not appear to have offered any process or prepared an adequate factual record.

There is also a substantive legal problem: No precedent exists to support the notion that mere allegations of private misconduct constitute “cause” under the statute. The Federal Reserve Act uses broad language—“for cause,” without further elaboration. This language is more open-ended than statutes for most multimember commissions with term-tenured leaders, which authorize removals by the president for only three specified causes: inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. All of these standard causes relate to an official's work. None would permit the president to remove someone for conduct outside the job, before entering government service.

Jonathan Chait: What Trump's feud with Jerome Powell is really about

The Federal Reserve Act language may encompass additional causes, such as those cited in other federal statutes. For example, one law cites “ineligibility”—a failure by an official to meet the statutory requirements to hold office. Another (for the board of directors of the Institute of Peace) lists “inability to discharge duties” and “conviction of a felony” alongside more conventional causes that the president can invoke. And at the Legal Services Corporation, Congress authorizes the president to remove officials “for offenses involving moral turpitude.”

But none of these statutes cites allegations of past private conduct or anything of that nature. It would not make sense, for example, for Congress to authorize the president to determine, in the first instance, whether a private past crime had indeed been committed. One would expect that question to be worked out in state or federal court—with removal from office by the president, at most, following a conviction. Here there is not even an indictment.

If the courts permit this removal, in which the removed official has no opportunity to contest the charges, we shouldn't be surprised if the president subsequently attempts to remove Powell for cause in connection with the building renovations. Lisa Cook's case is about much more than Cook herself. It is about the rule of law and whether this is “an Empire of Laws, not of men.” If the courts water down “for cause” removal to allow the president's firing to proceed, even if just while the litigation proceeds, it will be another example of what Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson last week called “Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist.” “Calvinball,” she explained, “has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.” The Court, she noted, appears “to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Splitsville understands why modern romance makes an open marriage so appealing.

The first scene of the new movie Splitsville starts with a hand job and ends with a car crash. Carey and Ashley (played by Kyle Marvin and Adria Arjona, respectively), who have been married for a little more than a year, are driving to visit their also-married friends Paul (Michael Angelo Covino) and Julie (Dakota Johnson). Ashley decides it's the perfect time to, um, connect with Carey—but his resulting erratic driving leads another car on the road to swerve and flip. One of the passengers in that car dies. As Ashley and Carey eventually drive away, she tells him she's been sleeping with other people and wants a divorce.

It's a jarring opening, especially in what is otherwise a goofy comedy. I was still galled by it at the end of the film, and stuck on it the next morning, when I woke up and Slacked my colleague who'd seen it: “why the hell does splitsville start w someone DYING?” Since then, though, I've come to think that a death is a fitting way to set the movie's events into motion. Carey ends up going to Paul and Julie's house alone, and during his stay, they tell him that their marriage is open. (They are “realistic” and “self-realized,” they explain.) Carey pitches that setup to his wife, hoping it can save their relationship; she accepts. And the four, lurching and stumbling, all take a very messy stab at nonmonogamy: yearning for freedom when they're feeling constrained and for stability when they're feeling unmoored, pining for whoever represents what their current partner doesn't, almost always appearing antsy. But that constant itch isn't unique to them; it's a byproduct, that brutal crash scene suggests, of the fact that their time on Earth—everyone's time—is terribly limited. They'll never get to have all of the experiences they want to, or try on all of the versions of themselves that different partners could bring out—even if the norms of modern romance curse them with the illusion that maybe they can.

Read: The slow, quiet demise of American romance

Splitsville reflects a simmering cultural anxiety about romantic commitment. Choosing a partner (or partners) has become, in many ways, a more confusing task than it used to be—and that reality is the water this film moves in. For a long time, many people had little choice at all; a match was typically arranged as a matter of family business. Even as people gained some romantic agency, partnership was usually based in pragmatism. Women, denied career opportunities and the right to open their own bank account, tended to depend on men financially; men relied on women for child care and housekeeping (even more than they do now). Today, though, marriage has become less and less necessary for more and more people: Women have gained economic power, and singlehood stigma has weakened. What, then, is the purpose of such a union? For some, of course, the practical benefits are still motivating. (“We have money and a kid,” Paul says soon after Carey's post-crash arrival. “We can never get divorced.”) But for many, romance has become something less utilitarian, or perhaps utilitarian in a new way: a path to self-actualization and discovery. “I don't want to exist,” Ashley says to Carey in that initial breakup. “I want to grow.” She can't afford to be constrained when she has “only been with seven people.”

In her book The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, the psychotherapist Esther Perel argues that humans are naturally torn between two opposing psychological needs: security and freedom. This, she says, is why happy people cheat: because even when they're enjoying the safety of couplehood, they chafe against the possibility that this might be it—not only the last person they'll sleep with but also the last partner they'll learn from and change in reaction to. “We are not looking for another lover,” she writes, “so much as another version of ourselves.” A sense of limitation—even more anxiety provoking in the age of dating apps, when prospects can seem plentiful—is the boogeyman of Splitsville. But the movie also knows that limits can be helpful, that having to decide which romantic partner to settle on—or whether to settle on one at all—can be more stressful than liberating. Having a choice means you can make the wrong one.

This specific dilemma has become a major theme in pop culture. Just think of the many dating shows that revolve around the question of whether two people will end up engaged or married. Contestants are drawn to each other, then to other people, then sometimes back to each other again, torn between familiarity and novelty. The indecision is the drama. Splitsville, in fact, is just one of a handful of recent movies that use romantic commitment as a source of terror, comedic discomfort, or both. In Oh, Hi!, a film released last month, Iris (Molly Gordon) and Isaac (Logan Lerman) are two lovers getting away for the weekend. They're having a lovely time, at least until Isaac says he's not looking for anything serious and Iris responds by keeping him chained to the bed. Together, a body-horror flick that hit theaters at the end of July, literalizes the tension between giving yourself fully to one relationship—with all of the coziness and claustrophobia that can bring—and preserving your individuality: Tim (Dave Franco) and Millie (Alison Brie) are partners who begin to physically, grotesquely meld into one person.

Read: The dating-app diversity paradox

Splitsville's characters hope that nonmonogamy can save them from having to choose. But—of course—jealousy and chaos ensue. The partners pretend they're fine with things that they're clearly not fine with. (“It's really not that big a deal if you think about it,” Paul says, sitting calmly at a broken table after learning that his wife slept with Carey and picking a fight with Carey that leaves the house destroyed.) They use language that sounds enlightened but doesn't really communicate what they need it to. (Paul and Julie are open because they're protecting their “emotional and spiritual” bond by being “a little bit more flexible with the physical.”) Instead of enjoying freedom and security at once, they bounce destructively between the two, always wanting what they can't have.

All of this might sound like a roast of open marriages—and the movie does poke fun. But ultimately, the villain isn't monogamy or nonmonogamy; the characters are their own worst enemy. Whether monogamous or not, the film suggests, humans will be humans. They will always be haunted by the path not taken; they will strive, ceaselessly, against the laws of nature and time, against mortality; they will never have it all. If they're doomed to dissatisfaction, though, at least they're doomed together.

The weird lie animating the right-wing womanosphere.

Earlier this month, Katie Miller launched her new podcast with a specific origin myth. Miller, a former Trump administration official and wife of Stephen Miller, declared that by creating a lifestyle podcast for conservative women, she was filling a hole in the media ecosystem.

“For years, I've seen that there isn't a place for conservative women to gather online,” Miller said in a video posted to X. Her caption added, “As a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn't a podcast for women like myself.”

This claim happens to be deeply untrue. Conservative women have arguably never had more places to gather online and talk about their lifestyle concerns — especially when it comes to motherhood and wellness. This media ecosystem has recently been dubbed the “womanosphere,” and it is booming.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Conservatives can go to Evie, the right-wing answer to Cosmopolitan, which has attracted plentiful mainstream media attention. They can get their celebrity gossip with a healthy strain of reactionary conspiracy theories from Candace Owens. They can get anti-feminist cultural commentary from YouTubers like Brett Cooper. They can get MAHA-inflected health care advice from Alex Clark's Culture Apothecary talk show. They can hear anti-trans sports commentary on Riley Gaines's Gaines for Girls. They can watch the agrarian fantasies of tradwives like Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman. And they can listen to conservative women's lifestyle podcasts, like Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey's Relatable. Many of these women, by dint of their jobs as full-time content creators and podcasters, are also working moms, as they are happy to discuss at length in their content.

Still, the sense that Miller is operating from a defensive crouch, grabbing for access to a feminine frivolity she feels she has been denied, suffuses her new show, The Katie Miller Podcast. “We're gonna do something for all the girls out there,” Miller tells her guest, conservative sportscaster Sage Steele, on the second episode before the beauty segment of their interview. “Conservative women never get asked these questions,” Miller adds. It's hard to know what exclusion Miller is referring to exactly (what is Ivanka Trump's brand if not being a conservative woman with beauty secrets?), but the idea that it might be true seems necessary to Miller's conception of her project.

In the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow.

She's not alone in that. A transgressive posture is one of the characteristics of the womanosphere: an implication that they are saying hard truths and asking tough questions about things the liberal elites don't want women to know, that they are reclaiming their due from the cultural gatekeepers who didn't want them to have it. All conservative media these days tends to operate under similar assumptions, but in the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow. (Sage Steele is a fan.)

As the womanosphere booms, it's taken on an odd, fraught position. Republicans claim that they are the party free from liberal scolds, that will let hot girls be hot, but also that elites have gatekept them away from all that is frivolous and fun about girlishness. Listening to (or watching) Miller's podcast isn't interesting because of the beauty secrets divulged; it's revealing because of the glimpse it gives us into Republicans' current vexed relationship with femininity.

To give Miller her due, it's true that there are few spaces these days for conservative women in traditional media, like old-school glossy magazines. Lifestyle media for women has long been inherently conservative-leaning, with its focus on dieting and man-catching and home-building, but the post-Jezebel generation of women's media took on an explicitly feminist lens. The 2010s saw an explosion of progressive so-called ladyblogs, like The Hairpin, The Cut, and Slate's Double X, while magazines like Teen Vogue took on a left-wing activist perspective. Even the flagship Vogue, which generally dedicates a cover to the sitting first lady, declined to feature Melania Trump during Donald Trump's first term and, so far, his second as well.

The emergent conservative womanosphere, like its manosphere counterpart, has been largely coming up outside the boundaries of traditional media, among podcasters and YouTubers and lifestyle influencers, where the money for high-performing contributors is better and the editorial oversight is lower. Miller's podcast fits neatly into the flourishing new ecosystem.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression.

Part of the worldbuilding of this universe is to claim that the rest of the universe does not exist: There is no womanosphere, according to these influencers. There is no feasible way to build a lucrative career out of being an anti-woke woman, and failing to land a feature in Vogue is censorship at its finest.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression. The tendency has been so widespread among Trump Republicans in his second term that in February, the pseudonymous blogger Scarlet gave it a name: the “soy right.”

“The Soy Right is being oppressed and they want you to know it,” she wrote. “They're scared to take the subway, they're offended that you called them white or cis, they're upset that you didn't think they were cool in high school, they want to call the manager because there's less boobies in video games. … While the right is winning cultural and political victories nonstop lately, that's not enough. They also need you to like them. Why don't you like them?!”

These grievances power the worldview of Miller and her ilk, and gives them a reason to create their podcasts and YouTube channels and magazines. They're calling the manager because they don't think they personally have gotten enough credit for being conventionally hot, raising kids, and having high-powered careers. Creating a new podcast is a way for Miller to give herself that credit. Meanwhile, harping on the false idea that there's a hole in the marketplace allows her podcast to take on a sense of heightened importance. If the world were fair, Miller implies, someone else would have asked her to describe her beauty routine a long time ago.

This idea that Republican women are never given credit for their beauty stands uneasily next to recent Republican attempts to claim the existence of beautiful women as a win for their own side. Over the past two years, the right has variously claimed Sydney Sweeney, Hawk Tuah Girl, and sorority rush videos as cultural phenomena that are by their nature Republican-coded and surely infuriate the left. (The left shows no sign of being infuriated, but that doesn't stop the narrative.) The story goes that the left is too woke, too PC, too ideologically hamstrung to celebrate the existence of conventionally attractive white women, so the right must step in.

In the manosphere, the obsession with hot girls shades into raunch culture, a performative, overwhelming ocean of sleaze in which the supposed celebration of hot girls also runs right alongside an attitude of degradation. The nascent womanosphere, however, tends towards purity culture, an obsession with Christian virtue and righteousness that is the mirror image of raunch culture.

Miller makes much of her status as a wife and mother. Her fellow womanosphere podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey calls out listeners for watching movies about “hot and heavy sinful romance” rather than focusing on “the Biblical marriage that God has called you into.” Brittany Martinez, the founder of Evie magazine, says she started her publication after watching the traditional glossies “encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications.”

As I've discussed extensively before, while purity culture and raunch culture might appear to oppose one another, they're two sides of the same coin, united by a shared premise that women's sexuality should always exist in service to men. They are also a trap: The raunchy cool girls get called sluts. The respected pure women get called prudes. The only way to play the game and win is to somehow be both raunchy and pure at the same time, an impossible status that was only ever held, very briefly, by a young Britney Spears before the world crashed down around her.

The womanosphere is animated by a sense of a broken promise: that these women were told they would receive attention and credit that never came. The Katie Miller Podcast says it's an attempt to rectify that broken promise. In reality, however, it's just one more entry into a crowded conservative media landscape, powered by the same old warped sense of victimization.

The CDC is collapsing. Will America's health follow suit?

The simmering showdown between US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the leadership of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has finally boiled over.

The White House said on Wednesday that CDC director Susan Monarez was fired — and Monarez's representatives quickly responded that she wouldn't leave her post without a fight. In protest of the ousting and Kennedy's leadership, four senior CDC leaders resigned.

The tension had been building for months. Once Kennedy took the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, he laid off thousands of workers at the CDC and other health agencies. He has rolled back longstanding vaccine policies over the objections of many experts inside and outside of the CDC. Then, earlier this month, a man angry about the Covid-19 vaccines fired nearly 200 bullets into a CDC office building. Although no one was hurt, CDC workers criticized Kennedy and others for stoking anti-CDC sentiment and for not speaking out after the incident. President Donald Trump has still not publicly commented on the shooting.

The final straw came yesterday when the Food and Drug Administration announced limited approval of new Covid vaccines updated to better match the variants currently circulating. The FDA approved the new shots — but only for the elderly and people who are at higher risk because of underlying health conditions. The vaccines had previously been approved for all Americans 6 months of age and older. The CDC would have been expected to make new Covid vaccine recommendations that matched the FDA's narrower approval, excluding healthy adults, pregnant women, and children — but, according to the New York Times, Monarez refused to commit to that policy in a private meeting with Kennedy

What happened next was chaos. National news outlets reported Wednesday afternoon that Monarez had been fired, less than a month after her Senate confirmation. Over the next few hours, Monarez's representatives responded that she was refusing to step down (her attorney suggests that her firing had been illegal), but the White House insisted she had, in fact, been terminated. And so began an exodus of more CDC leaders.

One of those officials — Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — explained why he was leaving the agency in a post on X. He portrayed the CDC situation as an existential battle between science and anti-science, noting in his post that no one on his team had ever even briefed Kennedy since he was sworn in as US health secretary in April.

“I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public's health,” Daskalakis wrote. “Public health is not merely about the health of the individual, but it is about the health of the community, the nation, the world. The nation's health security is at risk and is in the hands of people focusing on ideological self-interest.”

The CDC that will be left behind will be less science-driven and more beholden to Kennedy and his agenda — precisely the warning that the departing CDC officials are trying to send and a sentiment echoed by other public health organizations. “THE SUSTAINED ATTACKS ON PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE U.S. MUST END NOW,” read an all-caps statement sent by the Infectious Disease Society of America to the media.

But there's a bigger story here than just the latest drama under Kennedy's leadership: What's unfolding is a fight over the narrative of public health in America — and for the public's trust.

The American public is still unmoored after the Covid-19 pandemic, and two sides are trying to win out: Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement along with the critics who attacked the public health establishment during that emergency, and the public health experts aligned with America's scientific institutions. The outcome will determine the future of collective health in the US.

Kennedy argues that the public health establishment of the previous generation has failed the public and must be razed and replaced. If you look at the recent CDC personnel issues through this lens, then dismissing public health officials with decades of experience in their field is in service of that goal. On the other side, most scientists, public health experts, and CDC officials would argue that public health largely has a record of success — though with some mistakes and failures along the way.

America's public health institutions did lose some trust during the pandemic amid confusing and often inconsistent guidance. But a longer record of vaccinations driving down disease and other public health campaigns yielding major gains in people's well-being is clear from historical data and decades of peer-reviewed research.

Science may be on the CDC officials' side, but we're still learning exactly how the public actually feels about public health. How average people react to this drama and the conflicting messages that Kennedy and CDC officials are sending will determine the long-term consequences of this fight.

This parade of firings and principled resignations is in part a performance — and the audience is the American public.

As I have written before, 25 years ago, there was a pretty clear public health consensus in America. The federal government and major medical organizations were usually aligned on the major questions — questions like which vaccines to get. And the public was widely in support. In 2001, around the time the US declared measles had been eradicated, more than 90 percent of US adults said it was “extremely” or “very important” for people to get childhood vaccinations.

It is difficult to imagine such unanimity about any public health-related issue today.

Right now, the percentage of Americans who think childhood immunizations are important is below 70 percent. According to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey, only 26 percent of Americans have a great deal of faith in scientists to act in the best interests of the public, about the same percentage as those who say they have not too much or none at all (23 percent). That is much lower than in 2019, the pre-pandemic era, when 36 percent of Americans said they had a great deal of faith in science being in the public's best interest and only 12 percent had none or little.

Most Americans are stuck in the middle; 50 percent say they have a “fair” amount of trust in scientists. One way to think about this group is that they are up for grabs.

Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement has gained steam because many Americans desire a fresh approach to health and wellness; Kennedy remains one of the more popular active political figures in the country, despite criticism from all corners of the public health establishment. As the country's top health official, Kennedy argues he has a mandate to overhaul public health policy on everything from vaccines, to the food supply, to fluoride in public water systems.

But the health risks of Kennedy's policy agenda are real, and that is the message that public health experts, including the resigning CDC leaders, are trying to deliver to the public.

The US has already seen what happens when childhood vaccination rates drop, with the worst measles outbreak in 30 years taking hold this year in a poorly vaccinated Texas community. Dentists in Utah, where Kennedy helped herald the removal of fluoride from local water systems in April, are preparing for a surge in cavities. The introduction of fluoride into US water systems led to a large decline in cavities over many years; now, Kennedy's policy agenda could move the country backward.

And now, the new restrictions on Covid vaccines announced yesterday could make it more difficult for many people to get them. Vaccines may not be as widely available at pharmacies, and insurers may not be willing to cover the vaccine without government approval. That could make it harder for both vulnerable people and their loved ones to get Covid shots. The science is clear on the relative safety of the Covid shots, and Kennedy has been criticized for the weak evidence that he has cited to justify the changes to the Covid vaccine guidance. People could get sick if these shots are harder to come by because of Kennedy's policies.

This is always a challenge in public health.

Short of emergency lockdowns and mandates, public health has always been about soft power: Can you persuade the public to take certain precautions in the best interest of not only themselves but the people around them? And that authority is always fluctuating. Around 90 percent of Americans get their childhood shots, but less than 50 percent usually get their flu shot in a given year.

Now, the headwinds facing good public health policy are stronger than ever, with Kennedy and his movement representing an active opponent of many well-supported public health interventions in charge of US health policy. For a while, Monerez, Daskalakis, and others seemed prepared to try to work within the system that Kennedy controlled. But they no longer believe that is possible, so they are taking the fight to the public.

Here's how this African country is winning the fight against childhood HIV.﻿

Botswana has been getting a lot of calls lately from across the African continent, prodding the nation — once “at risk of extinction” from HIV — to tell the world how they did the impossible: squash childhood HIV rates.

The number of children living with HIV has declined sharply everywhere, but nowhere more so than in Botswana, which has managed to slash its childhood infection rate by more than 98 percent since the 1990s.

At its peak, in what was one of the world's worst outbreaks of HIV, one in eight infants were infected at birth. Mortality in young kids nearly doubled over a decade, with 3,000 children dying of AIDS each year. And 25,000 children — one in every classroom of 25 — had long-term symptoms of the virus, which without treatment, destroys the body's immune system, turning even common infections deadly.

Now, new infections in kids are so exceedingly rare — at under 100 per year — that every infant diagnosed with HIV now prompts a comprehensive audit by the country's public health officials.

It is a remarkable turnaround. While Botswana's HIV rate is still the fourth-highest in the world — affecting up to a third of adults in some regions — the number of babies born with HIV today is virtually zero.

It took time to pay off, but Botswana has managed to build the most robust HIV prevention infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly for pregnant women and children. Life-saving antiretroviral therapies — which can transform HIV into a manageable and largely untransmittable chronic condition — have been widely available for free in the country since 2002. The nation's government launched a program to prevent mother-to-child transmissions in 1999, expanded its free coverage of maternal services over the years, and became one of the first countries to implement the World Health Organization's Option B+ strategy in 2013, making a highly effective lifelong treatment regimen freely available to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV.

Thanks to those sustained public investments, Botswana became the first country in the world with a high HIV rate to achieve the World Health Organization's Gold Tier status for eliminating mother-to-child or “vertical” transmissions as a public health threat earlier this year.

“Botswana shows you know what can happen when a country decides that no child should be born with HIV, and they actually mean it,” said Doris Macharia, president of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, who began her career at the height of the HIV epidemic, working as a physician in her native Kenya and at a rural clinic in South Africa.

Even in the face of global aid cuts, which have stripped billions from highly effective HIV prevention programs, progress like Botswana's proves that the hardest-hit countries are still moving forward.

“We've made phenomenal progress,” she said, “but we still have a long way to go.”

A young woman living in Botswana in 1997 had a one in four chance of contracting HIV. If she had three children in the years that followed, at least one of her babies would almost surely contract the virus during pregnancy or childbirth, or while breastfeeding.

But if her HIV-positive daughter, now a young woman, became pregnant today, her chance of transmitting the virus to her own children would be less than 1 percent — down from up to 40 percent three decades prior.

What changed?

For starters, antiretroviral therapies have gotten much better, cheaper, and infinitely more accessible than a few decades ago. About 98 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women in Botswana now access those medications, which can suppress the virus enough that it is virtually undetectable and by extension, largely untransmissible.

When babies are born with HIV today, it's not because their mothers can't access treatment, but because they didn't know they had the virus to begin with.

“Not all countries are created equally, but all countries have an opportunity to step up and mobilize support — to move this needle for children and moms.”

But in Botswana, 99.8 percent of pregnant women give birth in a hospital or clinic and 95 percent access the country's free prenatal and maternal care services — up from 70 percent in 2001. This puts them on par with the United States and far ahead of neighbors like Zimbabwe. That makes it easy to routinely screen for HIV over the course of a pregnancy — and to immediately test any newborns at risk.

“There's no mom who wants her child to be sick,” Macharia said. “There's no mom who wants her child to die.”

Altogether, these interventions and policies have prevented about 59,000 children from being infected with HIV since Botswana enacted a nationwide campaign against vertical transmissions in 1999, according to estimates from UNAIDS, the United Nations partnership to fight HIV/AIDS. Globally, similar policies have prevented over 4 million childhood infections.

Macharia attributed Botswana's success not only to effective interventions, but to political will: Its government recognized the severity of the crisis relatively early on, and then consistently funded its own interventions. President Festus Mogae made combating HIV a top priority of his administration when he took office at the height of the crisis in 1998. After taking office, he quickly launched the campaign against vertical transmissions in 1999, became the first head of state to publicly test himself for HIV in 2001, and established Africa's first national antiretroviral treatment program in 2002.

“Not all countries are created equally,” Macharia said, “but all countries have an opportunity to step up and mobilize support — to move this needle for children and moms.”

So, how did the country pull it off? With its vast diamond reserves, Botswana is relatively wealthy — even despite recent downturns in the market. The country's per capita income is closer to that of Mexico or Brazil than to many of its sub-Saharan neighbors, and it has the lowest corruption rate in Africa.

And while American global aid programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have been essential partners in its HIV response, the country pays its own way for about 70 percent of its HIV prevention programs, said Alankar Malviya, Botswana country director for UNAIDS. Other poorer countries in Africa, such as Nigeria, Mozambique, and Côte d'Ivoire, rely on foreign aid for 80 or 90 percent of such funding.

That's made it harder for those nations to replicate Botswana's cohesive national strategy — especially with today's torrent of cuts.“The pace at which the global funding landscape for HIV has changed in the last few months is unprecedented,” Malviya said. “You cannot prepare any country for having to go through such a radical change in funding, which meant putting a pause to ongoing programs overnight.”

A lot of countries were already on their way to building roadmaps to fund their own programs in the long run, he said, but “you cannot sustain a program overnight.”

In the meantime, many are looking to Botswana — the first country to pioneer a roadmap for sustainably financing HIV prevention— for help. The country's public health officials have advised Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe and other countries on how to sustain their progress and diversify their funding in the long term.

“We've done so much to get to where we are, and we have so little to go,” Macharia said. Though “the last mile is always the hardest,” she thinks an AIDS-free generation is still very much in sight: “We are very, very close. We are extremely close.”

The president's tacky aesthetic is a window into his quest to become the single most enduring symbol of America.

In 1990, Playboy published an interview with Donald Trump in which the future president offered his thoughts on foreign affairs, the death penalty, and why he puts his name on everything. He also reflected on the meaning — or, perhaps, meaninglessness — of life. “Life is what you do while you're waiting to die. You know, it is all a rather sad situation,” he said. “We're here and we live our 60, 70, or 80 years and we're gone. You win, you win, and in the end, it doesn't mean a hell of a lot.”

It's no secret that every president cares about how they'll be remembered. But that pithy, 35-year-old quote explains a whole lot about Trump, his rise to power, and how he governs today. He doesn't only want a legacy, be it good or bad. Even winning the presidency twice doesn't suffice. What Trump really wants is to — in some way or another — live forever, and he's only just getting started.

By now, Trump's imprint on the world is indelible. His ability to wiggle out of legal consequences for his corruption and lawlessness has ushered in a new era of presidential immunity. His inability to admit defeat in 2020 nearly resulted in a coup d'etat and seriously undermined voters' faith in American elections. And his harsh immigration crackdowns, his fixation on birthright citizenship, and his censorship of speech have challenged the very ideals of what it means to be an American.

But to fully understand Trump's broader political project and how he has successfully transformed America, you have to recognize that he isn't only a political figure, but something much bigger: a cultural icon in the crudest sense.

It's that side of Trump that begins to explain one of the weirdest aspects of his presidency: his focus on aesthetics and how aggressively he is forcing his particular style and taste onto America. Whether it's making the White House look more like his private residences or turning the arts into his own pet project, Trump is trying to fundamentally change how America's government is perceived. Put another way, when we look at the government's buildings and institutions, Trump wants us to see only him — even after he's gone.

It's not entirely accurate to say that Trump has always sought fame. Because what Trump has really been chasing his entire adult life has been omnipresence. Celebrity status, untold fortune, and television success were never going to be enough; he wants to be everywhere. For a big chunk of his New York business years, Trump was completely obsessed with the idea of having the biggest and tallest buildings in the world. He injected himself into the American zeitgeist decades ago, giving tabloids enough gossip to fill their pages with scandal after scandal since the 1970s. His real estate career, his offensively lavish lifestyle, and his eventual rise as a reality TV star made him, in many ways, a caricature of American capitalism's excesses.

That never-ending pursuit of omnipresence has shaped Trump's political career and presidencies, perhaps more than anything else. After all, from a political standpoint, Trump has been all over the place: He has been a Democrat, independent, and a Republican. He sought to befriend Hillary Clinton — donating to her Senate campaigns and the Clinton Foundation — before eventually running against her in 2016. And while there are some policies and ideas that Trump has long been committed to, like tariffs or racist conspiracy theories, he has always been more devoted to himself than any policy agenda.

His true desire, it seems, wasn't to simply become the president of the United States, but to become the single most enduring representation of America itself.

Trump's political project, in other words, is to rebrand America. He's seemingly not so desperate to eke out wins for the Republican Party so much as he is trying to remake America in his own image. Gone are the days where America is promoted as an idea — a nation of immigrants or an unfinished project that every generation of Americans strives to improve — because in his eyes, America is Trump.

To understand Trump's aesthetics, you have to go back to the 1980s lifestyles of the rich and famous in New York, the time and place that defined Trump's rise in American culture. A lot of what Trump values today — real estate, television ratings, Time magazine covers — can be traced back to that era, when all of those things, at least to Trump and those running in his circles, were markers of clout.

That period was defined by greed and ostentatious displays of wealth. And Trump relished that environment. In the Playboy interview, Trump was specifically asked about why he feels so comfortable showing off his riches, especially given how much poverty could be seen on the streets. “There has always been a display of wealth and always will be,” he said. “And let me tell you, a display is a good thing. It shows people that you can be successful. It can show you a way of life. Dynasty did it on TV. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

Trump's quest to own the famed Plaza Hotel in New York City, which he bought for $400 million in 1988, ended in spectacular failure, with the hotel filing for bankruptcy just a few years after the purchase. But for Trump, acquiring the Plaza Hotel wasn't merely about making money; it was about achieving status. “To me the Plaza was like a great painting,” he said, recalling the whole ordeal in an interview in 2015. “It wasn't purely about the bottom line. I have many assets like that and the end result is that they are always much more valuable than what you paid for them.”

Just like that venture, Trump's vision for America today is remarkably shallow. It doesn't matter how functional America's institutions or even economy actually are. The only thing that matters is what America looks like on the outside. And a shiny veneer that flaunts wealth and military might — be it through a gilded White House or a B-2 stealth bomber flyover — is perfectly adequate, even if it's entirely hollow or bankrupt on the inside.

So naturally, Trump has dedicated a decent chunk of his presidency to imposing his style and aesthetic onto America.

In both terms, he has issued executive orders to change the look of federal buildings, discarding new architectural styles and instead promoting grand neoclassical buildings that mimic ancient empires. He has been in a long-simmering feud with Boeing since his first term over the new Air Force One — the iconic aircraft that carries the president across the country and around the world — and has been deeply involved in the design of the plane, which looks suspiciously similar to his own private jet. And he has completely redecorated the White House, decking out the Oval Office in gold, turning the Rose Garden into a patio that resembles his Mar-a-Lago club, and announcing plans to build a $200 million ballroom extension to the East Wing.

But Trump's fixation on rebranding America's image goes deeper than giving the Office of the President a makeover. Upon returning to the White House earlier this year, Trump purged the board of the Kennedy Center and appointed a new board that elected him to be the chair — an unusual role for the president of the United States to take on. The move showed how invested Trump personally is in the culture wars, so much so that he wants to be directly involved in decisions about what kind of art Americans should enjoy.

Trump is now even planning on hosting the Kennedy Center Honors this year, saying he was “very involved” in selecting the honorees. He also said that he vetoed “a couple of wokesters” who were in the running. And, according to the New York Times, Trump has considered giving posthumous awards to Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth.

He is also targeting the nation's museums and historical displays in an attempt to recast America's history in a much more favorable light that sweeps all the bad parts under the rug. For instance, he issued an executive order that discourages the Smithsonian Institution from putting up displays that portray America and its past negatively. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said in a recent social media post. “We have the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.”

To be sure, the United States has always been deeply invested in how it is perceived, both domestically and abroad, and has always projected itself as the “shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan often liked to say. And while there's no shortage of big egos among presidents, they often, at the very least, tried to gesture that America was bigger than just them.

What is different about Trump is that he is not so interested in the idealistic vision of America — or in presenting America as an idea, a neverending endeavor of creating a more perfect union. He's only interested in grandeur and the authoritarian tendency to so thoroughly intertwine himself with his country that the two can't be separated. And whether it's the Oval Office redesign, the Kennedy Center takeover, or — in quintessential dictatorship fashion — banners of Trump's portrait cropping up around the nation's capital, the message Trump is sending is clear: We are changing how America is perceived, we will aggressively flaunt our power and wealth, and we will iconize Trump so that he becomes just as much of a symbol of the United States as its own flag.

On the one hand, Trump's fixation on aesthetics can seem inconsequential — moves that can be easily undone by a future administration. On the other hand, they're a window into Trump's broader political project. After all, the way Trump is imposing his style and taste onto the American public is a projection of his ideals, and an attempt to change not just America's politics but its culture, too.

There are two major components of Trump's attempt to rebrand America. The first is to establish new American norms — changing the perception of what the average American way of life looks like.

Take Trump's desire to reinforce gender norms and project a certain type of hypermasculinity, all of which permeate his entire aesthetic. Some parts are less subtle than others: Kicking off his Kennedy Center takeover, for example, Trump announced on social media in February that he would “immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” That vision, apparently, had a lot to do with drag shows. “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” the president wrote. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” he added in another post.

Trump also likes to promote traditional images of strength as a representation of both himself and America. His now-famous photo after he was almost assassinated last year — with his fist pumped in the air and blood dripping down his face as he yelled, “Fight, fight, fight” — was turned into a painting that replaced a portrait of Barack Obama in Trump's White House. And his social media channels often promote photoshopped images of Trump as a superhero or with a muscular build.

The Department of Homeland Security in particular has been fond of sharing nostalgic paintings — like John Gast's “American Progress,” representing the imperialist manifest destiny doctrine, or Thomas Kinkade's “Morning Pledge,” depicting American schoolchildren gathered around the US flag in an idyllic suburb — with not-so-subtle captions like “Protect the Homeland” or “Remember your Homeland's Heritage.” (In a recruitment ad for Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS also posted on X, “Defend your culture!”)

All of this imagery, from the gaudy Oval Office overhaul to the kitsch paintings being shared on social media, tries to hark back to an old-fashioned idea of what America is supposed to look like. What Trump is really selling is the notion that the America that elected Barack Obama — the multiracial and cross-class coalition that formed a decisive majority in 2008 and 2012 — never really existed. And there seems to be an everlasting nostalgia for a whiter America in Trump's White House, even in rhetoric articulated by top officials like Stephen Miller. “Why is it that Democrats are so insistent that unlimited numbers of illegals from countries that are incapable of managing their own affairs come here?” Miller said earlier this summer. “Countries like Somalia, countries like Haiti, countries that have no history of successful self-government, and they want unlimited numbers of illegals from those countries and refugees from those countries to come here.”

Ultimately, this is all reflected in Trump's policy agenda. His mass deportation campaign, his executive order on birthright citizenship, and his attack on fundamental rights of immigrants, including free speech, underscore how one of his principal goals as president is to redefine what it really means to be American.

This is the kind of America that, as noted above, Miller and DHS are trying to promote. It's also the America that Trump feels comfortable being associated with. After all, this is the same Donald Trump who, along with his father, was sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for keeping Black tenants out of their buildings.

The second and final component of the rebrand is for Trump to personally embody that America — to transform himself into the ultimate figure to aspire to. And that part has to do with reviving the old American ideal of individualism and self-reliance, the false notion that the most successful Americans are somehow self-made, and that there is no collective ideal worth pursuing more than one's own individual success. Trump's whole aesthetic, and the way he's specifically projecting his style onto American government, is a celebration of that philosophy. It's all an ode to himself, not the American people or the generations before him that made his own fortunes possible in the first place.

That individualistic philosophy is why Trump is so invested in remodeling the White House, the Kennedy Center, and even museums in his own style — to exhibit his image as the greatest marker of success. It's why, on the right, there's such an overwhelming cult following around a single individual. There's an obsession with personifying America, and Trump desperately wants to be that personification.

The America Trump wants to project, in other words, is not the Statue of Liberty welcoming “huddled masses yearning to breathe free” or a country of shared collective interests, but one that adheres to the concept of the survival of the fittest. And Trump seems to believe — or at the very least wants to convey — that he's the fittest of us all.

Much of what has informed Trump's whole philosophy is his simplistic idea of success: that his many failures aren't necessarily a reflection on him, but that his success and wealth were achieved solely because of him. So the aesthetic Trump is trying his very best to push onto Americans — displays of sheer rugged strength, of vast wealth, of supposed success — points to a picture of an individualistic society that doesn't really care about its past sins. Because in Trump's world, so long as you amass an enormous amount of wealth and power (as both he and America have), then it's all worth showing off.

It's like he told Playboy back in 1990: “Let me tell you, a display is a good thing…It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

That's why Trump doesn't just want to be a political or historical figure, but a cultural icon that can represent American greatness long after he's gone. He wants the whole world to forever look at him.

AI in the classroom doesn't have to be a catastrophe.

Everyone in education, from K-12 teachers to university presidents, is well aware that AI is transforming the classroom. That presents all the challenges you've probably already heard of: students using ChatGPT to cheat, churning out papers and assignments without a second thought. But there's also the more underreported development — teachers are deploying the technology to write lesson plans, make quizzes, and streamline administrative tasks, saving them hours of grunt work.

In the best-case scenario, AI promises to make teachers better at their jobs. And ultimately, if AI becomes the transformative force optimists hope it will, that will help students get smarter, becoming a tireless teaching aid and providing 24-hour tutoring assistance. That's a big if, of course.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

At the very least, the time saving element for teachers is real, and it's a big deal. A recent survey from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation found that 6 in 10 teachers used AI for their work in the 2023-2024 school year. Those that used AI weekly — about a third of the teachers surveyed — estimated it saved them about 6 hours each week, which, in the best of circumstances, could mean that's 6 more hours of face time with students.

“This is not plugging students in front of computers, engaging with a chat bot,” Chris Agnew, director of the Generative AI in Education Hub at Stanford, said. “This is supporting teacher practice and then enabling this trained, experienced adult that's in front of kids.”

Of course, giving teachers some time back doesn't necessarily curb AI cheating. The savviest educators have clear guidelines for when AI can be used and when it can't, as well as a good system in place for discussing the technology's evolving role in school. After all, this is hardly the first time a new technology has swept into schools and upended old ways of doing things — educators used to worry about calculators in the classroom.

“We went from the phase of, ‘Ban AI, it's a cheating tool,' to now, the majority of the market really is, ‘How do we leverage these tools in really productive ways?'”

This also isn't the first time a new technology has opened up a huge business opportunity for tech companies to reach young, inquiring minds and make a lot of money in the process. Google, for instance, now offers its Workspace for Education with Gemini built-in for up to $66 per teacher per month. In a school district of 500 teachers, that could easily add up to an extra $400,000 a year. For school districts that use a learning management system, like Canvas by Instructure, or an AI-powered tutor, like Khanmigo by Khan Academy, the cost of tech-centric education could keep growing.

“We went from the phase of, ‘Ban AI, it's a cheating tool,' to now, the majority of the market really is, ‘How do we leverage these tools in really productive ways?'” said Ryan Lufkin, vice president of global academic strategy at Instructure, whose Canvas software is used by half of North American college students and over a third of K-12 students.

What the classroom experience will look like in a decade, much further into the AI revolution, is anyone's guess. In corporate America, companies are pouring billions of dollars into AI, hoping for transformative profits. So far, that's not going great.

If you're a parent, you might feel a bit powerless in this situation. Tech companies and school districts are making decisions that will impact your kid, who may or may not be using ChatGPT already to do their homework. But because we're in the early days of this technology, now is the time to learn about how it works and what your school district is doing with it.

If you set aside the idea that large language models could reinvent the American education system — which is not great, by global standards — you might be curious about the ChatGPT cheating problem, especially if you're a parent.

It's hard to tell just how many students are cheating with robots. A Pew survey of teens found that 26 percent of middle and high school students were using ChatGPT — for both nefarious and less nefarious purposes — in 2024, a percentage that had doubled since 2023. Another study from 2024 that tracked high school students' cheating from before and after ChatGPT's release found no indications that it had “dramatically changed the prevalence of cheating.” Regardless, a New York magazine feature earlier this year declared that “ChatGPT has unraveled the entire academic project.”

Proposed solutions to the cheating problem, however serious it is, are kind of funny. As the use of ChatGPT has increased on college campuses, for instance, so have the sales of blue books, according to the Wall Street Journal. Students can't use AI when they're locked in a room with nothing but a pencil and paper, after all. Then there's the call to bring back oral exams, including proposals to use video conferencing software to conduct hundreds of them at once. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology even invented a platform for oral exams that, somewhat ironically, uses AI to grade the students. There are other creative workarounds, too, like requiring students to show their work by tracking changes in Google Docs or asking them to generate ChatGPT essays and then critique them.

Banning AI completely is increasingly unpopular. New York City Public Schools, the nation's largest school district, banned ChatGPT not long after its release in 2022 and then lifted that ban a few months later. “The knee-jerk fear and risk overlooked the potential of generative AI to support students and teachers, as well as the reality that our students are participating in and will work in a world where understanding generative AI is crucial,” then-chancellor David Banks wrote in an op-ed. “While initial caution was justified, it has now evolved into an exploration and careful examination of this new technology's power and risks.”

That exploration period seems to be ongoing for many K-12 schools. By the end of last year, the city's comptroller, Brad Lander, called on the city's Department of Education to pull nearly $2 million in funding for AI software, because it had not studied the efficacy of AI in the classroom.

Schools are nevertheless spending money on AI tools, whether they're for teachers or for students. This represents just the latest raft of investment in education technology, or edtech. For the past four decades, putting computers into classrooms and screens in front of students has promised to transform learning. And for 40 years, it's failed to fulfill that promise. Student performance has remained flat, while spending on edtech and training teachers how to use it has grown.

It's unclear if AI can change this trend. Once you look beyond trying to stop students from using ChatGPT to cheat, you can get pretty creative with how AI might play a role in the classroom. You could imagine, for instance, that students will write fewer essays and might instead interact with a chatbot the way they'd talk to a human tutor. Khan Academy, a major edtech company, is piloting a chatbot it built with OpenAI called Khanmigo in 266 school districts nationwide. Khan Academy founder Sal Khan recently told Anderson Cooper that his dream is to give every student a private tutor. Khanmigo currently costs $4 per month per student.

What's more promising in the near future is giving teachers access to AI that can lead to new classroom experiences. Aside from its private tutor powers, Khanmigo can help create lesson plans and then integrate the chatbot into them, according to Kristen DiCerbo, chief learning officer at Khan Academy. She explained a scenario to me in which several Khanmigo agents essentially worked like teacher's assistants, checking in on groups of students during a lesson. “We think of it as like a force multiplier for the teacher, giving them just a little more reach in terms of what they can get done in the classroom,” DiCerbo said.

Aside from powering tools like this, OpenAI recently announced an education effort of its own in ChatGPT called study mode. This effectively turns ChatGPT into a tutor that replies to questions with more questions rather than answers. This is in addition to ChatGPT Edu, which launched last year and offers a version of ChatGPT built just for universities at a discount. Google is similarly marketing its Gemini Pro plan to students, who can currently get one year for free. Anthropic is selling a version of its Claude chatbot to universities, too. All of these education-specific products work a lot like the consumer versions but don't train their models on student data.

That all sounds good in theory, and it all costs money. It goes without saying that schools with more resources will be able to take better advantage of these new AI tools, possibly improving teachers' lives and student performance.

“Technology is not and never has been a silver bullet to address some of these more structural issues that exist in our education system,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media.

This is assuming that AI in education actually delivers the desired results, which would defy the decades-long trend in edtech. Despite initiatives that date back to the '90s to give schools cheap and easy access to the internet, a quarter of the school districts in the US don't even have broadband that's fast enough to support some of these applications. It's hard to have an education revolution when the page won't load.

So, for a number of reasons, chatbots won't be replacing teachers any time soon. More teachers may enlist AI to mix up their lesson plans, and students will inevitably try to find high-tech ways to get homework help. A chatbot that refuses to tell them answers might be their best hope.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Nvidia earnings recap: Stock slips despite earnings beat as China sales remain uncertain","https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-earnings-call-report-live-updates-2025-5","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:11:00 GMT","

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't.

Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05.

Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company.

Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region.

Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added.

""We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,"" she said.

Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion.

Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country.

""We just have to keep advocating,"" Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

""It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China,"" he said. ""So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market.""

Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong.

""Everything's sold out,"" he said.

Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close.

Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play.

In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid.

""Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s,"" analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. ""Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out.""

Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note.

""The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations,"" he wrote.

On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up.

""This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China,"" Ives wrote.

David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an ""incorrect knee-jerk reaction,"" and that the company's current growth rate is still ""remarkable.""

""I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue,"" Wagner said.

In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the ""AI platform the world's been waiting for."" He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is ""ramping at full speed.""

Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI.

Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024.

Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that ""everything's sold out,"" including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips.

He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals.

Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on ""annual rhythm,"" but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026.

""Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now,"" Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference.

""We just have to keep advocating,"" Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about ""the importance of American companies"" getting access to China's market.

Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China.

Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of.

""It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China,"" he says. ""So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market.""

CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI.

""Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer,"" Huang says. ""Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools.""

Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be ""a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more."" As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year.

""And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously,"" he says. ""The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly.""

Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving.

""We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,"" she says.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.)

Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says.

While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell.

Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion.

CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks.

She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues.

A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter.

Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks.

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030.

""The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia,"" she says.

CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts.

""Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around,"" wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat.""

""And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop,"" he added.

In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year.

It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024.

Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D.

Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business.

For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance.

It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter.

""In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China,"" the company said. ""There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.""

CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call.

The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high.

The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia.

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs.

All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants.

Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending.

William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion.

Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China.

Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology.

— Ana Altchek

Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings.

Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further.

Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth.

During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned.

Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology.

— Brent D. Griffiths

In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports.

The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers.

CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access.

Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips.

The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported.

President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region.

Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though.

Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said.

Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions.

— Ana Altchek

Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed ""to kill"" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner.

Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to ""The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant,"" Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips.

""They are going to put us out of business,"" Huang said, according to the book. ""Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel.""

Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline.

Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call.

— Brent D. Griffiths

Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a ""significant acceleration"" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note.

Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September.

""The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year,"" the firm wrote in a note on Monday.

Baird reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside.

In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference.

The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and ""building it here on shore."" While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress.

— Ana Altchek

Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter.

The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack.

""We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries,"" the bank said in a note to clients on Monday.

Analysts reiterated their ""overweight"" rating on the stock.

Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million.

Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions.

— Ana Altchek

Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post ""healthy"" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips.

""The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least,"" they wrote.

They continued: ""As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name.""

Analysts reiterated their ""Buy"" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside.

Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI ""hit a tipping point at enterprises.""

Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the ""solution of choice"" for training large language models.

""NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index,"" they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index.

Evercore reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Amazon has mostly sat out the AI talent war. This internal document reveals why.","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ai-talent-wars-internal-document-2025-8","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

As the AI talent war sweeps across Silicon Valley, Amazon has largely sat on the sidelines. A confidential internal document, and accounts from people familiar with the matter, reveal why.

The company has flagged its unique pay structure, lagging AI reputation, and rigid return-to-office rules as major hurdles. Now, the tech giant is being pushed to rethink its recruiting strategy as it scrambles to compete for top talent.

The document, from late last year, was written by the HR team covering Amazon's non-retail businesses, including Amazon Web Services, advertising, devices, entertainment, and the newly formed artificial general intelligence team.

""GenAI hiring faces challenges like location, compensation, and Amazon's perceived lag in the space,"" the document noted. ""Competitors often provide more comprehensive and aggressive packages."" Business Insider obtained a copy of the document.

Amazon's absence from recent splashy AI hires underscores those concerns. Meta has pulled in high-profile talent from ScaleAI, Apple, and OpenAI. Google and OpenAI continue to be top destinations for AI experts, while Microsoft has even drafted a wish list of Meta AI employees it hopes to recruit.

Amazon's spokesperson initially told BI that the company continues to ""adapt our approach to remain highly competitive, maintaining flexibility in both our compensation packages and work arrangements to attract and retain the best AI talent in this dynamic market.""

Hours later, the spokesperson updated the statement, saying the premise of the story was ""wrong,"" without providing any specifics.

""We continue to attract and retain some of the best people in the world and they're building and deploying GenAI applications at a rapid clip. Our compensation is competitive, but we also want missionaries who are passionate about inventing things that will make a meaningful difference for customers — for those kinds of people, there's no better place in the world to build.""

Amazon is famously frugal. One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos still using door desks today.

This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation.

The internal document described compensation as one of the ""hotly debated topics"" among Amazon recruiters, citing the company's strict use of fixed salary bands for each role. Amazon's ""egalitarian philosophy"" on pay leaves its offers ""below par"" compared with top rivals, it added.

""The lack of salary range increases for several key job families over the past few years does not position Amazon as an employer of choice for top tech talent,"" the document warned.

For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is limited, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field. Indeed, Amazon has yet to find a blockbuster AI product like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, although its Bedrock AI cloud service has made progress.

Amazon's pay structure has been a long-standing source of tension.

Several people who spoke to Business Insider cited the 2020 departure of Amazon robotics VP Brad Porter as evidence of the company's frugal approach hampering talent recruitment and retention. Porter left in part after Amazon refused to raise his pay band.

Amazon's stock vesting schedule is also heavily backloaded, a structure that can be less attractive to new hires. The policy extends even to top executives, who generally receive no cash bonuses.

In addition to highlighting Amazon's ""perceived lag in the AI space,"" the internal document said generative AI has further intensified the competition for specialized talent, particularly individuals with expertise in large language models.

An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling.

""Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave,"" Reyes said. ""Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet.""

Some investors share that view. On Amazon's earnings call last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pressed CEO Andy Jassy on Wall Street's ""narrative right now that AWS is falling behind"" in AI and fears of losing market share to rivals. Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call.

Amazon intends to tackle these concerns. According to the document, the company will refine its ""compensation and location strategy"" and host more events designed to highlight its generative AI capabilities. It also intends to set up dedicated recruiting teams for generative AI within business units like AWS to boost efficiency.

Another point of contention is Amazon's aggressive return-to-office mandate, which has already caused logistical issues.

The company's new ""hub"" policy — which requires employees to relocate to a central office or risk termination — has further limited its access to ""high-demand talent like those with GenAI skills,"" according to the internal document.

""Hubs constrain market availability,"" it stated.

Amazon is exploring ways to allow for more ""location-flexible"" roles, the document added.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company is ""always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations.""

Amazon hasn't been entirely on the sidelines. Last year, it brought on Adept CEO David Luan as part of a licensing deal with the AI startup. Luan now heads Amazon's AI agents lab. But the company has also seen departures, including senior AI leaders like chip designer Rami Sinno and VP Vasi Philomin, who worked on Bedrock.

One Amazon recruiter told Business Insider that a growing number of job candidates started declining offers last year because of the company's RTO policy. Even if a competitor pays less, people are open to taking the job if they can stay remote, this person said.

""We are losing out on talent,"" this person added.

Indeed, Bloomberg reported recently that Oracle has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past two years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier.

The internal Amazon document dates to late last year, leaving open the possibility that the company has since adjusted its compensation approach to make exceptions for top AI talent.

Still, multiple people familiar with the situation told Business Insider there haven't been any formal updates to internal pay guidelines. One current Amazon manager said it remains almost impossible for the company to enact sweeping changes, given its long track record of sticking to the existing system. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.

""Based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from changing an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades,"" Amazon wrote this year about executive compensation in its annual proxy statement.

Of course, the AI talent war may end up being an expensive and misguided strategy, stoked by hype and investor over-exuberance.

Some of the high-profile recruits Meta recently lured have already departed.

The U.S. economy grew at a pace that was faster than expected in the second quarter as consumers and businesses held up against tariff volatility.

Gross domestic product rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the April-through-June period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its second estimate for the most encompassing measure of economic activity. The reading was better than an initial 3.0% estimate as well as the 3.1% Dow Jones consensus forecast.

Consumer spending, which rose by 1.6% compared with an initial 1.4% estimate, helped push the number higher.

Importantly, a measure called final sales to private domestic purchasers jumped 1.9%, up from the previous figure of 1.2%. Federal Reserve officials watch that metric closely as an indication of demand and sales that focuses on activity within U.S. borders, an especially important measure considering the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The GDP number also reflected the unusual impact of the tariffs as they related to trade numbers.

Imports, which subtract from GDP, tumbled 29.8% in the quarter after companies stockpiled ahead of Trump's April 2 ""liberation day"" announcement. The figure was a bit less than the previous estimate of 30.3%.

At the same time, exports, which add to GDP, fell by 1.3%, compared with the previous estimate of -1.8%. Taking the figures together, net exports added nearly 5 percentage points to the Q2 total.

For the first half of the year, GDP has grown about 2.1%, or an average of a little more than 1% per quarter. The economy contracted 0.5% in the first quarter, largely due to the impact of the import rush.

""The good news is consumption came in higher than previously thought. Americans are continuing to spend despite the tariffs and uncertainty, albeit at a slower pace than past years,"" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Going forward, the economy is likely to stay in this slower speed mode with spending and growth around 1.5% as the tariffs become more visible to American consumers.""

With the first months' data mostly in the books, the economy is growing at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure.

Inflation-related estimates were little changed from the initial reading. Core personal consumption expenditures prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5%, unchanged from the prior figure, while the headline PCE price index edged lower to 2%, in line with the Fed's inflation goal.

In this article

Best Buy surpassed Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations for its most recent quarter on Thursday, but stuck with its full-year forecast, citing tariff uncertainty.

On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said the retailer is ""increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year."" She said the company is ""trending toward the higher end of our sales range.""

Yet she said, ""given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter.""

The consumer electronics retailer said it expects revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.15 to $6.30 for its full fiscal year 2026. In May, Best Buy had cut its full-year profit guidance from a prior range of $6.20 to $6.60.

The middle of Best Buy's expected full-year revenue range would be roughly flat to its revenue of $41.53 billion in the previous year. Best Buy said it expects full-year comparable sales, a metric that tracks online sales and sales at stores open at least 14 months, to range between a 1% decline and a 1% increase.

Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said the company's full-year guidance reflects that some shoppers could hold off on purchases in the third quarter. He said the retailer could see a slowdown in the business in October ""as people are waiting for those holiday deals to come.""

For Best Buy, back-to-school season is a crucial time as families and students come to the store for laptops, tablets and more. Barry said the company has seen ""a strong customer response"" to its sales events during the season.

""These results demonstrate an important aspect of our thesis: Our model really shines when there is innovation,"" she said.

Shares of Best Buy were down nearly 6% in midday trading.

Here's how the retailer did for the three-month period that ended August 2 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Best Buy's net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2026 fell to $186 million, or 87 cents per share, from $291 million, or $1.34 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring charges, Best Buy reported earnings per share of $1.28.

Revenue increased from $9.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Best Buy has been navigating a challenging trifecta of factors. Customers have bought fewer kitchen appliances as they put off home purchases and projects because of higher interest rates. Some have hesitated to splurge on pricier items because of tariff-related uncertainty or held out on tech replacements as they wait for new or eye-catching items. The company's annual sales have declined for the past three years.

To spur growth, Best Buy launched a third-party marketplace earlier this month to offer shoppers a wider selection of consumer electronics, accessories and more. On the marketplace, sellers who apply for the platform can list their own brands and items on Best Buy's website and app.

The company already increased prices on some items because of tariff-related higher costs, Barry said on a mid-May call with reporters. She did not specify which items now cost more and described price increases as ""the very last resort.""

Still, tariffs did not have a material impact on fiscal second-quarter financial results, Barry said on the company's earnings call Thursday.

Barry said that shopping patterns at Best Buy have not changed from previous quarters. She said customers are ""resilient, but deal-focused"" and have been attracted to the company's sales events like the one it held in July.

""In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,"" she said.

Best Buy's comparable sales rose 1.6% in the fiscal second quarter compared to the year-ago period. That marked the company's highest growth in three years, Barry said on the company's earnings call.

In the U.S., comparable sales increased 1.1%, as customers bought mobile phones, video gaming equipment and items from its computing category. However, those sales trends were partially offset by weaker sales of appliances, home theaters, tablets and drones, the company said.

Investors have looked for signs that the replacement cycle is picking up about five years after consumers stocked up on laptops, kitchen appliances, computer screens and more during the Covid pandemic.

There were some indications of that rebound in Best Buy's second quarter. Barry said the retailer's computing category marked its sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth. It also recorded the highest number of second-quarter laptop unit sales in 15 years, she said.

Gaming in particular had stronger-than-expected sales in the quarter, thanks to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Barry said. The retailer capitalized on the highly anticipated launch by offering a way for customers to pre-order and opening stores at midnight when the gaming console dropped on June 5, so customers could line up and get it right away.

In the back half of the year, Barrie said Best Buy will try to rev up sales in slower categories like appliances and home theater by sharpening price points, adjusting the merchandise it sells and expanding the staffing devoted to them. The retailer has increasingly leaned on its vendor partners to staff stores, bringing in employees of Apple and Samsung for example, to support sales in different parts of its stores.

Barry said the retailer expects brands to ramp up those staffing contributions in the back half of the year.

Along with adding more dedicated brand experts to its stores, Best Buy has added new experiences to attract and engage customers. It's testing mini-showrooms with Ikea that feature kitchen and laundry room appliances and merchandise from both retailers in 10 stores in Florida and Texas. It is also rolling out new experiences with Breville and SharkNinja to show off trendy coffeemakers, beauty items and more, Barry said. And it has areas in stores where shoppers can try out Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses with Meta AI technology.

For the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, Best Buy worked with Nintendo to double the space in stores ahead of the June launch. Nintendo also brought game trucks to select stores, physical trailers where customers could play with the new system and try out the latest videogames.

Best Buy's fiscal second-quarter online sales in the U.S. rose 5.1% year over year and accounted for about a third of Best Buy's total U.S. revenue in the quarter.

There is growing evidence that the widespread adoption of generative AI is impacting the job prospects of America's workers, according to a paper released on Tuesday by three Stanford University researchers.

The study analyzed payroll records from millions of American workers, generated by ADP, the largest payroll software firm in the U.S.

The report found ""early, large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the AI revolution is beginning to have a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the American labor market.""

Most notably, the findings revealed that workers between the ages of 22 and 25 in jobs most exposed to AI — such as customer service, accounting and software development — have seen a 13% decline in employment since 2022.

By contrast, employment for more experienced workers in the same fields, and for workers of all ages in less-exposed occupations such as nursing aides, has stayed steady or grown. Jobs for young health aides, for example, rose faster than their older counterparts.

Front-line production and operations supervisors' roles also showed an increase in employment for young workers, though this growth was smaller than that for workers over the age of 35.

The potential impact of AI on the job market has been a concern across industries and age groups, but the Stanford study appears to show that the results will be far from uniform. 

The study sought to rule out factors that could skew the data, including education level, remote work, outsourced jobs, and broader economic shifts, which could impact hiring decisions.

According to the Stanford study, their findings may explain why national employment growth for young workers has been stagnant, while overall employment has largely remained resilient since the global pandemic, despite recent signs of softening.

Young workers were said to be especially vulnerable because AI can replace ""codified knowledge,"" or ""book-learning"" that comes from formal education. On the other hand, AI may be less capable of replacing knowledge that comes from years of experience. 

The researchers also noted that not all uses of AI are associated with declines in employment. In occupations where AI complements work and is used to help with efficiency, there have been muted changes in employment rates.

The study — which hasn't been peer-reviewed — appears to show mounting evidence that AI will replace jobs, a topic that has been hotly debated. 

Earlier this month, a Goldman Sachs economist said changes to the American labor market brought on by the arrival of generative AI were already showing up in employment data, particularly in the technology sector and among younger employees. 

He also noted that most companies were yet to deploy artificial intelligence for day-to-day use, meaning that the job market impact had yet to be fully realized.

Walgreens on Thursday named retail veteran Mike Motz as its chief executive officer after the U.S. pharmacy chain was taken private by Sycamore Partners, marking a fresh chapter for the company that has been struggling to keep pace with rivals.

The management shake-up came on the heels of Sycamore's roughly $10 billion acquisition of Walgreens Boots Alliance, completed earlier in the day.

Motz, previously the CEO of office supplies chain Staples' U.S. retail business, will succeed Tim Wentworth and steer the ailing pharmacy operator as it shifts its focus back on core retail and pharmacy operations. He had also worked as the president of Canadian pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart.

Walgreens has struggled to expand beyond its pharmacy business and diversify into broader healthcare services, even as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turned to lower-cost options from Amazon and Walmart for their prescriptions and toiletries.

Wentworth, who took the helm in 2023, spearheaded a turnaround at the company through cost cuts, including the removal of multiple mid-level executives and store closures. Wentworth will continue to serve as a director, Walgreens said.

The company also appointed John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a senior adviser to Sycamore, as executive chairman.

Rheinmetall's newly-opened factory in Northern Germany — set to become Europe's biggest ammunition production facility — is another step in the region's race to catch up with Russian output, according to the company's chief executive.

CEO Armin Papperger on Wednesday told CNBC that Russia had the capacity to put out 4 to 5 million artillery ammunition rounds a year. Comparatively, he said Europe has a yearly output of around 2 million, more than half of which is produced by Rheinmetall.

The European Union has been supporting Ukraine in its military effort to combat Russia's invasion, amid uncertainty over the U.S.' long-term plans to back Kyiv.

Europe's ""biggest need is artillery ammunition and missiles,"" Papperger said, stressing the new plant in Unterluess will focus on both items. The plant's output is expected to reach 350,000 artillery shells a year by 2027.

""We do our utmost, we do whatever we can do to be fast. I had a chat before with [German Defense Minister Boris] Boris Pistorius about that, he said, hurry up. We have to do more,"" Papperger told CNBC's Annette Weisbach.

Along with other European countries and NATO members, Germany has pledged to ramp up defense spending and expand its military in the coming decade — in Berlin's case, enabled by reforms earlier this year to its debt rules. It has specifically committed to more than double its defense spending to 153 billion euros ($178 billion) by 2029. Some analysts say Germany has more fiscal headroom to deliver on those promises than do the governments of France, Italy and the U.K.

Rheinmetall has been a major beneficiary of that trend, with its share price more than doubling last year and extending another 166% in the year to date.

Papperger told CNBC on Wednesday that he expected new contracts to come in over the fourth quarter this year and throughout the first quarter of 2026, and that it had received down payments from the government enabling it to make new investments.

""The German government is very fair to us,"" he said.

Speaking at the plant's opening on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the factory was set up by Rheinmetall in a ""staggering"" timeframe of 14 months.

""This is exactly what we need to ensure the prosperity and security of our economies and societies across Europe and North America, especially at a time when we are aggressively being challenged,"" Rutte said.

The NATO chief added that Russia and China were ""producing weapons and heavy military equipment at an incredible rate"" and with ""little transparency.""

""Now we need to see similar efforts to increase the production of more complex capabilities, like tanks and air defense systems and missiles,"" Rutte said.

In this article

Sales of Tesla cars in Europe plunged in July, in the company's seventh consecutive month of declines, while Chinese rival BYD saw a monthly surge, data released on Thursday showed.

New car registrations of Tesla vehicles totaled 8,837 in July, down 40% year-on-year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA. BYD meanwhile recorded 13,503 new registrations in July, up 225% annually.

Tesla's declines took place even as overall sales of battery electric cars rose in Europe, ACEA data showed.

Elon Musk's automaker faces a number of challenges in Europe including intense ongoing competition and reputational damage to the brand from the billionaire's incendiary rhetoric and relationship with the Trump administration.

Tesla has struggled globally in recent times. The company's auto sales revenue fell in the second quarter of the year and Musk warned that the automaker ""could have a few rough quarters"" ahead.

One of Tesla's issues is that it has not had a major refresh of its car line-up. The company said this year that it is working on a more affordable electric car with ""volume production"" planned for the second half of 2025, with investors hoping this will reinvigorate sales.

Thomas Besson, head of automobile sector research at Kepler Cheuvreux, said Tesla management has been trying to ""convince investors that Tesla is not really a car company"" by talking about artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomy.

""They talk about almost everything else but the car they're selling at a slower pace now because effectively, the age of their vehicle is much higher than the competition and the latest products have not been as successful as hoped, notably the Cybertruck,"" Besson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

But the U.S. automaker is up against Chinese players, which are launching models aggressively and ramping up their push into Europe. BYD has led that charge, opening showrooms up across the continent and launching its cars at competitive prices over the last two years.

Chinese brands commanded a record market share rate of more than 5% in the first half of the year, which is a record high, according to data from JATO Dynamics released last month.

It's not only Tesla feeling the heat from Chinese competition. Jeep owner Stellantis, South Korea's Hyundai Group and Japan's Toyota and Suzuki, all posted year-on-year declines in European new car registrations in July.

By contrast, Volkswagen, BMW and Renault Group, were among those that logged increases in new European car registrations across the month.

Market watchers might be perplexed by the seemingly contradictory moves of Nvidia's shares in extended trading.

The company beat expectations for its second-quarter results, and its forward revenue guidance also surpassed expectations. A stock buyback was also announced, but the stock fell.

The reason? Data center revenue, which serves as a proxy for the company's AI prospects, came up short of estimates.

Nvidia's growth in recent years has been fueled by its data center business, which focuses on graphics processors, or GPUs, and related products that link and scale them for large deployments. Revenue from the division rose 56% from a year earlier to $41.1 billion, slightly below the $41.34 billion estimate from StreetAccount.

However, it is important to note that the company is not performing poorly. In fact, the chipmaker has topped earnings estimates in 11 of the past 12 quarters, but its shares fell after results on four of those occasions, according to FactSet.

Could investors then, be expecting too much from the chipmaker?

Remember, Nvidia still has other engines to rely on, such as its gaming division. In fact, before the AI boom, Nvidia's gaming division was its largest revenue driver, and the firm was more widely known among computer enthusiasts for its graphics cards, which they would install in their own rigs.

Trees, forests and the Nvidia logo might all be green, but investors shouldn't miss the Nvidia forest for the AI tree.

Nvidia posts results beat. The tech giant reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%. However, the stock slipped in extended trading, as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second straight period.

S&P notches fresh closing high. The broad market index gained 0.24% at the end of the session and reached a new closing high of 6,481.40 as all three major U.S. indexes climbed on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's earnings. Over in Asia, markets were mixed, but Hong Kong led losses, falling over 1%.

Japan's top negotiator drops U.S. trip. Top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa canceled a trip to the United States on Thursday over issues related to the U.S.-Japan trade deal. Tokyo said the trip would have involved discussions on U.S. tariff measures, but as ""certain points required further technical discussion,"" the trip was cancelled.

Qantas soars to record high. Shares of Australian flag carrier Qantas rose to a record high Thursday after its full-year earnings results beat estimates, buoyed by resilient demand across its domestic and international networks. The stock posted a gain of up to 13.59% in early trade.

[PRO] Pros assess if TSMC is a ""smart"" buy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's said last week that investors buying TSMC stock would be ""very smart."" Analysts from Morningstar, Macquarie and GFM Asset Management share their thoughts with CNBC.

Taylor Swift's engagement is a big enough deal to move these stocks

Taylor Swift not only moves fans. The pop star's engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce was also enough to move stocks.

Her engagement announcement led to shifts in the share prices of Signet Jewelers, Ralph Lauren and American Eagle.

Other brands rushed to cash in the cultural cache of the Swift-Kelce engagement. Domino's Pizza and GrubHub pushed alerts to app users, with each referencing Swift's songs and including a ring emoji. Soda producer Poppi shared an Instagram photo themed to the duo's social media caption.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

Hello, this is Spriha Srivastava, CNBC International's Executive Editor for Digital, writing from London. This week, I take a closer look at India's tightrope walk — tariffs from Washington, oil from Moscow, and an uneasy handshake with Beijing. Let's dive in.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Picture this: you're at a dinner party with three friends who are struggling to get along. One is picking fights with everyone, another is slipping you secret notes under the table, and the third is that old frenemy you'd rather avoid but can't ignore. Awkward, right? 

That is where India finds itself. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is keeping India's energy bills in check with cheap oil, and Beijing, despite a bruised relationship, is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week. India's juggling act on the world stage has never looked more complicated, or more consequential. 

Trade with the U.S. has become a flashpoint. Washington has imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, followed by another 25% penalty tied to India's Russian oil purchases. That leaves duties on some Indian exports as high as 50%. The U.S. is India's single largest export market, worth about $87 billion a year, nearly a fifth of its total merchandise trade. Key Indian sectors such as diamonds, garments and seafood are especially exposed.

Think of what that means on the ground. Diamond polishers in Gujarat, garment workers in Tirupur, and seafood processors in Kerala all depend on U.S. orders. Electronics and pharma are spared for now, but other sectors — which employ millions — are suddenly exposed. 

The tariff fight comes even as the two countries deepen strategic ties. On a number of fronts, the U.S. and India are cooperating; the two countries are expanding defense cooperation, for instance, working together in the Quad, and advancing semiconductor supply chain talks. 

Major U.S. firms, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, have increased their investments in India in recent years. Yet trade frictions complicate the relationship, raising the question in Delhi: does Washington view India as a true partner, or simply another trading problem to manage?

Now, let's turn to Russia. India is the world's third-largest oil consumer, burning through more than 5 million barrels a day, so cheap energy isn't a luxury — it's a necessity. In 2021, just 1% of India's crude came from Russia. Today it's more than 35%, around 1.75 million barrels a day, saving Delhi over $17 billion since early 2022, according to analyst estimates. Those discounts have kept inflation in check and given Modi breathing space at home. 

But there's a second layer here. India is walking a geopolitical tightrope, with Pakistan tensions threatening to boil over. In that context, Russia is a vital security partner and central to India's defense procurement, making it difficult for Delhi to pull away without weakening its security posture.

The catch? Washington isn't impressed. U.S. officials including Peter Navarro and Scott Bessent argue Delhi is ""profiteering"" by paying above the G7's $60 price cap on Russian oil and exporting refined fuels back to Europe.  

Then comes Beijing, which represents perhaps the trickiest relationship of all. Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and stand alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing says the event is a display of solidarity, tensions between India and China remain unresolved.

Border clashes in 2020 killed at least 20 Indian soldiers, prompting a freeze in high-level engagement. Since then, India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, tightened foreign investment rules, and promoted self-reliance in key sectors. Yet trade between the two countries still hit $118 billion last year, with India importing far more than it exports. This imbalance frustrates Delhi but also underscores why cutting ties is not realistic.

Analysts say Modi is unlikely to secure a major breakthrough when he visits Tianjin. But showing up is a signal in itself — that India is willing to keep lines of communication open, even while deepening defense ties with Washington and buying cheap oil from Moscow. 

Step back, and India's position looks clearer. The U.S. is its biggest customer but also its harshest critic. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore. Delhi calls its approach ""strategic autonomy."" It has worked for decades, but today the balancing act is under more pressure than ever.

Which brings us back to that dinner party. India wants all three guests to remain seated, however awkward the conversation may be. The real test is whether Modi can stop someone from banging the table, throwing down their fork, and storming out. 

Richard Rossow, Senior Adviser and Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that a deal between the U.S. and India is ""still very much possible"" as the South Asian country puts forth substantial sweeteners.

Arnab Mitra, India consumer analyst at Goldman Sachs, said there could be a mass consumption revival in India driven by rural demand and upcoming GST reforms.

Meera Shankar, former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said India will not be able to entirely open up its agricultural sector because of domestic political sensitivities.

Trade negotiations between India and the U.S. still ongoing. India's Foreign Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that India has ""some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended."" He added that ""it is our right to make decisions in our 'national interest'.""

India and Russia reaffirm plans to boost bilateral trade. The two countries have vowed to expand their trade ties in a move indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil are unlikely to impact their partnership.

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor urges India to reassess Russian oil purchases. Raghuram Rajan said that Trump's hefty tariffs send New Delhi a clear ""wake-up call"" to reduce its dependence on a single trading partner. He added that it is now important for India to ""ask who benefits and who is hurt.""

People on the street are looking at China and comparing it to India. People who have been away from the Chinese markets think it's time to move back. But, I do think this is a relatively short-term thinking. India is still going to do very very well from a longer-term perspective.

— Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Markets

Indian markets fell Thursday, after a holiday the day before. It marked the first session since the additional 25% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. kicked in on Wednesday.

The benchmark Nifty 50 was down 0.85%, while the BSE Sensex index fell 0.87%. The 50-stock Nifty 50 has risen over 3% since the start of the year, while the BSE Sensex is up 2%.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield fell to 6.58%.

In this article

Microsoft on Thursday said that it had terminated two employees who broke into President Brad Smith's office earlier this week.

The news comes after seven current and former Microsoft employees on Tuesday held a protest in the company's building in Redmond, Washington, in opposition to the Israeli military's alleged use of the company's software as part of its invasion of Gaza.

The protesters, affiliated with the group No Azure for Apartheid, gained entry into Smith's office and had demanded that Microsoft end its direct and indirect support to Israel.

In a post on Instagram, No Azure for Apartheid said Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle had been fired by the company.

""Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, noting unlawful break-ins at the executive offices.

""These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters,"" the statement added.

In the aftermath of the protests, Smith claimed that the protestors had blocked people out of the office, planted listening devices in the form of phones, and refused to leave until they were removed by police. 

No Azure For Apartheid defines itself as ""a movement of Microsoft workers demanding that Microsoft end its direct and indirect complicity in Israeli apartheid and genocide.""

The Guardian earlier this month reported that the Israeli military had used Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure to store the phone calls of Palestinians, leading the company to authorize a third-party investigation into whether its technology has been used in surveillance.

Smith said on Tuesday that the company would ""investigate and get to the truth"" of how services are being used. 

According to Smith, No Azure For Apartheid also mounted protests around the company's campus last week, leading to 20 arrests in one day, with 16 having never worked at Microsoft. 

No Azure for Apartheid has held a series of actions this year, including at Microsoft's Build developer conference and at a celebration of the company's 50th anniversary. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that a Microsoft director had reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the protests.

Microsoft's actions come after tech giant Google fired 28 employees last year following a series of protests against labor conditions and the company's contract with the Israeli government and military for cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. In that case, some employees had gained access to the office of Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google's cloud unit.

Japan's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa canceled a trip to the United States on Thursday over issues related to the U.S.-Japan trade deal.

In a statement, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that his trip would have involved the discussion of U.S. tariff measures.

""However, during the coordination with the US, because it became apparent that certain points required further technical discussion, the trip was cancelled, and it was decided that discussions will continue at the administrative level,"" Hayashi told reporters.

Japanese media outlet Kyodo News said it has not been decided whether he will reschedule the trip, while Reuters said Akazawa could head to Washington as early next week after the outstanding issues are resolved, citing an anonymous government source.

Hayashi said Tokyo will urge the U.S. to amend its presidential order on reciprocal tariffs as soon as possible, and ask Washington to issue a presidential order to lower tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.

The White House has an executive order setting the baseline tariff rate for Japan at 15%, but there has not been a written confirmation cutting the tariff rate for automobiles to 15% from 25%.

Akazawa reportedly said in July that the U.S. had promised to amend the executive order on reciprocal tariffs on Japan to include a ""no-stacking"" arrangement, in which tariffs will not stack on each other beyond 15%. That would be similar to the arrangement made with the European Union.

""We have confirmed with the United States that a sincere and prompt implementation of the Japan-US agreement is vital,"" he said on Thursday.

Separately, Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa said on Thursday that although tariff negotiations between the two sides have resulted in an agreement, many uncertainties remain.

He warned that exports and industrial production are projected to be negatively affected in Japan ""for the time being,"" saying that there will be a ""reactionary decline"" in light of front-loading from U.S. tariffs. Corporate profits are also expected to decline, mainly in the manufacturing sector, Nakagawa said, ""reflecting the effects of the deterioration in export profitability due to the increase in U.S. tariffs and of the slowdown in overseas economies.""

Reuters had earlier reported that also on the agenda for Akazawa's trip was a written confirmation of the details of Japan's $550 billion investment package for the U.S. in exchange for reduced tariffs on imports.

That comes after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a Fox News interview on Monday stateside that the U.S. will make an announcement regarding the package.

The $550 billion package was announced as part of Tokyo's deal with the U.S. in July, which saw so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs on Japanese exports lowered to 15% from 25%. Tariffs on Japan's key automobile sector were also cut to 15%.

However, sticking points emerged over the $550 billion investment package, with Trump touting the package as ""our money to invest, as we like.""

""Some people are saying Japan is simply handing over $550 billion,"" Akazawa said after the trade deal was announced. ""But such claims are completely off the mark,"" according a to Reuters report on July 25.

Akazawa also reportedly said that the returns would be split between Japan and the United States, according to the degree of contributions by each side, while recognizing the U.S.' willingness to contribute a larger share.

 A significant portion of the almost $5 billion ETH awaiting withdrawal may be sold to lock in profits, considering Ether's 72% climb over the past three months 

Ethereum is seeing the largest validator exodus in crypto history, with over 1 million Ether tokens currently waiting to be withdrawn from staking through Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) network.

Ethereum's exit queue surpassed 1 million Ether (ETH) worth $4.96 billion on Thursday. This marks the amount of Ether set for withdrawal by the network's validators, who are responsible for adding new blocks and verifying transactions in proposed blocks, playing a vital role in the functioning of the blockchain network.

The mass exodus has extended the validator exit waiting time to a record 18 days and 16 hours, according to blockchain data from validatorqueue.com.

While this does not mean that all the validators are looking to sell their holdings, a significant portion of the almost $5 billion may be sold to lock in profits, considering that Ether has risen 72% over the past three months.

“The exit queue hitting 1 million ETH reflects healthy market dynamics rather than a cause for concern,” Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone blockchain oracle firm, told Cointelegraph, adding:

The “unprecedented demand” from public vehicles such as treasury firms and exchange-traded funds means that the validator sales are “easily absorbed by this institutional appetite,” he said.

Ether remains the “liquidity magnet” of the crypto industry, with Ether futures open interest nearing $33 billion, signaling solid institutional interest, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo.

“Standard Chartered reiterated that ETH and ETH-treasury firms remain undervalued even at these levels, projecting a $7,500 year-end target,” said the analyst, adding:

Ether “looks primed to test $5,000,” said the analyst, adding that investor demand may be shaped by Thursday's release of the US initial jobless claims report, along with Friday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

In contrast to the 1 million Ether set to exit the network, only 737,000 Ether are awaiting being staked in the entry queue, with an average wait time of 12 days and 19 hours.

Still, the network remains stable with over 1 million active validators and 35.6 million Ether, representing over 29.4% of the total supply.

Ops, si è verificato un problema

Ethereum introduced smart contracts, expanding on the uses for blockchain technology.

It now has the most total value locked of any blockchain.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) recently turned 10, as it launched on July 30, 2015. In crypto years, that's a fairly long time. Blockchain technology is continuously improving, and most cryptocurrencies either fizzle out quickly or never catch on in the first place.

Considering the massive number of cryptocurrencies that are out there, no one can learn about them all, but Ethereum is one that's worth your time. Here's why.

Ethereum was the first blockchain that could run smart contracts -- self-executing programs built on a blockchain. The introduction of smart contracts was a major development that expanded on what blockchains could do. It led to the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, stablecoins, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), to give a few examples.

Many blockchains with smart contract functionality are competing with Ethereum now. But because Ethereum was the first mover, it has been able to capture a dominant market share.

The current total value locked (TVL) into DeFi applications across all blockchains is $156 billion, according to DefiLlama. Ethereum accounts for a whopping 61% of that with $95 billion in TVL. Solana ranks a distant second with $11 billion. It's the same story with stablecoins, where Ethereum tokens account for 52% of the entire market.

Most of the money and activity is on Ethereum, which has kept it firmly entrenched as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. All the activity on the Ethereum blockchain drives adoption of its native cryptocurrency, because gas fees are paid in ETH tokens.

Ethereum is in a competitive space, and many blockchains have been called potential ""Ethereum killers,"" including Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche. But even after being around for years, they're well behind Ethereum in terms of value and usage, so none of them have lived up to that title so far.

Ethereum may not completely maintain its current market share. It's still well-positioned to remain a top blockchain since it is far ahead in terms of usage.

Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:

Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) demonstrated resilience during the last 24 hours, staging a rally that lifted the token nearly 3% to $5.13. 

The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. This accumulation phase marked the turning point, as buying pressure mounted through the early session.

Momentum built steadily before culminating in a decisive breakout late in the period. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend.

Cryptocurrencies such as ICP appear to be drawing fresh interest as alternative asset classes gain traction. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based on Fibonacci extension levels.

I confess, I wasn't clear on the nature of an altcoin, so the AI clarified for me that it's basically “any cryptocurrency that isn't bitcoin.” Uncreatively, the name comes from “alternative” + “coin.” Some people exclude Ethereum from the category because it's so big, but technically, Ethereum is an altcoin too.

While bitcoin was designed mainly as digital money and a store of value, ChatGPT told me “altcoins explore all sorts of other uses.”

For example:

Ethereum (ETH): Runs smart contracts and decentralized apps.

Ripple/XRP: Focuses on fast, cheap cross-border payments.

Cardano (ADA): Aims to be eco-friendly and research-driven.

Solana (SOL): Offers super-fast and low-cost transactions.

Meme coins (like Dogecoin): Started as jokes but gained popularity.

The examples above already show how altcoins serve a wide range of purposes. ChatGPT explained that most of them were created “to improve on bitcoin's limitations,” be that speed, energy use or programming issues, or “offer completely new functions in finance, gaming, NFTs and more.”

While some of them offer real utility, others are highly speculative, and you definitely don't want to blindly invest in them.

ChatGPT warned that for the average American worker, “balancing safety and upside is key.” You can expect bigger, more established altcoins to offer more stability, whereas newer projects can yield explosive gains — or total losses.

In the realm of the more stable and established picks, ChatGPT offered the following three choices based on insights from Barron's and Crypto Economy.

Ethereum (ETH): The AI suggested that Ethereum is among the most stable altcoins. “Think of Ethereum as the main ‘operating system' for most crypto apps,” it said. A lot of digital contracts and new kinds of online finance run on Ethereum. Thus, “big investors are pouring money in, and some experts think it could climb toward $7,000 this year,” the AI said.

Solana (SOL): Solana is an altcoin that's known for being “lightning-fast and cheap to use,” ChatGPT said, able to process thousands of transactions per second at very low cost, making it practical for things like payments, digital art (NFTs) and other online projects. “Large investors are quietly buying in, which suggests confidence in its future,” the AI said.

Ripple (XRP): XRP is often interchangeably referred to as Ripple, the company that makes it, and is designed for “quick, low-cost money transfers across borders–like sending dollars to Europe in seconds,” the AI said. Though it had some legal battles, they are now settled, giving people more optimism in its staying power.

A couple others that may be on a growth path include TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA).

You don't have to take ChatGPT's word for it, however, you can do your own due diligence by:

Looking at market capitalization (the total value of the coin): Bigger = generally more stable.

Sticking to the top projects (Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, etc.): These have survived multiple market cycles.

Noting red flags: Avoid tiny “penny” coins with huge promises but no track record.

Find out what the altcoin you're interested in really does, ChatGPT suggested. For instance, does it solve a real-world problem (faster payments, smart contracts, gaming) or is it just hype (like meme coins)?

“The more use cases and adoption, the more likely it is to hold value long-term,” the AI said.

Also look into the team and company behind it. Do they have a solid track record, an active developer community that is continually working to improve it and transparency? If not, be wary.

Before you invest, make sure that you can easily buy and sell it on major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken. “If it's only on obscure exchanges, that's a risk,” the AI warned. The higher the liquidity, the less chance of getting “stuck” with a coin you can't sell.

Most of all, don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) drive you, ChatGPT warned. “Just because it's trending on TikTok doesn't mean it's safe.”

Moreover, if the returns sound too good to be true, trust that instinct. And never invest money you need for essentials like rent or emergency funds into crypto.

Key Points

Is Bitcoin losing its grip on crypto investors? Here's what's going on in the crypto sector, and how you should play these trends in the long run.

Market watchers like FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich have noticed a recent shift in the cryptocurrency market. Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk that Bitcoin (BTC 0.22%) investors are moving some of their assets into altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH -3.26%) and Solana (SOL 0.52%).

At the same time, he concedes that the Bitcoin sales could be an early sign of the next crypto winter. So what's next for crypto investors -- another sectorwide selloff, or just a rebalancing of crypto investors' cash?

Kuptsikevich based his analysis on the retreating Bitcoin price. As I'm writing this on the evening of Aug. 26, the largest crypto name has backed down 9.7% from its recent all-time peak. More specifically, Bitcoin is down 6% in the past 30 days while Ethereum gained 20.9% and Solana posted a milder 5.3% gain.

The crypto-market tenor extends to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the sector. The leading iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA -1.85%) has seen asset inflows of 25.5% in the last month, but the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT 0.37%) sister fund only grew its asset portfolio by 1%.

Bitcoin's dominance over the crypto market rose steadily from December 2022 to July 2025, topping out with Bitcoin's market value being nearly 65% of the total crypto market. Since then, the dominance metric has dipped to a still-impressive 57%. Bitcoin remains the king of the hill, but its iron grip over the crypto sector is growing a little weaker.

Image source: Getty Images.

Other metrics are less conclusive.

CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index, for example, sits right in the middle of the chart on a sideways trend over the summer. And if you look at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the last year, they saw a collective gain of 79% while Bitcoin rose by 76%. In other words, the market-driving Bitcoin chart has stayed close to the average performance of other large crypto names.

Keeping all these technical indicators in mind, it's important to note that a proper altcoin season would be the result of some fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency sector itself.

Surging transaction volumes on the Ethereum and Solana blockchain networks could be one example, indicating broader real-world use of these smart contract platforms. Lots of new active addresses on those networks would be a sign of rapidly increasing developer activity -- another bullish trend.

I don't see any of these positive signs for Solana right now, though Ethereum is trending in the right direction. But you know what -- Ethereum is indeed outperforming Solana in terms of recent price gains. You never really know what goes on behind the curtain of these digital assets, but this accurate pairing of blockchain activity and price gains suggests that market makers might base their coin prices on actual cryptocurrency qualities.

And if that's the case, wider use of cryptocurrencies could lead to a real altcoin season. Bitcoin should also benefit from a general crypto surge, but not nearly as quickly as the smart contract experts leading the charge.

So where is the crypto sector going next?

From a historic perspective, it's almost time to start the next crypto winter in preparation for another boom-and-bust cycle around the 2028 Bitcoin halving event. But the strict calendar patterns of earlier Bitcoin halvings have evolved into softer trends with fewer sudden surprises.

The mere presence of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs seems to have a calming effect on crypto prices, and the current government's crypto-friendly policies are also helping. As a result, the crypto sector could sort of skip the expected crypto winter and just trade sideways or slightly higher for a couple of years. That is, unless decentralized finance tools and Web3 concepts take over the crypto narrative for a while. That would be the start of a significant altcoin season.

I'm speaking in generalities because it's pretty much impossible to nail down future tech-culture shifts and the financial market reactions they inspire. At the same time, top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum look poised for wealth-building returns in the long run. With that mindset, I don't really care whether Bitcoin pulls ahead or lags behind the altcoins in 2025 or 2026. The winning idea is to buy each long-term winner on the dips, hold on with so-called diamond hands when the market is tough, and celebrate the resulting wealth many years later.

Bitcoin rebounds to $117K before cooling; Ethereum hits $4,900 as altcoin season signals emerge with BTC dominance slipping to 57%.

Analyst picks Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, Sui, Tron, and Injective as top long-term altcoin plays amid capital rotation from Bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency market has had a turbulent week, swinging between sharp pullbacks and brief rallies. After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday, Bitcoin staged a dramatic rebound, jumping from $110,000 to nearly $117,000 within hours. Ethereum also stole headlines by hitting a fresh all-time high at $4,900. But as quickly as momentum arrived, the market has cooled again, leaving traders trying to read the next move.

One development stands out: Bitcoin dominance is slipping. Currently hovering around 57%, this decline shows capital rotating into altcoins. The pattern is similar to earlier bull market cycles, where Bitcoin rallies first, stalls, and then altcoins take the stage. 

Historically, August has been a slow month for crypto markets. In 2021, momentum didn't return until late September.

The fall in Bitcoin dominance, combined with Ethereum's breakout, hints that altcoins may be on the verge of their own season. If history repeats, the next few weeks could see liquidity pour into a wider set of projects.

In a recent interview with Coinpedia, market analyst Lennaert Snyder outlined where he sees the greatest long-term opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. His focus is on Layer-1 blockchains with thriving ecosystems and Ethereum Layer-2 networks that enhance scalability.

He said that Arbitrum and Optimism are the two Ethereum Layer-2s poised for lasting success, with Arbitrum being his top pick thanks to its developer activity and adoption.

“I also believe ETH L2s will continue to play a major role in scaling Ethereum. That's why I see Arbitrum and Optimism as strong long-term plays, with ARB as my favorite,” he said.

On the Layer-1 side, Snyder pointed to Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), Tron (TRX), and Injective (INJ) as projects with solid fundamentals. Each, he argued, brings unique strengths, particularly in DeFi and stablecoin markets, making them stand out for long-term accumulation.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Philippine Senator Bam Aquino said he intends to soon propose a bill seeking to place the country's national budget on a blockchain platform, local media reported.

During his appearance at the Manila Tech Summit on Wednesday, Aquino said he plans to file a bill in the next couple of weeks proposing to place government budgeting and transactions to a blockchain-based system for greater openness, local business news website BusinessWorld reported.

""No one is crazy enough to put their transactions on blockchain, where every single step of the way will be logged and transparent to every single citizen. But we want to start,” Aquino said at the conference, according to a report from local TV news channel Bilyonaryo.

In a separate Facebook post, Aquino noted that he talked about innovations at the conference, such as ""blockchain-based budgeting to make every peso transparent and accountable.""

""If we're able to do this, I think we'll be the first country to have our budget on the blockchain. Of course, I don't know what kind of support I will get,"" Aquino added.

The Block has reached out to Aquino's office for further information.

Aquino's remarks came after the Department of Budget and Management launched a blockchain-based document validation system on Polygon last month. At the time, Undersecretary Maria Francesca Del Rosario said the system could help combat AI deepfakes and prevent bad actors from falsifying government documents. It's unclear if Aquino's planned measure would be linked to the initiative.

Governments worldwide are exploring blockchain applications for public sector operations. On Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the department will begin publishing economic statistics on the blockchain, starting with GDP figures.

Meanwhile, Philippine Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte has proposed a bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, aiming to accumulate a total of 10,000 BTC over five years.

Oops, something went wrong

Tether, the world's largest digital asset company, has announced plans to launch USDT on RGB, a next-generation protocol for issuing digital assets on Bitcoin.

RGB recently reached mainnet with its 0.11.1 release and is designed to expand Bitcoin's role beyond a store of value. By allowing private, scalable, and user-controlled issuance of assets, RGB creates a pathway for stablecoins to exist natively on Bitcoin's blockchain.

In a blog post, Tether said that with this launch, users will be able to hold and transfer USDT alongside their Bitcoin in the same wallet. RGB's architecture will allow USDT to run directly on Bitcoin's infrastructure.

According to Tether, this also opens the door for advanced features such as offline transactions, giving users greater flexibility and resilience in payment scenarios.

For billions of people globally, the combination of Bitcoin's security and Tether's stability is a step toward stable, everyday digital money.

Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, explains the importance of this move: “Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable. With RGB, USDT gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future.”

By making USDT native to Bitcoin through RGB, Tether is ensuring that the world's first cryptocurrency continues to serve as the bedrock of a global, decentralized financial system.

Earlier this month, Tether made a new investment in Bit2Me, acquiring a minority stake in the Spanish crypto platform.

As part of the deal, Tether said it is also leading a €30 million ($35 million) funding round to support Bit2Me's expansion across Europe and Latin America. The funding round is expected to close in the coming weeks.

Latest data from CryptoQuant shows that stablecoin liquidity continues to expand, but the pace of growth has slowed considerably.

Weekly expansions in stablecoin market capitalization have dropped to around $1.1 billion. This is in stark contrast to the $4–8 billion weekly inflows observed in late 2024, which were instrumental in supporting Bitcoin's sharp upward momentum.

Tether's USDT, the dominant stablecoin, has also seen its 60-day growth moderate, holding at roughly $10 billion compared with peaks above $21 billion earlier in the cycle. While the figures remain in positive territory, they indicate a cooling trend in capital inflows.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 28th, 2025, Chainwire

The ECM Blockchain has set a new milestone as the first blockchain project initiated by Bangladeshi entrepreneur Tanvirul Islam Prince with global reach. Often described as Bangladesh's 1st blockchain initiative on a global scale, ECM Blockchain is being developed as a next-generation distributed ledger network designed to deliver fast, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure for real-world applications. Unlike many pilot initiatives in the country, ECM Blockchain is preparing for a full mainnet launch in Q4 2025, supported by an ecosystem of live projects already in place.

Bangladesh's Growing Role in the Global Tech Industry

Bangladesh has steadily built a reputation as a source of dynamic digital and technological talent. Over the past decade, the country has become one of the fastest-growing IT outsourcing hubs, with thousands of skilled developers, engineers, and digital professionals contributing to projects worldwide. Its young, tech-savvy population has embraced areas such as software development, fintech solutions, mobile applications, and digital entrepreneurship, earning recognition on the global stage.

Bangladesh has also seen several blockchain-related initiatives in recent years:
		



While these reflect Bangladesh's interest in blockchain, they have largely been pilot projects, academic programs, or localized applications. None have yet positioned Bangladesh as a global player in blockchain technology.

The ECM Blockchain marks a turning point - standing as the first blockchain project from a Bangladeshi founder with true global reach, already deploying live projects and preparing to launch a full-scale blockchain network.

How ECM Blockchain Can Benefit Bangladesh

Though ECM Blockchain is designed as a global network, it also holds significant potential benefits for Bangladesh:

This positions ECM Blockchain not only as a global innovation but also as an enabler of Bangladesh's digital transformation journey.
		



An Ecosystem With Global Intent

The ECM Blockchain is represented in the global blockchain industry through the ECM Ecosystem, a suite of interconnected projects that showcase its real-world utility. This ecosystem demonstrates how a Bangladeshi-founded blockchain can scale globally by powering diverse applications across finance, commerce, and digital innovation.

The ECM Ecosystem already includes live and operational projects, which prove the project's delivery capability even before the blockchain mainnet launch:

In addition, several upcoming projects are positioned to expand ECM's global reach:

All of these projects are designed to run on or integrate with the ECM Blockchain mainnet, scheduled for launch in Q4 2025. This combination of live applications and future projects positions ECM as one of the first blockchain networks from Bangladesh to demonstrate adoption and readiness on a global stage.
		



Supporting the ecosystem's development, BlockVerse Solutions, a Bangladeshi-founded technology company headquartered in Dubai, provides the core technical support for ECM Blockchain - ensuring the network's growth is backed by both local expertise and global infrastructure.

Security and Transparency

The ECM Blockchain is being developed with a focus on transparency, scalability, and security. Independent audits, milestone-based releases, and a robust consensus mechanism will ensure trust for enterprises, developers, and users. Its architecture is designed to support high transaction throughput, low latency, and reliable performance, making it suitable for applications ranging from e-commerce to supply chain and financial services.

ECM Coin and ICO

The ECM Coin will serve as the utility token for the ECM Blockchain and its ecosystem. The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is currently live, with 48 million tokens available at $1.20 each out of a total supply of 200 million ECM.
		



Proceeds will be directed toward the development of the ECM Blockchain, ecosystem expansion, and integrations across industries.

As cryptocurrency trading and ICOs are not permitted under current Bangladeshi regulations, the ECM ICO is being conducted internationally only, targeting global investors and markets outside Bangladesh.

Full ICO details, including tokenomics and roadmap, are available at ecmcoin.com. Investors can participate directly through mycoinpoll.com.

The ECM ICO is live now.

About ECM Blockchain




The ECM Blockchain is Bangladesh's first blockchain project with global reach, developed with technical support from BlockVerse Solutions (Dubai HQ). Built as a Layer-2 (L2) based chain, it is designed to deliver low-cost and faster transactions, making it highly efficient for real-world applications. The blockchain powers an ecosystem of projects including MyCoinPoll, bCoinMart, AndroMarkets, CryptoCoinEarning, and Androverse, with a mainnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025.

Home » News » Crypto News

Coinbase's Layer-2 blockchain Base has taken a big leap in the NFT market, securing the third spot in global 30-day NFT trading volume.

Over the last month, Base recorded $47.67 million in NFT trading volume, completing a 70% surge that pushed it past competitors like Immutable zkEVM and Solana, which now rank fourth and fifth, respectively.

The surge was largely driven by collections like Get Based, DX Terminal, and Based Style, which together accounted for nearly $25 million in volume. Beyond NFTs, Base has also become one of the busiest ecosystems overall: in the past 30 days, the network processed 27 million transactions and more than $16 billion in dApp volume.

Despite Base's momentum, Ethereum remains the NFT market leader, logging $408 million in trading volume in the same period. Blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, Moonbirds, BAYC, and Lil Pudgys generated over $200 million in combined activity. However, this dominance comes against a backdrop of declining floor prices. 

Polygon continues to hold second place with $62.29 million in 30-day NFT volume, up 15% on the month. Interestingly, most of this growth came from Courtyard NFTs, a project tokenizing real-world assets like trading cards, which alone contributed $57.65 million, up 21%.

The competition among Ethereum, Polygon, and Base underscores the shifting dynamics of NFT adoption. With Base rapidly climbing the ranks and diversifying its ecosystem activity, analysts suggest it could continue to eat into Solana and Immutable's market share if growth remains steady.

Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. His work has appeared in...

A new “WEB3” token presale has come under heavy scrutiny after blockchain investigator ZachXBT warned that the project may be tied to individuals behind some of the most notorious scams in the NFT space, including the failed Squiggles collection and alleged scammer “Raichu.”

The project, called WEB3, announced its token presale this week through its official X account. The post instructed users to send SOL to a specified wallet address in exchange for $WEB3 tokens, which would later be airdropped to contributors. 

According to the announcement, the WEB3 price will be determined by the amount of SOL raised divided by the total supply. The team also noted that the presale could end at any time and emphasized that participants should not send funds from exchange wallets.

Reportedly, the project raised $500k in 3 hours, and it has less than 12 hours left. 

While the project framed the offering as a step toward fairness and transparency, ZachXBT quickly raised concerns. “Community alert: @web3 is linked to a team member of the Squiggles NFT rug and Raichu, who I previously posted about,” he wrote on X.

The alarm comes amid resurfacing evidence of the Squiggles scandal in early 2022, when the project drew more than 230,000 Twitter followers and over 360,000 Discord members ahead of a highly anticipated NFT drop. 

memorieshttps://t.co/XJ1KnjVXKL

Investigations at the time by YouTuber Coffeezilla and others suggested the collection's founders were frontmen for a group of serial scammers known as “NFT Factory LA.” The group was linked to multiple failed projects, including League of Sacred Devils, Lucky Buddhas, and Sinful Souls.

Coffeezilla's reporting revealed that Squiggles' team allegedly manipulated sales volume using “shadow wallets” to create the appearance of demand. 

A single account reportedly spent over 800 ETH, more than $2 million, across hundreds of wallets that each purchased three Squiggles NFTs before relisting them on secondary markets. 

Hours after the drop, OpenSea delisted the collection, effectively ending the scheme before it could reach its full $20 million target.

The same network of individuals has been tied to Raichu, also known as Ryan, a promoter who connected NFT projects with celebrities and influencers. 

1/ Ever wonder who connected projects with the celebrities and influencers that promote crypto scams? Here's a breakdown on one of the people doing it known as Raichu (Ryan). pic.twitter.com/uzrEZ1pAvX

ZachXBT documented Raichu's role in several rug pulls, including Baller Ape Club, which raised $2.6 million before its founder was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, and Crazy Lemur Club, which disappeared with $320,000. 

He also linked Raichu to Ancient Cats Club, which allegedly stole $1.7 million, before its team moved on to launch other scams like Bored Bunny and Rich Dwarves Tribe.

In light of this, WEB3's presale announcement has sparked skepticism. The project itself acknowledged in a statement that it anticipated controversy, referencing comparisons to previous hype-driven launches like $YZY, $Libra, and other tokens.

The team claimed it had initially pursued a private fundraising round involving prominent investors but later refunded those contributions, insisting it wanted to “level the playing field” through a public presale.

“When building @web3, we knew what the broader Crypto Twitter community would say about us,” the team wrote. “Our mission is to let the people thrive, build with core DeFi principles, and create a culture that can sustain anything. It's time to believe in something again.”

Despite the reassurances, ZachXBT's warning has amplified doubts, especially given the project's links to figures previously accused of orchestrating multimillion-dollar rug pulls. 

While WEB3 positions itself as an attempt to “Make Crypto Fair Again,” critics argue that the involvement of known actors from past scams raises serious red flags.

At press time, the WEB3 presale remains active, though questions about its legitimacy continue to grow across social platforms.

The project is calling the claims “FUD” and outlining steps it says prove legitimacy. In a public statement, the team argued that suggestions the token had launched before were “blatantly false,” urging critics to “check the chain.”

The group also distanced itself from an individual named Arsalan, accused of trying to raise funds in its name. 

Hello all – we are seeing various FUD in our comment section and thought we should take some time to address it. We understand that the public presale process is unorthodox, so bare with us as we push through here.1. There are claims that this token has been launched before,…

According to the statement, the team terminated the associated member, refunded the “extremely small” amount collected, and later returned the entirety of its private sale funds. 

The project insisted its founders had privately doxxed and described its goal as building “the largest index / media outlet in all of crypto.”

The dispute comes against a backdrop of rising crypto crime. PeckShield data shows hackers stole $142 million in July 2025, up 27% from June. India's CoinDCX lost $44.2 million in an insider-assisted attack, while DeFi protocol GMX suffered a $42 million exploit before negotiating a white-hat recovery.

In total, $2.2 billion vanished in the first half of the year across 344 incidents, with wallet hacks accounting for $1.7 billion and phishing scams another $410 million.

ZachXBT himself has tracked several high-profile frauds. In June, he unmasked New Yorker Christian Nieves, who posed as Coinbase support staff to steal $4 million from users before gambling the funds away.

🕵 ZachXBT exposes 5 North Korean workers running 30+ fake identities to target crypto projects as anonymous source compromises DPRK IT worker devices, revealing $680K Favrr exploit.#NorthKorea #Lazarushttps://t.co/ZmPCIZmVpW

More recently, on Aug. 13, he exposed a ring of five North Korean IT operatives who allegedly forged identities to secure developer jobs at crypto projects. Breached device data revealed fake IDs, Upwork and LinkedIn accounts, and stolen credentials.

The latest presale controversy shows how even high-profile projects remain vulnerable to reputational damage amid a widening climate of crypto fraud.

One of the most interesting recent trends in the quickly evolving crypto landscape is the notion of using NFT assets as loan security. With their recent entry into the decentralized finance market, NFTs are opening up new doors for both lenders and borrowers. They were previously mainly considered valuables or digital art.

Since it will allow people to unlock value in new ways without having to sell their valuable assets, this change could have a huge impact on how crypto assets develop in the future.

In traditional finance, you can use your house, car, or stock as collateral for a loan. With the possible exception that the asset you pledge might be an NFT, decentralized lending now allows the same thing.

In other words, you can lock your NFT into a smart contract and obtain a crypto asset loan. The lender holds the NFT until the loan is paid back. It's an arrangement that benefits both sides:

 

 

The following are the main causes of the growing interest in NFT collateralized lending:

 

 

As a result of these factors, NFTs are gaining popularity in mainstream financial applications and securing their position in the future of the crypto industry.

 

 

 

 

 

NFT collateralized lending is evidence of the rapid innovation in the crypto space, not just a new financial product. It combines ownership, digital identity, and finance into one blockchain-powered system.

NFT-backed loans may eventually become as prevalent in traditional banking as personal loans or mortgages as the crypto industry develops. We may even witness:

 

 

These developments may create completely new avenues for economic participation, particularly in areas with a dearth of traditional banking.

 

NFTs have altered our perception of digital ownership, and they are now altering the way that we lend and borrow funds. NFTs can be used as collateral in DeFi so that people can obtain funds without having to sell them. Gamers, collectors, and investors now have more options as a result. First, complete your own research and know the risks. If you are planning to invest, it's important to use secure and trustworthy platforms.

NFTs will eventually be useful financial tools that link digital assets to real value, going beyond simply digital art. The next time you see an NFT, consider it more than just a work of art; it might even help finance your next big idea.

Despite clear internal warnings, sensitive information was leaked.

The Ministry of Defence was cautioned about the risks of sharing spreadsheets containing hidden tabs before a 2022 data breach exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to relocate to the UK.

Documents released by the Information Commissioner's Office reveal that despite clear internal warnings, sensitive information was leaked when an official mistakenly emailed a spreadsheet with concealed data, reports BBC News.

The incident, described by officials as ""likely the most expensive email ever sent,"" is estimated to cost taxpayers around £850 million due to the emergency resettlement scheme that followed. While the ICO fined other bodies for smaller breaches, it decided against sanctioning the MoD, citing concerns about burdening taxpayers further.

Internal communications show some ICO staff questioned the lack of investigation, warning of reputational risks to the regulator. The ICO maintains it has pushed for stronger safeguards, but acknowledged the government has ""not yet done enough"" to address systemic data security shortcomings.

ust when whales thought they had gobbled up all the TOKEN6900 (T6900) ICO issuance in the nick of time, the team behind the latest ‘Murad coin' has announced a final chance to buy. 

The newly added final stage runs until the token claim goes live next Wednesday, 2pm UTC on 3 September. Even better, the T6900 token stays at the previously advertised presale end price of $0.007125. So far, the presale has raised an incredible $3 million.

It means there are now an additional six days of FOMO ahead before the token is claimable by presale buyers and tradable on exchanges.

If you are looking for belief-driven, community-powered value, in what crypto influencer Murad Mahmudov identifies as the meme-led supercycle for crypto, you might do well to follow the example of one whale who has just ponied up $19k in the T6900 ICO.

Presale ended. Final chance.

— Token6900 (@Token_6900) August 28, 2025



Earlier today a whale got in big with the T6900 token, which now has astute traders wondering aloud if famed meme coin booster Murad, credited with taking SPX6900 to escape velocity, is buying too.

Murad is not just a meme coin bull; he is a massive SPX6900 shiller, which accounts for 94.34% of his known crypto wealth. Now market watchers are asking if Murad could be rotating some of that wealth into a rival ‘index' coin, TOKEN6900?

The wallet holding his SPX has been inactive since 24 July 2024. But it is likely that he is using an as-yet-unidentified wallet to make his most recent speculative meme coin trades.

Still, whatever else he is buying, Murad is still very much a SPX6900 believer. He thinks it will eventually reach a market cap of $1 trillion to become “the biggest crypto since bitcoin”, even though he has nominally lost $1.23 million on the coin in the past seven days alone. At one point, his portfolio was valued at more than $70 million – today it is $38 million.

But if SPX6900 is struggling to keep its market cap head above $1 billion, never mind $1 trillion, it could make sense to start allocating to its best-known cousin, TOKEN6900. 

It may be only a matter of time before Murad alerts those among his 740,000 followers on X who don't already know about the ticker T6900.

After all, T6900 takes the same irreverent and satirical approach to the financial markets as SPX6900. And like SPX, T6900 is all about virality and community. 



Murad reckons that utility coins are passé. The future is with no-fundamentals meme coins that can generate zeitgeist real estate by harnessing the power of decentralized networks. 

Meme coins crystallize the otherwise latent or unrealizable values of what used to be called brand power. But now, with social media, brands are easily subverted and undermined by online communities – yes, we're looking at you, Cracker Barrel.

T6900 takes this ethos and runs with it as exit liquidity for late capitalism. T6900 is your elector seat to escape the financial ancients' régime.

Vibe liquidity stands at the center of the T6900 world. This crypto shouts to the market: “Cometh to me, you huddled masses; there is liberty and wealth for those brave enough to seize it. T6900 is your ultimate brain-rot finance for the new American financial revolution.”



https://twitter.com/MustStopMurad/status/1960446843625857081

There's no AI hype machine or flash website promising to revolutionize legacy industries. Instead, T6900 is the product of the collective hallucinations of terminally online traders.

Suffice to say, T6900 is the ultimate trading vehicle – the dream coin and object of desire of degen traders everywhere. And in an America where the President puts crypto first, you would be a fool to bet against T6900.

Crypto YouTube rising star Borch has told his 92.1k subscribers that T6900 could be in store for 2,000% gains because of its viral potential and leveraging of the SPX6900 mindspace.

Borch does not hold back: “This could be one of the most exciting early opportunities in the crypto space right now. In this video, I'll break down everything you need to know about TOKEN6900, why people are hyped, and how you can get in before the big pump.”

In six days' time, when T6900 claiming and trading go live, there will be some who look back and say, “Why didn't he buy some of that 69 action”, and subsequently live to regret not being the second-coming of Murad.  



Actually, it's not quite true that T6900 has no fundamentals because it does offer staking, allowing token owners who deposit into the staking smart contract to earn 33% per annum rewards. 

That's the sort of passive income that legacy finance can't match in an environment of falling interest rates. Once claiming is live, earned rewards will vest over 30 days.

You can purchase TOKEN6900 on the presale site and start staking today. Alternatively, you can buy T6900 directly from the website or in Best Wallet, which is one of the best crypto and bitcoin wallets. 

Best Wallet was recently awarded WalletConnect certification and can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Finally, Coinsult and SolidProof have audited TOKEN6900's smart contract, and no critical issues have been found.

The crypto market is buzzing as investors notice that Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price are showing weakness while a new project called Remittix is stealing the spotlight. With over $21.6 million already raised from more than 623 million tokens sold at $0.0987, Remittix is drawing serious attention. Traders are asking the question: are SHIB and DOGE slipping because capital is rotating into what could be the next big altcoin breakout?

Source: TradingView

Shiba Inu has long been a crowd favorite, but its chart suggests hesitation. Trading around $0.00001250 currently, SHIB has developed a Cup and Handle pattern that can accelerate to $0.0000239 in case the resistance at $0.00001710 is breached. The average daily trading volume increased by 118 percent to $361 million signaling that there are still buyers out there.

However, not everything is bullish. The $0.0000103 support level is weak, and any fall below this value will negate the bullish case. According to analysts, whale wallets have been dispensing rather than hoarding tokens, which is a burden to long-term growth. While optimism remains in pockets of the community, some holders are already diversifying into Remittix, which promises more than speculative rallies.

Source: Ali Martinez

The Dogecoin price is also facing turbulence, consolidating around $0.22 and testing the crucial $0.20 support. Technical charts show a symmetrical triangle forming, with $0.25 as the ceiling that must be broken for DOGE to rally higher. Failure to do so could push the token down to $0.19 or even $0.17.

Futures data highlights increasing risk. Open interest in DOGE contracts dropped 5 percent to $3.26 billion, while $19 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours. This sharp decline reflects weak conviction among traders. Despite Dogecoin's resilience as a top meme coin, investor capital is clearly rotating toward alternatives offering real-world utility, with Remittix emerging as the standout choice.



While Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price wobble, Remittix has become the headline story in crypto. Raising over $21.6 million already, the project is being hailed as one of the strongest ICOs of 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is building real utility, enabling cross-border payments and providing a mobile-first experience. This has positioned it as more than just hype, it's a working PayFi solution that institutions and individuals can both use.

These drivers explain why many investors believe Remittix could deliver 100x returns, similar to Shiba Inu in its early days, while also offering real-world use cases that DOGE never achieved.



The story unfolding here is about market rotation. As traders grow cautious about the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu's ability to sustain momentum, Remittix is emerging as the alternative with substance. By combining viral growth with genuine utility, it has managed to attract not just retail speculation but also early institutional curiosity. If this continues, it could set a new standard for how PayFi tokens dominate the next cycle.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- BIS reports stablecoins/crypto drive 1/3 of central banks to accelerate CBDC development, with 91% still engaged in projects.

- Emerging markets show higher stablecoin adoption in cross-border payments, while 67% of economies will soon regulate cryptoassets via bespoke frameworks.

- Ripple's XRP maintains relevance in SBI's multi-rail payment system, coexisting with Chainlink's control layer for interoperability and liquidity.

- BIS Innovation Hub advances blockchain-based solutions, aligning with 14% SWIFT transaction volume projections for XRP Ledger by 2030.

- Central banks and institutions increasingly explore blockchain to optimize cross-border payments, balancing traditional systems with crypto-based innovations.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has highlighted that developments in stablecoins and other cryptoassets are prompting central banks to accelerate their work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). A 2024 survey by the BIS found that a third of central banks have intensified their CBDC efforts in response to these evolving market dynamics, underscoring the sector's growing influence on global financial infrastructure. While overall engagement in CBDC projects remains high—91% of central banks are involved—this figure has slightly declined from 94% in 2023, with emerging markets experiencing a more pronounced drop. The survey's scope has expanded to include tokenization and has briefly addressed stablecoins and cryptoassets, indicating a broadened regulatory and policy focus.

Most central banks reported minimal mainstream usage of stablecoins, with only a small fraction noting their application in domestic payments, remittances, or cross-border retail transactions. Emerging market central banks, however, cited more significant usage, particularly in cross-border retail payments and remittances. In terms of regulation, 45% of central banks have already enacted legislation governing stablecoins and cryptoassets, with another 22% in the pipeline. As a result, nearly two-thirds of economies are expected to have regulatory frameworks in place soon. Almost 80% of jurisdictions have opted for bespoke regulatory approaches rather than repurposing existing legislation, reflecting the complexity and novelty of the asset class.

The BIS also emphasized the role of international cooperation in promoting financial stability. As part of its broader mission, the BIS Innovation Hub continues to develop public goods in the technology space to support central banks and improve the functioning of the global financial system. Recent initiatives have included advancements in digital asset frameworks and cross-border payment solutions, aligning with the increasing adoption of blockchain-based technologies by financial institutions.

Ripple's XRP, which is already used in live corridors by institutions like SBI Group for cross-border payments, has shown continued relevance in the context of financial infrastructure. Recent developments, including a new partnership between SBI and Chainlink, have sparked discussions about the potential for XRP to coexist with other blockchain-based solutions. Pundits argue that while Chainlink is positioned as a control layer—handling data, compliance, and messaging—XRP remains the bridge asset for settlement in SBI's multi-rail system. This modular approach is seen as a strategic move to integrate both interoperability and liquidity into a unified financial stack.

The BIS's findings also reflect growing interest in blockchain's potential to reshape cross-border financial flows. Ripple's technology, particularly its use of XRP as a liquidity solution, aligns with the goals of faster, more efficient, and less fragmented international payments. Although Ripple and SWIFT currently lack a formal partnership, RippleNet can receive SWIFT's MT103 payment messages through third-party APIs, enabling an indirect yet functional connection. This interoperability is supported by Ripple's adoption of ISO 20022, a global financial messaging standard, which enhances compatibility with both legacy and emerging systems. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has speculated that the XRP Ledger could manage up to 14% of SWIFT's transaction volume by 2030, although such projections remain speculative and are not presented as established facts.

The continued development of XRP-based corridors and the broader adoption of blockchain technologies in cross-border payments underscore the evolving role of digital assets in global finance. As central banks and financial institutions explore new ways to enhance efficiency and reduce costs, the interplay between traditional systems and crypto-based solutions will remain a key area of focus for both regulators and market participants.

The e-rupee is already tiring. What does the US' pro-stablecoin stance mean for the RBI's pet crypto project?

 A weekly newsletter about how finance is getting supercharged by tech in India, and how you can make money work for you Subscribe here


 Good morning [%first_name |Dear Reader%], 

You are reading our subscriber-only newsletter Ka-Ching!—a weekly commentary on fintech and personal finance

When was the last time you paid in e-rupees? 
Wait, let me amend that. When have you ever paid in e-rupees? 
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) pet CBDC—or central bank digital currency—has always been a rare beast on the ground, regardless of the fact that it was first launched as early as 2022. As of March 2025, India was purportedly running the world's second-largest CBDC pilot (after China), with around Rs 1,000 crore of e-rupees in circulation ($122 million)—a 334% jump from the previous year. But that, and the 5 million total users it has, are minuscule in the context of India's 1.4 billion population. Less, if you account for the fact that active users number only 400,000. 
About 17 banks and fintechs have so far launched e-rupee wallets for their users, but the enthusiasm seems to be fading before even the first leg is done. For instance, several users told The Ken that digital-rupee wallets on Cred, one of the fintechs that launched them, have now disappeared from the app. 
I can understand why few people have been interested in exploring the e-rupee. Why use them when you can transfer regular rupees from bank account to bank account just as easily, through UPI or bank apps or other wallets? Why keep track of all these different (albeit colourful) denominations?

Tim Draper, an American billionaire and venture capitalist who is one of the bigger crypto sector investors in the world, with a portfolio of over 50 crypto startups, did not hold back on his disinterest in CBDCs in a recent chat with me. “They are ridiculous,” he said, “China has one, and people hate it, too.” Instead, he touts stablecoins and bitcoins as the route to a great crypto economy. 
Setting aside Draper's own motivations, and interests, he isn't the only one who seems to be thinking along these lines. US President Donald Trump, too, has been openly betting on stablecoins over CBDCs for a while. 
In fact, his GENIUS Act, signed into law in the US in July, puts most global CBDC projects at risk—including India's. 
CBDCs vs Stablecoins

To get down to brass tacks, CBDCs are all issued by central banks, and are intended to serve as blockchain versions of regular currencies and function as legal tender.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- XRP nears $4 resistance, driven by Fibonacci levels and institutional momentum, with potential to reach $20.

- SEC's 2025 ruling and ETF approvals could unlock $8.4B in capital, boosting liquidity and adoption.

- Real-world use in cross-border payments and CBDC integration strengthens XRP's utility-driven demand.

The cryptocurrency market has long been a theater of volatility, but XRP's trajectory in 2025 suggests a unique confluence of technical, institutional, and utility-driven forces. As the token approaches the $4 resistance level—a critical Fibonacci threshold—investors must weigh the interplay of technical breakouts, regulatory clarity, and real-world adoption to assess its potential to scale toward $20.  

XRP's price action in 2025 has been shaped by Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, which analysts like EGRAG Crypto and Captain Redbeard have meticulously mapped. The token is currently retracing toward the 0.618 Fibonacci level (~$2.90), a golden ratio often signaling a pivot point for bullish continuation. If XRP holds above this level, it could retest $4.67 by late November 2025, a target derived from the 1.272 extension.  

Beyond $4, the 1.618 extension (~$8) and 2.618 extension (~$13.56) represent intermediate and long-term targets. EGRAG Crypto's ambitious projection of $27.17 hinges on XRP surpassing its 2021 all-time high of $3.31, a level it has already exceeded. The $4 resistance, therefore, is not an endpoint but a gateway to higher-order momentum.  

The institutionalization of XRP has accelerated since the U.S. SEC's August 2025 resolution, which affirmed XRP's non-security status in secondary markets. This regulatory clarity has unlocked $7.1 billion in liquidity, with Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) now used by over 300 financial institutions. CME Group's XRP futures, with open interest exceeding $9.02 billion, reflect robust institutional positioning.  

The potential approval of XRP ETFs by October 2025 could inject $8.4 billion in capital, mirroring Bitcoin's ETF-driven rally. ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) is a leading candidate, with a 95% approval probability. Such inflows would amplify XRP's liquidity and price discovery, particularly as macroeconomic tailwinds—such as inflation-linked demand for alternative assets—persist.  

XRP's value proposition extends beyond speculative trading. Ripple's ODL has become a cornerstone for institutions like Santander, SBI Holdings, and Standard Chartered, enabling real-time cross-border payments with 70% lower costs than traditional systems. Santander's Q3 2024 report highlighted $2.5 billion in ODL transactions, underscoring XRP's role as a bridge asset.  

Emerging markets are pivotal to XRP's adoption. In Africa, Ripple's partnership with Onafriq has expanded remittance corridors across 27 countries, while SBI Holdings' integration in Asia has streamlined high-frequency payments. These use cases position XRP as a solution to systemic inefficiencies, not merely a speculative token.  

Moreover, XRP's compatibility with ISO 20022 standards and its potential as a CBDC intermediary suggest a future where it facilitates seamless fiat-digital currency conversions. This utility-driven narrative strengthens its case for sustained demand.  

Despite the bullish thesis, risks remain. A breakout above $4 could trigger profit-taking corrections, particularly if short-term traders capitalize on momentum. Additionally, while the SEC case is resolved, regulatory scrutiny in other jurisdictions—such as the EU's MiCA framework—could introduce friction.  

Technical indicators like the TD Sequential “buy” signal and whale accumulation (300 million XRP in August 2025) suggest resilience, but investors must remain vigilant. A retest of the $2.90 support level could test conviction, though institutional buying power may stabilize the token.  

For investors, the case for XRP hinges on three pillars:1. Technical Validation: A clean break above $3.12 and $4.67 would confirm the bullish structure, with $8 as a near-term target.2. Institutional Inflows: ETF approvals and futures growth could drive liquidity, reducing volatility and attracting long-term capital.3. Utility Expansion: Cross-border payment adoption and CBDC integration provide a flywheel of demand, insulating XRP from speculative cycles.  

Given these factors, accumulating XRP at key Fibonacci levels—particularly below $2.90—offers a compelling risk-reward profile. A breakout above $4 could catalyze a parabolic move toward $20, especially if macroeconomic conditions favor alternative assets.  

In conclusion, XRP's path to $20 is not a speculative leap but a calculated convergence of technical, institutional, and utility-driven forces. For those with a medium-term horizon, the token's regulatory clarity, real-world adoption, and Fibonacci-driven momentum present a rare opportunity to participate in a digital asset poised to redefine global finance.

Zhou Xiaochuan stresses need for vigilance to prevent digital currencies being used for excessive speculation

Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has urged a more measured tone amid a global surge of interest in stablecoins, calling for a “multidimensional assessment” of their genuine utility and the systemic risks they may pose.

The United States and Hong Kong are rolling out regulatory frameworks for the asset, and speculation has been growing about the likelihood of Beijing following suit by introducing yuan-backed stablecoins in a bid to further internationalise its currency.

“We need to be vigilant against the risk of stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, as misdirection could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system,” Zhou said at a closed-door China Finance 40 Forum (CF40) seminar last month, according to an article published on Wednesday by the think tank, whose membership includes senior Chinese regulatory officials and financial experts.

He warned that some industry players could leverage the hype around stablecoins to boost their valuations, focusing on cashing out rather than the profitability or sustainability of the stablecoin business, which would be “detrimental to the healthy development of the financial system” and could lead to the accumulation of “systemic risks”.

01:25

What's the hype about stablecoins?

The article, which compiled Zhou's comments at the seminar, said that some current discussions on stablecoins were based on a single perspective, and there needed to be a “multidimensional, multi-perspective assessment” instead.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.China's growing focus on stablecoins is less about embracing crypto and more about defending its currency from U.S. dollar dominance, says Dr. Vera Yuen of Hong Kong University's Business School, who argues the shift highlights offshore opportunities but also deep domestic limits.

Beijing's shift comes as Washington moved first to create a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry in the U.S. Reuters recently reported that China's State Council is reviewing a roadmap for yuan-backed stablecoins later this month, with Hong Kong and Shanghai expected to fast-track adoption.

In an earlier interview, Animoca Group president Evan Auyang told CoinDesk the trigger was the U.S. GENIUS Act, which cements dollar-pegged tokens as part of global finance.

He said the law is “pressuring China to act a lot faster,” pushing Beijing to consider stablecoins not as speculative instruments, as once described by the People's Bank of China, but as necessary infrastructure to keep pace in global trade and settlement.

Yuen said the government first prioritized the e-CNY, its Central Bank Digital Currency, because it offered control, traceability, and seigniorage profits — features that regulators valued over those of privately issued tokens. But she noted that stablecoins have a clear edge in international use.

“Many CBDCs are developed for domestic use, so for international use of CBDCs, there is a big problem of interoperability of different systems. Stablecoins are designed to be used internationally, so it can be a better option for cross-border transactions,” she told CoinDesk.

""Focusing on stablecoins allows China to respond proactively to global regulatory debates and technological advances, ensuring it remains competitive and prepared as the digital currency landscape evolves,"" Yuen continued.

Capital controls still mean any yuan token will stay offshore, with Hong Kong's new regime providing the testing ground. However, limited CNH liquidity underscores how narrow the runway is for China's internationalization push.

""This would limit the issuance of offshore renminbi stablecoins, constraining its attractiveness as a means of payment,"" Yuen said.

China is also not moving in isolation.

In Japan, Monex Group is preparing to issue a yen-backed stablecoin tied to government bonds, joining other domestic players such as SBI and JPYC.

Unlike China, however, where capital controls push experimentation offshore, Japan's regulators are laying the groundwork for stablecoins to circulate at home, signaling Asia's broader race to keep pace with U.S. dollar tokens.

For now, Beijing's stablecoin experiment looks less like a replacement for the e-CNY and more like a cautious complement, a way to extend the yuan's reach abroad without loosening its grip at home.

Brits are showing a growing interest in putting crypto inside retirement plans, but many still don't fully grasp the risks. According to a new survey by Aviva, 27% of UK adults said they would be open to including digital currency in their retirement portfolios, while 23% said they might withdraw part or all of their existing pensions to buy crypto directly.

Based on reports from Censuswide, which polled 2,000 UK adults between June 4 and June 6, more than four in five people hold pensions that add up to about £3.8 trillion ($5.10 trillion).

If even a small slice of that moved into crypto, it could be meaningful for markets. Of the respondents who said they were open to digital currency in pensions, just over 40% pointed to the chance of higher returns as the main draw.

UK retirement savers warm to crypto. A new Aviva survey finds 27% of UK adults would include crypto in retirement, hinting at future flows from a multi-trillion pound pension market.

— TrinityPad (@Trinity_Pad) August 27, 2025



Younger adults appear to be the most active. Reports show nearly 20% of people aged 25 to 34 admitted to withdrawing pension money to buy crypto at some point.

Aviva's research also found that about one in five UK adults — roughly 11.5 million people — have held crypto at some time, and two-thirds of that group still hold some form of digital asset.



That mix of ownership and age-skewed behavior helps explain why digital currency is now part of conversations about retirement planning.

Survey participants flagged clear concerns. Hacking and phishing topped the list at 40%, while 37% cited a lack of regulation and consumer protection, and 30% named volatility.

Almost one-third admitted they didn't completely grasp the trade-offs involved in replacing pensions with bitcoin, and 27% said they were unaware of any risks at all. Those numbers suggest interest outpaces understanding for a notable share of the public.



Regulation will likely play a large role in how fast any shift happens. Reports note that HM Revenue and Customs will require crypto platforms to collect full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026. That move is aimed at strengthening tax compliance and oversight and could change how some consumers view bitcoin's privacy and convenience.

The debate over retirement funds and crypto is not confined to the UK. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, opening potential access to more than $9 trillion in retirement assets.

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin issuers Circle Internet Group and Paxos Trust have piloted a new verification method for stablecoins, reported Bloomberg.

The move, aimed at combating counterfeit tokens and improving transparency, was conducted in collaboration with Bluprynt, a fintech startup led by Georgetown Law School professor Chris Brummer.

The pilot utilised Bluprynt's cryptography and blockchain technology to enable companies to trace their stablecoin tokens back to the verified issuer.

The move is expected to provide a layer of security in the digital asset market by giving ""provenance upfront,"" as Brummer explained.

The technology is designed to simplify processes and offer the clarity that regulators and investors require, potentially reducing the risk of financial losses due to fraudulent activities.

Brummer also highlighted the potential benefits of this technology for auditors, financial crime-fighters, and investors.

Paxos issues and operates the blockchain infrastructure supporting PayPal's stablecoin, PYUSD.

Additionally, Circle formed a partnership with Finastra, a financial software provider, to allow banks to incorporate USDC settlement into their cross-border payment operations.

The collaboration will leverage Finastra's Global PAYplus (GPP) payment hub solutions, marking the first instance of Finastra's customers connecting to Circle's payment infrastructure.

This connection is expected to process over $5tn in daily cross-border transactions, offering banks an alternative to traditional correspondent banking networks.

The integration promises faster settlement times while adhering to existing compliance and foreign exchange processes.

Earlier this month, Circle teamed up with corporate payments company Corpay to bring stablecoin capabilities to Corpay's cross-border payment services.

This partnership will introduce the flexibility of USDC within Corpay's infrastructure, providing businesses with access to the benefits of blockchain technology, including 24/7 settlement times.

Articles Details

In-depth analysis uncovers the secrets behind market moves.

- U.S. government publishes GDP data on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, endorsing crypto technology under Trump's administration.

- The initiative adds blockchain as a data verification channel without replacing existing methods, led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

- Trump's crypto-friendly policies include dismissing BLS head over data disputes and expanding family-backed crypto ventures like World Liberty Financial.

- Global blockchain adoption grows as crypto industry becomes a political force, with $133M+ spent on pro-crypto election campaigns in 2024.

- Commerce plans to expand blockchain use across government departments, reflecting Lutnick's vision for decentralized data distribution.

The U.S. government began publishing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on public blockchains on Thursday, marking the latest move by the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry.

Officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce stated that this initiative will add a new channel for releasing economic data but will not replace existing methods.

By adopting blockchain technology to host some of its most critical and market-moving economic data, the Department of Commerce is effectively placing a ""seal of approval"" on the technology. Today, blockchain applications extend far beyond their origins in cryptocurrency and are increasingly used for trading various assets, including money market funds and stocks.

In its initial phase, this U.S. government initiative will cover nine blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The plan involves storing ""cryptographic hashes"" of the data on these blockchains—essentially a tool to verify data integrity.

Officials from the Department of Commerce mentioned that the administration, led by President Donald Trump, plans to expand the scope of this initiative in the future.

Shift in Government Policy

This policy shift comes just weeks after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that job growth in recent months was significantly lower than previously announced figures. Subsequently, Trump dismissed the head of the BLS and, without providing evidence, suggested political manipulation of the data.

Department of Commerce officials stated that the blockchain initiative is unrelated to the dismissal of the BLS director.

Officials revealed that the driving force behind pushing data onto the blockchain is Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Earlier this year, Lutnick also proposed revising the methodology for calculating GDP to exclude the impact of government spending on the figure. GDP data is published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which operates under the Department of Commerce.

Governments worldwide have been exploring blockchain applications for years: some have used public networks to test central bank digital currencies, while others have considered using the technology for issuing digital credentials.

For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has adopted the Avalanche blockchain—one of the nine blockchains included in the Department of Commerce's data release initiative—to digitize vehicle ownership credentials. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has also explored using the technology to streamline airport security screening processes.

Earlier this year, spurred by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" also looked into using blockchain to reduce costs and increase government transparency.

The ""Crypto President""

Lutnick previewed this change during a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, telling Trump that departmental statistics would begin to be released via blockchain ""because you are the 'crypto president.'""

Trump, once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now become a supporter of the industry—during his 2024 campaign, he pledged to reduce regulatory burdens hindering its development.

Upon taking office, he quickly took action to fulfill some of these promises: for instance, the Trump administration has established Bitcoin reserves and accumulated cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana; appointed crypto-friendly agency heads who have terminated enforcement investigations against companies like Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange; and signed a stablecoin regulatory bill—stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value pegged to underlying fiat currencies.

The Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency has also expanded significantly, spanning businesses such as Bitcoin mining and stablecoin issuance. Next week, a cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial, a company backed by the Trump family, will begin trading on centralized exchanges.

This stands in stark contrast to the administration of former President Joe Biden, whose regulatory agencies generally maintained a skeptical stance toward the cryptocurrency industry in recent years.

Cryptocurrency as a Political Force

The U.S. government's adoption of blockchain technology also reflects the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry itself. Years ago, many commercial attempts to deploy blockchain technology failed because they focused on applications using private blockchains—operated by companies that often had policy disagreements, leading to higher costs and greater implementation challenges.

However, under Lutnick's push, the Department of Commerce chose to utilize public blockchains like Ethereum, maintained by computers around the world and updated by volunteer programmers.

Officials stated that cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are all participating in the Department of Commerce's initiative. The Department purchased cryptocurrencies (i.e., ""gas fees"") required to publish transactions on the blockchain through these exchanges. Kraken and Gemini are planning to go public in the coming months.

The cryptocurrency industry has become a political force to be reckoned with: investors and corporate executives exert influence through well-funded political action committees, similar to how traditional financial industries like banking wield power in Washington.

The industry has provided significant financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and has backed multiple crypto-friendly lawmakers in Congress. According to data analyzed by OpenSecrets, the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase, contributed over $133 million to three super PACs supporting ""pro-crypto"" candidates in the 2024 election.

Companies like Kraken and Coinbase also donated $1 million each to Trump's inauguration in January.

Lutnick hinted earlier this week that the potential applications of cryptocurrency extend far beyond publishing economic indicators.

During a meeting with Trump and other federal agency leaders on Tuesday, Lutnick said, ""We will integrate GDP data into the blockchain to demonstrate its role in data distribution. Subsequently, we will open this capability to all government departments, enabling all of you to adopt this approach.""

As the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries scale globally, nations are no longer adopting a wait-and-see attitude; they're actively competing for a slice of the pie. Governments are recognizing that Web3 is a revolutionary technology with wide-reaching implications for economies, governance and digital infrastructure, and countries are vying to attract the top talent to their shores.

What's emerging is a new network of crypto tech hubs: jurisdictions building regulatory clarity and fostering innovation to attract the most ambitious developers and companies in the space. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Hong Kong and Singapore are among the best known, but there are many regions lining up to shape the next phase of decentralized innovation.

But there's one thing that most crypto hubs have in common. See if you can spot what it is, but we'll let you know at the end.

The UAE, led by Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has become a key player in the global crypto landscape. The former emirate didn't become crypto-friendly overnight, but rolled out a series of regulatory milestones between 2021 and 2022 that transformed it into a welcoming environment for crypto companies.Consequently, thanks to agencies such as Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM, introduced even earlier in 2018), the country offers structured licensing for exchanges, custodians and blockchain companies.

Long-time home to Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and other personalities such as Ola Doudin and Zach Whitkoff, its business-friendly environment and international connectivity have drawn major crypto exchanges and ecosystem builders. Rachel Pether, regional head at global digital asset investment manager 3iQ, says:

“Having been a resident of Abu Dhabi for over 17 years, I've seen first-hand how it has transformed itself into a world-class crypto hub. It's been successful bottom-up with crypto firms setting up in Abu Dhabi and a high number of professional investors leading to high crypto adoption per capita.”

The UAE is pursuing a broad strategy that bridges capital markets, DeFi, NFTs and tokenization.Statistics: Crypto ownership rates among UAE residents stand at 25.3%, one of the highest globally. The crypto market revenue in the UAE is estimated at $395.9 million in 2025, growing at a forecast compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% into 2026.

In 2024, over $30 billion flowed into crypto investments in the UAE.

The UAE scores high on the global Crypto Adoption Index (50.2/60), with top marks in tax-friendliness (10/10) and innovation.

Crypto taxes: Zero tax on trading, gains, staking or mining rewards.

Singapore continues to offer one of the world's most thoughtful approaches to digital asset regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has implemented a framework that distinguishes between various token types, providing licensing for payment token services and setting clear guardrails for custody and compliance.

83% of Fortune 500 blockchain pilots run under MAS-approved frameworks, and BlackRock chose Singapore as its Asian tokenization hub. SWIFT is testing CBDC bridges with Singaporean banks, and Token2049 holds its main conference here every year. Famous residents include Crypto.com founders Gary Or, Bobby Bao and Rafael Melo.

“Singapore has achieved what no other crypto hub has: institutional trust at scale. This isn't just about being crypto-friendly, it's about building a credible, predictable environment where global institutions feel safe to innovate and invest. This level of trust doesn't happen by accident — it's engineered,” says Sky Wee, managing partner at Sky Ventures.

But MAS has taken a more cautious stance on retail crypto speculation in recent years following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs. 

New rules came into force at the end of June requiring entities offering digital token services to overseas clients to obtain a Digital Token Service Provider license or face a possible term of imprisonment, with Bitget, Bybit and Tokenize forced out of the city state. The MAS has warned licenses will only be issued in “extremely limited circumstances.”The rules aim to tackle regulatory arbitrage. Still, Singapore's infrastructure and fintech-savvy culture make it a model for jurisdictions seeking to balance innovation with systemic stability; the city-state remains a magnet for institutional-grade platforms, tokenization pilots and blockchain R&D.Statistics: One in four adults owns crypto, many using it for payments. Singapore ranks No. 1 worldwide on several adoption indexes (Henley Crypto Adoption Index score is 45.7/60).Market revenue is projected at about $392 million in 2025, growing 4.2 % annually into 2026.

Around 4.19 million users by 2026, reaching 68% crypto penetration.Crypto taxes: 0% — no tax on personal crypto gains, up to 22% if crypto trading qualifies as “business activity.”

Switzerland was an early frontrunner as a crypto hub, particularly the region of Zug, known as Crypto Valley. Zug became a first-mover in crypto due to its progressive regulatory stance and early embrace of blockchain. In 2016, it began accepting Bitcoin for public services, signaling openness to innovation. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) provided early clarity on ICOs and asset categorization.

Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano and other projects established foundations in the country, and it was the home for crypto titans such as Mihai Alisie, co-founder of Ethereum. As Johann Schneider-Ammann, former Swiss economics minister, declares, “We want to be the crypto nation.”

Zug's stability, legal clarity and tech-forward mindset made it a magnet for pioneers, setting the global standard for how local governance can catalyze a decentralized economy.

Today, Switzerland is home to a growing number of regulated exchanges, security token platforms and crypto banks. The country's reputation for neutrality, privacy and legal precision continues to attract both startups and multinational players focused on financial infrastructure, asset management and secure digital identities.

Statistics: Crypto market revenue is projected at $446.1 million in 2025, with a CAGR of 4.6% into 2026, and an average per-user revenue of $115.90.

The user base is estimated at 4.03 million by 2026, with penetration rising from 43% in 2025 to 45%.

Zug hosted 512 crypto firms in 2024, including major projects as Ethereum, Solana and Cardano, totaling 1,290 companies across Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Crypto taxes: Capital gains are 0% (exempt for private investors) unless classified as a professional trader. Wealth tax is 0.3%-1% on global assets, including cryptocurrency. However, crypto income from mining, staking or other active activities is taxable as ordinary income.

Gibraltar has proven that size is no barrier to influence in the blockchain sector. As early as 2018, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) introduced a regulatory framework for distributed ledger technology providers, making it one of the first jurisdictions in the world to do so.

Gibraltar's regulatory framework, introduced in 2018, mandates that crypto firms be licensed as distributed ledger technology (DLT) providers, requiring robust risk management, AML controls and capital adequacy, which offers legal certainty while avoiding overly prescriptive rules. Albert Isola, a key architect of Gibraltar's DLT framework, lives on the “Rock” and is now minister for digital and financial services.

Combined with its 10% corporate tax rate and no capital gains tax, Gibraltar provides a cost-effective and compliant environment for crypto businesses to operate and scale. The “Rock” now hosts a range of exchanges, fintech companies and blockchain service providers… and its legal system, rooted in English common law, adds an extra layer of predictability for global companies.

“Gibraltar pioneered the world's first dedicated regulatory framework for DLT providers, underpinned by an experienced regulator and a proactive government deeply committed to innovation,” says Targ Patience, chair of the Gibraltar Association for New Technologies (GANT).“We're now breaking new ground in advances for tokenization, DApps and DAOs. Coupled with a vibrant crypto community and zero capital gains tax, Gibraltar offers an unmatched crypto ecosystem.”

Stats: Ranks 15th globally, scoring 87.4/100 in the Global Intelligence Unit's Cryptocurrency Report.Crypto taxes: 0% capital gains tax and no VAT/wealth/inheritance tax on crypto. Income tax applies to trading or mining as a business (up to 39%). Corporate tax is 15% on Gibraltar-sourced profits.Home to: Albert Isola, minister for Digital and Financial Services.

Once hailed as the “Blockchain Island,” Malta was among the first countries to propose a comprehensive legal framework for blockchain and digital assets in February 2018, when its government unveiled three landmark bills: the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Bill (MDIA), the Technology Arrangements and Services Bill (TAS/ITAS) and the Virtual Financial Assets Bill (VFA).This laid the groundwork for what would become the world's first holistic blockchain legal system and provided regulatory certainty while encouraging innovation. John McAfee was a regular visitor to the island, and Chun Wang, co‑founder of F2Pool (one of the world's first and largest Bitcoin mining pools), became a Maltese citizen in 2023.

Jean-Michel Azzorpadi, Maltese blockchain evangelist and founder of Kralanx Cyber Security, comments, “Malta is the only jurisdiction in the EU with a pre-2025 regulatory framework more arduous than MiCA, so the country has been well prepared for some time. Maltese banks are still asleep at the wheel, but EMIs (so-called Electronic Money Initiatives) have filled the gap, making the overall blockchain ecosystem quite strong.”

Malta's status as a European Union member gives it access to Europe's single market while its flexible approach continues to appeal to mid-sized exchanges and emerging projects seeking a home with credible oversight and European integration.Statistics: Malta ranks sixth globally in the 2024 Henley Crypto Adoption Index, with high regulatory support and strong business presence. Crypto market revenue in Malta is projected to reach about $591,600 in 2025, with a CAGR of roughly 6.4 % into 2026; average revenue per user is $12.80. 

Crypto taxes: There is no capital gains tax on crypto that is held long-term, while occasional trading (profits on casual trades) are tax-exempt. Frequent/professional trading and income from mining/staking/trading is treated as standard business income at 15%-35%.

Ethereum is eating the world — ‘You only need one internet'

Thailand's crypto islands: Working in paradise, Part 1

Sri Lanka offers the ideal blend of strategic location, technical talent and economic efficiency, making it the perfect base for an emerging crypto hub. Positioned at the crossroads of Asia and the Middle East, the island nation provides convenient access to major global markets.More importantly, its capital, Colombo, has rapidly emerged as a hub for innovation with a highly educated, English-speaking workforce and a thriving community of software engineers, blockchain developers and AI specialists. 

Rumors that Binance is to set up in the country have also been echoing around Telegram messaging groups. The country's five-year economic crisis from 2019 to 2024 engendered interest in crypto as an alternative hedge against inflation.

Gareth Brawn is the founder and CEO of The Coin With No Name, a Solana-based project powering an AI bot development platform that lets consumers build, deploy and monetize AI bots.

“Sri Lanka brings a unique energy to entrepreneurship; it's resilient, forward-looking and untapped. The local startup ecosystem is rapidly maturing, supported by government initiatives and growing foreign investment. By choosing Sri Lanka as our headquarters, we have gained operational advantages but also contribute to nurturing a rising tech economy,” he says.

Statistics: Digital asset revenue is projected at $62.6 million in 2025, with a CAGR of 8.5% into 2026, creating an average revenue per user of approximately $59.1. 

By 2026, about 1.16 million users (4.6% of the population) are expected to hold crypto.

Crypto taxes: No formal crypto regulation, but a 10% capital gains tax for crypto. The central bank advises the public of high risks and does not recognize crypto as legal tender, although there are moves to create a more friendly crypto environment.

Home to: No widely recognized global crypto personalities.

Hong Kong is reemerging as a major force in crypto after several years of regulatory uncertainty. Hong Kong's government released its first virtual asset policy statement in 2018, committing to introduce licensing for digital asset trading platforms under the so-called principle of “same activity, same risk, same regulation.”With a licensing framework now in place for digital asset exchanges and custodians, the city is attracting institutional interest and rebuilding its status as a digital finance hub.

Kumardev Chatterjee, founder of the Global Crypto Forum, highlights: 

“Web3 activity in Hong Kong has been growing steadily since 2024, with major steps such as the launch of BTC and ETH ETFs, hosting of important conferences such as Bitcoin Asia and Consensus HK. It also has a welcoming regulatory environment, from leading Hong Kong Legislative Council members such as Johnny Ng and Government members such as Joseph H. L. Chan, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.”

Authorities are actively encouraging tokenization pilots, including green bond issuances and infrastructure for central bank digital currencies. Hong Kong's legal sophistication and proximity to China make it a strategic base for firms looking to navigate the Asian market while remaining compliant under an increasingly mature framework.Many in the industry hope that China sees Hong Kong as a sandbox to experiment with crypto, before loosening up restrictions on the mainland — though that's yet to occur.

Statistics: Digital assets market revenue is forecast at $200.7 million in 2025, growing at 4.0% CAGR to $208.7 million in 2026. Crypto user base expected to reach around 694,000 by 2026 (8.9% penetration in 2025, 9.3 % in 2026)

Crypto taxes: 0% capital gains tax on private, occasional crypto trading; salaries tax applies to crypto paid as income. Hedge funds and family offices' gains from crypto may be exempt under proposed new regulations.

We're sure you've already noticed but the one thing the above emerging crypto hubs have are low or no capital gains taxes on crypto. It seems if you want to attract the best crypto talent from around the world, favorable regulations that balance innovation and consumer protections are good… but 0% capital gains taxes on crypto profits are even better. See also Portugal, which Magazine covered as a crypto hub attracting international talent back in May. 

The United States remains a powerhouse of crypto development and capital, but policy fragmentation continues to slow its momentum. Agencies such as the SEC and CFTC often clash over jurisdiction, leaving companies in a legal gray area that can stifle growth or push operations overseas.

Despite this, cities like San Francisco, Austin, and New York remain innovation hotspots. Startups continue to raise capital, build protocols, and push the boundaries of DeFi, NFTs, and layer-2 scaling.Global crypto leaders such as Vitalik Buterin and CZ are regular visitors (for somewhat different reasons), and it is home to Michael Saylor, Marc Andreseen, Brian Armstrong and many others.

Jonny Fry, CEO of TeamBlockchain, observes, “New York will rise from current relative obscurity to one of the most important now the GENIUS act has passed [the Senate].”

“This provides clear regulatory guidance and so encourages a huge surge in stablecoins being launched and does for the US dollar what the Petro dollar did and the euro did previously — extend the life span of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.”

With momentum building around bipartisan legislation in Congress, there is hope that clearer rules will soon support the country's unrivaled technical and entrepreneurial strength.

Statistics: Crypto market revenue in the US is projected at $16.1 billion in 2025 (3.6% CAGR into 2026); overall digital asset market revenue is $18.6 billion — the highest globally. User base is expected to reach 166.7 million by 2026, with penetration rising from 46.4% (2025) to 47.8% (2026).

When worlds collide: Joining Web3 and crypto from Web2

The European Union is taking a unified approach to crypto regulation through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Once fully implemented, it will create consistent standards for exchanges, stablecoins and wallet providers across member states. Portugal is one country that is especially crypto-friendly.

Gavin Wood, Stani Kulechov, and Julien Bouteloup all live on the continent, including Dr. Philipp Sandner, Germany's leading blockchain academic, shaping EU crypto policy.

European cities are also growing as cultural and technical centers for blockchain. Filippo Chisari, General Partner at AgileGTM Blockchain Fund, remarks, “Lisbon is one of the world's major hubs today more than ever, not because of the friendly taxation on crypto capital gains as many would think, but because it is simply much more cost-effective to be a bootstrapped entrepreneur in Lisbon than it is in London, NYC or any other major hub, while still being extremely well connected and accessible.” 

Berlin's deep open-source roots make it a favorite among DeFi builders and it played a foundational role in Ethereum's development. Paris is investing heavily in fintech and startup infrastructure. While bureaucracy can be a hurdle, Europe's cohesive policy direction gives it an advantage as regulatory clarity becomes a competitive edge.

Statistics:MiCA (Markets in Crypto‑Assets) was fully implemented from December 2024 across EU members. The digital assets market in Europe is estimated at $30.1 billion in 2025, with 30.4 % CAGR into 2026, reaching $34.7 billion. There are 268 million users (30.4 % penetration in 2025, rising to 31.6 % in 2026). Germany leads adoption, reflecting strong regulatory frameworks.

Crypto taxes: These vary from country to country, ranging from lower taxes in Germany and Portugal to higher regimes in Spain, Holland and Belgium.

In Latin America and Africa, blockchain adoption is being shaped less by investment cycles and more by practical utility. Citizens in countries with unstable currencies or limited financial access are turning to stablecoins, peer-to-peer networks, and blockchain-based savings platforms to manage daily economic life.

Brazil has emerged as a regulatory leader in Latin America, supporting digital real pilots and exploring public sector blockchain applications. El Salvador has, of course, embraced Bitcoin like nowhere else. In Africa, Nigeria and Kenya are pioneering the use of mobile wallets, crypto remittances, and micro-lending protocols.

Joshua Johnson, co-founder and CEO of LiquidHectare, highlights a novel example of blockchain governance emerging from Africa:“The Zanzibar sovereign zone is creating the world's first onchain government, similar to what the UAE is pioneering with their land department, but at the scale of an entire governmental system and positions Zanzibar as the ‘Singapore of Africa' through blockchain governance.”

While infrastructure and policy frameworks are still evolving, the innovation born out of necessity in these regions reflects crypto's most grounded and impactful potential.

Statistics: Crypto ownership in Latin America stands at 57.7 million users (12.1% penetration) as of early 2025. South America alone is expected to reach $5.8 billion in crypto revenues in 2025, rising to $6.5 billion by 2026. Crypto taxes: Varies by country, but it is especially crypto-friendly in El Salvador and Panama.Home to: Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele; Wences Casares, originally from Argentina, founder of Xapo Bank; Ricardo Salinas, a Mexican billionaire who holds 70% of his personal investment portfolio in Bitcoin.

The rise of crypto hubs across the globe underscores a new reality: The future of blockchain innovation will not be centered in one place, but distributed across jurisdictions that offer distinct advantages.The UAE continues to stand out for its ambition and execution. Singapore, Switzerland, Gibraltar and Malta offer dependable, innovation-friendly regulatory environments. Hong Kong and key EU cities are advancing frameworks that combine oversight with flexibility. Meanwhile, grassroots adoption in Latin America and Africa is pushing the technology into real-world utility.

Crypto is inherently decentralized, and now its geography is reflecting that principle. Jurisdictions that prioritize clarity, agility and openness will lead the way — not because they all follow the same blueprint, but because they empower different parts of a borderless, programmable economy to thrive on their own terms.

The native token of the Chainlink network, LINK, surged more than 5% after the network announced a partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring official government economic data onchain, marking a first-of-its-kind effort to bridge public data infrastructure with blockchain applications.

Pyth Network was also selected alongside Chainlink, sending its native token, PYTH, up nearly 50% after the announcement. 

Key macroeconomic statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers — are now accessible onchain through Chainlink Data Feeds, the company announced in a blog post on Thursday. Six data points in total are being published, including both absolute levels and annualized percentage changes.

The data is being made available across ten blockchain networks, including Ethereum ETH$4,480.35, Avalanche AVAX$24.41 and Optimism OP$0.7107. Chainlink says the feeds will update monthly or quarterly, mirroring the release schedules of their traditional counterparts.

Meanwhile, Pyth said it will initially offer quarterly GDP data releases going back five years, with expectations to expand the initiative to other economic datasets. 

The initiative, a first for the U.S. government, opens up new possibilities for developers building in DeFi and beyond. 

For example, lending protocols could adjust interest rates based on GDP trends, while prediction markets might incorporate the PCE Index to crowdsource inflation forecasts.

""Bringing U.S. government data onchain unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets, such as automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors,"" Chainlink's blog post said. 

Bringing economic data sets onto the blockchain also brings efficiency and transparency to data published by the government. 

""The integrity of economic data is essential to global markets, and bringing this data onchain opens up new frontiers for transparency, accessibility, and composability across DeFi, enterprise use cases, and public accountability,"" Pyth said in its statement. 

Chainlink and other crypto industry players have deepened their engagement with U.S. policymakers this year after Donald Trump won the U.S. election last year, with the promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. 

Chainlink had held several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help clarify how blockchain infrastructure fits within existing broker-dealer and transfer agent rules, as well as other lawmakers to help establish the GENIUS Act, the company said.

By bringing federal economic indicators onchain, Chainlink is attempting to normalize blockchain as a destination for mission-critical public data — offering transparency and composability that traditional systems don't easily support, it said.

The move highlights the U.S. government's push to adopt blockchain technology for public data infrastructure. On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Department of Commerce plans to begin publishing economic statistics — including GDP figures — onchain as part of an effort to expand blockchain-based data distribution across federal agencies.

Lutnick said the initiative aims to modernize how official data is shared by making it more transparent and tamper-proof, without disclosing how the government is planning to do so. 

He said the Department hopes to set a precedent for other agencies to follow by moving key indicators like GDP to the blockchain, laying the groundwork for a more secure and interoperable system for releasing government data.

""Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce's visionary stance on data innovation and willingness to embrace blockchain technology is positioning the U.S. as a world leader in finance. But this is just the first step in a long and high-yielding endeavor to rebuild the data infrastructure of the United States of America,"" Pyth said in its statement on Thursday.

UPDATE (Aug 28, 15:00 UTC): Updates the headline and story throuhgout to add more information about the government wanting to use blockchain for public data infrastructure. Also adds that Pyth Network was selected alongside Chainlink.

UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL AUG 28 9AM ET

A group of former Jump Trading, Coinbase (COIN) and Citadel Securities engineers said it raised $20 million in new funding for trading infrastructure startup aPriori, bringing the total capital raised to $30 million.

The round included participation from HashKey Capital, Pantera Capital, Primitive Ventures, IMC Trading, GEM, Gate Labs, Ambush Capital and Big Brain Collective, according to a release.

San Francisco-based aPriori is building what it calls an execution layer for on-chain markets, designed for high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks.

The firm uses high-frequency trading practices in an attempt to reduce issues that plague crypto markets like wide spreads and maximal extractable value (MEV) leakage.

Founder Ray Song said the company's system segments order flow in real time and redistributes MEV to stakers in an attempt to improve yields and network alignment.

APriori has developed a liquid-staking platform and an AI-powered decentralized exchange aggregator called Swapr, both of which are intended to improve execution for traders and liquidity providers.

Pantera Capital's Nihal Maunder said the firm increased its investment because aPriori is one of the few projects with the technical capability to bring traditional execution standards to decentralized finance (DeFi). The company plans to use the new funds to expand hiring, accelerate product rollouts and deepen partnerships across the trading and staking ecosystem.

As bitcoin BTC$112,543.94 bulls aim to reestablish an upward price trajectory, they may face resistance from sellers near the $113,600 level, according to on-chain data.

BTC has already bounced to $112,800 from sub-$108,800 levels hit Tuesday, CoinDesk data show. The bounce is likely fueled by a fresh all-time high in the S&P 500 and a better-than-expected earnings report by Nvidia, one of the largest publicly listed companies in the world by market value and a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence.

The path ahead may prove challenging, as investors holding at a loss may look to sell into any price rebound.

""Currently, bitcoin trades beneath the cost basis of both the 1-month ($115.6k) and 3-month ($113.6k) cohorts, leaving these investors under stress. Any relief rally is therefore likely to encounter resistance, as short-term holders seek to exit at breakeven,"" analytics firm Glassnode said in a report published Wednesday.

Glassnode's cost basis metric reveals the average purchase prices at which digital assets have been acquired by wallets with varying holding durations. For example, the three-month cost basis of $113,600 indicates that investors holding assets purchased within the past three months paid, on average, this price level.

As of now, the spot market flows suggest an uphill battle for the bulls ahead, while ETF and corporate activity suggest otherwise.

""Spot demand remains neutral, as perpetuals tilt bearish with CVD negative. The current funding rate of ~0.01% points to a fragile neutrality. If price breaks above $112.4K with volume, it opens the pathway to $114K – $116K,"" Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN.

That said, ETF inflows and corporate adoption of BTC continues to suck out significant supply from the market, offering a bullish hope, Misir explained. 

""ETF flows continue to strengthen with $81 million for Bitcoin ETFs and $307 million for Ether ETFs over the past day. ETFs, corporates, and governments are now absorbing ~3,600 BTC/day, which translates to ~4x miner issuance. Metaplanet announced a new plan to raise $881 million to buy $837 million BTC in Sep–Oct, adding to its 18,991 BTC,"" he noted. 

Should BTC turn lower, then $107,000 is the key support level to watch.

That's because analysis by Glassnode shows that the six-month cost basis is at that level. So, a break lower would prompt these holdings to sell, potentially causing a more profound decline.

""The 6-month cost basis sits near ~$107k. A sustained move below this level risks triggering fear, which could accelerate downside momentum,"" Glassnode said.

 Over 70,000 wallets piled into the YZY memecoin, but most lost money as its price collapsed by over 80%, underscoring the risks of celebrity-backed tokens. 

More than 51,000 traders incurred losses on Kanye West's recently launched memecoin, highlighting the potential risks of trading celebrity-endorsed tokens with no intrinsic technological utility.

The Kanye West-linked YZY token was launched on the Solana blockchain on Aug. 21. It rallied 1,400% within the first hour before losing over 80% of its value. 

Of the 70,200 traders who invested in the celebrity-endorsed token, more than 51,800 realized losses, with three traders losing over $1 million, according to blockchain data platform Bubblemaps.

“Meanwhile, 11 wallets made $1M+,” wrote Bubblemaps in a Wednesday X post.

Amid large-scale losses from the majority of the token's traders, only 11 out of 70,000 wallets generated over $1 million in profit, while 99 generated over $100,000, highlighting the financial risks of celebrity-endorsed meme tokens with a lack of blockchain utility.

Meanwhile, the YZY token's price is down over 80% from its all-time high, trading at $0.5515 with just 19,531 traders holding the token, data from blockchain intelligence platform Nansen shows.

Former kickboxing champion Andrew Tate was among the traders looking to profit from the rapper-endorsed token. Tate opened a 3x leveraged short position on the YZY token, leading to a total $700,000 loss on the Tate-related Hyperliquid account, Cointelegraph reported on Friday.

Following the YZY incident, the blockchain data platform pointed to Hayden Davies, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token, as one of the potential insiders.

Davies received renewed access to his funds on Aug. 21, after a judge had unfrozen $57.6 million in USDC (USDC) stablecoins tied to the Libra token scandal, Cointelegraph reported.

“Despite our collective efforts as investigators, builders, and communities – the same names keep running the same scams,” wrote Bubblemaps in a Wednesday X post, adding:

“Naseem: A network of snipers tied to Naseem, famous for making $100M on TRUMP, was first to buy YZY. These snipers are consistently first, printing millions,” added the platform.

Despite resulting in significant retail interest spikes, most celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrencies fail to gain traction and rise to become large-cap tokens.

Over 30 celebrity-endorsed tokens launched on Solana in June 2024 and have seen prices fall by no less than 73.23%. Celebrities endorsing these tokens included 50 Cent, Caitlyn Jenner, Iggy Azalea and soccer legend Ronaldinho Gaúcho.

Tate also jumped on the Solana memecoin bandwagon on June 7, 2024, endorsing more than 10 tokens, most of which lost around 99% of their value shortly after the endorsement.

 Bitcoin bulls are shrugging off the risk of fresh BTC price downside with a return to $113,000, but they have more work to do, said trader Peter Brandt. 

Key points:

Bitcoin builds on 1.6% daily gains as bulls overcome a fresh round of BTC sales by an “OG” whale entity.

Accumulation is in full swing across the board, research says, with interest mimicking April's price rebound.

BTC price action needs to avoid a “double top” all-time high next.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $113,000 on Thursday as demand from Asia ignored fresh whale selling.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 1.6% on the day to hit highs of $113,365.

The uptick liquidated about $40 million of crypto shorts in the four hours to the time of writing, per data from CoinGlass, with BTC resistance stacked overhead.

At the same time, a Bitcoin “OG” whale began to distribute more of their supply, with 250 BTC ($28.2 million) sent to crypto exchange Binance. The transaction was noted by X analytics account Lookonchain, and followed a 750 BTC sale the day prior.

Whale distribution behavior, often involving coins dormant for a decade or more, previously sparked a snap BTC price downside.

Commenting on the recent selling trend among whales, longtime market analyst Peter Brandt argued that it reflected classic “market tops.”

“It represented SUPPLY. Tops in markets are created by SUPPLY or DISTRIBUTION,” he wrote in part of an X post on Wednesday. 

As Cointelegraph reported, not all classes of Bitcoin investor have rethought their market exposure. 

As noted by Andre Dragosch, European head of research at crypto asset manager Bitwise, both retail and institutional accumulation are now at their highest since April, during the aftermath of a dip to local lows under $75,000.

“Such high level of accumulation tends to precede major breakouts to the upside,” Dragosch concluded, alongside Bitwise data.

Brandt remained level-headed on the outlook, saying that BTC/USD needed to reclaim $117,500 to invalidate bearish trend reversal signals.

Failure to do so, he said, would leave recent all-time highs as a “double top” formation, discounting seven weeks of price action.

A warning signal from the Coinbase Premium Index ahead of the Wall Street open showed that Bitcoin bulls were not yet in the clear.

The Premium was red for Wednesday, per data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, pointing to weakening US demand after a strong start to the week.

 The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Jerome Powell; some have previously signalled a constructive stance toward crypto. 

The Trump administration is considering at least 11 candidates to replace Jerome Powell when his term as Federal Reserve chair expires in May. At least three of them have taken positive stances toward crypto. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Wednesday that there are 11 “very strong candidates” for Fed chair, which he'll begin to vet and shortlist starting next month.

The list of candidates, as CNBC reported on Aug. 13, citing two administration officials, includes Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Fed Governor Chris Waller, Fed Vice Supervision Chair Michelle Bowman and former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey.

The list also includes Bush administration economic adviser Marc Sumerlin, investment bank Jefferies chief market strategist David Zervos and BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder.

The Federal Reserve sets US interest rates, which affect how the market invests. Lower interest rates increase liquidity and usually spur bets on volatile, risky assets like crypto, while interest rate hikes typically see investors sell riskier bets.

BlackRock's Rieder has made positive comments about crypto in the past. 

He told The Wall Street Journal in early 2024 that Bitcoin could likely “be a big part of the asset allocation framework” and that “over time people become more and more comfortable with it.”

Related: Bitcoin won't be ‘priced in' until Trump announces new Fed chair

Rieder told CNBC in November 2020 that he thought crypto and Bitcoin were “here to stay” and that “the receptivity — particularly millennials' receptivity — of technology and cryptocurrency is real.”

BlackRock has the largest Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds on the market.

The Fed's Waller and Bowman, reportedly also in the running, have both recently signalled a friendly approach to crypto.

Bowman, the Fed's top regulatory official, said on Aug. 20 that the central bank's staff should be allowed to invest a small amount in crypto to help them understand the technology, adding it would help with a “working understanding of the underlying functionality.”

Fed Governor Waller said a day later that the banking sector had “nothing to be afraid of” about crypto payments operating outside the traditional banking system, as it was “simply new technology to transfer objects and record transactions.”

In comparison, Powell has addressed crypto a handful of times and has usually urged a cautious approach. He said in June that crypto had become more mainstream and expected banks to increase engagement with the sector.

In December, he said Bitcoin was more of a competitor for gold than it was the US dollar.

Meanwhile, Jefferies, the investment bank for which Zervos directs strategy, is involved in crypto-tied entities.

The bank has backed the recent public debuts of trading platform eToro, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, crypto exchange Bullish and crypto-based lender Figure Technology Solutions.

It also bet early on the Bitcoin (BTC) buying ambitions of Michael Saylor's Strategy, and has reportedly had a senior banker dedicated exclusively to crypto for at least five years.

Powell's tenure as chair ends in May, but his 14-year term on the Fed board ends in early 2028. His highly anticipated speech on Friday raised hopes of an interest rate cut, with financial markets now expecting the Fed to cut rates when it again meets in mid-September.

These Succulents Glow in the Dark—And They're Gorgeous

Houseplants become rechargeable night-lights after injection with tiny phosphor particles

By Katherine Bourzac & Nature magazine 

Researchers gave these succulents in the Echevaria genus a glow up by injecting them with luminescent particles.

Liu et al./Matter

University students might soon have something other than black-light posters to brighten their dorm rooms. Researchers have created glow-in-the-dark plants by injecting succulents with materials similar to those that make the posters light up. The fleshy plants shine as brightly as a night light, and can be made to do so in a wide variety of colours — a first for glowing houseplants, according to the team.

The researchers, led by Xuejie Zhang, a materials scientist at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, describe today how they produced the plants in the journal Matter. They have applied for a patent on the technology, which they hope will lead to decorative installations and living lighting.

The idea of making glowing plants has captivated scientists since the late 1980s, when researchers made the first bioluminescent plant by inserting a gene from a firefly (Photinus pyralis) into a type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). This work laid the foundation for the first genetically engineered luminescent houseplant to come on the market in the United States, last year. The biotechnology firm Light Bio in Sun Valley, Idaho, sells the petunia (Petunia hybrida), which glows a very faint green thanks to genes from a light-emitting mushroom.

Unlike the petunia, which emits light through chemical reactions in its cells, the succulent glows because of materials injected into its leaves. These materials — phosphor particles made of strontium and aluminium dosed with other metals — absorb energy from light at one wavelength, store some of that energy and then slowly re-emit it at a different wavelength for several hours. For instance, one material the scientists injected into their succulents absorbs ultraviolet and blue light, and re-emits it as green light.

This type of ‘afterglow' phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark toys and paints, and as an imaging tracer for laboratory animals. Whereas genetically engineered bioluminescent plants are, so far, limited in the range of colours they emit, afterglow phosphors span a wide variety of hues, including red and blue, and they can be combined to produce a white glow.

This video shows how the tiny phosphor particles spread through the succulent leaves after they are injected.

Liu et al./Matter

The researchers purchased phosphors containing strontium aluminate and ground them down to particles of various sizes before injecting them into an assortment of plants. They found that particles around 7 micrometres in diameter glowed more brightly than did nanoparticles in plants, and were able to fill up the interior tissues of succulent leaves for a stronger, more uniform glow. By contrast, plants with simple leaf structures, such as tobacco plants and pak choi, emitted a more patchy glow.

The plant favoured by the team is the succulent Echevaria ‘Mebina', a common houseplant that grows rosettes of dense, fleshy leaves. To make every leaf glow, the researchers had to inject each one with phoshor particles, a process that takes about ten minutes. The luminescence — which the team generated in hues of blue-green, blue-violet, green, red and white — lasted as long as 120 minutes after exposing the plant to tailored wavelengths of light or sunlight, and could be triggered again and again over the 10 days of the study.

The researchers estimate that the cost of materials to create one plant is about 10 yuan (US$1.40).

Co-author Shuting Liu, also at the South China Agricultural University, says that the team hopes to move away from injecting each leaf by using smaller particles, which can spread more readily throughout plants. But the team will need to overcome an obstacle: the smaller the particle, the dimmer the glow.

Keith Wood, chief executive of Light Bio, says it's not yet clear how these particles affect the health of the plants over their lifespan. Additionally, the researchers acknowledge that more safety testing is needed; in particular, they need to know whether a leaf full of particles would be toxic if accidentally ingested.

Wood is also sceptical that glowing plants will ever be a living lighting system, capable of replacing light bulbs. So far, researchers have fallen “spectacularly short of that objective”, he says. Instead, whimsy is the name of the game with these plants. “We're making something fun, enjoyable, magical,” he adds.

New Cell Transplant for Type 1 Diabetes Sidesteps Need for Immunosuppressants

Scientists treated a person's type 1 diabetes with genetically modified insulin-producing cells that evaded immune system attacks. This is the first therapy for the condition that does not require immunosuppressant drugs

People with type 1 diabetes must constantly rely on insulin injections or pumps, usually for the rest of their life after diagnosis. The autoimmune disease destroys the cells that produce the hormone, which is crucial to keeping blood sugar in check. But now research suggests a new therapy could finally allow people with type 1 diabetes to make insulin on their own.

A 42-year-old man who has lived most of his life with type 1 diabetes has become the first human to receive a transplant of genetically modified insulin-producing cells that can slip past the immune system's mistaken attacks. This marks the first pancreatic cell transplant in a human to sidestep the need for immunosuppressant drugs—and it might even lead to a future cure for the disease, researchers say.

“This is the most exciting moment of my scientific career,” says cell biologist Per-Ola Carlsson of Uppsala University in Sweden, who helped develop the procedure. The new treatment, he says, “opens the future possibility of treating not only diabetes but other autoimmune diseases.”

Scientists injected nearly 80 million genetically tweaked cells into the participant's forearm muscle, and 12 weeks later the cells were still alive and producing insulin. The recipient did require additional insulin injections—but the injected cells showed no signs of rejection, which the researchers say is a major step forward. The results were reported this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.

About two million people in the U.S. live with type 1 diabetes, which typically requires an intensive regimen of insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring. If their blood sugar runs amok, people face severe risks, including heart attacks, nerve damage, vision problems, kidney disease, and more.

For decades, scientists have struggled to develop therapies that can successfully replenish beta cells—the specialized insulin-producing cells that are found in the pancreas. Newly added functional beta cells are usually quickly destroyed because a type 1 diabetic immune system flags them as invaders. A few past attempts successfully transplanted donor islets—clusters of pancreatic cells that included beta cells—but these always ultimately triggered an aggressive immune response. And such a response requires recipients to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs, which come with serious side effects, such as increased risks of infections and cancer. For example, at a conference in June, Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that 10 out of 12 participants who were treated with a stem-cell-based infusion during a clinical trial no longer required insulin injections a year after the therapy. But they may continue to need to immunosuppressants.

In the new study, Carlsson and his team looked for ways to dodge the immune response. First, they broke down a deceased donor's pancreatic islets into single cells. Using the common gene-editing technique CRISPR, the researchers inactivated in some of these cells two genes that control the expression of proteins called human leukocyte antigens, which direct the immune system to the foreign cells. Without those markers, the immune system can't easily recognize and destroy the donor cells.

To further evade immune system detection, the team made some cells express higher levels of a gene that discourages attacks by the body's natural killer cells and macrophages, two types of immune cells. Three months after the treatment, although the immune system attacked some cells in the graft, it left the cells that had the inactivated genes and overexpressed gene alone. Blood tests showed no measurable immune cell activation or antibody production in response to these cells.

Before the transplant, the participant had no measurable naturally produced insulin and was receiving daily doses of the hormone. But within four to 12 weeks following the transplant, his levels rose slightly on their own after meals—showing that the new beta cells were releasing some insulin in response to glucose. Four adverse events occurred, but none were serious or related to the modified cells.

The advance “is amazing,” says Laura Alonso, chief of the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. Unlike type 2 diabetes, in which people have poorly functioning beta cells, type 1 diabetes can destroy beta cells completely. Some people with type 1 diabetes may still have a small set of functional beta cells, but in more established cases, the immune system often whittles away all cells, Alonso says. For those established cases, she says, “cell-based therapy is where we need to go.”

Alonso adds, however, that even though the new study is promising, it involved just one participant and is therefore preliminary. And longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the therapy's safety before it can be offered to more people. She also notes that the injected cells produced only 7 percent of the insulin needed for a person to be fully independent of additional medication. The researchers supplied the recipient with insulin doses to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

“It's a relatively short but nonetheless important finding,” says Kevan Herold, an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine, who was also not involved in the study. Because the participant still required a substantial amount of insulin after the transplant and no others have received this treatment yet, Harold cautions that “the clinical significance is somewhat unproven.”

Carlsson says the team will continue to monitor the transplant recipient over the next year and will increase the dose of the modified cells if no adverse effects occur. In the meantime, he and his colleagues are developing a stem cell source that would be capable of producing large quantities of insulin-producing cells. “The combination of those two advances would create the possibility of a cure for type 1 diabetes,” he says.

While Herold thinks it's still too early to consider this approach for a cure, “these options are now here to change the disease in ways that have never been possible before,” he says. “There's tremendous hope.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","These “plastivore” caterpillars can devour a plastic bag in just 24 hours","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250827010736.htm","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 04:41:15 GMT","

Plastics play a fundamental role in modern life, but their resistance to biodegradation makes them very difficult to dispose of. New research reveals how “plastivore” caterpillars can metabolically degrade plastics in a matter of days, not decades, and store them internally as body fat – but at what cost?

In 2017, a groundbreaking study demonstrated that the caterpillars of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella), known as waxworms, can degrade polyethylene plastic. Polyethylene is the world's most commonly manufactured plastic, with over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene produced globally each year. Polyethylene is chemically resilient, which makes it resistant to decomposition and can take decades or even hundreds of years to fully degrade.

While this plastic degradation process has been demonstrated by waxworms at a small scale, this ongoing research project is helping us to better understand the biological mechanisms at work, the impact of an all-plastic diet on the health of these organisms, and their viability as a sustainable solution to plastic pollution.

“Around 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire polyethylene bag in as little as 24 hours, although we believe that co-supplementation with feeding stimulants like sugars can reduce the number of worms considerably,” says Dr Bryan Cassone, a Professor of Insect Pest and Vector Biology in the Department of Biology at Brandon University, Canada. “However, understanding the biological mechanisms and consequences on fitness associated with plastic biodegradation is key to using waxworms for large-scale plastic remediation.”

Utilizing a suite of techniques spanning animal physiology, material science, molecular biology and genomics, Dr Cassone and his team have studied the interesting relationship between waxworms, their bacterial microbiome, and their potential for large-scale plastic biodegradation, as well as the possible impacts on waxworm health and survivability.

This research reveals that waxworms metabolically process the plastics down into lipids and store it as body fat. “This is similar to us eating steak – if we consume too much saturated and unsaturated fat, it becomes stored in adipose tissue as lipid reserves, rather than being used as energy,” says Dr Cassone.

While waxworms will readily consume polyethylene, this research also shows that this ultimately ends in a quick death. “They do not survive more than a few days on a plastic-only diet and they lose considerable mass,” says Dr Cassone. “However, we are optimistic that we can formulate a co-supplementation that not only restores their fitness to natural levels but exceeds it.”

Dr Cassone and his team have identified two ways in which waxworms could contribute solutions to the ongoing plastic pollution crisis. “Firstly, we could mass rear waxworms on a co-supplemented polyethylene diet as part of a circular economy,” he says. “Secondly, we could explore the re-engineering of the plastic biodegradation pathway outside the animal.”

As a bonus benefit, the mass production of waxworms would also generate a substantial surplus of insect biomass, which could represent an additional economic opportunity in aquaculture. “Our preliminary data suggests that they could become part of a very nutritious diet for commercial food fishes,” says Dr Cassone.

This research is being presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in Antwerp, Belgium on the 8th July 2025.

New research from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, in partnership with the University of Bath, has found that the reasons why a person chooses to use cannabis can increase their risk of developing paranoia.

The use and potency of cannabis is increasing worldwide, and dependence and cannabis-induced psychosis are also greatly increasing as a result, especially in North America. Two new research papers, both using data from Cannabis & Me -- the largest survey of its kind -- have identified key risk factors associated with the more severe forms of paranoia in cannabis users.

The first study, published on August 26 in the BMJ Mental Health, explored the relationship between why people first started using cannabis, and how this affected their subsequent use.

3389 former and current cannabis users aged 18 and over responded to a survey examining their reasons for first and continued use, their weekly consumption of cannabis in THC units, and their mental health.

Researchers established several key findings. Respondents who first started using cannabis to self-medicate an illness, including physical pain, anxiety, depression, or because they were experiencing minor psychotic symptoms, all demonstrated higher paranoia scores.

This was in contrast to those respondents who tried cannabis for fun or curiosity, or with their friends, who reported the lowest average paranoia and anxiety scores.

Dr Edoardo Spinazzola, a Research Assistant at King's IoPPN and the study's first author said, ""Our study provides vital evidence on how the reason someone first starts using cannabis can dramatically impact their long-term health.

""This research suggests that using cannabis as a mean to self-medicate physical or mental discomfort can have a negative impact on the levels of paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Most of these subgroups had average scores of depression and anxiety which were above the threshold for referral to counseling.""

Respondents were also asked to provide data on the frequency and strength of the cannabis they were using so that researchers could track their average weekly consumption of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -- the principle psychoactive component of cannabis.

The researchers found that the average respondent consumed 206 units of THC a week. This might equate to roughly 10-17 'joints' per week, if the user was consuming an expected 20 per cent THC content that is standard for the most common types of cannabis available in London.

However, respondents who started using cannabis to help with their anxiety, depression, or in cases where they started due to others in their household who were already using cannabis, reported on average 248, 254.7, and 286.9 average weekly THC units respectively.

Professor Tom Freeman, Director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath and one of the study's authors said, ""A key finding of our study is that people who first used cannabis to manage anxiety or depression, or because a family member was using it, showed higher levels of cannabis use overall.

""In future, standard THC units could be used in a similar way to alcohol units -- for example, to help people to track their cannabis consumption and better manage its effects on their health.""

In a separate study, published in Psychological Medicine, researchers explored the relationship between childhood trauma, paranoia and cannabis use.

Researchers used the same data set from the Cannabis & Me survey, with just over half of respondents (52 per cent) reporting experience of some form of trauma.

Analysis established that respondents who had been exposed to trauma as children reported higher average levels of paranoia compared to those who hadn't, with physical and emotional abuse emerging as the strongest predictors.

Researchers also explored the relationship between childhood trauma and weekly THC consumption. Respondents who reported experience of sexual abuse had a markedly higher weekly intake of THC, closely followed by those who reported experiencing emotional and physical abuse.

Finally, the researchers confirmed that the strong association between childhood trauma and paranoia is further exacerbated by cannabis use, but is affected by the different types of trauma experienced. Respondents who said they had experienced emotional abuse or household discord1 were strongly associated with increased THC consumption and paranoia scores. Respondents reporting bullying, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect on the other hand did not show the same effects.

Dr Giulia Trotta, a Consultant Psychiatrist and Researcher at King's IoPPN and the study's first author said, ""This comprehensive study is the first to explore the interplay between childhood trauma, paranoia, and cannabis use among cannabis users from the general population.

""We have not only established a clear association between trauma and future paranoia, but also that cannabis use can further exacerbate the effects of this, depending on what form the trauma takes.

""Our findings will have clear implications for clinical practice as they highlight the importance of early screening for trauma exposure in individuals presenting with paranoia.""

Professor Marta Di Forti, Professor of Drug use, Genetics and Psychosis at King's IoPPN, Clinical Lead at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust's Cannabis Clinic for Patients with Psychosis, and the senior author on both studies said, ""There is extensive national and internation debate about the legality and safety of cannabis use.

""My experience in clinic tells me that there are groups of people who start to use cannabis as a means of coping with physical and emotional pain. My research has confirmed that this is not without significant further risk to their health and wellbeing, and policy makers across the world should be mindful of the impact that legalisation , without adequate public education and health support, could have on both the individual, as well as on healthcare systems more broadly.""

Cannabis & Me was possible thanks to funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC).

Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the ""workhorses"" of life essential to nearly every living process. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In a new study, published in Nature, researchers chemically linked life's amino acids to RNA in conditions that could have occurred on the early Earth -- an achievement that has eluded scientists since the early 1970s.

Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: ""Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. Understanding the origin of protein synthesis is fundamental to understanding where life came from.

""Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis.

""Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. This machine requires chemical instructions written in messenger RNA, which carries a gene's sequence from a cell's DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein.

""We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. The chemistry is spontaneous, selective and could have occurred on the early Earth.""

Previous attempts to attach amino acids to RNA used highly reactive molecules, but these broke down in water and caused the amino acids to react with each other, rather than become linked to RNA.

For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. This activation involved a thioester, a high-energy chemical compound important in many of life's biochemical processes and that has already been theorized to play a role at the start of life*.

Professor Powner said: ""Our study unites two prominent origin of life theories -- the 'RNA world', where self-replicating RNA is proposed to be fundamental, and the 'thioester world', in which thioesters are seen as the energy source for the earliest forms of life.""

In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life.

The next step, the researchers said, was to establish how RNA sequences could bind preferentially to specific amino acids, so that RNA could begin to code instructions for protein synthesis -- the origin of the genetic code.

""There are numerous problems to overcome before we can fully elucidate the origin of life, but the most challenging and exciting remains the origins of protein synthesis,"" said Professor Powner.

Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: ""Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin.

""Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life.

""What is particularly groundbreaking is that the activated amino acid used in this study is a thioester, a type of molecule made from Coenzyme A, a chemical found in all living cells. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building.""

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said that the reactions they demonstrated could plausibly have taken place in pools or lakes of water on the early Earth (but not likely in the oceans as the concentrations of the chemicals would likely be too diluted).

The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules).

Notes

*The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a ""thioester world"" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters.

** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape. As part of their study, the research team showed how, once the amino acids were loaded on to the RNA, they could synthesize with other amino acids to form peptides.

The work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the Simons Foundation and the Royal Society.

Ecologists have observed a species of nocturnal spider attracting prey to its web using the bioluminescent beacons of already trapped fireflies. This rare example of a predator exploiting its prey's mating signal for its own gain is documented in the British Ecological Society's Journal of Animal Ecology.

Researchers at Tunghai University, Taiwan have observed sheet web spiders Psechrus clavis capturing fireflies in their webs and leaving them there while they emitted bioluminescent light for up to an hour. The researchers even observed the spiders going to check on the captured fireflies from time to time.

Intrigued by this unusual behavior the researchers set up an experiment to test whether this was a strategy used by the spiders to increase their hunting success. In the experiment, they placed LEDs that resembled fireflies, in real sheet spider webs and left other webs clear as controls.

They found three times the amount of prey was attracted to webs with the LEDs compared to the control webs. This increased to ten times more prey when they only looked at fireflies being captured.

The findings confirm that captured fireflies left as bait increase the hunting success rate of the spiders. The researchers also noticed that the majority of captured fireflies were male, who were likely mistaking the glow for potential mates.

Dr I-Min Tso, the lead author of the study said: ""Our findings highlight a previously undocumented interaction where firefly signals, intended for sexual communication, are also beneficial to spiders.

""This study sheds new light on the ways that nocturnal sit-and-wait predators can rise to the challenges of attracting prey and provides a unique perspective on the complexity of predator-prey interactions.""

The researchers suggest that this behavior could have developed in sheet web spiders to avoid costly investment in their own bioluminescence like other sit-and-wait predators, such as anglerfish. Instead, the spiders are able to outsource prey attraction to their prey's own signals.

The sheet web spider Psechrus clavis is a nocturnal sit and wait predator found in subtropical forests of East Asia. It's main source of prey, the winter firefly Diaphanes lampyroides, uses continuous, non-flashing bioluminescence to attract mates.

Video footage captured by the researchers (see link below) in their experiment shows sheet web spiders employing different strategies when interacting with different prey species. Spiders would immediately consume any moths captured in their webs but would not immediately consume fireflies they captured.

""Handling prey in different ways suggests that the spider can use some kind of cue to distinguish between the prey species they capture and determine an appropriate response."" explained Dr I-Min Tso. ""We speculate that it is probably the bioluminescent signals of the fireflies that are used to identify fireflies enabling spiders to adjust their prey handling behavior accordingly.""

The researchers conducted their field experiment in the conifer plantation forest at National Taiwan University's Xitou Nature Educational Area.

Because they used LEDs to mimic the light signal emitted by fireflies, the researchers warn that although the wavelength and intensity of the LED set up was a close match to fireflies, it would be best if real fireflies were used in the field experiment. But they admit that this would be extremely difficult in practice.

The discovery of new fossils and a new species of ancient ancestor may help shift the perception of human evolution from linear evolution to that of a tree with many branches, new UNLV research published on August 13 in the journal Nature shows.

UNLV anthropologist Brian Villmoare and a team of international scientists discovered new fossils at a field site in Ethiopia that indicate Australopithecus, and the oldest specimens of Homo, coexisted between 2.6 and 2.8 million years ago at the same place in Africa.

The scientists found 13 teeth at the Ledi-Geraru site and determined that, although some belong to the genus Homo, a set of upper and lower teeth belong to a new species of the genus Australopithecus. This new species is distinct from the well-known Australopithecus afarensis (the famous 'Lucy'), which last appears at roughly 2.95 million years ago and was discovered in nearby Hadar.

The presence of both species in the same location shows that human evolution is less linear and more tree-like, said Villmoare, associate professor of anthropology and lead author of the paper.

""We used to think of human evolution as fairly linear, with a steady march from an ape-like ancestor to modern Homo sapiens. Instead, humans have branched out multiple times into different niches. Our pattern of evolution is not particularly unusual, and what has happened to humans has happened to every other tree of life,"" he said.

""This is what we should be finding in the human fossil record,"" Villmoare said. ""Nature experimented with different ways to be a human as the climate became drier in East Africa, and earlier more ape-like species went extinct.""

The Ledi-Geraru site is the same field site where a team of researchers discovered the jaw of the earliest Homo specimen ever found at 2.8 million years old. Villmoare has worked with the Ledi-Geraru Research Project and scientists at the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University since 2002.

""The new finds of Homo teeth from 2.6-2.8 million-year-old sediments -- reported in this paper -- confirms the antiquity of our lineage,"" he said.

""We know what the teeth and mandible of the earliest Homo look like, but that's it. This emphasizes the critical importance of finding additional fossils to understand the differences between Australopithecus and Homo, and potentially how they were able to overlap in the fossil record at the same location.""

The researchers haven't named the species yet. More fossils and further study are needed.

                         (2025)Cite this article


Cancer-associated fibroblasts represent a functionally diverse and heterogeneous entity within the solid tumor microenvironment. Mitochondrial transfer from cancer cells to fibroblasts is now shown to act as a reprogramming stimulus, driving metabolic and functional differentiation of fibroblasts to support tumor growth.

In the context of an increasing need for clinical assessments of foundation models, we developed EyeFM, a multimodal vision–language eyecare copilot, and conducted a multifaceted evaluation, including retrospective validations, multicountry efficacy validation as a clinical copilot and a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT). EyeFM was pretrained on 14.5 million ocular images from five imaging modalities paired with clinical texts from global, multiethnic datasets. Efficacy validation invited 44 ophthalmologists across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa in primary and specialty care settings, highlighting its utility as a clinical copilot. The RCT—a parallel, single-center, double-masked study—assessed EyeFM as a clinical copilot in retinal disease screening among a high-risk population in China. A total of 668 participants (mean age 57.5 years, 79.5% male) were randomized to 16 ophthalmologists, equally allocated into intervention (with EyeFM copilot) and control (standard care) groups. The primary endpoint indicated that ophthalmologists with EyeFM copilot achieved higher correct diagnostic rate (92.2% versus 75.4%, P < 0.001) and referral rate (92.2% versus 80.5%, P < 0.001). Secondary outcome indicated improved standardization score of clinical reports (median 33 versus 37, P < 0.001). Participant satisfaction with the screening was similar between groups, whereas the intervention group demonstrated higher compliance with self-management (70.1% versus 49.1%, P < 0.001) and referral suggestions (33.7% versus 20.2%, P < 0.001) at follow-up. Post-deployment evaluations indicated strong user acceptance. Our study provided evidence that implementing EyeFM copilot can improve the performance of ophthalmologists and the outcome of patients.

For patients attending ocular disease screening in the primary care centre where only low-cost examination technics are available, EyeFM can use its single modality and cross-modality ability to assist disease detection, followed with screening report writing assisted by its vision-question answering ability. Then, some patients will be referred to specialty care settings for further examination, where EyeFM can use its integrated modality disease detection or even zero-shot ability to facilitate further diagnosis. The image-report writing ability and vision-question answering can also assist to improve the efficiency of clinical report and patient letter drafting in specialty care settings.

a) The diagram of pretraining process for EyeFM. EyeFM was first pretrained for its image encoder with five modalities of images, then conducted vision-language joint pretraining. The image module includes one encoder and five decoders. The encoder comprises 24 Transformer blocks. Each decoder comprises two Transformer blocks. The linear projection layer is implemented with a single convolutional layer. In the vision-language module, the projection is implemented using a single linear layer, which serves to connect the image encoder with the language module. The language module is based on LLaMA 2 architecture with 7 billion parameters. b) The diagram of human-in-the-loop process for EyeFM. EyeFM human-in-the-loop utilized DPO and federated learning for distributed knowledge evolution.

First, we conducted retrospective validations, comparing EyeFM with prior benchmarks of medical foundation models. This step serves as the foundation for evaluating the model's performance and safety when progressing to clinical applications. Second, we conducted reader studies and real-world study prospectively to test the efficiency of EyeFM as a clinical copilot to assist ophthalmologists. This step bridged the gap between the performance of the model its own and its efficiency when applicated by clinicians. At last, we validated EyeFM with a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Colored chart, above, validation experiments and their corresponding relationship with the functions of EyeFM. The x-axis represents different tasks of EyeFM and y-axis represents validation experiments. Cells were coloured if the experiments have validated corresponding functions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","China Is Building a Brain-Computer Interface Industry","https://www.wired.com/story/china-is-getting-serious-about-brain-computer-interfaces/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In a policy document released this month, China has signaled its ambition to become a world leader in brain-computer interfaces, the same technology that Elon Musk's Neuralink and other US startups are developing.

Brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, read and decode neural activity to translate it into commands. Because they provide a direct link between the brain and an external device, such as a computer or robotic arm, BCIs have tremendous potential as assistive devices for people with severe physical disabilities.

In the US, Neuralink, Synchron, Paradromics, and others have sprung up in recent years to commercialize BCIs. Now, China boasts several homegrown BCI companies, and its government is making the development of the technology a priority.

Jointly authored in July by seven departments within the Chinese government—including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National Health Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences—the new policy document lays out a road map for China to achieve breakthroughs in BCI technology by 2027 and build an internationally competitive industry by 2030.

“We know that China is strong at translating basic research into practical uses and commercialization. We've seen that in other industries, such as photovoltaics and electric cars. Now BCI is another area where that's going to be critical,” says Max Riesenhuber, a professor of neuroscience and codirector of the Center for Neuroengineering at Georgetown University Medical Center, who has published research on China's BCI developments.

“The document really lays out this whole umbrella of activities needed to become a leader in BCI, not just in research, but in actually getting it into the mainstream,” he says.

Research on BCIs dates back to the 1970s, but for decades, the technology was too cumbersome and unreliable for practical applications. Neuralink and its US competitors are all aiming to improve on the design and performance of early BCIs to make useful products for patients.

China's foray into BCI research came later, but the country is quickly catching up to the US. Several companies and research institutions in China have successfully tested BCI implants in patients, showing that people with paralysis can move a cursor on a computer screen, operate a robotic arm, and type out their thoughts. Last year, the Chinese government released ethical guidelines for the use of BCIs. Now, its policy document lays out a road map for speeding up the development of these devices. It outlines 17 specific steps, which include creating better chips to capture brain signals, improving software to decode those signals, standardizing BCI technology, and establishing manufacturing capabilities.

“The Chinese government has always been supportive of disruptive technologies,” says Phoenix Peng, cofounder and CEO of NeuroXess, a BCI company based in Shanghai. “I think, from the government's point of view, this policy means that BCI technology has already passed from a concept level into the product level.”

He says NeuroXess has implanted six paralyzed patients with its device. In three of those patients, it was used to accurately decode Chinese speech. For the others, it allowed thought control of digital devices.

Given these and other recent milestones, Peng says it's realistic to think that at least one BCI system could gain approval in China by 2027.

Minmin Luo, director of the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR) in Beijing, agrees that the country is well on its way to meeting the goals set out by the new policy document. “It is basically an engineering project, with not so ambitious goals. Already, there are so many people working on it,” he says.

Luo is the chief scientist at NeuCyber NeuroTech, a spinoff of CBIR, which has developed a coin-sized brain chip called Beinao-1 and so far implanted it in five people. “We have observed excellent safety and stability in our clinical assessments,” he says.

The recipients, who are paralyzed, are now able to move a computer cursor and navigate to smartphone apps, Luo says. The team plans to implant a sixth patient by the end of August.

“We believe there is a significant unmet need for assistive BCI technology in China,” he says. He estimates that at least 1 to 2 million patients in the country could benefit from BCIs for assistive and rehabilitative purposes.

Beyond those uses, the policy document lays out other medical applications. It says BCIs could be used to monitor and analyze brain activity in real time to potentially prevent or reduce the risk of certain brain diseases. It also endorses consumer applications, such as monitoring driver alertness. The document says a wearable BCI could provide timely alerts for drowsiness, lack of attention, and slow reaction times, helping to reduce the probability of traffic accidents.

“I think noninvasive BCI products will get a huge market boost in China, because China is the biggest consumer electronics manufacturing country,” Peng says.

A few US companies, including Emotiv and Neurable, have started selling consumer wearables that use electroencephalography, or EEG, to capture brain waves through the scalp. But the devices are still expensive and have yet to take off more broadly.

China's policy document, meanwhile, is promoting the mass production of non-implantable devices in various forms—forehead-mounted, head-mounted, ear-mounted, ear buds, and helmets, glasses, and headphones. It also proposes piloting BCIs in certain industries for safety management, such as hazardous materials handling, nuclear energy, mining, and electricity. The document suggests that BCIs could provide early warnings for workplace events such as low oxygen levels, poisoning, and fainting.

While the new policy guidance sets up a China-US rivalry in the BCI space, Peng sees room for cross-country collaboration among entrepreneurs. “We can cooperate as a society to build something for the patients, because they are desperate for this technology to have a better life,” he says. “We don't want to be involved in any geopolitical issues. We just want to build something useful for patients.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Top CDC Officials Resign After Director Is Pushed Out","https://www.wired.com/story/centers-for-disease-control-prevention-cdc-resignations/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 01:08:28 GMT","

Susan Monarez is no longer the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a post by the official Department of Health and Human Services X account. She had been in the position for just a month. In the wake of her apparent ouster, several other CDC leaders have resigned.

Named acting CDC director in January, Monarez was officially confirmed to the position by the Senate on July 29 and sworn in two days later. During her brief tenure, the CDC's main campus in Atlanta was attacked by a gunman who blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him sick and depressed. A local police officer, David Rose, was killed by the suspect when responding to the shooting.

In a statement Wednesday evening Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell, Monarez's lawyers, alleged that she had been “targeted” for refusing “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.” The statement further says that Monarez has not resigned and does not plan to, and claims that she has not received notification that she's been fired.

According to emails obtained by WIRED, at least three other senior CDC officials resigned Wednesday evening: Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Debra Houry, chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science; and Daniel Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.

More resignations are expected to become public soon, say CDC staff with knowledge of the departures.

“I worry that political appointees will not make decisions on the science, but instead focus on supporting the administration's agenda,” says one CDC employee, who was granted anonymity out of concerns over retribution. “I worry that the next directors will not support and protect staff.”

President Donald Trump's original pick to lead the CDC was David Weldon, a physician and former Republican congressman from Florida who had a history of making statements questioning the safety of vaccines. But hours before his Senate confirmation hearing in March, the White House withdrew Weldon's nomination. The administration then nominated Monarez.

The CDC leadership exits come amid recent vaccine policy upheaval fomented by HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who in May removed the Covid-19 vaccine from the list of the CDC's recommended vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The following month, he fired all 17 sitting members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group of independent experts that makes science-based recommendations on vaccines.

In their place, he installed eight new members, including several longtime vaccine critics. “A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy said in a statement at the time.

Earlier this month under Kennedy's leadership, HHS canceled a half billion dollars in funding for research on mRNA vaccines. This month HHS also announced the reinstatement of the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines, a federal advisory panel created by Congress in 1986 to improve vaccine safety and oversight for children in the US. The panel was disbanded in 1998, when it issued its final report. Public health experts worry that the panel is a move to further undermine established vaccine science.

In her email to staff, Houry referenced ongoing changes at the agency as the reason for her departure.

“For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations. Vaccines save lives—this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact. Informed consent and shared decisionmaking must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities,” she said. “Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.”

Jernigan, who has served at the CDC since 1994, said in an email to staff, “I believe strongly in the mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80 years; however, given the current context in the department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.”

In his email, Daskalakis said, “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.”

In a longer statement posted on Instagram, Daskalakis said, “The recent change in the adult and children's immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people. The data analyses that supported this decision have never been shared with CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership.”

The current turmoil at the CDC has remaining staffers concerned about the agency's future. “My main concern is they will be replaced with puppets,” says one CDC employee who was granted anonymity over concerns of retribution, “which will lead to people not getting the vaccines they need, which will lead to more preventable outbreaks.”

The age-old question (if “age-old” can be used for technology developed in the past 20 years) persisted as I tested the newest designed-for-kids Kindle: Should you give kids a screen when you could give them something else?

If you are going to give your kids a screen, a reflective e-paper screen that's easier on the eyes than an emissive screen is one of the best ways to go. While a Kindle can't fully replace the experience of turning a page on a physical book, I loved reading from a young age and would have loved to be able to bring every book I wanted anywhere I went. That's something I can do now with my son. While he's a little too young (only 3!) to be in charge of his own Kindle, I was happy to find I could pull up classic picture books like Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? to read with him on the go.

While you could always do this with the Kindle Kids and Paperwhite Kids, the Kindle Colorsoft Kids ($270) levels up the experience with a colorful E Ink screen. It's a new version of the Colorsoft that's designed with kids in mind, with two pretty cover options to boot. Now my son and I can see that the brown bear is brown, rather than me just telling him that. It's a fun on-the-go option for picture books, and even more ideal for older kiddos who love comic books and graphic novels.

The Colorsoft Kids is the same size as both the Colorsoft Signature Edition that came out last year and the Paperwhite Kids, with a 7-inch display. That screen is an inch larger than the cheaper base Kindle Kids, but it doesn't have the auto-adjusting front light you'll find on the Signature Edition Colorsoft. The Colorsoft Kids (and cheaper baseline Kindle Colorsoft) also doesn't have Qi-certified wireless charging like the Signature Edition, either, and has a smaller storage of 16 GB. That should still be plenty for several colorful books, though you could run out of storage faster if you download too many large comic and illustrated files. But it's pretty easy to unload and re-download books to adjust your storage.

Like the Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Kindle Colorsoft Kids has 300 pixels per inch (PPI) for black-and-white content, and 150 PPI for color. The colors aren't super saturated compared to a real-life kids' book, but it still makes for a nice visual experience, especially for more colorful stories. It's a similar color experience you'll get on devices like the ReMarkable Paper Pro and Kobo Libra Colour.

You can go into the settings and switch the colors from Standard to Vivid, which promises to add more color to less-saturated images. I didn't see much of a difference switching between these two modes, and you do have to exit kids mode to change this setting, which was a little annoying when trying to see if it improved a book for my son or not. Amazon says switching to Vivid mode doesn't tax the battery on the Colorsoft.

While the Colorsoft can try to make images more vivid, it can't add color where there isn't color already. The Harry Potter series, for example, will have colorful covers when used on a Colorsoft (Kids or not!), but the little illustrations at the top of each chapter remain black-and-white. I've been apprehensive about switching to a color Kindle as an adult who mainly reads books with no preexisting illustrations to enjoy. While the thought of colorful covers brings me joy, it's certainly not a necessary upgrade for most readers. But for kids, there are tons of books with color and illustrations. The color pages make it something that would even appeal to my younger son as he works on letter recognition in a way a regular Kindle wouldn't for years.

The color screen does take something away: Dark Mode. You can't turn it on for the entire Kindle anymore when it comes to the Colorsoft collection. You can change the page settings and turn the page color to black for a similar experience while you read, but the menus and main Kindle pages will all remain in light mode.

One of the biggest appeals to buying one of the Kids-branded Kindles is the free access to Amazon Kids+ content, which usually costs $6 a month. While the other Kids models get six months of free access, the Colorsoft Kids gets a full year of free access. There's also “kids mode,” but you can activate that on other Kindle models without needing a specific Kids Kindle.

When you set up kids mode, you'll be prompted to put in your child's name and their birthday, which allows Amazon to recommend books appropriate for their age. You can make multiple kid profiles, but you'll need a PIN or passcode to switch off kids mode and return to regular Kindle mode. I set up my son's profile with his nickname and his birthday, and since he's only 3 years old, his recommendations in the “Books You Might Like” section were colorful picture books like Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? and First 100 Animals. I was able to download both immediately with the Kids+ subscription.

You buy books on a Kindle, but the Kids interface has a Store option that allows your kid to browse books and request them, which will then alert the parent account about the desired book. It replaces the store feature in regular mode that allows you to purchase a book directly. It's a nice way to still give kids an option to look for a new book and choose it themselves, without giving them free-for-all access to your credit card on file. (But if you were going to give your kids free rein on spending, books are a great place for it.)

While you can access kids mode on any Kindle, a Colorsoft certainly feels like a great fit for kids of all ages. Colorful covers and pages are a great way to entice kids to read, and it's certainly much more fun to look at a library of books on a Colorsoft model than it is on a black-and-white-only e-reader. The full year of Kids+ content is a great bonus, too.

While upgrading to a color Kindle is a fun option, most of my adult books won't be able to take advantage. Kids have more illustrated book options to actually take advantage of the color feature, and it's a nice choice for developing readers who might lean on art more to understand a book.

You'll pay quite a bit more for this Kindle than the other Kids options, but it's an e-reader that can grow with your kid and take them through all kinds of phases of reading. Plus, it's a Kindle you can borrow from them to get a little color for your books, even if it's just the covers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Why China Builds Faster Than the Rest of the World","https://www.wired.com/story/dan-wang-china-breakneck-book-interview/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

There's never been a shortage of hot takes about what really makes the United States and China so different: Capitalism versus socialism; democracy as opposed to authoritarianism; Christianity or Confucianism; equity versus efficiency. In his highly anticipated new book, Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future, Hoover Institution fellow Dan Wang proposes a fresh lens for looking at the world's two largest superpowers: the US is a “lawyerly society,” he argues, while China is an “engineering state.”

Wang's argument is based on looking at the professional backgrounds of each country's elite class. In Washington, most politicians are trained as lawyers, but in Beijing, senior leaders are more often educated in civil or defense engineering. Wang theorizes that the academic subjects political leaders study during their formative years later profoundly shape their respective governance styles. Lawyers tend to emphasize compliance and patience. Engineers prefer to move fast, build big, and only later contend with the costs.

Wang's framework isn't about declaring winners and losers. Instead, he places the US and China at opposite ends of a spectrum, while countries like France, Germany, and Japan fall somewhere in between. His prescription? “For the US to be 20 percent more engineering, and for China to be 50 percent more lawyerly,” he told me earlier this week.

Our conversation took place on Tuesday, the day Wang's book was published, in a small park in Manhattan. New York City has one of the world's oldest subway systems, but it hasn't approved a major new train line since 2007. In his book, Wang includes a detailed discussion about Robert Moses, the controversial urban planner who built some of the city's most famous and enduring infrastructure but also tore up marginalized neighborhoods in the process. He argues that New York could use another transformative builder like Moses.

The conversation felt personal because of the contrast between New York, where I now live, and Wuhan, where I grew up. When I left Wuhan for college, the city built seven new subway lines in four years, stretching almost 100 miles. Locals nicknamed Wuhan's mayor at the time 满城挖 or “Mayor Dig-It-All-Up,” to show their disapproval. But now that the construction is finished and Wuhan has been completely transformed, Mayor Dig-It-All-Up is remembered fondly by many locals, and he has been elevated by the central government to manage a province in China's southwest.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: Do you think the US should move to the other end of the engineer-lawyer spectrum you describe and become a full-blown engineering state?

Dan Wang: The US used to be more of an engineering state—it's certainly built a lot. We're chatting in New York City right now, and this is the city that built subway stations about 120 years ago. The United States built canal systems and highways and transcontinental rail systems and the Apollo missions, as well as the Manhattan Project. A lot of what I'm trying to do is to say that the US should recover some of these engineering muscles. It certainly doesn't have to be like China.

Since we're talking about New York. You wrote about Robert Moses in your book. Is he an example of a positive engineer leader to you?

Robert Moses was neither a lawyer nor an engineer, but he was someone who built at breakneck speed. He should have been indicted, as he was by Robert Caro [who wrote The Power Broker, a damning biography of Moses]. He should have been stopped by the 1960s.

But it doesn't make sense that we are still stomping on Robert Moses' name at a time when it has become completely impossible to build mass transit in New York City. We do need a little bit of construction. It doesn't have to be exactly Robert Moses–style, but we need to be focused a little bit more on delivering outcomes rather than focusing on process.

Is it enough to just employ engineers in the government? Or is there another factor?

There has to be more. There has to be a sense that the law is a way also to strike deals rather than an instrument to create litigation and regulation.

One big challenge for New York's subway system now is how to maintain a 100-year-old system. Yes, China has been building a lot in the last decade, but will they be able to maintain it well?

The engineering state is always going to be tearing things down and building more, in part, because they are engineers. Neither the local nor the central governments are very imaginative, because whenever they have the ability to spend on something, they just build on more infrastructure.

When you talk about bringing back manufacturing to the US, are you envisioning bringing back all kinds of manufacturing or only a selective few?

I think we should err on the side of bringing back more rather than less. Maybe it is hard to say that sneakers and T-shirts are the most important thing, but for anything more complex, the US has a really hard time building. It is good for the US to have more electronics production; it is good for us to have more electric vehicle battery production.

Can the US really bring those industries back, given that China does not seem interested in letting go of its manufacturing advantage or deindustrializing?

Chinese technology leaders, like BYD and CATL, are really eager to invest more in the US. It might be difficult at some point, say if Beijing disallows CATL from investing in the US, but for the most part, what we see is considerable eagerness from Chinese companies to make these investments. And for the most part, I believe that the US should be welcoming them.

Beijing is already scrutinizing this kind of overseas investment, because it doesn't want to lose China's trade secrets. Did they learn that from the US?

Perhaps they learned from the US. But I think the US now should learn more from China. If China had substantial help, especially from companies like Apple and Tesla, building up manufacturing facilities in Shenzhen and Shanghai, then the US can still learn more from China rather than refusing to learn and blocking Chinese technology leaders from building more.

And that requires swallowing our pride here, right? Like we actually need to learn from China, even though US politicians don't want to admit that.

Yes. I think that we should all swallow pride. My personal philosophy is that if anyone wants to serve me shit, my answer is always going to be: “Please sir, may I have another?” That's just how we should all be living.

Do you think tech companies prefer operating in an engineer-led country like China rather than America's lawyerly society?

Companies generally prefer having some degree of rule by engineers. Because engineers are much more focused on doing very rational things, like figuring out how to build a great subway system. Perhaps their regulations are also more rational.

That doesn't mean lawsuits everywhere are bad. Sometimes companies have a great time suing each other and protecting their intellectual property. But, in general, a common sentiment among business elites is that China's government understands us. You see this with Elon Musk, praising China's premier who helped him build the Gigafactory in Shanghai.

But you also wrote recently that entrepreneurs and executives can sometimes feel miserable because the Chinese government changes its mind very abruptly.

Sometimes it is the case that the engineering state treats a lot of the society and the economy as simply another engineering problem. They try to engineer the population, first from not having kids, and now, into having more kids, or the economy, from valuing profitable sectors to delving too much into sectors that better serve the national interest. And these efforts often backfire, because the economy and society are not relatively simple systems like a really big hydroelectric dam.

One of the core conclusions you draw is that an engineering-led government is supposed to make more rational decisions. To some degree, I agree with you, but I also don't know if I can trust the Chinese government to always make a rational decision. That kind of uncertainty, isn't that bad for companies?

Yes, I think six years of living in China made me realize that a government could be too efficient.

This idea of being fixated on a specific target and just charging at it at full speed.

That's right. And having lived through the zero-Covid experience, I think something I've realized is that the line between rationality and irrationality is kind of blurry.

Did that experience influence your belief that China should be 50 percent more lawyerly?

It would be good if people had some way to assert themselves against some of these horrible things, like the one-child policy. I don't worry that China will ever become quite like the lawyerly society, and be unable to build almost anything at all. It would be great if China could have some actual procedural safeguards, and for the US to have reasonable costs associated with building infrastructure in reasonable timelines, too.

Framer, a no-code website builder that claims over half a million monthly active users, has reached a $2 billion valuation after raising a $100 million Series D funding round led by existing investors Meritech and Atomico.

This double-unicorn milestone comes at a time of hype for website builders — including direct competitors like Figma, Squarespace, and Wix, as well as rising “vibe coding” platforms such as Cursor and Lovable. 

In 2023, Framer raised a $27 million Series C led by Meritech at an undisclosed valuation.

“With this funding, we're doubling down on enterprise growth and AI, so any company can confidently run their entire website on Framer,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said.

Rather than static landing pages, Framer supports dynamic websites that teams can quickly update — without requiring developer support. More recently, the company has added analytics and enterprise security features, with the goal of helping “companies run their entire .com,” Bok told TechCrunch.

Founded in Amsterdam by Bok and Jorn van Dijk, who had sold their design studio to Facebook in 2011, Framer describes itself as “the website builder loved by designers,” with the promise that websites created with its tools will stand out.

The Dutch company has also been investing more heavily into its enterprise business. Since introducing business plans late last year, Framer reports that businesses have become the majority of its new customers. These include companies like Miro, Perplexity, and Scale AI — as well as 40% of Y Combinator's most recent batch. 

The growing B2B business is already making an impact on the company's bottom line. According to a spokesperson, the company reached $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year, and aims to cross the $100 million threshold next year. “We've been break-even for the past year,” Bok told TechCrunch.

Credit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers' personal information.

In a filing with Maine's attorney general's office on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers' personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations.

TransUnion claimed “no credit information was accessed,” but provided no immediate evidence for its claim. The data breach notice did not specify what specific types of personal data were stolen.

In a separate data breach disclosure filed later on Thursday with Texas' attorney general's office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers' names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

When reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company's data breach, or say what types of customers' personally identifiable information were taken. 

TransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the financial data of more than 260 million Americans. It's the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting the insurance, retail, and transportation and airline industries. 

Several companies, including Google, insurance giant Allianz Life, Cisco, and HR giant Workday, reported data breaches of customer data stored in their Salesforce-hosted cloud databases. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters.

It's not clear who is behind the breach at TransUnion, or if the hackers made any demands to the company.

Updated with a response from TransUnion, and updated with additional details from the Texas state filing.

What happens when your first 10 hires aren't people at all? At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at San Francisco's Moscone West, we're digging into the new wave of startups replacing or augmenting early employees with AI agents. Think outbound sales, billing, and customer support — automated from day one.

This panel, hosted on the Builders Stage, features a mix of technical founders and seasoned operators who are actually doing it, debating where the line between human and machine should be drawn — and how far is too far.

Caleb Peffer, founder and CEO of Firecrawl, is helping over 350,000 developers (and companies like Shopify and Zapier) plug AI directly into the live web. His dev-first platform is already reshaping how AI agents interact with the internet and scale with clean data.

Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, founder and CEO of Artisan, made waves with his “Stop Hiring Humans” campaign — and he's serious. His company raised $35 million to build AI employees, starting with sales. Expect bold insights on replacing go-to-market teams with code.

Sarah Franklin, CEO of Lattice and former Salesforce president and CMO, brings hard-won wisdom on scaling companies with impact. She's built and led real teams at the highest level and knows exactly where AI helps — and where it hurts.

Whether you're already embedding AI into your stack or just testing prompts on your product team, this conversation is about more than hype. It's about getting real on ROI, trust, team dynamics, and what it means to build a business that moves faster than ever with fewer human hands.

This session is just one of hundreds featured across five industry stages, plus breakouts and roundtables. Grab your pass to Disrupt 2025 before prices jump in mid-September. Get your ticket now.

A staggering 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing, according to a recent report published by MIT's NANDA initiative. But rather than giving up on the technology altogether, the most advanced organizations are experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn and be supervised.

That's where Maisa AI comes in. The year-old startup has built its entire approach around the premise that enterprise automation requires accountable AI agents, not opaque black boxes. With a new, $25 million seed round led by European VC firm Creandum, it has now launched Maisa Studio, a model-agnostic self-serve platform that helps users deploy digital workers that can be trained with natural language.

While that might sound familiar — reminiscent of so-called vibe-coding platforms like Cursor and the Creandum-backed Lovable — Maisa argues that its approach is fundamentally different. “Instead of using AI to build the responses, we use AI to build the process that needs to be executed to get to the response — what we call ‘chain-of-work,'” Maisa CEO David Villalón told TechCrunch.

The principal architect behind this process is Maisa's co-founder and chief scientific officer, Manuel Romero, who had previously worked with Villalón at Spanish AI startup Clibrain. In 2024, the duo teamed up to build a solution to hallucinations after seeing firsthand that “you could not rely on AI,” Villalón said.

The pair isn't skeptical about AI, but they think it won't be feasible for humans to review “three months of work done in five minutes.” To address this, Maisa employs a system called HALP (human-augmented LLM processing). This custom method works like students at the blackboard — it asks users about their needs while the digital workers outline each step they will follow.

The startup also developed the Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU), a deterministic system designed to limit hallucinations. While Maisa started out from this technical challenge rather than a use case, it soon found that its bet on trustworthiness and accountability resonated with companies hoping to apply AI to critical tasks. For instance, clients that currently use Maisa in production include a large bank, as well as companies in the car-manufacturing and energy sectors.

By serving these enterprise clients, Maisa hopes to position itself as a more advanced form of robotic process automation (RPA) that unlocks productivity gains without requiring companies to rely on rigid predefined rules or extensive manual programming. To meet their needs, the startup also offers them either deployment in its secure cloud or through on-premise deployment. 

This enterprise-first approach means Maisa's customer base is still very small compared to the millions flocking to freemium vibe-coding platforms. But as these platforms are now exploring how to win enterprise customers, Maisa is moving in the opposite direction with Maisa Studio, which is designed to grow its customer funnel and ease adoption.

The startup also plans to expand with existing customers that have operations in multiple countries. With dual headquarters in Valencia and San Francisco, Maisa already has a foothold in the U.S., as reflected in its cap table; its $5 million pre-seed round last December was led by the San Francisco-based venture firms NFX and Village Global. 

In addition, TechCrunch learned exclusively that U.S. firm Forgepoint Capital International participated in this new round via its European joint venture with Spanish bank Banco Santander, highlighting its appeal for regulated sectors.

Focusing on complex use cases demanding accountability from nontechnical users could be a differentiator for Maisa, whose competitors include CrewAI and many other AI-powered, business-focused workflow automation products. In a LinkedIn post, Villalón highlighted this “AI framework gold rush,” warning that the “quick start” becomes a long nightmare when you need reliability, auditability, or the ability to fix what went wrong.”

Doubling down on its goal to help AI scale, Maisa plans to use its funding to grow from 35 to as many as 65 people by the first quarter of 2026 in order to meet demand. Starting in the last quarter of this year, the startup anticipates rapid growth as it begins serving its waitlist. “We are going to show the market that there is a company that is delivering what has been promised, and that it's working,” Villalón said.

Investors are clamoring to get onto Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable's cap table, making unsolicited offers of investment that value the company at more than $4 billion, reports Financial Times. 

Lovable CEO Anton Osika isn't currently engaging with the flurry of inbound interest, the Times says, which comes a few weeks after the startup announced a $200 million round at a $1.8 billion valuation in a deal led by Accel.

A Lovable spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company isn't fundraising now. 

Lovable has grown quickly over its short lifespan. In July, the startup said its annual recurring revenue had surpassed $100 million with more than 10 million projects built using the platform. 

The astounding trajectory of Europe's hottest unicorn comes just nine months after Lovable launched and comes on the heels of investor interest in vibe-coding startups. Cursor-maker Anysphere raised $900 million in May, more than tripling its valuation to $9 billion.

Foundation models for time series

We are on a mission to create the forecasting foundation model to rule them all. Forecasting drives critical decisions worldwide - impacting staffing, supply chain management, finance and more. Our solution provides companies with the models, platform and APIs they need to easily generate the most accurate forecasts possible, helping to significantly reduce waste and enabling smarter, more confident decisions.

As our founding software engineer, you will have the ability to pick up nearly any part of the stack when needed, from developing our customer-facing APIs, robust data pipelines, or our web application. You'll work closely with our founding data engineer, data scientist and machine learning engineers on challenging (often greenfield) problems.

You are passionate about your craft, maintain high standards, stay current with the latest tech and know when to make trade-offs to deliver results efficiently. We do not believe great engineers are “jack of all trades”, but rather that they excel at diving deep into complex topics quickly, leveraging a broad range of experiences to solve challenging problems. You are also open to exploring new concepts, technologies, and enjoy quickly throwing prototypes together to kick the tires. You prefer quick feedback loops, rather than aiming for perfection on the first try.

Our goal is to provide the most accurate and easy-to-use forecasts to our customers, by leveraging refined information from their own industry. Foundation models for time series are changing this entirely. With the current advances in data processing and model training, we can now pre-train models on diverse temporal data across industries. We provide value to our customers by enabling rapid interaction with our models when provided data and context in natural language, delivering real-time forecasts with accuracy reports. Our customers do not need to be data scientists or have a PhD in Machine Learning to build and ship an accurate forecasting system for their use-cases.

Example use cases include demand forecasting for large furniture chains, predicting sales for a restaurant group and revenue forecasting in the gaming industry.

The founders Geoff and Joachim are both Machine Learning PhDs who have built forecasting and ML systems from scratch at JP Morgan, Amazon, Google, Bloomberg, and Sonos in the US.

We are a global company that happens to be HQed in Paris. Get the best of both worlds — Silicon Valley work ethic and ambition in the center of Paris, right across from the historical Stock Exchange, in the Sentier.

Some individual queries use a small amount of electricity, but AI's energy demand is still a big deal.

Google just announced that a typical query to its Gemini app uses about 0.24 watt-hours of electricity. That's about the same as running a microwave for one second—something that, to me, feels virtually insignificant. I run the microwave for so many more seconds than that on most days.

I was excited to see this report come out, and I welcome more openness from major players in AI about their estimated energy use per query. But I've noticed that some folks are taking this number and using it to conclude that we don't need to worry about AI's energy demand. That's not the right takeaway here. Let's dig into why.

1. This one number doesn't reflect all queries, and it leaves out cases that likely use much more energy.

Google's new report considers only text queries. Previous analysis, including MIT Technology Review's reporting, suggests that generating a photo or video will typically use more electricity.

When I spoke with Jeff Dean, Google's chief scientist, he said the company doesn't currently have plans to do this sort of analysis for images and videos, but that he wouldn't rule it out.

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

The reason the company started with text prompts is that those are something many people out there are using in their daily lives, he says, while image and video generation is something that not as many people are doing. But I'm seeing more AI images and videos all over my social feeds. So there's a whole world of queries not represented here.

Also, this estimate is the median, meaning it's just the number in the middle of the range of queries Google is seeing. Longer questions and responses can push up the energy demand, and so can using a reasoning model.  We don't know anything about how much energy these more complicated queries demand or what the distribution of the range is.

2. We don't know how many queries Gemini is seeing, so we don't know the product's total energy impact.

One of my biggest outstanding questions about Gemini's energy use is the total number of queries the product is seeing every day. 

This number isn't included in Google's report, and the company wouldn't share it with me. And let me be clear: I absolutely pestered them about this, both in a press call they had about the news and in my interview with Dean. In the press call, the company pointed me to a recent earnings report, which includes only figures about monthly active users (450 million, for what it's worth).

“We're not comfortable revealing that for various reasons,” Dean told me on our call. The total number is an abstract measure that changes over time, he says, adding that the company wants users to be thinking about the energy usage per prompt.

But there are people out there all over the world interacting with this technology, not just me—and what we all add up to seems quite relevant.

OpenAI does publicly share its total, sharing recently that it sees 2.5 billion queries to ChatGPT every day. So for the curious, we can use this as an example and take the company's self-reported average energy use per query (0.34 watt-hours) to get a rough idea of the total for all people prompting ChatGPT.

According to my math, over the course of a year, that would add up to over 300 gigawatt-hours—the same as powering nearly 30,000 US homes annually. When you put it that way, it starts to sound like a lot of seconds in microwaves.

3. AI is everywhere, not just in chatbots, and we're often not even conscious of it.

AI is touching our lives even when we're not looking for it. AI summaries appear in web searches, whether you ask for them or not. There are built-in features for email and texting applications that that can draft or summarize messages for you.

Google's estimate is strictly for Gemini apps and wouldn't include many of the other ways that even this one company is using AI. So even if you're trying to think about your own personal energy demand, it's increasingly difficult to tally up. 

To be clear, I don't think people should feel guilty for using tools that they find genuinely helpful. And ultimately, I don't think the most important conversation is about personal responsibility. 

There's a tendency right now to focus on the small numbers, but we need to keep in mind what this is all adding up to. Over two gigawatts of natural gas will need to come online in Louisiana to power a single Meta data center this decade. Google Cloud is spending $25 billion on AI just in the PJM grid on the US East Coast. By 2028, AI could account for 326 terawatt-hours of electricity demand in the US annually, generating over 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

We need more reporting from major players in AI, and Google's recent announcement is one of the most transparent accounts yet. But one small number doesn't negate the ways this technology is affecting communities and changing our power grid.

          Today's quantum computers are fundamentally impractical. But with a
          more resilient qubit, scientists believe they can unlock the
          technology's extraordinary potential. Soon, they hope to prove it.
        


          Quantum computers may one day reshape whole industries and reconfigure
          global supply chains. But as of now, they're fundamentally
          impractical.
        


          Although today's quantum computers, painstakingly designed by
          scientists, are becoming more advanced with each passing year, they
          also remain vast, energy-guzzling behemoths that cost millions of
          dollars to build and—as yet—perform little that supercomputers cannot
          already manage.
        


          And that is in large part because of the inefficiencies of their most
          fundamental building block: the qubit.
        


            A qubit, or quantum bit, plays a similar role in quantum computers
            as
            transitors
            do in a standard computer chip. But, unlike a transistor, qubits can
            calculate at levels no traditional microprocessor could achieve,
            paving the way to a swath of functions not possible in traditional
            computing. The quality of a qubit will determine the speed, error
            rate, and efficacy of a quantum computer to a greater extent than
            any other one of its components.
          


          The challenge is that existing qubits used in quantum computers are
          inherently unstable, explains Michael Eggleston, research group leader
          at Nokia Bell Labs. Any infinitesimal disturbance in their
          environment, known as noise, leaves them destabilized and any
          information they hold destroyed. This renders any complex quantum
          tasks ultimately unworkable.
        


          Even the most advanced qubits—such as superconducting qubits in
          development by both Google and IBM, which leverage superconducting
          materials at extremely low temperatures—have a lifespan measured in
          mere milliseconds.
        


          “The challenge on the engineering side is: how do I design a system
          that doesn't interact with the environment?” says Eggleston. “It's
          arguably impossible because, if it doesn't interact with the
          environment, how can you read or control it? That sets the fundamental
          limit on all existing qubits.”
        


          The only way around this limitation has been to use more and more
          qubits in order to outpace this inherent instability. That is why in
          2023 IBM announced plans to create a 100,000-qubit machine within 10
          years. The idea is that this scale will allow a large fraction of
          qubits to be dedicated to correcting the errors induced by noise.
        


          But with overheads as high as a thousand to one, this still leaves
          planned systems fundamentally flawed.
        


          The industry is currently investing billions of dollars in creating
          the smallest possible practical quantum computer, but even these are
          set to be enormous, says Eggleston. “The problem is they're all based
          on these architectures that don't scale well,” he says. “They'll take
          up giant rooms, requiring whole data centers to operate. The first
          ‘useful' quantum computer will be able to do 1% of the things we want
          it to do. So, how do we go beyond that?""
          




          Source: Compiled by MIT Technology Review Insights, based on data from
          McKinsey, 2025.
          



              For the team at Nokia Bell Labs, the solution lies in better
              qubits rather than bigger machines.
            


            Specifically, rather than information encoded in individual
            elementary particles, the team is focused on qubits that hold this
            same information in the way matter is spatially oriented—what is
            known as a topological qubit.
          


            This alternative approach uses electromagnetic fields to manipulate
            charges around a supercooled electron liquid, triggering the qubits
            to switch between topological states and locking them in place for
            far longer periods of time.
          


            It is inherently more stable as a result, explains Eggleston. “We
            have these electrons, and they're sitting in a plane, in one state.
            If I move them around each other, they're now in a different state.
            But that's really hard to accidentally do, it doesn't happen
            randomly. And so that allows you to build a stable system that you
            can control.”
          


            In fact, while existing qubits have a lifespan of milliseconds, for
            topological qubits this could be several days, he adds. “It's
            incredibly stable. Many, many orders of magnitude more stable.”
          


            Some of the science that underpins the topological qubit dates back
            decades. In 1998 Bell Labs scientists Daniel Tsui and Horst Störmer
            were awarded
            the Nobel Prize in Physics
            for their discovery six years earlier of a counterintuitive physical
            phenomenon, later dubbed the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect.
            FQH refers to how electrons manipulated under strong magnetic fields
            and at very low temperatures can create new states of matter. These
            states are being leveraged nearly 40 years later to form the basis
            of topological qubits.
          


            But in so many other ways, the push toward a topological qubit has
            placed scientists firmly in unknown territory. “The development of
            the technology can be frustrating because nobody's done this
            before,” admits Eggleston. “It's completely open sky. We're often
            ahead of the theorists.”
          


            That's why the Nokia Bell Labs team has often worked collaboratively
            with the competition to advance the field. Much of the early
            research saw them work closely with Microsoft, for example. But
            they're also hoping that 2025 will mark the year that sets their
            research apart.
          


            In the coming months, the team at Nokia Bell Labs hopes to
            demonstrate their ability to control the qubit for the first time,
            intentionally moving it between states to offer enhanced stability
            and resilience against errors.
          


            “That will be a first,” says Eggleston. “Nobody's ever actually
            shown you can control the topological state and switch it on and
            off. And that's what we're wanting to demonstrate this year. That's
            what the scientists in our lab are working on as we speak.”
          


            “Then next year, we'll build on that to show the quantum gating
            operations that you'd need to build a quantum computer,” Eggleston
            adds.
          


              If the Bell Labs team can reach these milestone moments, they will
              move closer toward a fully workable topological qubit that could
              prove transformative for the future of quantum computing.
            


            Although the breakthrough may not shorten the timeline to a
            full-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer, it will demonstrably
            alter the scale and scope of what quantum computers can achieve.
          


            Rather than multi-billion-dollar machines that occupy entire
            buildings to deliver a mere fraction of the potential functionality,
            topological qubits could pave the way for far more efficient
            machines capable of tackling extremely complex optimization tasks
            and simulation problems with billions of variables at both
            microscopic and global levels.
          


            In short, they could unlock the future potential that has made
            quantum computing a topic of scientific fascination for years.
          


            Think about their application in chemistry, points out Eggleston, an
            area in which trial and error materially slows progress. “You have
            chemicals where it's impossible to understand how they bind and
            interface with each other, and so teams synthesize, run tests, and
            see what works and what doesn't,” he explains.
          


            “But when someone designs a bridge, they don't just build a bunch
            and see which one doesn't fall down. Instead we have tools that
            allow you to simulate the mechanics of these giant structures, test
            them, and optimize them before you build anything. That's what I see
            quantum computing being able to offer for the chemistry field,”
            Eggleston adds.
          


            Such a breakthrough could also transform the design and development
            of lifesaving drugs, with quantum computers able to carry out
            molecular modelling for new therapeutic compounds at far greater
            speeds and levels of complexity than current computational methods
            allow.
          


            And quantum systems could enable the simulation of exponentially
            more complex supply chains, crafting intricate digital twins that
            allow organizations to optimize operations. They could allow
            scientists to better predict the course of climate change, or
            develop advanced materials for use in aerospace. The use cases go
            on.
          


            But before all that possibility can be materialized, a qubit that's
            up to the task must come to fruition.

Framer, a Dutch company specializing in tools for automating web design, has secured a $100 million funding round that values the startup at $2 billion.

The investment was led by existing backers Meritech Capital Partners and Atomico, according to a statement released Thursday.

The massive capital infusion positions it to take on its largest rival, Figma, which also uses a community-based model to create websites and design. It went public in 2023 and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this summer and now holds a lofty market cap of $37.68 billion.

No-code websites teach users to create websites and apps without extensive programming knowledge. As the no-code and AI-driven design sector heats up, Framer's rapid valuation jump underscores investor enthusiasm for platforms that simplify web development using generative AI, making it a key player to watch as the industry continues to evolve.

Framer claims a user base of 500,000 active monthly users, most of whom are startups. The company aims to attract larger enterprise clients as it scales. The last funding round in 2023 was a $27 million raise, though the valuation at that time was not disclosed.

“Close to half of the latest Y Combinator batch launched with Framer, alongside global brands like Perplexity, Scale AI, Huel, Miro, Zapier, and Mixpanel,” Framer said in a statement. “Today, hundreds of thousands of sites run on Framer, with more than half a million people using the platform each month.”

Venture capitalists see significant potential in AI-powered tools that enable rapid website creation and design, especially following the September 2023 IPO of Figma, which soared 250% on debut and has become a benchmark for the sector. It has since seen a rollercoaster ride for its share price.

“Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said after Figma's IPO. “Because of this three-year bottleneck, tech IPO investors have been starved for new deals.”

That appetite has only grown. Venture capital firms invested approximately $162.8 billion across various deals in the first six months of 2025, according to data from PitchBook.

Notably, about 30% of this funding was allocated to late-stage startups, reflecting a continued appetite among investors for established companies preparing for or already pursuing IPOs and acquisitions.

Founded in 2014 in Amsterdam by by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk who had previously sold their company, Sofa, to Facebook, Framer initially focused on prototyping tools for website design. Over time, it expanded into web publishing and “no-code” development.

The funding underscores a broader trend among technology investors betting heavily on startups that offer no-code or “vibe coding” features, which rely on generative AI models from providers like OpenAI.

Framer markets itself as a simpler alternative to Figma and Squarespace, offering an integrated platform for web animation, marketing analytics, and publishing.

“We empower designers to publish websites without needing costly developers,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said in the statement today.

Other startups in the space, such as Anysphere, which produces the AI coding assistant Cursor, are reaching hefty valuations on relatively modest revenue. In July, Anysphere announced over $500 million in annualized revenue, valuing the company at nearly $10 billion.

Framer, on the other hand, generated around $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year and projects to double that figure in 2026, driven by growing demand for AI-enhanced design tools.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Nearly Every Whale Shark at This Tourist Destination Bears Human-Made Scars","https://gizmodo.com/whale-sharks-are-getting-brutalized-by-tourists-and-fishers-2000649071","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 04:01:13 GMT","

The world's largest living fish has plenty to fear from people. New research shows that a large proportion of whale sharks at a popular and protected tourism region bear scars caused by human activity.

A large group of marine scientists examined more than a decade's worth of whale shark sightings in the Bird's Head Seascape off Indonesia. Among other things, they found that over half of the sharks had injuries attributable to humans. Many of these injuries were preventable, the researchers say, and simple measures can be taken to ensure the safety of these gentle giants moving forward.

“[The] high percentage of injured whale sharks shows that even in protected zones, the whale shark interactions with fishing gear and tourism still pose risks to them,” study author Edy Setyawan, lead conservation scientist at the Elasmobranch Institute Indonesia, told Gizmodo.

Befitting its nickname, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is certainly hefty.

As adults, they commonly reach lengths between 30 and 40 feet (9 and 12 meters) and usually weigh around 18 tons; some get even larger. Despite their size, though, they're no ferocious sea monster. These slow-moving fish are filter feeders that suck up their meals from the surrounding water. Though they can eat large and small marine organisms alike, they typically stick to microscopic plankton.

Whale sharks can be found in warm and tropical waters all over the world, but their numbers have dwindled dramatically in recent decades, and they're classified as an endangered species. They face several human-made threats, including hunting, climate change, and bycatching (being unintentionally caught by fishing boats). And even with ongoing conservation efforts, their recovery has been slow, partly because it can take up to 30 years for the sharks to reach sexual maturity.

According to Edy Setyawan, previous studies looking at the population health of these sharks have been limited to short-term surveys or snapshots of a single location. In their new research, the team was able to analyze 13 years of sightings along the Bird's Head Seascape (2010 to 2023) from four regions of the area.

The seascape is well known for its diversity and is estimated to contain three-quarters of the world's coral species along with many other migrating species like the whale shark. The seascape is a popular destination for marine tourism and is covered by a network of 26 different Marine Protected Areas.

Though the researchers largely studied past data they themselves collected, they also relied on photos captured by tourism operators and citizen scientists. All told, they identified 268 unique whale sharks. Roughly 200 of these sharks sported visible injuries, they found. And of these, 80% had injuries determined to be human-caused (58.3% had injuries from natural causes, while some sharks had both).

On the positive side, severe injuries, including amputation, caused by humans were relatively rare (17.7%). The most common human-associated injuries were caused by sharks colliding into boats and bagans—floating platforms adorned with nets and lights used for fishing.

The team's findings were published Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Fishing and marine tourism are important parts of the local economy, including whale shark sighting tours. And while the increasing popularity of these tours could lead to more injured sharks, the researchers argue this doesn't have to be inevitable.

They lay out simple steps that can greatly cut down on whale shark injuries, such as stricter regulations that would compel bagan fishers and owners to remove the sharp edges from their platforms. Tourism-related measures, like limiting boat traffic, enforcing slow-speed zones, and promoting responsible diving and snorkeling practices, would further reduce harm, Setyawan said.

Not all the team's findings are dire. They've learned a lot about these majestic aquatic beasts, including the main regions they reside within the seascape. Most of the sharks found there were also young juvenile males, suggesting the area is an important nursery habitat for the species.

They next plan to track the annual population trends of whale sharks living in the seascape via satellite tags, which should also help them answer important questions like whether these populations migrate elsewhere.

It's always inconvenient to have a different charger for each device to travel with. Your computer desires one, your phone another, and all of a sudden your bag is so heavy it's like carrying a brick with frustratingly knotted cables and big blocks. That's why taking along one charger to do it all is such a relief.

Right now, the Ugreen 65W Nexode GaN charger is on sale on Amazon to a mere $25, its lowest price ever in its entire history compared to its usual $43 (40% off). That's a massive saving for something that will be capable of replacing several of your current chargers simultaneously.

See at Amazon

The best part about this charger is rather simple: instead of needing to carry multiple adapters, you simply need to carry this small block. It has a powerful 65W output so it's able to power more demanding devices like a MacBook and charge it to half in 30 minutes. That is a game-changer if you're rushed and only need to top up and go. For everyday phones like an iPhone, Galaxy, or Pixel, fast charging is expected to get you out of the worry mode about running out of battery sooner.

We also love this model because of the port array: With three USB-C ports and one USB-A, you can charge four devices at once without slowing them down. So, imagine charging your laptop, phone, tablet and wireless earbuds all at once and watching them all hike back to 100%. It's handy for anyone who has to work with multiple devices every day.

This Ugreen charger also uses GaN technology: while the term may sound like something out of the tech lab, the benefit is straightforward. GaN miniaturizes chargers to a smaller, more efficient, safer size compared to old-school silicon. It protects the charger from overheating, saves energy wasted, and prevents your devices from exposure to hazardous fluctuations.

Measuring just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches and with a foldable plug, it's easy to throw in a backpack or even a jacket pocket without worrying about carrying yet another bulky gadget. If you've ever struggled to fit multiple chargers into a power strip or crammed ones with awkward shapes into a small carry-on, you'll appreciate how neatly this block fits without hogging space.

This price won't last long, so it makes sense to grab it now while it's at its all-time low.

reMarkable is back, teasing something big (but also maybe small) slated for Sept. 3. In a teaser on YouTube, the company is building hype about the upcoming event with a very brief glimmer of what appears to be a new product. In the teaser, reMarkable includes on-screen text stating that “something is on the move.” I don't claim to be some kind of riddle-solving brain genius, but I am going to go ahead and guess there's a deeper meaning to that statement.

“Something,” in this case, most likely refers to a new tablet, and “on the move” connotes portability, which could mean a tablet that's smaller or lighter, or heck, maybe both! This is deep-level analysis, I know. If that wasn't enough to impress you, maybe this screenshot of what could be reMarkable's next tablet will.

Given the fact that we're seeing what could be a new device from the side in the one and only glimmer of a tablet in this 15-second teaser, I am going to go ahead and use my supernatural powers of deduction and guess that there could also be some kind of announcement on the bezels and/or slimmness of this potential new tablet. If this next tablet isn't e-paper, I will eat my own shorts.

In any event, we shall find out what reMarkable has in store for us very soon. If you're dying to see how potentially portable reMarkable's next e-paper tablet can get, you can tune into its event on Sept. 3 at 8 a.m. ET or 5 a.m. PT if you're freaky like that.

Nvidia and Carbon Robotics' tractor-pulled device is designed to kill large areas of weeds


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia has revealed a surprising partnership with an agricultural robotics company whose flagship product deals out instant laser death to fields full of weeds. The awe-inspiring Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2 packs in 24 high power lasers and 24 Nvidia GPUs to facilitate its claimed “10,000 weeds per minute” zapping performance. That's equivalent to 600,000 weeds per hour, or 167 weeds per second.

Though the claimed performance is amazing, we aren't talking about a compact, home garden-style device here. The flagship LaserWeeder G2 600 is a hulking tractor-pulled device spanning 20 feet. We note there are G2 models smaller than this flagship, but even the smallest G2 200 model is 110 x 85 x 127-inches and requires at least a 110hp tractor with 6,500 lbs lift capacity. The cut down size of the G2 200 reduces performance to 2,500 weeds per minute, which remains impressively rapid and equivalent to nearly 42 weeds per second.

Carbon Robotics is of course very positive about the qualities and performance of an AI and laser-powered weed control system. It highlights the trend of weeds becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides. It touts the sub-millimeter precision and identification accuracy of the Nvidia-accelerated ‘Large Plant Model' weed identification system, which ensures your crops don't fall to friendly fire. The robotics device is also a massive labor saver, outperforming “a hand crew of 75 people,” according to the product pages for the G2 600 model.

Interestingly, Carbon Robotics also aims to address the “global shortage of tractor drivers.” It is an autonomous retrofit for existing tractors, says the Nvidia blog. It can thus work long and ungodly hours. For extra safety, these autonomous tractors are said to be monitored via a remote operations center.

There are some downsides to devices like the G2, though. Such robotic machinery surely comes with a lofty price tag. Including the Nvidia GPUs and laser tech probably makes this tractor-pulled tech much more expensive than traditional farming machinery.

Also, those with experience of using devices which burn weeds will be aware that if a root survives, it sometimes doesn't take very long for it to spring right back up. Lastly, there is some added hazard here, due to the laser technology inadvertently injuring someone's eyes or skin. In arid areas, there may also be concerns about fires propagating from the fields to the surrounding countryside.

Thank you for calling Lockheed Martin, please hold

An accident report has revealed that a U.S. Air Force pilot spent 50 minutes on a conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers ahead of his plane plummeting to the ground and exploding in a fireball. Thankfully, the unnamed pilot ejected safely with just minor injuries, reports CNN, but the $200 million F-35 fighter jet was destroyed.

This incident took place on January 28, near Eielson Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. Investigations point towards the presence of water in hydraulic lines as the root cause of this military jet crash. But the investigator's report also suggests the pilot and engineering team's handling of the landing gear issue could have been better.

Shortly after take-off, the pilot ran into an issue with the F-35. The landing gear wouldn't retract correctly, so he sought to lower it again, but it then became locked at an angle, neither retracted nor correctly lowered… Running through operational check lists didn't remedy the situation.

Sensing the need for assistance, the pilot then decided to consult the experts. He managed to get a group of five Lockheed Martin engineers (the F-35's makers) to participate in a conference call. According to CNN's viewing of the incident report, five engineers were on the call: “a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three specialists in landing gear systems.”

We can't be sure of the advice given, but next in the chain of dramatic events was the pilot attempting two ‘touch and go' landings. During these procedures, the idea was to try and straighten out the landing gear. However, the nose wheel still couldn't be straightened.

Things actually got worse after the two dummy landing attempts. CNN notes that the left and right main landing gears also froze along with the nose wheel.

Now, flying the plane with multiple system errors was bad enough, but the plane then became “uncontrollable” as it started to operate in “automated ground-operation mode.”

Without proper flying mode power or controls, the pilot thus made the decision to eject. The pilot suffered a few minor injuries, but the $200m plane ended up in a fireball.

On inspection of the wreckage, the hydraulic system appears to have mistakenly been partly filled with water (a third of the fluid present). There should have been no water in these lines due to the extremely low temperatures aircraft endure at altitudes. CNN notes that on the day of the flight, the ground temperature was an already chilly -1 degree Fahrenheit (about -17 degrees Celsius).

Another F-35 at the same base was flown 9-days later, and suffered a similar hydraulic icing issue – but it was able to land safely.

Focusing back on the headlining fireball incident, and the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board concluded a mix of “crew decision making” and hydraulic fluid maintenance programs contributed to the crash.

This might seem harsh on the pilot and engineers. However, the engineers reportedly talked about a 2024 maintenance update during the conference call. If they had followed this updated guidance, then “they likely would have advised a planned full stop landing or a controlled ejection instead of a second touch-and-go,” says the report.

 August 28, 2025  

A monthly benefit provided to women with low income during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with improved newborn and early childhood health outcomes, according to a retrospective cohort study from Manitoba, Canada. But as the amount of the stipend remained the same, the positive association decreased over time.

“Manitoba really has a one-of-a-kind program in the Healthy Baby program. It's now been in place for more than 20 years, and we have great longitudinal data on parents and infants who received the benefit,” study author Jennifer Enns, PhD, lead research associate at the University of Manitoba's Manitoba Centre for Health Policy in Winnipeg, told Medscape Medical News. “This study was an opportunity to produce key evidence on a program that my colleagues and I have shown can really make a difference for Manitoba families.”

The article was published on August 14 in JAMA Network Open.

Overall, 9.1% of women in Manitoba live in poverty, according to a 2024 paper. Single-parent families headed by women are at higher risk for poverty (23.9%).

In 2001, Manitoba's government instituted the Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit, which distributed $81.41 per month for 6 months to pregnant women with low income. The program also provided referrals to Public Health Services and resources, a Healthy Baby Community Support program, and a connection to early prenatal care.

The researchers obtained data from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, focusing on singleton pregnancies for which newborn risk data were available. They also obtained administrative data from the Healthy Baby Program.

The study population was divided between 17,970 women who received income assistance and 8301 women who did not. The birth outcomes analyzed included low birth weight, preterm birth, small- and large-for-gestational-age births, and breastfeeding initiation. The researchers also looked at the following childhood development outcomes at kindergarten, as measured by the Early Development Instrument (EDI): physical health and well-being, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive development, and communication skills and general knowledge.

The initial results of this study confirmed those of earlier investigations, showing substantial benefits for birth and development outcomes among the offspring of women who received the benefit. At the start of the study period in 2003, receiving the benefit was associated with increased likelihood of breastfeeding initiation (relative risk [RR], 1.06) and large-for-gestational-age births (RR, 1.13) and a lower likelihood of preterm birth (RR, 0.72), low birth weight (RR, 0.68), and small-for-gestational-age births (RR, 0.83). The benefit also was associated with decreased vulnerability among children at kindergarten age in the domains of language and cognitive development (RR, 0.77) and communication skills and general knowledge (RR, 0.83).

As the program continued, the benefit remained the same; no adjustments for inflation were made. Follow-up data for children born in 2013 found that the association between the benefit and positive outcomes was no longer significant. The RR for developmental vulnerability in language and cognitive development was 1.07, and the RR for developmental vulnerability in communication and general knowledge was 0.93. There were also no further significant differences between groups for any of the other three EDI domains by the end of the study period. 

“Inflation and the declining buying power of $81.41 per month since 2001 are the major drivers of the way that we saw the benefits' effectiveness drop over time,” Enns said. “Some of the ways the benefit likely works are by reducing stress, helping parents eat better, and giving them an opportunity to prepare for the birth of their child, which is what recipients of the benefit told us in this study.”

Inflation calculators estimate that the original benefit from 2001 would need to be around $135 in 2025 to have the same buying power. The province increased the benefit in 2024, based on a sliding scale, with a maximum benefit of $162.82 monthly for women with a net income of $21,744 or less.

Among the study's limitations was its reliance on administrative data. Certain populations, such as First Nations and Métis mothers, may not be reliably represented. “Where administrative data fall short is that they usually depend on people making contact with a system or service for them to appear in our databases,” Enns said. “Sometimes we have to get creative in thinking about who isn't accessing certain health or social services and why. For this study, we had data on everyone who received the Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit, and then we also used income and doctor's visit data to identify people who would have been eligible (that is, they were pregnant and had low income) but did not apply.”

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Jessica Madden, MD, board-certified neonatologist, lactation consultant, and medical director at Aeroflow Breastpumps, said, “This is a well-executed population-level analysis using administrative data and appropriate statistical methods to compare families who did and did not receive the benefit. The design is not randomized, so unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, but the authors' use of propensity scoring and inverse probability weighting makes the findings credible. The long time frame adds value because it shows how the effect of the program shifted over nearly two decades.”

The results were not surprising, but they were important, Madden continued. “We know that financial stability during pregnancy supports healthier birth outcomes, including lower rates of preterm birth and low birth weight. What stood out here was that the benefit's positive impact faded over time as the monthly amount stayed flat. That [finding] reinforces a practical point: Programs need to keep pace with inflation to remain effective.”

The Canadian Institutes for Health Research supported this study. Enns and Madden reported having no relevant financial relationships.

One of the most common grounds for suing a physician for medical malpractice is an alleged omission in the informed consent process. In such cases, it is not unusual to see courts presented with two completely opposing accounts of what happened before a surgery or procedure. On one side are healthcare professionals who assert they provided the patient with all necessary information; on the other are patients who categorically deny this.

When accounts diverge so sharply about what occurred during the consultation, it is easy to assume that one party is being untruthful — and in some cases, they may be. However, evidence suggests that the issue often lies not in deception but in the amount of information patients actually retain after consent discussions.

A 2012 study, The Myth of Informed Consent in Rectal Cancer Surgery What Do Patients Retain?, followed 30 patients scheduled for rectal cancer surgery. Each patient received an average of three interviews in which diagnosis and treatment were discussed with multiple healthcare professionals. They were also given printed materials and web resources for further reference.

The results were striking: 20% of patients remembered specific information about their survival probability, 67% had only a vague sense of their chances, recalling only terms such as “good” or “very good,” and 13% were unaware of any survival probability or potential cure after surgery. Regarding surgical risks, 20% recalled specific risks related to bowel function changes, 57% did not recall any urinary risks, and 47% did not recall any sexual function risks. While the study was small, it reflects a pattern repeatedly observed in similar research: Patients retain only a fraction of the information provided during the informed consent process.

In 2020, a systematic review examined informed consent in neurosurgery. One study included in the review reported that lack of informed consent was cited as the reason for litigation in 42.6% of cases, while another found it was a factor in 24.4% of malpractice claims.

Regarding information recall, research has shown that patients remembered, on average, only five of 32 surgical risks in cranial procedures and four of 25 in spinal surgery. Overall, only 18% of general information was retained, along with just two of the six major procedure-specific risks.

Most literature on the topic reaches a similar conclusion: Patients retain very little of the information provided before a procedure.

While the use of electronic tools, multimedia, and video materials has helped patients retain more information, this is not always the case. Memory lapses can lead patients, in good faith, to claim that they never received information if the expected outcomes are not achieved.

This leads to the most important conclusion on the subject: It is not enough to simply provide information; the informed consent process must also be documented. Documentation allows the information provided to be reviewed and ensures there is a record that the discussion took place during prior consultations.

Even if the patient does not remember, having a written or electronic record showing that information was provided can clarify whether the explanation was actually given. Given that patients often retain only a small portion of what they are told, documenting the informed consent process becomes a priority.

Omissions in informed consent are currently a frequent cause of malpractice claims worldwide. Each country has its own regulations regarding how the process should be carried out and whether a formal document is required.

The key is to view informed consent not as a bureaucratic obstacle or another form to fill out but as a way to respect patient autonomy. When providing information, clinicians must ensure the patient understands it and recognize that, while it can help them make an informed decision, they are very likely to forget it. For everyone's peace of mind, documenting the process is the safest approach.

Acceptance rates to US medical schools slipped among students who aren't White or Asian following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending race-based admissions policies, especially in states without pre-existing bans on affirmative action, according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open. 

While acceptance rates grew from 2019 to 2023 among Whites (40.37% vs 47.47%, P < .001) and Asians (38.26% vs 45.19%, P < .001), they fell among racial groups that are considered underrepresented in medicine (36.06% vs 33.08%, P < .001, all respectively), Yale School of Medicine Professor Sarwat Chaudhry, MD, and colleagues reported. 

The retrospective, cross-sectional analysis echoes a report by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) showing that the numbers of Black and Latino individuals entering medical school in the 2024-2025 academic year dropped by 11.6% and 10.8%, respectively, compared to 2023-2024. 

The researchers used the AAMC data to examine 291,764 applicants to 151 MD programs between 2019 and 2024, focusing on racial/ethnic groups considered to be underrepresented in medicine: Blacks (11.74% of the total), Hispanics (12.24%), and American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (1.57%). Whites made up 53.0% of the sample, and Asians made up 28.8%. (Applicants could identify with more than one group.)

The mean decline among underrepresented groups translates to 503 fewer acceptances in 2024, “raising concerns about the future racial and ethnic diversity of the health care workforce,” the authors write. They also argue that the decline has “significant implications for the future of health care access, especially for patients with the greatest need.”

However, the report also notes that applications by students in underrepresented groups fell by 782 in 2024 compared to the mean from 2019-2023 (11,958 vs 11,176, respectively). 

In June 2023, the Supreme Court struck down the use of race-conscious admissions in higher education, reversing more than four decades of affirmative-action policies. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that universities have “wrongly concluded that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.”

However, Roberts wrote that universities could still consider the role of race in the lives of applicants.

Among acceptances, the representation of underrepresented groups remained about the same vs the mean from 2019-2023 in states with existing affirmative action bans (25.44% in 2019-2023 vs 25.33% in 2024) while shrinking in those without bans (27.04% in 2019-2023 vs 20.89% in 2024, P = .001).

An analysis of 2024 acceptances found that schools had the highest school-level percentage acceptance rates for underrepresented groups in private schools (24.52%) vs in public schools (20.10%). Over time, proposed or existing state legislation against diversity, equity, and inclusion programs was not associated with statistically significant differences in acceptance rates.

The study notes limitations such as its focus on a single year after the court ruling and the possibility that other factors are affecting the numbers. 

Norma Poll-Hunter, PhD, senior director of workforce diversity at the AAMC, told Medscape Medical News that the findings align with historic patterns. 

“We have been here before when we had state-level initiatives that passed in Washington state and California in the mid-nineties, ending affirmative action and admissions,” Poll-Hunter said. “As a result, we did see declines at that time, not only for medical school, but for other schools, including law school and other graduate programs.”

The current landscape differs because of both the Supreme Court ruling and state-level efforts to target diversity programs, she said. 

For now, she said, medical schools are embracing other approaches to boost diversity, such as pipeline programs and partnerships with undergraduate institutions. In admissions, it's also important to understand that factors such as communication skills are important to physician success and not just test scores, she said.

In an accompanying commentary, internist Atul Grover, MD, PhD, of George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington DC, argued that having a diverse medical student body remains crucial. “Decades of analysis have found that female and underrepresented in medicine physicians are more likely to serve underserved communities, and applicants from rural areas are more likely to serve rural populations,” he wrote.

But another physician applauded the move away from diversity policies and questioned the study.

The analysis “fails to address applicant qualifications,” said nephrologist Stanley Goldfarb, MD, chairman of Do No Harm, an organization that claims 30,000 members and is “focused on keeping identity politics out of medical education, research, and clinical practice.”

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Goldfarb cited his organization's new analysis of 23 public medical schools, which found that “accepted Asian and White applicants had, on average, higher MCAT scores than accepted black applicants” at all but one school.

A 2015 study led by a Uniformed Services University team didn't find any link between MCAT scores and clinical-based assessment of performance in medical school, even though “admissions committees use this test to predict future accomplishment.”

Goldfarb disputed diversity's benefit in medical education. “Diversity, in itself, carries no inherent moral value — it is neither intrinsically good nor bad,” he said. “What matters most in medical education is excellence, as it ensures future physicians possess the skills and knowledge to provide exceptional patient care.”

He also questioned whether there are viable alternatives to race-based policies to increase admissions for underrepresented groups. No one has identified a strategy to encourage higher acceptance rates for underrepresented applicants without discrimination, he said.

The study is funded by the American Medical Association and National Institutes of Health. Two authors report support from the NIH. Other authors report relationships with the AMA and University of California, Davis Health. 

Poll-Hunter and Goldfarb have no disclosures.

Fertility-preserving hormonal therapy use for early-stage endometrial cancer increased from 5.2% in 2004 to 13.8% in 2020. Survival with that treatment was comparable to that with hysterectomy in patients younger than 40 years but significantly worse in those aged 40-49 years.

“While overall survival in patients with hormonal therapy is shorter than with hysterectomy, survival for patients younger than 40 years of age is comparable after primary treatment with fertility-preserving hormonal therapy or hysterectomy...However, for patients aged 40 to 49 years, fertility-preserving hormonal therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of death,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Yukio Suzuki, MD, PhD, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. It was published online on August 28 in JAMA Oncology.

According to the authors, pathologic stage was unavailable for 57.2% of patients in the primary hormonal therapy cohort. Additionally, the researchers noted that detailed information about the type of hormonal therapy used, including route of administration, dosage, adherence, and duration of therapy, was lacking. The database also did not capture information about BMI, which is significant as obesity is a major cause of endometrial cancer.

This study was supported by grants from the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Cancer Institute. Suzuki reported no relevant conflicts of interest. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

Binge gaming, defined as playing video games for more than 5 consecutive hours, affected almost one third of student participants in a new study and was associated with increased symptoms of internet gaming disorder (IGD), depression, and anxiety compared to non-binge gaming.

“Binge gaming may act as a behavioral indicator and risk factor for various social, academic, and health problems and preventive effort is warranted. Future interventions should also be gender-specific as our results showed significant gender differences in binge gaming and its correlates,” the investigators wrote.

The study was led by Nick Tse, PhD, HKCT Institute of Higher Education, Hong Kong. It was published online on August 13 in PLoS One.

The study's cross-sectional design prevented the establishment of causal relationships between variables, and the use of a convenience sample in Hong Kong limited the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the measurement of binge gaming relied on a single self-reported question.

The study was funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund and General Research Fund. The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In a cohort of 104 patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), 44% experienced recurrence in subsequent pregnancies, with peak total bile acid levels > 40 μM/L in the index pregnancy significantly associated with recurrence risk. A shorter interpregnancy interval was linked to lower recurrence risk, while Hispanic patients showed higher recurrence rates.

“These findings contribute to the literature on the risk of ICP recurrence in a modern, racially diverse cohort and highlight elevated TBA [total bile acid] level as a predictor of recurrence,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Henri M. Rosenberg, MD, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It was published online in Obstetrics & Gynecology.

The retrospective design and absence of data on family history of ICP or ICP genetic testing limited the study's scope. The researchers noted underrepresentation of non-Hispanic White, Black, and Asian patients in the study population, affecting generalizability. The small sample size prevented multivariable modeling with adjustment for confounders, and the authors cautioned that the wide CIs suggest additional studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.

A landmark UK Biobank study reveals that not all additives are equal: while sugars, sweeteners, and flavorings drive higher mortality, gelling agents may offer protection, reshaping how we view the risks of ultra-processed foods.



Study: Association of 37 markers of ultra-processing with all-cause mortality: a prospective cohort study in the UK Biobank. Image Credit: photka / Shutterstock

In a recent article in the journal eClinicalMedicine, researchers in Germany investigated whether specific markers of ultra-processing (MUPs) are associated with mortality, beyond the established links between ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and poor health.

Their findings indicate that certain types of sugar, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavor enhancers, and flavors were associated with a higher risk of mortality, as was overall UPF intake.

Flavour additives dominated UK supermarket foods, appearing in 13.6% of total food intake on average, more than any other MUP category analyzed in the study.

UPFs are highly industrially processed items that are typically rich in fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients such as fiber, protein, and vitamins. These foods are marketed aggressively and valued for their convenience, often replacing healthier dietary options.

The consumption of UPFs has been rising globally, with countries such as the UK and the USA deriving more than 50% of their total energy intake from them, compared with around 10% in Italy.

This trend is concerning, as UPFs have consistently been associated with obesity, weight gain, and numerous negative health outcomes. Consequently, several national dietary guidelines recommend limiting UPF intake.

Food processing is commonly classified using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods into four groups. UPFs fall under NOVA group 4 and can be identified through MUPs. These include cosmetic additives such as sweeteners, flavors, and colors, as well as non-culinary ingredients like modified oils or fructose.

A food is classified as UPF if it contains at least one MUP. Although UPFs have been strongly linked to mortality, no studies have directly examined whether specific MUPs contribute equally to these risks. This knowledge gap is critical, as certain additives may lead to negative health outcomes, while others may not.

Assessing portion sizes required creative solutions: When packaging data was unavailable, researchers turned to the UK Food Standards Agency's standard portion guides to estimate grams consumed.

Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study of over 500,000 adults recruited between 2006 and 2010.

For this study, 186,744 participants aged 40–75 years were included after applying exclusions for missing information, implausible dietary reports, and pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes or malabsorption disorders. Dietary intake was assessed using up to five 24-hour web-based food recalls completed per participant.

To estimate UPF and MUP consumption, researchers matched each food item reported to up to ten commercial products from UK supermarkets. Ingredient lists were analyzed for 57 possible MUPs grouped into nine categories, with 37 of these found in at least one product. For each food item, a Marker Likelihood Index (MLI) was calculated based on the proportion of commercial products containing a specific MUP.

The proportion of intake from UPFs or specific MUPs for each participant was calculated relative to total food intake (expressed as a percentage of total food intake, %TFI).

Mortality data were obtained from national health registries, with follow-up until December 2022 (mean follow-up 11.0 years).

Statistical analyses used Cox proportional hazard regression models with penalized cubic splines to examine associations between MUP intake and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, alcohol intake, BMI, ethnicity, health status, education, psychiatric history, income, physical activity, blood pressure, sex, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings.

Even cumulative exposure to multiple MUPs mattered: Total intake across all markers showed a significant link to higher mortality risk, beyond individual MUP effects.

The participants were 58 years old on average, and 57% were female; UPF intake accounted for an average of 20.0% of their total food intake. Over 11 years of follow-up, 10,203 deaths occurred. Higher UPF consumption was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk (HR-nadir) at 18% TFI and risk rising beyond that intake level.

When examining specific MUPs, five categories – flavour, flavour enhancers, colouring agents, sweeteners, and varieties of sugar – showed strong positive associations with mortality risk at specific intake levels:

In contrast, no associations were observed for processing aids, modified oils, protein sources, or fibre.

At the individual level, 13 specific MUPs were significantly related to mortality. These included glutamate and ribonucleotides (flavor enhancers); acesulfame, saccharin, and sucralose (sweeteners); caking agents, firming agents, thickeners (processing aids); and fructose, inverted sugar, lactose, and maltodextrin (sugars). Notably, gelling agents (processing aids) showed an inverse association with mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results, especially for UPF, flavour, coloring agents, and sweeteners.

Results held firm after excluding early deaths: Sensitivity analyses removed participants who died within 2 years of dietary assessment, reducing concerns about reverse causation.

This exploratory study is the first to assess broad categories and specific MUPs in relation to mortality, showing associations between higher mortality risk and both overall UPF intake as well as several MUPs (flavors, flavor enhancers, coloring agents, sweeteners, and sugars).

The findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence linking these additives to weight gain, metabolic disruption, and alterations in gut microbiota. The inverse association for gelling agents (possibly due to pectin content) highlights significant variation in health effects across additives.

Strengths include the large cohort size, extended follow-up, and novel MUP-based classification using commercial product analysis, which enhances objectivity compared with predefined UPF food lists. However, as an exploratory analysis, limitations include reliance on self-reported dietary data, potential residual confounding, limited power for rarer MUPs, and the ‘healthy volunteer' bias of the UK Biobank.

These results highlight specific MUPs, such as flavorings, colorings, sweeteners, certain processing aids (e.g., thickeners), and sugars, as potential drivers of UPF-related health risks. Replication and exploration of mechanisms in future research are needed.

A novel, multi-analyte test developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Ludwig Center and the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurosurgery can accurately identify brain cancers using small samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a promising new tool to guide clinical decision-making. 

The findings, supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, were published Aug. 25 in Cancer Discovery and demonstrate that combining multiple biological markers, including tumor-derived DNA and immune cell signatures, is more effective for diagnosing central nervous system cancers than using any one marker alone. 

""This study highlights how much more information we can gain when we evaluate several analytes together,"" says senior study author Chetan Bettegowda, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Cushing Professor and Director of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, director of the Reza Khatib Brain Tumor Research Center at Johns Hopkins, medical director of the Ludwig Center, and a senior author on the study. ""The ability to detect cancers with high specificity and also gain insight into the immune environment of the brain could be an important advance in the care of patients with brain tumors."" 

To evaluate the potential of a multi-analyte approach, investigators analyzed 206 CSF samples, including samples from patients with high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, metastases and central nervous system lymphomas. Their test, called CSF-BAM (cerebrospinal fluid–B/T cell receptor, aneuploidy and mutation), measured chromosomal abnormalities, tumor-specific mutations, and T and B cell receptor sequences. In combination, these markers identified brain cancers with more than 80% sensitivity (ability to detect cancer) and 100% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer-free) in the validation cohort. The 100% specificity means no false positives were recorded among individuals with noncancerous conditions. 

The study also showed that the assay could distinguish between the immune cell populations present in cancer and noncancer cases, offering additional biological context that could be helpful in more-challenging clinical scenarios. Investigators say this ability to categorize T and B cell populations in the CSF provides insights into both disease presence and immune response. 

Many patients with brain lesions face invasive diagnostic procedures to confirm a cancer diagnosis. A tool like this could help us make better-informed decisions about who really needs a biopsy and who doesn't.""

Christopher Douville, M.D., assistant professor of oncology and senior study author

Researchers say the test could be particularly useful for cases in which conventional imaging or cytology is inconclusive, or in situations when obtaining tissue for diagnosis is risky or not possible. The multi-analyte approach, they say, enables clinicians to better detect cancer and better understand the disease status, supporting a more tailored approach to patient care.

Despite advances in insulin therapy and automated delivery systems, people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) still face a daily struggle: manually dosing insulin before meals. Current insulin options - rapid-acting or ultra-rapid analogs - are too slow to match the body's natural insulin response, making full automation elusive.

A new research project at Wayne State University, supported by a $300,000 grant from Breakthrough T1D International, aims to change that. Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, is developing a next-generation ultra-rapid insulin designed to dramatically accelerate insulin action and remove the need for user input at mealtime.

Our goal is to create an insulin that acts fast enough to truly mimic the human pancreas. When combined with advanced insulin delivery algorithms, this could make fully automated systems a reality and help patients manage their condition with fewer interruptions to daily life.""

Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, Wayne State University

By addressing the limitations of current insulin analogs in terms of speed, onset and duration, the project has the potential to significantly improve glycemic control and reduce the burden of disease management for people with T1D.

Since joining Wayne State in 2013, Cao has received more than $6 million in external funding for diabetes-related research, including multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health and Breakthrough T1D.

Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State, praised the project's potential and the university's role in advancing human health through translational research.

""Type 1 diabetes affects millions of individuals and families, often beginning in childhood,"" said Obasi. ""Dr. Cao's research is critical in helping to move us closer to an improved treatment that will bring new hope to those living with the disease. This funding underscores the importance of sustained investment in research to impact lives now and in the future.""

Dr. Ali Abolmaali, dean of the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, said Cao's work exemplifies the college's commitment to solving real-world health challenges.

""This project is a testament to how engineering research can directly improve lives,"" said Abolmaali. ""We're proud to support faculty like Dr. Cao, whose work bridges science, medicine and technology to serve the public good.""

Breakthrough T1D International is a leading global funder of T1D research, supporting projects that accelerate the development of treatments and technologies to improve the lives of people affected by the disease.

Food allergies affect more than half a billion people worldwide. In severe cases, even a small bite of the wrong food can trigger anaphylaxis - a rapid, body-wide allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, a dangerous drop in blood pressure and even death.

Scientists have long understood how injected allergens - like those in lab tests or insect stings - trigger anaphylaxis. But researchers have puzzled over how anaphylaxis begins in the gut after eating a food allergen.

Now, Arizona State University researchers, in collaboration with a team led by Yale University and other partners, have pinpointed a surprising culprit: specialized immune cells in the intestine that produce powerful chemical messengers.

These chemical messengers can cause muscles in the airways and gut to contract, increase mucus production and boost inflammation. They're already known to play a role in asthma attacks. This study shows they are also key drivers of severe food allergy reactions that start in the gut.

The findings, published in the current issue of Science, reveal that reactions to allergens in the gut are fundamentally different from reactions to allergens entering the bloodstream directly.

Until now, we assumed that anaphylaxis followed the same pathway regardless of where allergens entered the body, with histamine from mast cells as the main driver. Our study shows that when allergens are ingested, a specialized set of mast cells in the gut don't release histamine - instead, they produce lipid-based molecules called leukotrienes. These molecules, rather than histamine, trigger anaphylaxis in the gastrointestinal tract.""

Esther Borges Florsheim, ASU researcher 

Florsheim is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes and assistant professor with the School of Life Sciences at ASU. 

In both food and systemic allergies, immune cells called mast cells play a central role. When these cells detect an allergen via antibodies called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, they burst open, releasing chemicals that cause swelling, low blood pressure and other symptoms.

In the bloodstream, the most important of these chemicals is histamine, which is why antihistamines can help in some allergic situations. However, the new research shows that when an allergen is ingested, mast cells in the intestinal lining respond differently. They make relatively little histamine. Instead, they ramp up production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of inflammatory lipids already known to constrict airways in conditions like asthma.

In the gut lining, intestinal mast cells take cues from nearby epithelial cells. These cues shift the cells' activity, so they make more leukotrienes and less histamine. Detailed genetic and chemical analyses showed that intestinal mast cells come in several subtypes. Compared to mast cells elsewhere in the body, mast cells in the gut were primed to make leukotrienes.

Previous research found that blocking the IgE pathway - either by removing IgE antibodies or the receptor they bind to on mast cells - protected against developing severe symptoms. 

To test whether leukotrienes were truly driving the reaction, the team used zileuton, an FDA-approved drug used to treat asthma, which blocks a crucial enzyme needed to make leukotrienes. 

The results showed the drug reduced allergy symptoms and provided protection from a dangerous drop in body temperature - a hallmark of anaphylaxis.

Importantly, the same drug did not prevent reactions caused by allergens injected into the bloodstream. That finding showed that the gut pathway is different from the whole-body allergic pathway and has its own chemical drivers.

Current emergency treatments for severe allergic reactions, such as epinephrine, are aimed at quickly reversing symptoms once anaphylaxis starts. Antihistamines can help in mild reactions, but they are far less effective for preventing severe events - especially those triggered by food.

The new findings suggest that targeting leukotrienes could offer a new preventive or therapeutic approach for food-triggered anaphylaxis. 

More research is still needed to test whether the results from this study can be applied to humans. However, drugs that block leukotriene production (like zileuton) or leukotriene receptors (such as montelukast, also commonly used for asthma) are already approved for other uses, which could speed up testing for food allergy applications.

Beyond the potential clinical applications, the work changes how scientists think about allergic reactions. It shows that how an allergen gets into the body - through the skin, bloodstream or gut - can shape the type of immune response involved.

""This finding highlights the gut as unique in how it senses allergens and potentially other harmful environmental challenges, such as food additives,"" Florsheim says. ""It also helps explain a long-standing puzzle: why levels of food-specific antibodies, especially IgE, do not reliably predict the risk of food allergy.""

The researchers plan to follow up by studying whether similar mast cell populations and leukotriene-driven pathways exist in human intestines, and whether blocking them can reduce or prevent severe reactions in people with life-threatening food allergies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. A key reason for its high death toll is that it often goes undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Although modern colonoscopy has greatly improved the early detection of precancerous lesions, determining which ones are likely to become cancerous remains a challenge-especially during the procedure itself. A new study published in Biophotonics Discovery may offer a promising solution.

A team led by researchers at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal tested an advanced imaging method that uses the natural glow (or autofluorescence) of tissues when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Importantly, this approach doesn't require any dyes or contrast agents. By analyzing how long this autofluorescence lasts-called ""fluorescence lifetime""-the researchers could detect subtle differences in the tissue's biochemistry. Combined with machine learning, this label-free method could distinguish benign from malignant lesions in real time.

The researchers collected fresh tissue samples from 117 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. They scanned each specimen using a fiber-optic probe and a dual-laser autofluorescence lifetime system, which illuminated the tissue at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 445 nm) to excite various molecules like collagen and cellular coenzymes. This setup captured data from multiple optical channels, tracking how each type of tissue responded to the light over time. These measurements were then matched to pathology diagnoses to serve as training data for an AI-based classification model.

Using an ensemble learning technique known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), the model was trained to recognize patterns in the spectroscopic data that correspond to benign or cancerous tissue. On the training set, the model achieved 87 percent accuracy, with a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 83 percent and a specificity (true negative rate) of 90 percent. When tested on a separate set of new samples, the model performed almost as well, with 85 percent accuracy, 85 percent sensitivity, and 85 percent specificity.

In practical terms, this means the system was able to identify cancerous tissues with high reliability based only on their autofluorescence signatures. Even when applied to individual measurement points-rather than larger tissue regions-the model generated useful probability maps that highlighted tumor areas. These findings suggest that the technology could one day guide doctors during colonoscopy or surgery, helping them decide which lesions to remove and where to focus their attention.

The study also investigated whether the complex imaging system could be simplified without sacrificing accuracy. The results showed that using a reduced set of optical channels-focusing on the most informative biochemical signals-still produced strong performance, potentially lowering the cost and complexity of future clinical devices.

Although more work is needed to improve accuracy, especially for early or borderline lesions, and to expand testing to larger and more diverse patient groups, this research marks an important step toward integrating real-time, AI-guided optical diagnostics into routine colorectal cancer care. It could eventually help reduce unnecessary biopsies, shorten procedures, and ensure that dangerous lesions aren't missed.

Once driven by dramatic drops in early-life mortality, life expectancy gains are now losing momentum, signaling that today's generations may never match the near-linear longevity climb of the past.



Study: Cohort mortality forecasts indicate signs of deceleration in life expectancy gains. Image Credit: Hyejin Kang  / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, INED, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison estimated cohort life expectancy for birth cohorts from 1939 to 2000 across 23 high-income countries, using multiple forecasting methods, and assessed whether gains are decelerating.

While earlier cohorts saw steady gains despite world wars and pandemics, forecasts suggest the 1939-2000 birth groups won't maintain that same resilience – a notable shift from historical patterns highlighted in the research.

Every year of extra life shapes budgets, pensions, and family plans, yet recent headlines warn that progress may be slowing. For a century, high-income countries saw near-linear gains as vaccines, sanitation, and cardiac care reduced early and midlife deaths.

Period life expectancy summarizes mortality in a calendar year, but cohort life expectancy tracks real birth cohorts and better reflects lived longevity. Longevity also depends on economic stability, behavior, inequality, and emerging risks, including pandemics and public health crises.

Policy and planning hinge on knowing whether longevity gains are compounding, flattening, or shifting by age; further research is essential.

The analysis used age-specific death rates from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) for 23 high-income, low-mortality countries. Birth cohorts from 1939 to 2000 were included at age 20 and above, to ensure substantial observation.

Cohort mortality was forecasted to age 100+ for accuracy, and life tables were then closed at 85+. Two modeling strategies were applied. Period-based forecasts approximated cohort mortality by extracting the Lexis diagonal and included Lee-Carter (LC), Smooth Constrained Mortality Forecasting CP-Splines (CPS), Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa), and the United Nations World Population Prospects 2024 (UN WPP 2024) medium scenario. Cohort-specific models directly captured cohort trends using the Linear Lee-Carter (LLC) and Cohort Segmented Transformation Age-at-death Distributions (C-STAD) methods.

Uncertainty was quantified with 95% bootstrapped Prediction Intervals (PIs). For interpretation, a “best-practice” series (representing the highest cohort life expectancy) and a median were summarized. An age-decomposition using Arriaga's method apportioned cohort life expectancy changes into contributions from ages 0–5, 5–20, 20–40, 40–60, and 60–85+, with Switzerland used as a reference to limit cross-country variation. Accuracy checks compared forecast bias by predicting outcomes for cohorts born between 1919 and 1938 and contrasting those forecasts with observed values.

The gap between best-practice countries and the median actually widened in the forecasts, indicating the slowdown isn't happening uniformly across all high-income nations.

Across all six forecasting methods, gains in cohort life expectancy decelerated relative to the near-linear pace observed for cohorts born between 1900 and 1938. Under a linear extrapolation of those earlier gains, best-practice life expectancy would increase by about 0.46 years per cohort and reach 100 years by the 1980 birth cohort.

In contrast, forecasted best-practice gains ranged from 0.22 years per cohort with LLC to 0.29 years per cohort with CPS, with the UN WPP 2024 at 0.23. For the median across countries, gains ranged from about 0.20 to 0.27 years per cohort. This corresponds to percentage reductions compared to the optimistic trend of approximately 37%–52% for best-practice and 44%–58% for the median.

None of the cohorts born from 1939 to 2000 is projected to achieve a cohort life expectancy of 100 years.



Cohort life expectancy, observed and forecasted. Observed values and forecasted values are separated by the vertical dashed line (black) in 1938. Best-practice (red), median (blue), country-specific (gray), linear extrapolation of best-practice 1900–1938 (pink). 

Across methods, the optimistic linear projection exceeded the upper bound of the 95% PI, reinforcing the slowdown signal, findings held in sensitivity analyses. Accuracy analyses indicated that any downward bias for earlier cohorts cannot fully explain these results.

Forecasts produced for cohorts born between 1919 and 1938 were compared with observed cohort outcomes. For CPS, the absolute mean deviation averaged approximately 0.36 years, compared to a later gap of roughly 2.75 years; for LC, 2.37 years versus 3.01 years.

This slower improvement pattern at young ages had already emerged clearly in cohorts born before 1939, suggesting the deceleration isn't a sudden new phenomenon predicted solely by models.

Across methods, the observed forecast bias accounted for only a fraction of the divergence from the optimistic scenario, supporting a real deceleration rather than an artifact of underestimation.

Age decomposition pinpointed where momentum was lost. More than half of the reduction in the pace of improvement stemmed from slower gains among children aged 0–5, and over two-thirds from those under 20. These ages are fully observed for the cohorts under study, indicating that the slowdown reflects mortality trends that have already occurred rather than speculative forecasts.

Gains at older ages persisted but were not large enough to offset early-life deceleration. In a stress test that doubled future mortality improvements relative to CPS forecasts, the average improvement for currently living cohorts rose from roughly 0.20 to 0.32 years per cohort, still well below the 0.46 years per cohort observed for earlier cohorts.

Country patterns, examined through best-practice and median series, suggested that the results were not driven by a single outlier. Forecast trajectories largely continued smooth historical trends without structural breaks, and conclusions were consistent across period-based (LC, CPS, CoDa, UN WPP 2024) and cohort-specific (LLC, C-STAD) approaches.

Currently living cohorts in high-income countries are projected to experience a slower increase in longevity compared to earlier cohorts. The deceleration stems chiefly from diminished improvements at very young ages, with later-life progress too small to restore the previous pace.

These findings do not establish a hard biological limit, but instead underscore the combined effects of social, economic, behavioral, and medical determinants. Importantly, the authors note that these forecasts apply specifically to the 1939–2000 birth cohorts studied, and conclusions should not be generalized beyond this range.

Policies that reduce midlife risks and accelerate the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases may raise cohort life expectancy, yet are unlikely to recreate the historical, near-linear climb for these cohorts. Planning for pensions, health systems, and inequality must reflect this slower trajectory.

Research conducted by Radboud university medical center, in collaboration with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and Erasmus MC, reveals that the backpack helps individuals with ataxia stand and walk more steadily, reducing their reliance on mobility aids like walkers.

Ataxia is a neurological condition in which the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for coordination, functions improperly. This leads to issues with balance and coordination, increasing the risk of falls.

Some people with ataxia, often young individuals, depend on a walker. These devices can be heavy and cumbersome, and many patients find them stigmatizing.""

Dr. Jorik Nonnekes, rehabilitation specialist and lead researcher at Radboudumc

The backpack, known as the Gyropack, uses gyroscopic technology similar to that used in space stations or large satellites to maintain orientation in space. The backpack has been in development in Vallery's group at TU Delft and Erasmus MC for over a decade. 'When I learned about it, I immediately saw its potential for helping people with ataxia,' says Nonnekes. Working closely with the TU Delft team, the backpack was optimized for medical use. It contains spinning wheels that generate resistance to rotations of the wearer's torso, resulting in improved posture and balance.

The study involved fourteen patients with moderate to advanced ataxia. Participants performed balance and walking exercises under three conditions: without the backpack, with the backpack fully operational, and with the gyroscopes rotating but not generating any useful effect. The last condition was a sham condition that was indistinguishable in sound and vibrations from active support. Even without active gyroscopes, the backpack provided noticeable benefits-likely due to its current weight of around six kilograms, which helps stabilize the upper body. However, the most significant improvements were observed when the gyroscopes were active. 'Patients were visibly more stable and could, for example, walk in a straight line much more effectively,' Nonnekes notes.

The research team aims to further develop the backpack, focusing on user-friendliness. Ideally, the device will become lighter and quieter. 'It's not yet suitable for everyday use,' says Nonnekes, 'but in the future, it could help people with ataxia participate more freely in daily life, like attending social events without needing a walker, which many find bulky and inconvenient. This could greatly enhance their mobility and overall quality of life.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Online cognitive behavioral therapy shows promise for treating bulimia nervosa","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250827/Online-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-shows-promise-for-treating-bulimia-nervosa.aspx","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 02:58:00 GMT","

Bulimia nervosa (BN), or bulimia, is a mental health disorder characterized by binge eating and a fear of gaining weight, which drives people to try and avoid weight gain, usually by compensatory (vomiting etc.). Over time, this binge–purge cycle harms both physical and mental health of the individual, leading to problems like dehydration, low blood pressure, depression, and even self-harm. BN mostly affects young women and often begins in their teenage years, with studies showing that up to three percent of women may experience BN at some point in their lives, putting them at higher risk if left untreated.

BN is thought to develop from harmful learned habits that can be changed with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This approach helps people break the binge–purge cycle by challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to dieting and body weight. However, for many people, especially those living far away from specialist clinics, accessing face-to-face therapy is not always easy or even possible.

Now, in the first study of its kind conducted in Asia, an international team of researchers have shown that CBT can also be effective when delivered online. Their findings suggest that guided internet-based CBT (ICBT) can help people who otherwise struggle to get specialist care.

The study was conducted by Dr. Sayo Hamatani from the Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Japan, and included several co-authors, such as Dr. Kazuki Matsumoto from Kagoshima University, Japan; Dr. Gerhard Andersson from Linköping University in Sweden; and Dr. Yoshifumi Mizuno from the University of Fukui, along with researchers from Tohoku University Hospital, Chiba University, Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, and Tokushima University. The results were published online in Volume 8 of the journal JAMA Network Open on August 05, 2025.

""We undertook this study to lower barriers to accessing specialist care and help create a society where people can receive high-quality treatment regardless of where they live. By establishing a specialist online therapy that can be delivered at home, even patients in remote areas or with busy schedules will find it easier to continue treatment, supporting early intervention and preventing progression to more severe forms,"" explains Dr. Hamatani as she speaks of the motivation behind the study.

The researchers assessed the efficacy of guided ICBT by comparing it to that of usual care. To this end, they recruited 61 women between the age of 13–65 years (average age: 28 years), who were randomly assigned either to an intervention group that received guided ICBT or to a control group that continued with usual care. The program lasted 12 weeks, during which participants in the ICBT group worked through weekly online modules adapted for Japanese patients and received support from a therapist through an online platform. The program included strategies to help people resist urges to binge and purge, such as exercises to face triggers in a safe way and activities to help reshape negative views about their own bodies.

When the researchers compared the results at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention, they found that women in the ICBT group showed significantly reduced binge eating and compensatory behaviors compared to those in the usual care group, with an average decrease of about 10 episodes in total. The percentage of women whose symptoms improved enough to be considered in remission, rose from just 13% with usual care to up to 55% with ICBT. Participants also reported feeling more satisfied with the online program, with more than 75% stating they would return to this treatment program if they needed help again.

These findings strongly make the case for continued support as essential for treating BN and preventing the condition from becoming more severe. Making CBT available online could very well be a game-changer for people who cannot easily access a clinic. ""With insurance support and integration into healthcare systems, this approach could reach many more people and play a key role in treating BN,"" highlights Dr. Hamatani.

Developing a system based on this study could potentially lead to high-quality care, promoting equitable mental healthcare and improving the overall quality-of-life among patients with BN.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition with significant health implications worldwide. In Nigeria, data on its prevalence and characteristics are limited, highlighting the need for comprehensive studies to better understand its epidemiology and clinical features in the region. This study aimed to assess the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and management challenges of IBD among patients undergoing colonoscopy in Nigeria.

Over five years (2019–2024), a multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted involving clinicians across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. It included a retrospective review of records from 18 centers. Data collection was conducted in two phases via Google Forms, focusing on care practices and detailed case information, including demographics, clinical features, histology, and treatment. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and tests for associations, with significance set at p < 0.05.

A total of 459 suspected IBD cases (9.7%) were identified among over 4,700 colonoscopies, with histological confirmation in 208 cases (4.4%), indicating the prevalence of IBD in the Nigerian patient population. The most common subtype was ulcerative colitis (53.9%), followed by Crohn's disease (21.0%) and indeterminate colitis (25.0%). Regional variations were observed, with higher diagnosis rates in some zones (North-West: 14.9%; South-East: 1.4%). The predominant clinical feature was rectal bleeding. Endoscopic findings frequently showed pan-colitis (62%), with significant regional differences (p < 0.001), and management mainly involved medications such as acetylsalicylic acid derivatives (60.0%), with surgical options rarely employed (0.6%). Challenges included high medication costs and limited availability, which affected nearly half of the patients (49.4%; 46.2%).

The findings of this multicenter survey illuminate the pressing issues surrounding IBD in Nigeria, drawing attention to its prevalence, complex clinical presentations, and significant management challenges. The data reveal critical similarities and differences compared to findings in West Africa, other regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The lower prevalence in Nigeria and other African studies reflects unique genetic and environmental factors influencing IBD development. Demographic trends indicate a younger population affected by IBD in Nigeria, consistent with regional observations. However, disparities in clinical presentations, treatment modalities, and barriers to care highlight broader challenges within the Nigerian healthcare system that warrant urgent attention.

From ""no added sugar"" to ""organic goodness,"" infant and toddler foods in New Zealand are overloaded with promotional claims, many of which may mislead parents and blur the line between marketing and nutrition.



Study: Cluttered with claims: Composition, nutrition, health and marketing claims on commercial infant and toddler foods in New Zealand. Image Credit: banjongseal324SS / Shutterstock

Products averaged 7.5 distinct claims each, ranging wildly from just 3 claims up to a cluttered 15 claims per package.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition & Dietetics, researchers found that all commercial toddler and infant food products in New Zealand had multiple on-pack claims.

Nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life can influence health and well-being. Early life is a period of rapid growth and could shape healthy eating patterns. Therefore, optimal nutrition in early childhood is central to healthy growth, development, and well-being. The Nutrient and Promotion Profile Model (NPPM) of the World Health Organization provides a framework for developing effective policy and legal measures to ensure the sale of appropriate toddler and infant foods.

NPPM recommends that commercial toddler and infant foods not carry nutrition, health, composition, or marketing claims. The paper highlights a key regulatory gap, as the current Australia-New Zealand Food Standards Code does not address marketing claims (such as those related to taste or convenience). Infant and toddler food labeling has been identified as an area of concern by the Food Regulation Standing Committee (FRSC) of New Zealand and Australia, as caregivers struggle to determine which foods align with the Healthy Eating Guidelines for New Zealand Babies and Toddlers.

""Free from"" claims for artificial flavors and colors topped the list, appearing on 72% and 71% of products respectively, even more than ""no added sugar"" (53%).

The present study aimed to identify on-pack claims on commercial toddler and infant foods in New Zealand. First, all relevant toddler and infant food products were identified through the Nutritrack database. Data were annually collected from four major supermarket chains in New Zealand. Images of foods and beverages were taken, and data from the photos were entered into a database. To account for products new to the market since the last data collection, this was supplemented by an online supermarket search in January 2024, which identified 21 additional products. Products were classified into 59 categories and 15 food groups.

The study used products categorized as baby foods, which included products indicated on-pack as intended for toddlers and infants. Additionally, the food groups of dairy and snack foods were examined to identify other foods suitable for toddlers and infants. Infant products were defined as those intended for ages < 12 months. Toddler products were those designed for ages 12 to <36 months. Infant formulas, toddler milks, and follow-on formulas were excluded from the analysis.

The identified products were stratified into 14 food categories or subcategories based on the NPPM. The presence/absence of nutrition, composition, marketing, and health claims was identified. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the frequency of claims by food category and overall. The frequency of products with imagery of fruits or vegetables was also examined.

Snacks and finger foods displaying vegetable images often relied on powdered forms, contributing to their low average vegetable content of just 11.4%.

The researchers identified 210 toddler and infant food products. These included 43 toddler products and 167 infant products. Most products (35%) were vegetable and fruit purees, followed by snacks and finger foods (28%), and savory meals (24%). On average, each product had 7.5 unique claims. All products carried a marketing claim, 19% featured a health claim, and 99% had a nutrition or composition claim.

Nutrition and composition claims were the most common, with an average of four claims per product, followed by marketing claims (3.3 claims) and health claims (0.2 claims). Further, “free from” claims, relating to the absence of ingredients generally perceived to be harmful, were the most prevalent nutrition or composition claims found on 97% of products; “free from” claims most commonly referred to added sugars, flavors, colors, salt, and preservatives.

Approximately 68% of products featured words such as ""fresh,"" ""organic,"" ""natural,"" or ""real"" on their packaging. Most products with a health claim were found in the dry cereals and starches (77%) and snacks and finger foods (34%) categories. The most common health claim was related to beneficial health and development, and these claims were more than twice as prevalent on toddler foods (found on 33% of products) compared to infant foods (15%). The most common marketing claims were related to ideal texture, taste, optimum feeding, high quality, and lifestyle or convenience.

Further, 58% of products featured images of fruits, 88% of which contained processed fruit sugars. The percentage of fruit in products with fruit imagery ranged from 0% to 100%. One-fifth of products with fruit imagery had less than 5% fruit. Vegetable images were found on the packaging of 36% of products. Most products were savory meals or purees, containing an average of 49% vegetables. Beyond imagery, the study also found that the product names themselves were often misleading. For 27% of products, the name did not accurately reflect the ingredients in the order they appear. For example, a product named ‘Organic Lamb and Garden Vegetables' implied that lamb was the main ingredient, when in fact it contained only 10% lamb compared to 90% vegetables.

Among the 27% of products with misleading names, a striking 24 out of 27 were savory meals overstating the prominence of meat or chicken.

Commercial foods for infants and toddlers in New Zealand were saturated with claims, with all products featuring at least three unique claims. Composition and nutrition claims were the most common category. Marketing claims were also common, while health claims were less frequent. One-fourth of products featured all three categories of claims.

Besides, a combined 88% of products featured vegetable and/or fruit imagery. Similar types and numbers of claims were found on infant and toddler foods, except for health claims that were more prevalent on toddler foods. The paper notes that previous research confirms these claims can be powerful, with one study finding that ‘free from' claims can promote inaccurate perceptions of a product's healthiness and influence purchasing choices. Overall, regulations are needed to restrict the use of claims and align them with best practices, thereby preventing caregivers from being misled by these promotional messages.

Scientists in Australia are launching one of the most comprehensive trials to date to test whether ditching plastics in food, personal care, and household products can lower internal chemical loads and improve markers of cardiometabolic health.



Protocol: Randomised controlled trial of a low plastic diet and lifestyle intervention for adults with cardiometabolic risk factors: the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial – a protocol. Image Credit: Oksana Mizina / Shutterstock

In a recent public health protocol published in BMJ Open, researchers describe the PERTH (Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health) trial, a new randomized controlled study protocol designed to investigate whether a comprehensive, 4-week ""low-plastic"" diet and lifestyle intervention can reduce exposure to plastic-derived chemicals.

These chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors with documented links to obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The PERTH trial examines whether a cohort of 60 adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, provided with all-plastic-free food, cookware, and personal care products, can demonstrate measurable reductions in plastic-associated chemical excretion and exploratory changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers.

From the top of Mt. Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, plastics from food packaging, kitchen utensils, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies can be found everywhere and comprise an inescapable part of modern life. Alarmingly, in addition to their ecological and environmental impacts, a growing body of scientific literature reports extensive physiological concerns associated with them.

Two classes of chemicals commonly used in plastics: 1. bisphenols (like Bisphenol A [BPA]) and 2. phthalates (like diethyl phthalate [DEP]) are known endocrine disruptors. Observational research has linked higher exposure to these “plastic-associated chemicals (PACs)” with various adverse physiological outcomes, including obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation.

Clinical evidence suggests these outcomes substantially increase individuals' risk and severity of cardiometabolic disease. Unfortunately, whether actively and drastically reducing PAC exposure can reverse previous harm remains to be investigated through controlled intervention studies.

The present public health protocol details the proposed methodology of the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of a low-plastic lifestyle intervention on measurable health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors.

The study will involve 60 community-dwelling adults (aged 18–60 years) in Perth, Australia, who have established cardiometabolic risk factors. Study inclusion criteria include: 1. A body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², and 2. A high waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women). The study will randomly assign participants into a case (“intervention”; n = 30) or control (n = 30) group.

The intervention period will last four weeks, during which time the intervention cohort participants will receive a comprehensive, all-inclusive low-plastic lifestyle package. This includes: 1. Delivering all food and beverages in plastic-free packaging, 2. Replacement plastic-free kitchenware (e.g., stainless steel pots, glass containers), 3. Personal care products (such as shampoo and soap), and 4. Cleaning supplies.

Interventional group participants will receive detailed instructions on how to minimize plastic exposure in their daily lives. In contrast, the control group will be asked to maintain their routine lifestyle and dietary patterns.

Study outcomes will be measured by evaluating the change in a composite z-score of urinary bisphenol concentrations (BPA and BPS) between participants in the intervention and control groups. Secondary and tertiary outcomes will include changes in urinary phthalate metabolites and a range of key health markers, including cardiometabolic biomarkers, blood pressure, and body composition. Participants will also collect their own stool and nasal lavage samples to support exploratory analyses.

Participants' sociodemographic information will be recorded at baseline, and all biomedical measurements will be taken at baseline, midpoint (week 2), and at the end of the 4-week intervention.

By providing all food and products to the intervention group, the PERTH trial will be the most comprehensive and rigorously controlled trial ever conducted on the topic. Impressively, pilot trials have already revealed that BPA was detectable in over 91% of urine samples derived from healthy (no cardiometabolic disease) adults, confirming that PAC exposure is widespread in Australia.

These pilots further demonstrated that a 7-day low-plastic intervention could significantly reduce urinary PAC levels, providing a strong basis for this larger, longer trial. Notably, while laboratory staff will be blinded to participant allocation, both participants and investigators cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention.

Finally, the PERTH study leverages the Plastic-Associated Chemical-exposure Questionnaire (PACeQ) to meticulously track and assess all potential routes of plastic exposure (ingestion, inhalation, and absorption), ensuring robust and trustworthy results. The protocol also highlights the ethical rationale for the holistic intervention approach, as it avoids artificial PAC exposure in controls due to safety concerns.

The PERTH trial is a critically important study that will provide the first protocolised attempt to test the causal effects of whether a comprehensive reduction in exposure to everyday plastic chemicals can lead to exploratory improvements in cardiometabolic health markers.

Study outcomes have the potential to significantly impact public health guidelines, inform regulatory policy on the use of chemicals in consumer products, and empower individuals with practical, evidence-based strategies to reduce their body's plastic burden. While the study's Australian focus prevents its global generalizability, it comprises the first significant step from observational links to real-world interventions.

PFAs, also known as 'forever chemicals', account for nearly 9,000 different chemicals, some of which are already prohibited or heavily regulated. Their extensive use has left a lasting mark on both the environment and public health.

The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) are reviewing PFAs risks to guide REACH UK on potential updates to chemical safety laws.

Ensuring the safety of our food remains a fundamental public health priority. Experts say wider quality and safety checks are needed on more food products as shifting industrial processes alter environmental conditions.

Research has connected PFA exposure to cancer and to harmful effects on the immune, reproductive, and hormonal systems.

Since the 1960s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized some PFAs in food packaging for their non-stick, grease-proof, and water-resistant properties. The highest PFA concentrations are often found in molded fiber packaging such as takeaway bowls, plates, and food boxes.

The United States has passed more PFA laws than most other countries, including the United Kingdom. To improve food safety, the FDA introduced an official testing method (C-010.01) to detect PFAs in a variety of foods. This method was changed in December 2021 to version C-010.02.

In this regard, a useful Application Note for Method C-010.02 has been published. The updated C-010.02 method offers a fast, reliable way to measure PFAs in foods from dairy to baked goods, eggs, and vegetables.

Tired of the limits that come with purchasing conventional reference materials from stock catalogs? Sifting through endless catalogue pages with varying concentrations and matrices wastes valuable time, with no guarantee of finding the standard you need.

Many chemists avoid the tedious process entirely, instead mixing their own analytical standards in-house. However, this approach adds extra workload and considerable risk.

Luckily, there is a better solution. Custom certified reference materials (CRMs) from Inorganic Ventures are a simpler and faster approach to obtain the appropriate analytical standard reference material for your unique use case. Inorganic Ventures always encourages its clients to share the responsibility for establishing calibration standards.

Allow Inorganic Ventures to handle the burden of creating custom analytical standards depending on your specific requirements. This saves time and removes the risks of blending standards by hand.

Not sure that custom CRMs outperform analytical standards mixed in-house? Here are six reasons why you should trust Inorganic Ventures to create calibration solutions for your workflow rather than blending them yourself.

Combining single-element analytical standards into a viable solution requires both resources and time. Consider the administrative, equipment, and human costs of stocking and measuring reorder points per solution. These costs mount quickly into a significant ongoing expense.

Inorganic Ventures' analytical standards ensure that you pay only for what you need, making inventory management much easier. Its CRMs are ready for instant use without any additional preparation, and each standard can be diluted directly from the bottle.

When creating your own calibration standards, you are always responsible for providing verification.

Labs held to strict testing specifications must continuously ensure that every standard is generated to the highest possible standards. This requires a high level of confidence and organization. An audit can turn this into a high-pressure test of record-keeping.



Image Credit: ESSLAB

With a custom CRM, all regulatory documents, including CoA and SDS, are prepared for you and ready for inspection. Its standards are manufactured and certified in accordance with ISO 17025 and ISO 17034 Scopes.

To err is human, and even experienced scientists make mistakes. When mixing analytical standards in-house, you will inevitably second-guess the validity of your data. Unfortunately, there is no margin for error in the analytical sector.

Mixing errors, whether in amounts, matrix composition, or other factors, can quickly undermine accuracy.



Image Credit: ESSLAB

Common human errors that can jeopardize DIY standards include: 

Transpiration can progressively raise the concentration of your analytical standards over time. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this phenomenon when combining your own working standards in-house, as it is caused by water vapor penetration into the mixture, either through container walls or through the opening.

Inorganic Ventures' proprietary packaging technology minimizes transpiration, preserving CRM integrity for years. Transpiration Control Technology (TCT) prevents transpiration from the bottle by creating an equilibrium within the heat-sealed container.

Analytical standards packaged in this manner keep their integrity for up to four years after manufacturing.

Products can be stored in the TCT bag for up to three years, and then for another year after removal. The time and expense savings associated with regular inventory refilling are completely removed, thus alleviating your storage worries.



 Image Credit: ESSLAB

Analytical standards must be delivered in ultra-clean bottles, and the CRM is prepared using sterile laboratory equipment and clean beginning materials. It is possible to reproduce these stringent cleaning conditions in your own lab, but this is just another example of the work and cost implications of mixing calibration standards oneself.

The Inorganic Ventures team conducted comprehensive leaching experiments to determine contamination levels in all materials used to produce the CRMs. The team obtain the cleanest components (beginning materials, weigh boats, pipettes, bottles, and so on) and correctly leach them all to achieve the cleanest final analytical standard possible. 

Inorganic Ventures also has a separate clean room with a HEPA filtration system and ultra-high purity acids for manufacture. This safeguards against environmental contamination at every stage. 

If your results are incorrect, it might be incredibly difficult to identify the cause of the error. Simple mistakes, such as going over volume, will necessitate boiling the concentrate, usually in glass, which may introduce more pollutants. The only solution is to start afresh.

Investigators at Mass General Brigham and the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have uncovered how patients' healthcare spending has changed following the implementation of the No Surprises Act in 2022, a bipartisan law prohibiting unexpected or ""surprise"" bills after patients receive out-of-network medical care. The team found that the law dramatically reduced out-of-pocket costs, with an average annual savings of nearly $600 per patient. The findings are published in The BMJ.

""One in five insured adults in the U.S. incurred surprise bills before the No Surprises Act, and these bills frequently exceeded thousands of dollars, resulting in substantial financial hardship among patients,"" said lead author Michael Liu, MD, MPhil, a clinical fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and research fellow at the Smith Center. ""Government agencies have called for rigorous evaluations of the law, and we believe our paper is the first to do so.""

Liu and his colleagues analyzed data on 17,351 adults aged 19-64 years with direct-purchase private insurance. Some resided in intervention states that gained protections from the No Surprises Act and others resided in control states that already had laws providing comprehensive surprise billing protections and therefore did not gain additional protections from the law.

After implementation of the No Surprises Act, out-of-pocket medical spending declined significantly in intervention states-nearly $600 annually per patient-but not in control states, indicating that the law was successful in protecting patients from surprise medical bills. Although experts initially projected that premium spending (fixed monthly payments to insurance companies) would decline because the law was supposed to promote fair payment negotiations between insurers and providers, the researchers observed that such spending was unchanged after the law. ""This finding is in line with anecdotal reports that providers-especially those backed by private equity firms-are leveraging loopholes and unfair tactics to secure higher payments at the expense of patients and the healthcare system,"" said Liu.

Importantly, the No Surprises Act did not meaningfully reduce high burden medical spending, defined as a family spending more than 10% of their income on health care, suggesting that opportunities remain to build upon the law and pursue additional policy strategies to reduce healthcare-related financial strain, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

Our findings have important implications for patients and should inform ongoing policy efforts to prevent financial toxicity and address the healthcare affordability crisis in the U.S.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study finds minimal risk of second cancer in breast cancer survivors","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250828/Study-finds-minimal-risk-of-second-cancer-in-breast-cancer-survivors.aspx","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

For women diagnosed with early breast cancer, the long-term risk of developing a second primary cancer is low (around 2-3% greater than women in the general population), finds a study published by The BMJ today.

The researchers say this information can help reassure many breast cancer survivors who believe their risk of a second primary cancer is much higher than these results suggest.

Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers, but risk estimates from previous studies are inconsistent. The risk and type of a second cancer can also be affected by the initial treatment received, as well as social, lifestyle and genetic factors.

To address this uncertainty, researchers used data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service for England to estimate the long-term risks of second primary cancers compared with the general population, and the various factors associated with these risks.

Their findings are based on 476,373 women diagnosed in England from 1993 to 2016 with early invasive breast cancer at ages 20-75 years who underwent surgery.

Over a follow-up period of up to 20 years, 64,747 women developed a second primary cancer, but the absolute excess risks compared with risks in the general population were small. 

By 20 years, 13.6% of women had developed a non-breast cancer (mainly womb, lung or bowel cancer), 2.1% more than expected in the general population, and 5.6% had developed a contralateral breast cancer (on the other side of the body), 3.1% more than expected.

When patients were grouped by age at first breast cancer diagnosis, the excess risk of a second non-breast cancer varied little across age groups. However, the excess risk of a contralateral breast cancer was greater in younger than in older women.

For example, for a woman whose first breast cancer was diagnosed when aged 60, her estimated risks of developing a new cancer by the age of 80 are 17% for non-breast cancer and 5% for contralateral breast cancer compared to risks of 15% and 3% respectively for women of the same age in the general population.

For a woman diagnosed when aged 40, her estimated risks of developing a second cancer by the age of 60 are 6% for both non-breast and contralateral breast cancer compared to 4% and 2% respectively for women in the general population.

When patients were grouped according to other (adjuvant) treatments they received after surgery, radiotherapy was associated with higher rates of contralateral breast and lung cancers, endocrine therapy with uterine cancer (along with reduced contralateral breast cancer), and chemotherapy with acute leukaemia.

Based on these results, the researchers estimate that around 7% of excess second cancers may be due to the use of adjuvant therapies, but note that their benefits outweigh this small risk in almost all circumstances where these treatments are recommended.

The authors acknowledge that their findings may be affected by incomplete cancer registry data for some variables. What's more, they did not have information on family history, genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices such as smoking.

However, this long-term study describes the development of second cancers according to multiple patient, tumour and treatment characteristics amongst all women with early invasive breast cancer so the findings can reliably inform breast cancer patients and the clinicians who treat and support them.

They are also relevant to clinical practice and policy, and may help inform the design of future studies to assess cancer risk.

These results are reassuring and should be shared widely, say patients in a linked opinion article, who note that finding detailed information on the risks of second cancers after breast cancer was particularly difficult.

In general, the benefits of treatments in protecting patients from recurrence of breast cancer far outweigh the potential downsides, the patients write. Such information should be available and offered by clinicians at the time that adjuvant therapies are discussed.

They acknowledge that not everyone will want all the details at diagnosis, but say it should be there for those who do want it and for those who seek it later. ""Information on risks should be readily available. It helps us to plan our lives and think ahead to the future,"" they conclude.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","NWSL transfer grades: Amid world-record fee and USWNT hopefuls, which moves were best?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46090602/nwsl-transfer-grades-how-did-uswnt-moves-rank-2025","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Arsenal and USWNT defender Emily Fox admits she was surprised to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or. (1:07)

The NWSL's transfer window is officially closed, and for the second straight time, it involved a world-record deal -- this time for an incoming player.

Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle moved from Tigres to the Orlando Pride last week and set the new women's global transfer record at $1.5 million, per ESPN sources. But there have been several other high-profile transfers involving NWSL players and some U.S. women's national team hopefuls, too.

Outgoing transfers and intra-league trades can still take place, but the transfer window is now closed for new summer arrivals in the NWSL. So, which transfers were the best for the respective player's career? Let's grade them and dig into what these moves mean for the future.

- How women's transfer record skyrocketed with Ovalle move
- NWSL Power Rankings: Orlando Pride are officially in a slump
- USWNT debutants ranked: All 24 players with first caps under Hayes

Grade: A-

Ovalle is known as La Maga (The Magician) for her audacious play, from the scorpion-kick goal seen round the world earlier this year for Tigres to last year's cheeky goal that lifted Mexico to its first win over the USWNT on American soil.

Ovalle is already a household name in Mexico. Her move to the NWSL in her prime at 25 years old will give her a global platform to showcase those skills and, if all goes to plan, fully insert herself into the conversation as one of the world's best.

Alexis Nunes and Ali Krieger discuss the potential record signing of Lizbeth Ovalle to Orlando Pride.

That plan requires Ovalle to become a focal point for Orlando, a team already blessed with depth and talent. She'll have at least a few months (if not more) to play alongside six-time World Player of the Year Marta. The recent season-ending injury to Barbra Banda also means that Ovalle will be needed even more immediately if the Pride want to repeat.

Orlando's 22 goals scored is the lowest among the top seven teams right now -- and Banda scored eight of those. The Pride are creating opportunities -- 26.3 expected goals, per FBref so Ovalle could be the missing piece.

A world-record transfer fee will come with pressure, however. How will she handle it?

Grade: B+

Fishel's move to Seattle was about the long term. Chelsea's roster is perpetually crowded, and Fishel has eyes on the 2027 World Cup with the USWNT. To be there and to be a prominent player for United States coach Emma Hayes (who signed her at Chelsea), Fishel needs more consistent reps as a bona-fide starting forward for her club.

That is what Seattle expects from her, evidenced by an NWSL record cumulative salary and that should play out in the long term.

Right now, Fishel is still assimilating into a new club after a relatively recent return from a torn ACL. She has played limited minutes off the bench in three games for Seattle. The Reign, and Fishel, are going to need time to adapt to one another.

Grade: B+

Sentnor's move from the NWSL's last-place team to the league leaders in August is another case of playing the long game.

There are valid short-term questions about how Sentnor fits into an already stacked Kansas City roster. Sentnor was the focal point and franchise player in Utah; in Kansas City, she is not a guaranteed starter, as talented as she is. Not right now, anyway.

Alexis Nunes is joined on Futbol W by Emily Keogh to discuss the rise of Utah Royals' Ally Sentnor.

But this move is about the future for a 21-year-old rising star -- which is why Kansas City paid an intra-league record $600,000 (plus potential add-ons) to sign her. Sentnor will be coached by Vlatko Andonovski, arguably the NWSL's most successful coach and a former USWNT coach who knows what is needed in that environment.

Kansas City isn't exactly overly young, either, with Debinha turning 34 in October and Bia turning 32 in December. Roster turnover is inevitable in the NWSL especially, and Sentnor is likely to become a long-term centerpiece for the Current. This move is about her development.

Grade: A

Rarely does the cliché of ""a win-win"" ring true, but it is a fitting description of this move.

Watt became the first signing for 2026 NWSL expansion team Denver Summit FC, which is a nice touch of history for the Colorado native. She gets to go home for a historic moment next year to anchor a new franchise, and Orlando get salary cap relief and extra funds to use on an already expensive roster (more on that soon).

Plus, Watt gets to finish the 2025 NWSL season with Orlando on loan, giving her a six-month runway to join her new team and relocate her life. She's also an important part of the Pride's push to repeat as NWSL champions.

Watt is exactly the type of player NWSL expansion teams need to establish success. Yes, there are likely more splashy signings to come, but Watt is a hard worker who contributes offensively with dynamic wing play, and she brings championship, veteran experience to Denver. And can establish herself as an early leader at the club.

Grade: B+

On one hand, Sanchez is a loss for San Diego and the NWSL. That she left San Diego just over a year after a then-NWSL record transfer from the Houston Dash is also a bit anticlimactic. The reality, however, is that Sanchez was fighting for minutes on an overhauled Wave roster being guided by a new head coach in Jonas Eidevall. Sanchez started in only three of her last eight games for the Wave before making the move back to Tigres, where she played earlier in her career.

Sanchez already has five goals for Tigres, which is among the league leaders. That's all a net positive for her, even if she has moved around a fair amount to end up back at Estadio Universitario.

Cantore joined the Spirit from Juventus after a strong showing with Italy at Euro 2025, which further boosted her celebrity, and has settled into life in Washington nicely, already after scoring in her second NWSL appearance.

The 25-year-old fills a void on a Spirit team that has dealt with endless injuries or other absences, including at the forward position, and combines well with her new teammates, as she showed again in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bay FC.

She is like a magnet for the ball in the attack, and could be an important addition for the team that looks most ready to challenge the Kansas City Current's dominance come playoff time.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Could Folarin Balogun deliver for the United States in September?

That'll be top of mind as the U.S. Men's National Team gears up to face Korea Republic and Japan in the September FIFA window.

Balogun was added to the now 23-player roster on Wednesday ahead of Aug. 31 when players report to New Jersey for training camp. He earned his first cap in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League Finals and scored his first goal in the 2-0 win against Canada in the Final, quickly garnering a name for himself as a scoring threat.

This window and the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup also give Balogun a chance to answer another question: Can he stay healthy?

He last competed with the National Team in September 2024, just as Pochettino was hired. However, this isn't Balogun's first call-up under the head coach. Balogun was one of five forwards selected to the roster for June camp, but he sustained an ankle injury before reporting for National Team duty. The forward missed significant time during the last Ligue 1 season with a dislocated shoulder and the ankle injury.

This will give Pochettino a chance to evaluate the 24-year-old forward more thoroughly. Though, the forward has proven to be efficient for both club and country. Balogun has racked up five goals in 17 caps with the USMNT. On the club side, he recorded four goals in 16 appearances for AS Monaco last season.

Josh Sargent, Damion Downs and Tim Weah are forwards on this September roster who have played the No. 9 position. This September camp gives Pochettino a chance to look at several different players as decisions for the upcoming World Cup roster need to be made. And like other positions, the striker is ripe for the taking.

Other options at the position in the player pool — Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Downs — have all earned caps under Pochettino. Now, Balogun is poised with the opportunity to prove his value, too, in Harrison, N.J. on Sept. 6 and then in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 9.

Before there was a chance for any controversy to emerge surrounding Folarin Balogun's omission from Mauricio Pochettino's latest U.S. men's national team (USMNT) roster, the Monaco forward was belatedly called up.

Balogun earned his chance to face South Korea and Japan in a series of friendlies after Vancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White pulled out through injury. The 29-year-old sustained a hamstring strain during last weekend's victory over St. Louis, creating a gap in the roster which many already expected to be filled by Balogun.

Injury hampered much of the 2024–25 campaign for the former Arsenal striker, who was sidelined for the best part of six months with a dislocated shoulder and the surgery required to fix it. After getting back on the pitch in spring, Balogun was initially included in this summer's Gold Cup roster only for an ankle injury to force him out.

Balogun's most recent international appearance came back in September 2024, before Pochettino's reign even began. His last international win and goal was the opening game of the 2024 Copa América against Bolivia.

The 24-year-old had previously been considered to be USMNT's first-choice No. 9 and will be competing for a starting spot in September with Southampton's Damion Downs and Norwich City frontman Josh Sargent. 

Pochettino's initial choice of Vancouver's White over Balogun may have been a consequence of his lofty opinion of MLS. The top flight of North American soccer is widely considered to be inferior to Europe's elite divisions, yet the Argentine coach offered an impassioned counter-view at his squad announcement.

“We need to give MLS the value, because I think competing there, I think players can show that they can perform in the national team,” Pochettino told assembled media this week. “I think it's not necessary to move from MLS to Europe. Because sometimes MLS, under my assessment, maybe is more competitive than some leagues in Europe.”

Soccer America


					Home for America's Passionate Soccer Fans				

Mauricio Pochettino named a U.S. national team roster for the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan that left out some familiar names and top emerging players.

That sparked short-term questions — how will the USA fare against a pair of Asian powers? — and long-term speculation about Pochettino's selection process heading toward the 2026 World Cup.

Big picture/Small picture issues

It is possible to examine this roster for both the short- and the long-term implications. Pochettino helped explain during Tuesday's media call with several key statements. 

First, he quantified the USMNT player pool and said he was tracking 60-65 players on a weekly basis to monitor their progress. 

Second, he said this was the last camp with the possibility of bringing in new faces (at least in significant numbers). 

Third, and most importantly, he addressed the nature of needing roster spots to become more competitive within the squad. In a specific point that addressed the nature of the roster, he said he didn't have “A team” players or “B team” players as the media and fans like to refer to teams. Often this leads to the assumption that only a few players are competing for roster spots while others are “locks” who can take their spots for granted. 

“We respect and have full respect for all the players who can be called by us,” Pochettino said. “All need to feel the possibility to fight for a place. If we want to be a team that is really competitive, we cannot nominate 13, 14, 16 players and say for sure these guys will arrive at the World Cup and the rest need to fight for a place. 

“Come on, that is not the real sport of football. When you see national teams that have won World Cups, you really understand what that means.

“Players need to feel the threat from your teammates They need to defend their place every single possibility they have with the national team.”

Many fans were critical of the roster. Even giving full respect to a coach of Pochettino's stature, some of the picks were tough to comprehend. But critics of the roster must ask: What, exactly, makes this team exempt from an overhaul? What about the team over the past 16 months is worth clinging to? 

At the Copa America and at the Nations League, the team played far below the sum of its parts. The Gold Cup was somewhat better but even then, Pochettino was limited with roster constraints. 

If Pochettino wants to change the direction of the team, he can't call back the same core each camp, which was a valid criticism during the later years of Gregg Berhalter's tenure. The few new faces that would occasionally emerge would then have a harder time finding their way because the large core would dictate the culture. 

To get to the heart of it, this roster is about cleaning the slate. 

This camp is about making players work for call-ups, and when they get back into camp, having a new tone. It is sending a message to players.  

An important takeaway: the players not in camp are just as important as the players who are on this roster. Pochettino wants to see those who were left off respond the way Josh Sargent has (scoring goals in each of Norwich's first four games this season). 

Pochettino wants to see desperation for call-ups, not players simply assuming they'll be invited. Then once they're in camp, they know they must perform to earn playing time. 

Pochettino inherited a flawed team whose core has been together for over half a decade. It's a process to fix it. It's not about a few simple tactical adjustments but rather more drastic measures. 

We don't yet know how the team will look in October. But the players in this camp have a huge opportunity to boost their stock. The players not in this camp simply have to work harder and perform better. Pochettino and his staff are watching their club performances. 

Here's a position-by-position look at things.

Goalkeeping

Pochettino has turned the goalkeeping position on its head. Not since Tim Howard or Brad Guzan were in the picture has the USMNT willingly dropped Matt Turner, Zack Steffen or Ethan Horvath in a FIFA calendar window. Then, on top of that, 2024 Olympic team goalkeeper Patrick Schulte has also been dropped. 

Matt Freese is a great example of how things can change for a player. With Pochettino wanting to look at different options beyond Turner, Freese was given the starting Gold Cup spot when Schulte and Steffen were injured. A bad mistake against Haiti aside, he took advantage of the opportunity. He's now fighting to possibly be a World Cup starter.

Chelsea will welcome Barcelona to Stamford Bridge in the league phase of the Champions League, while Arsenal host Bayern Munich.

As was the case last season, all 36 teams in the competition will compete in one big league and each play eight fixtures.

Chelsea have a trip to Bayern Munich to look forward, but the standout fixture for the Blues is a home clash against Barcelona.

Alongside those two fixtures, there will be a reunion with former boss Antonio Conte when they travel to take on Napoli.

Arsenal, who reached the semi-finals last season, will also face Bayern, as has regularly been the case in this competition over the past decade.

That will come at the Emirates Stadium, as will a blockbuster encounter with Atletico Madrid.

There is a trip to Milan to face Inter for Mikel Arteta's side. The Italian side beat Arsenal in the league phase of the Champions League last season.

Tottenham, meanwhile, are back at Europe's top table and take on holders Paris Saint-Germain, who were fortunate to beat them in the UEFA Super Cup earlier this month.

Thomas Frank's side have plenty of familiar opponents. They travel to take on Eintracht Frankfurt, beaten on the way to Europa League glory last season, as well as Bodo/Glimt, who Spurs saw off in the semi-finals of that run.

Liverpool face another heavyweight showdown with Real Madrid, in what is a swift return to Anfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Manchester City will be at the Bernabeu to take on the 15-time champions, while they host Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and Galatasaray.

Newcastle complete the six Premier League sides in the competition and have been handed a tough set of fixtures.

The Magpies have tricky away trips, including against PSG, Leverkusen and Marseille, while Barcelona will be hosted at St James' Park.

Manchester City: Borussia Dortmund (H), Real Madrid (A), Bayer Leverkusen (H), Villarreal (A), Napoli (H), Bodo/Glimt (A), Galatasaray (H), Monaco (A)

Liverpool: Real Madrid (H), Inter Milan (A), Atletico Madrid (H), Eintracht Frankfurt (A), PSV (H), Marseille (A), Qarabag (H), Galatasaray (A)

Arsenal: Bayern Munich (H), Inter Milan (A), Atletico Madrid (H), Club Brugge (A), Olympiacos (H), Slavia Prague (A), Kairat Almaty (H), Athletic Bilbao (A)

Nilson Angulo has had a fantastic start to the campaign with Anderlecht. The young Ecuadorian winger, who is likely going to be featuring at the World Cup next summer, has scored twice and grabbed three assists in just eight games this season. As a result, clubs have been interested, but recently Angulo said he would prefer to stay in Belgiu. However, that may now change. Rudy Galetti has revealed that Portuguese club Sporting CP have engaged in talks with Anderlecht over bringing the 22-year-old Angulo to Portugal. Sporting CP recently missed out on the signing of Yeremay from Deportivo so are looking for an alternative.

while Anderlecht are also keen to keep Angulo, that may change if the side fail to overcome AEK Athens in Conference League qualification. After a 1-1 draw in Brussels, the side travel to Greece tonight for the return leg. Missing out on European football will mean they need to bring the financial benefits into the club via player sales. Even with a positive result in Europe, if Sporting CP submit an offer that is too good to turn down, Anderlecht will likely allow Angulo to move to Lisbon.

Anderlecht and Sporting CP are no strangers to each other, with Zeno Debast having moved from Brussels to Lisbon in the past season.

The Champions League draw will take place at 18:00 CEST today, with five La Liga clubs eagerly awaiting their eight opponents for the league phase of the competition. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Athletic Club and Villarreal will have happy accountants as a result.

Due to the coefficient rankings, La Liga earned an extra Champions League spot last season to the benefit of Villarreal. They will be in the mix for the largest ever pot of prize money in football, as per Marca. UEFA have been under pressure to respond to increased demands for more money to be shared amongst the European elite in recent years following the attempted move to a Superleague, and the advent of the Club World Cup.

Arsenal Champions League Tickets: a Buyer's Guide

The total pot of prize money increased by 21% last year with the new format, some €400m. This year will see a much more modest rise, with the total pot increasing by €43m to €2.47b in total. There is also good news for Real Betis and Celta Vigo in the Europa League, where the €465m pot has risen to €565m, while Rayo Vallecano will be hoping to earn their share of the €285m n the Conference League, up from €235m.

Last season Paris Saint-Germain earned the most money from the total, bringing in €118.7m in total. Performance-related bonuses adhere to a strict structure, with €2.1m awarded for a win, and €700k for a draw. Those who qualify for the knockout rounds receive a bonus ranging from €1.7m (16th if they win their play-off) to €12m (1st). Reaching the round of 16 adds another €11m to your bonuses, which increases to €12.5m, €15m, €18.5m and right up to €25m for the winners as a team progresses through each round.

The performance bonuses represent 37.5% of the total (€926.2m), while participation on its own accounts for 27.5% (679.2m, which evens out as €18.6m per team). The third area of financial rewards is the ‘base value', which accounts for €864.5m (35%), This has replaced the ‘market share' function, and is based on a slightly more complicated system.

It appears to be based on a combination of the UEFA coefficient, an independent coefficient based on average position over the last two tournaments, and ranked from 1 through 36 amongst all of the teams, and the contribution of their national broadcasters to the pot.

FIFA were content to boast of the €1b prize money pot, divided by the 32 teams involved – which Marca point out ended up being €929m. However the Champions League remains king, dividing the €2.47b between the 36 teams. However the difference for the biggest sides is less augmented, with Atletico Madrid (€19.7m) and Real Madrid (€32.8m) received higher fixed fees for their participation.

The champion of the Club World Cup, in this case Chelsea, was set for a prize of €110.9m, while the Champions Leage winner will receive between €142.7m and €154.7m depending on their base value. That will require the winners to play an extra 10 matches to receive that bump too.

UEFA intend to maintain this method of dividing the prize for this season and next season, when their current TV rights deal.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.

Rather concerningly, this is an injury that Palmer has been carrying for some time, which means it may well have been exacerbated by Chelsea going all the way at the Club World Cup and the scaled-back pre-season that followed, with the gruelling summer tournament only reaching its conclusion in mid-July.

Following his last-minute withdrawal before the thumping victory over West Ham on Friday, apparently after painkillers failed to have the desired effect, head coach Enzo Maresca admitted his talisman had already been playing through the pain barrier in the season opener against Crystal Palace five days prior, where the attacker was criticised for a subdued performance in the goalless draw. The decision to start him there deserves some scrutiny if Palmer's absence proves to be a lengthy one.

""Cole in the last four or five days was not 100 per cent,” the Italian tactician revealed. ""He tried the warm-up but he felt something. We preferred not to take any risks. We will see if it's something important or not. [It's in the] groin. For the Crystal Palace game, he was not 100% but he tried to make a big effort for the club, the fans and the team. He tried tonight, but it was not very good.""

Palmer was underwent a scan on Tuesday, although it remains to be seen when the results of those tests will be revealed with Chelsea not due to play again until Saturday lunchtime when they host neighbours Fulham, by which time eight days will have passed since he pulled out of the West Ham clash.

According to Chelsea reporter Si Phillips, the attacker could be sidelined for up to six weeks, although there is optimism that his layoff will be shorter and that he might even be available immediately after the upcoming pause for World Cup qualifying action.

Although England almost certainly won't have Palmer at their disposal, Chelsea will consider the international break to be well-timed as their players prepare to disperse after the Fulham game. However, their key man could still miss Premier League clashes against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton in September, while the Blues will be desperate to have him available for the visit of champions Liverpool on Saturday, October 4, in just under six weeks' time.

Having played such a key role in getting the club there, the 23-year-old may also miss out on the Blues' first two fixtures back in the Champions League in mid- and late September, as well as the third round of the Carabao Cup.

Whatever the result of the scan, this injury is a crushing blow for Chelsea at such an early stage of a season that had offered renewed hope. It's common knowledge that Palmer has been a revelation since joining the Blues less than two years ago, emerging as a creative and goal-scoring force, but his durability is an underrated attribute.

Since his arrival from Manchester City, you can count the number of games he has missed at club level on one hand; in 2023-24 he only missed the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal through illness, and there was some strange symmetry last season as he sat out the same fixture due to a hamstring problem.

His international record is strangely more patchy; after being sidelined for two England games following the defeat at the Emirates in March, Palmer has only featured in three of his country's last 10 games, having withdrawn from two squads during Lee Carsley's interim reign following Euro 2024, and he is now set to miss another camp.

The attacker's club might think the international break comes at a good time, but this could still be his longest absence since joining Chelsea, and his most significant since a serious foot injury he suffered during his time at City in 2022.

There is little doubt that this is an injury that Palmer could have avoided or would have been less severe if it wasn't for Chelsea's run to unexpected glory at the Club World Cup, where the 23-year-old was their hero once again as he dismantled European champions Paris Saint-Germain almost singlehandedly in the final. Ironically, it was a performance that led to much of the optimism around Stamford Bridge at the start of the new season, which has now been diminished in light of Palmer's setback.

Despite the west Londoners often coming up against relatively weaker opposition in the U.S., Palmer was only rested for the clash against Morocco's Esperance - clocking up more than 550 minutes in six games over the course of just under a month. It is believed that this groin problem flared up at some point during the tournament, where matches were invariably played in excruciating and physically draining heat and humidity.

It's easy to forget that he was involved in the completely misguided post-season England camp in June, too, needlessly playing in what should have been a routine win over Andorra before warming the bench against Senegal.

In normal circumstances, Palmer would have had ample time in pre-season to recover, but going all the way at the Club World Cup has come at a cost. After the final on July 13, the squad was afforded just three weeks off before reporting back for training in early August as part of their scaled-back warm-up plans, with Palmer playing more than 100 minutes across their two friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan on the same weekend when, evidently, he wasn't fully fit.

Inevitably, Palmer's imminent absence has led to scepticism over how Maresca's men will handle their upcoming games. Speaking before the West Ham clash, Sky Sports pundit and Chelsea fan Paul Merson said: ""If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have.

""Palmer is the talk of the town in team talks against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea.""

The ex-Arsenal man continued: ""It's not just all on Palmer because the coach has to come up with solutions, too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.""

Of course, the Blues handled their business pretty well without him at the London Stadium in a thumping 5-1 victory, although some atrocious defending from a West Ham side in disarray at the start of the campaign contributed to all of their goals.

Nevertheless, it was a victory that led Maresca to effuse that Chelsea are not the one-man team that some of their detractors believe them to be, as his side delivered a cohesive performance despite the absence of their lynchpin, with five different names on the scoresheet.

""The ones that say we are 'just a Cole team', for sure Cole is our best player no doubt,"" the Italian said. ""For sure with Cole we are (a) much better team, but I think we already showed last year in the two or three months where Cole was not 100%, when we achieved top four that no one expected.""

And in fairness, if this injury is a precursor to Palmer being unavailable or ineffective more often, then the contributions of Estevao Willian and Joao Pedro in particular will be very encouraging. The former was Palmer's replacement in the starting line-up and collected the Player of the Match award after a dazzling performance that belied his tender years, including a scintillating dart to the byline before pulling the ball back for an Enzo Fernandez tap-in, while the latter scored a simple header and laid on two more for his team-mates from his sidelined colleague's No.10 position.

Behind the scenes, Chelsea may well be working on a more permanent solution. The Premier League giants are still pursuing RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons as we enter the final days of the transfer window, with the Dutchman a player capable of shouldering the creative and attacking burden that so often falls on Palmer. However, it seems his arrival will be contingent on outgoings.

Meanwhile, Barcelona's Fermin Lopez is the latest creative player to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge as the Blues look to capitalise on a bloated midfield in Catalunya, with talks opened with his representatives and a €50 million (£43m/$58m) offer supposedly lodged. Again, that clearly suggests Chelsea view acquiring cover for their talisman as something of a priority, before it's too late.

Whatever happens before the deadline on September 1, it's clear Chelsea need to alleviate the workload on their No.10. They might get away with this particular injury being a minor one, but as the fixtures pile up and the season progresses, they risk losing Palmer for a much longer period after a rest-less summer.","{'href': 'https://au.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'au.sports.yahoo.com'}","soccer"

Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City.

At a Legislative Budget Committee meeting on Aug. 26, Kansas lawmakers received an update from Kansas City 2026, the nonprofit overseeing the strategy of hosting the World Cup. Some key details are still hazy, with fewer than 300 days to go before the start of the event.

Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium.

There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence.

""The team base camps are really the team's home away from home, those are the locations where teams will come and train to prep for the tournament,"" said Lindsey Douglas, chief operating officer for Kansas City 2026. ""These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial.""

In the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" the large tax and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump, allocated $625 million for a security at the 11 host cities. It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million.

About 650,000 visitors are expected to the Kansas City area through the duration of the World Cup. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days.

The event will double the number of teams playing from prior World Cups to 48. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game.

""The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, this will be the largest version of that sporting event in 2026. Even though soccer is one of many sports we follow here in the United States, by far at the world stage, it is the largest,"" Douglas said.

That many people coming to the region is anticipated to generate $653 million in direct economic impact. Kansas City 2026 said it's attempting to leverage the visitors and the economic impact for longer-term partnerships.

""We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this,"" Douglas said.

There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners.

The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000.

Kansas Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, the chair of the Legislative Budget Committee, raised concerns about the number of hotel rooms available for the influx of guests. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup.

""We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area,"" Douglas said. ""We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. Also campgrounds are really looking at this as an opportunity as well. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have.""

Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. The existing public transit networks aren't substantial enough to accommodate the number of visitors coming in.

School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest.

Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport.

FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.","{'href': 'https://www.cjonline.com', 'title': 'The Topeka Capital-Journal'}","soccer"

England face Andorra at Villa Park and Serbia away in World Cup qualifiers; John Stones, Phil Foden, Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw among familiar faces available again after June defeat to Senegal; Jack Grealish, Mason Mount will hope for call, as well as U21 stars such as Adam Wharton

By Peter Smith and Rob Dorsett 

Thursday 28 August 2025 11:53, UK

Thomas Tuchel will be without key players Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham when he names his squad for September's World Cup qualifiers but familiar faces will be pushing for a recall as preparations for next summer ramp up.

The June camp ended in embarrassment for Tuchel and England, with the team soundly beaten by Senegal after an underwhelming 1-0 win away to Andorra.

England's squad announcement takes place at 2pm on Friday - follow it on Sky Sports News and the Sky Sports website and App.

But with England's toughest test of qualifying - their trip to Serbia on September 9 - in this next double-header and subsequent international breaks in October and November, Tuchel is entering a pivotal part of his project to win the World Cup in North America in 2026. His squad, named on Thursday, should reflect that.

This will be his most substantial block of training and game time with his squad before the tournament - assuming England complete what now looks like a straightforward qualification - and also a period where players will be aiming to carve out clear roles in the head coach's plans. The time for experimenting is over.

It is significant, then, that of players who missed the previous squad, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Marc Guehi, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden are fit and available. Rashford, like Trent Alexander-Arnold, hasn't had a glittering start to life in Spain, but both seem primed to be involved.

Jack Grealish will also hope his two assists for Everton at the weekend will help to nudge him back into the frame. His inclusion or absence will be a major talking point either way.

Mason Mount may feel his prospects of adding to his 36 caps are on the rise after his involvement for Manchester United this term and the long chat he had with Tuchel after the opening-weekend defeat to Arsenal.

His United team-mate Shaw is also enjoying his football again, after a couple of injury-ravaged seasons. Interestingly, Myles Lewis-Skelly, who had come in at left-back for England, has begun both Arsenal games on the bench. Djed Spence, meanwhile, has helped Tottenham make a fast start with his performances at left-back.

Adam Wharton, Tino Livramento and Liam Delap - who missed the last camp due to the U21 Euros, although Delap instead linked up with Chelsea at the Club World Cup - could be in with the seniors this time.

But will Delap dislodge surprise summer pick Ivan Toney? Dominic Solanke will also be waiting on a recall after being omitted in June, despite helping Tottenham to a Europa League success.

Tuchel made the trip to Slovakia to watch the youth team win the Euros and it will be intriguing to see if any other members of Lee Carsley's group have impressed enough. Jarell Quansah has had a call-up from Tuchel previously and, after his victorious summer with the U21s, scored on his Bayer Leverkusen debut.

Elliot Anderson is also among the Young Lions most likely to get a shout, with central midfield still a conundrum. Kobbie Mainoo's lack of game time at Manchester United will surely count against a player once seen set to become an important figure in the middle of the park for his country.

James Maddison certainly won't be involved, given his injury lay-off, while Levi Colwill is another out for the long term.

It also looks probable Ben White's international absence will continue, with the right-back - who finally made himself available for selection again in the summer - missing Arsenal's game last weekend with injury. Conor Gallagher - a favourite of Tuchel's at Chelsea - has played just over an hour's worth of football so far this season for Atletico Madrid.

In goal, Jordan Pickford remains the clear No 1 with Dean Henderson and James Trafford called up as well for the last outing. They are expected to deputise again. Aaron Ramsdale has since moved to Newcastle but is currently behind compatriot Nick Pope in the club pecking order.

Will we get the odd surprise? Tuchel has thrown those up in each squad he has named so far - but the expectation is that a clearer idea of his primary World Cup contenders will emerge with his selections this week.

Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:

The FA's youth team coaches are considering promoting Max Dowman to England's U19 squad after his impressive debut for the Arsenal first team against Leeds United at the weekend.

The 15-year-old winger has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games.

Now there is a possibility he will jump another age group, in recognition of his progress in senior football. But for that to happen, because he is still a minor, it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal.

His development will be carefully managed - by club and country. His team-mate Ethan Nwanieri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21s in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness. He went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's side as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches.

The feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken.

Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: ""There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life. For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.""

The teenager has been involved with England's junior teams for several years, making his international debut for the U16s - and then the U17s - in 2024. However, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1 2026.

Dowman stood out in pre-season, coming off the bench on numerous occasions and impressing Mikel Arteta with the impact he made. That prompted the Arsenal boss to bring him on at the Emirates on Saturday - albeit with his side already 4-0 up. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal.

Dowman instantly excited the home crowd with a number of runs down the right wing on Saturday, and won the penalty in stoppage time that Gyokeres converted for 5-0.

As we head towards the final few days of the transfer market, Barcelona are expected to finalise the future of two of their academy graduates in Hector Fort and Jan Virgili.

While Fort is no longer seen as a viable first-team option for Hansi Flick, Virgili, who recently impressed at the iconic Maracana, is on the verge of joining Mallorca this summer.

But even in the midst of such uncertainty surrounding their Barcelona future, both of them, as well as teammate Andres Cuenca, have been called up for action.

Fort, Cuenca, and Virgili have all been included in Spain's U-20 squad for their September training camp in Clairefontaine, France.

The camp will feature two friendlies against the French U-20 team – on September 4th and September 7th – serving as the final preparation ahead of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile.

Spain are set to kick off their World Cup campaign on September 28 against Morocco at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, before facing Mexico (October 1) and Brazil (October 3) in what promises to be a challenging group stage.

It will be interesting to see how these three players, each facing a distinct situation, respond to the call-up.

As mentioned earlier, Virgili is already on his way out of Barcelona, while Fort, too, may leave the club in favour of a loan move elsewhere, incidentally to Mallorca as well.

Cuenca might be the only player still remaining at Barcelona, though the youngster will largely ply his trade with the second team.

Although their involvement in Chile won't directly affect Barça's first team, losing Cuenca in particular would be a blow for the reserves.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

© 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.

Domains created to take advantage of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 in the United States were recently found. It's a sign of what's to come for the big one – the 2026 World Cup.

According to PreCrime Labs, the threat research team at BforeAI, a cybersecurity company specializing in proactive threat prevention, many domains used this year have already been registered for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

“This highlights two key tactics used by attackers: they either repurpose old domains for new campaigns or register new ones well in advance,” said the researchers. 

“By ‘aging' these domains for a year or more, attackers can better avoid detection and improve their success rates as the event nears. We even discovered domains registered for the FIFA tournaments in 2030 and 2034.”

In their report, PreCrime says it has analyzed a set of 498 domains that contain FIFA, football (soccer), and World Cup-related brand terms (e.g., “worldcup,” “fifa,” “football”). 

These domains span a mix of obvious trademark typosquats, speculative registrations, generic fan, merchandise, and betting names, and community or amateur-football sites.

In one example, researchers found a domain with a page title that says “FIFA world cup schedule” to lure users searching for official match information. When they visit the site, they are met with a betting page. 

This is a common trend observed around mega sporting events, where adversaries abuse trending keywords to maximize search visibility and social media spread.

The page content is in Mandarin Chinese, but FIFA and official broadcasters don't actually use such channels for promotions. Prominent use of celebrity pictures and “official partner” keywords are used to establish legitimacy, which is not verifiable with FIFA's actual sponsor list. 

Claims like “ 巴 西 圣 保 罗 ” (Brazil São Paulo official partner) are used, but in Mandarin, to enhance credibility.

Another webpage promotes an “EV Map for World Cup 2026,” claiming to help traveling fans find hotels and restaurants with EV chargers. In fact, the campaign obviously aims to collect personally identifiable information through a B2B phishing scheme.

Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 

In this case, fake branding elements, especially those of payment partners (VISA), flags, and FIFA logo lookalikes, were strategically added to the domains.


Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 


Major events tournaments such as global soccer events or huge concert tours predictably trigger spikes in fraud infrastructure: fake ticketing, counterfeit merchandise, unlawful streaming, betting lures, and generic “fan guide” pages used as lead-gen or phishing launchpads.

And the FIFA World Cup is undoubtedly the largest one out there. In 2022, when the tournament was held in Qatar, it engaged five billion fans across all media, FIFA said. 


    Cybernews researchers have discovered severe misconfigurations affecting two Tencent sites, exposing sensitive credentials and internal source code. The critical flaws could potentially grant full access to internal services and backend infrastructure within Tencent Cloud.

Carlo Ancelotti has announced the Brazil squad for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia. This marks the Italian coach's second international break in charge, and he has named an exciting squad.

The 25-man squad includes 12 Premier League players, 2025 Champions League winner Marquinhos and FC Barcelona's incredible talent Raphinha. Brazil will play at the FIFA 2026 World Cup next summer, but Ancelotti's job is to make this group a contender for the title, not just a participant.

Wesley could start on the right side of the backline for Brazil. The ex-Flamengo player suffered a baptism of fire with the national team when Argentina smashed the 'Seleção' 4-1 in March. However, the young full-back has huge potential and keeps improving at club level.

Since that tricky night in Buenos Aires, Wesley has performed incredibly for Flamengo in Brazil, earning a $29 million move to Italian Serie A outfit Roma. Wesley slotted straight into Gian Piero Gasperini's starting line-up and scored the only goal on the opening day of the season as Roma defeated Bologna 1-0.

Kaio Jorge is the top scorer in the Brazilian league so far this season and he is leading a title charge for his club. The forward has notched 15 goals and five assists in 20 league matches. Jorge has been a revelation in domestic football this year and will likely be rewarded with his first ever minutes for Brazil on the international stage.

Jorge probably won't start ahead of the likes of Chelsea's João Pedro or Tottenham's Richarlison, but given that Ancelotti wants to experiment with his team, the boss will surely give the Cruzeiro star a chance to prove his worth. Jorge will have to take every chance he gets if he wants to keep a spot in the national team.

Estêvão enjoyed a short cameo in Chelsea's first Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace. The winger then registered an assist against West Ham on matchday two. An injury forced Cole Palmer out during the warm-up, so the young Brazilian came into the starting line-up and made no mistake in showing his quality at the very top level of club football.

The kid who shone in Brazil for Palmeiras, and impressed against Chelsea at the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the summer, is showing his quality faster than many expected. Just a couple of weeks into the season fans can expect 18 year-old Estêvão to play regular football for Chelsea and Ancelotti's Brazil. The dynamic attacker has an abundance of raw talent and can go all the way to the top, but can he become a Brazil starter ahead of the FIFA 2026 World Cup?","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Soccer's governing body is spending millions on out-of-home advertising for the 2026 World Cup before a ball has even been kicked. That early push signals how global live events are becoming OOH's new frontier.

2026 World Cup logo / Fifa

Fifa has already poured more than $5m into out-of-home (OOH) advertising in Q2 2025 to promote the Fifa Club World Cup. That figure might look like a footnote in a $2.86bn quarter for the OOH industry, but it is more than just a one-off media buy. It is an early signal of how the governing body intends to use public space to build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup, now less than a year away.

OOH has long played a supporting role during global tournaments, but Fifa's spend this far in advance shows a shift in strategy. By dominating transit hubs, airports and city centers, the organization is creating a year-long build toward one of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Anna Bager, president and chief executive of the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA), framed it this way in the group's latest report: OOH “mirrors the cultural and social moments that shape how people spend their time and is where brands show up to connect with audiences at scale.” For Fifa, that connection starts now.

Recent tournaments show how OOH becomes indispensable during shared cultural moments. At Euro 2024, brands spent more than €313m on OOH campaigns across Europe's biggest markets, turning fan zones and city squares into branded stages. Beyond static signage, activations included live score updates on digital screens, creative that shifted with match outcomes and branded experiences embedded directly into public viewing areas. These executions helped transform city centers into extensions of the stadium experience.

Digital OOH has only heightened that role. Programmatic buying now allows advertisers to adjust messaging in real time, align creative with match results and target audiences by location or context. The flexibility of digital formats means campaigns can scale quickly while remaining responsive to the highs and lows of live sport, something static placements cannot achieve on their own.

This evolution highlights why OOH has become one of the most engaging channels for fans during major events. Stadium crowds and fan festivals are not just gatherings of spectators; they are cultural canvases where brands can establish visibility and presence at scale.

The World Cup is one of the few events that commands attention on every continent and advertisers know it. OOH revenue in the US alone grew 3% in Q2 2025, with digital formats climbing 9.2% and transit advertising up nearly 9%. Financial services, communications, and real estate brands were among the fastest-growing categories. Tech and direct-to-consumer companies made up more than a quarter of the top 100 OOH advertisers, with names such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon leading the way.

Fifa's heavy spend puts it in line with those top-tier players but also highlights the unique role of live sport. While TV spots for the 2026 Super Bowl are already priced at more than $8m for 30 seconds, OOH offers Fifa the chance to saturate the real-world environments where fans live, travel and gather. From city-center fan festivals to screens outside stadiums, out-of-home gives the World Cup a physical presence months before kickoff.

If Fifa's $5m spend in Q2 is any indication, OOH is no longer just a backdrop for major tournaments. It is becoming one of the lead platforms, capable of delivering cultural ownership in the places fans experience sport together, on the streets, in transit and across every corner of the host cities.

Mexico next year will host FIFA World Cup games in three cities. But the country's tourism chief says the tournament will be a nationwide celebration that will attract more than 5 million visitors and benefit the entire country.

Mexico's Secretary of Tourism, Josefina Rodríguez Zamora, and Gabriela Cuevas Barrón, the country's representative for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, have unveiled a national tourism strategy designed to harness the full potential of the world's biggest sporting event.

Unveiled at the Punto México centre in Mexico City in front of business chambers, tourism organizations, and industry leaders, the strategy includes “concrete actions” to promote Mexico to millions of visitors and global audiences during the month-long tournament.

Rodríguez stressed the goal is to benefit all 32 of Mexico's states, not just the three host cities – Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. By coordinating public and private efforts, the government aims to welcome more than 5.5 million additional visitors, generate investment, create jobs, and strengthen Mexico's image as one of the world's leading tourism and cultural destinations.

The Caribbean Journal says the plan “envisions not just matchday crowds, but cultural experiences that unfold across the country. From June 5 to July 22, the “México de mis Sabores” Gastronomic Festival will showcase the flavors of every region. Archaeological zones will host exhibitions of the traditional Mesoamerican ballgame, and Pueblos Mágicos will see beautification projects under the Rutas Mágicas de Color program.”

After the matches are over, Mexico City Stadium will be transformed into a convention and trade centre. In Guadalajara, officials are creating new tourism routes and upgrading hotels and the airport to accommodate tens of thousands of fans.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest in history, with 48 teams competing in 104 matches across Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Mexico will host 13 matches, including the opening ceremony and match at Mexico City Stadium (formerly Estadio Azteca) on 11JUN, 2026. The stadium will become the only venue in the world to have hosted three World Cup openers, after doing so in 1970 and 1986.

“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to trigger new investments, strengthen tourism employment, and promote Mexico as what it truly is: one of the most important destinations in the world,” Rodríguez said.

GOAL breaks down all 36 participants in the latest edition of the European club game's most prestigious tournament

The Champions League is almost back! On Thursday, the eagerly-awaited draw for the league phase will take place in Monaco. Obviously, with this being a UEFA-run competition, the ceremony will needlessly take well over an hour, as the European game's governing body always insists on carrying out painfully awkward interviews while dishing out meaningless awards.

However, if last year's event is anything to go by, we should learn the computer-generated fixture lists for all 36 participants after about 75 minutes of tedium. After that, we'll be able to look forward to the actual football.

The Blues' talisman is already facing a short spell on the sidelines after a strenuous summer where he was overworked in the pursuit of silverware

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ben Shelton continues to turn up the heat on countryman Taylor Fritz in his quest to become the No. 1 American player before the US Open is done.

Already at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Shelton moved to within 95 points of No. 4 Fritz in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta Wednesday night inside Louis Armstrong Stadium. 

""I feel like I played well and I was happy with how I played the big points,"" Shelton said. ""It was an electric atmosphere. This is the one tournament that is all about the fans and their energy and passion for the sport.""

Shelton, who next faces wily French veteran Adrian Mannarino in the third round, is seeded to meet 2022 champion Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals. 

A 2002 US Open semi-finalist, Shelton moved into contention to challenge for the mantle of American No. 1 by winning the ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto earlier this month and in the knowledge that Fritz would drop his 1300 points by reaching the final last year at Flushing Meadows. 

Shelton has been large and in charge through the opening two rounds. He clipped 35 winners and saved all five break points in his opener against Peru's Ignacio Buse. Against former World No. 10 Carreno Busta, Shelton drilled 42 winners, including a crosscourt backhand passing shot on match point.

 Earlier in the day, Fritz underlined his 2025 US Open credentials by passing a stern second-round test on Wednesday in New York. 

 Fritz hung tough in the face of a fast start by Lloyd Harris before powering to a 4-6, 7-6(3), 6-2, 6-4 victory. A finalist last year at the hard-court major and the current leading American in the PIF ATP Rankings, World No. 4 Fritz took control of his encounter with Harris after crucially clinching the second-set tie-break inside Louis Armstrong Stadium.

 Fritz fired 54 winners, including 17 aces, to improve to 2-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Harris. Both the pair's previous tour-level meetings took place in 2020, and the 2025 incarnation of Fritz ultimately proved too strong for the South African qualifier. 

 Now 40-15 for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Fritz will take on another qualifier in the third round in Jerome Kym. The Swiss 22-year-old will be aiming to upset a higher-ranked American for the third consecutive match: He ousted Ethan Quinn in the opening round and then on Wednesday edged 30th seed Brandon Nakashima 4-6, 7-6(2), 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(10-8).

 The man Fritz defeated in the 2024 semi-finals, Frances Tiafoe, was also pushed to four sets in his second-round match. The 17th-seeded Tiafoe overcame qualifier Martin Damm 6-4, 7-5, 6-7(8), 7-5 to improve to 14-0 against players ranked outside the Top 50 at the US Open. 

 Now 24-10 at the US Open, Tiafoe will take on 11th seed Holger Rune or Jan-Lennard Struff for a fourth-round spot in New York. The charismatic American is battling to remain a Top 20 player this fortnight: With last year's semi-final points having dropped off, Tiafoe is currently down 12 spots to No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz takes very different path than Djokovic to US Open R3","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-bellucci-us-open-2025-r2","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 06:33:45 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz raced to a convincing victory Wednesday in the US Open second round, making a statement while potential semi-final opponent Novak Djokovic continues searching for his A-game.



Unbroken through two matches, the second-seed Alcaraz downed Italian Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3, a far cry from his shocking exit last year to Botic van de Zandschulp at the same stage. This time around, the Spaniard has been nearly flawless through his opening two matches. In contrast, his rival Djokovic has scraped through to the third round, needing four sets to get past Zachary Svajda earlier Wednesday, after struggling physically in his opener against Learner Tien following a six-week break from the Tour.



“If I'm honest, I thought about last year when I stepped on the court. Some bad thoughts,” Alcaraz said in his post-match press conference. “I was nervous about it, thinking, ‘Okay, I don't want to do the same thing as I did last year'.”



The 2022 champion kept World No. 65 Bellucci scrambling from the start, piling on the pressure with aggressive baseline play to race through the opening set in just 30 minutes. The 22-year-old's performance was as tight as his new buzzcut. It was Alcaraz's most decisive victory in terms of fewest games lost across his 17 completed matches at the US Open.

“I set up some goals at the beginning of the match, and I'm trying to follow them from the first ball until the last ball,” Alcaraz said. “That's something that helped me a lot to stay in the match — to stay positive, to stay aggressive all the time. Not having ups and downs in the match. It's just about the goals you set up yourself and try to follow them every time.”

Alcaraz attacked returns with fearless aggression, having won 58 per cent of his first-serve return points. Yet he still had the touch to feather delicate drop shots that impressed the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. One of his highlight-reel moments came when he unloaded a blistering 109 mph (175 km/h) forehand winner to earn a break point in the second set

“The return has been an important goal for me just to be really good and keep it really improving. There are a lot of players that are serving really, really well, which I have to be ready for that,"" said Alcaraz, who converted three of eleven break points against Opelka and seven of 17 against Bellucci.

""The return is the shot that you start the point with. If you make a really good return, you put yourself in the position of attack, which I really like being in the attack position as much as I can. I just put so much attention on it in every practice, in every match, and I'm paying attention to the stats about my return.”

Poetry in motion. @usopen | #USOpen | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/yUj6ep7kOq



The five-time major champion, who is on a eight-match winning streak dating back to his title run at the Cincinnati Open, next faces 32nd-seeded Italian Luciano Darderi, who beat American wild card Eliot Spizzirri 6-0, 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-4. It will be Alcaraz and Darderi's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.



Alcaraz is aiming for a second US Open trophy and a return to World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. If the Spaniard matches or betters Jannik Sinner's result at Flushing Meadows, Alcaraz will leave New York atop the PIF ATP Rankings. He has won 32 of his past 33 matches, with his lone loss being to Sinner in the Wimbledon final.



Leading the Tour with 56 wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and six titles this season, Alcaraz and rival Sinner could meet in a double-prize championship match, with the US Open trophy and World No. 1 honours on the line.

Backed by a raucous Court 11 crowd, Taylor Townsend upset Jelena Ostapenko to become the lowest-ranked American woman since 2019 to defeat a former Grand Slam champion at a major.

NEW YORK -- Taylor Townsend defeated No.25 seed Jelena Ostapenko 7-5, 6-1 in a tense second-round match on Court 11 Wednesday, a victory that sends the World No.139 into the third round of the US Open for the second time in three years. 

Townsend becomes the lowest-ranked American woman to defeat a former Grand Slam champion at a major since Kristie Ahn ousted Ostapenko in New York six years ago.

“She was playing amazing in the first set and couldn't miss,"" Townsend said. ""I had my head down and head in my strings and just tried to just continue to plug away. That's what I kept telling myself. Keep fighting.”

Handshake turns tense

The result included a tense exchange at the net. Townsend said the handshake became heated when Ostapenko questioned her conduct and character.

“I've never been the one to back down from anything like that,” Townsend said. “Still, there's no beef on my side. It's competition. People get upset when they lose. But you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter.”

Taking the high road

Townsend, the current No.1-ranked player in doubles, said she embraces the head-to-head intensity of tennis, even when emotions run high. “Absolutely, I'm an Aries, so I'm a fire sign,” she said, laughing. “I wore fire today. Maybe that's why I was fired up. I was ready to go.”

She explained the challenge of managing momentum shifts is what makes the sport compelling. “This is one of the reasons why I love sports,” she said. “To see how someone can handle themselves in the moment … how they handle ups and downs, how they handle momentum shifts. This is what makes sports, and that's what makes it fun.”

Townsend added that her biggest satisfaction was staying composed throughout. 

“I had accepted that mentally. This could just be one of those days, and I'm OK with that,” she said. “Today I was rock solid, and that's what I'm really, really proud of.”

HBCU Day reflections

Outside of the friction, the occasion itself carried a broader significance. Townsend's win came on HBCU Day at the US Open, a connection that resonated deeply. For her, the celebration was about more than tennis -- it was about carrying herself “in a certain type of way” and representing a culture with rich history.

Her sister attended Florida A&M, and the presence of the school's marching band on site gave the day added meaning, merging two worlds that have shaped her life.

“Representation is everything,” Townsend said, “because you have to see it to believe it, even if it's just one, and I think that's so special, especially with us honoring Althea Gibson because she was the first woman of color to show up and pave the way for us, and everyone to be here, honestly.”

What's next

Townsend will face No.5 seed Mirra Andreeva in the third round. The 18-year-old easily handled Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-1 on Wednesday afternoon. Andreeva has dropped only five games through two matches. 

She leads the head-to-head record with Townsend 1-0, a three-set win on clay in Madrid last year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Pegula, Navarro ride strong wins into US Open third round","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4351090/navarro-eases-by-mcnally-to-reach-third-round-of-us-open","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 03:22:16 GMT","

Jessica Pegula swept past Anna Blinkova in straight sets, while Emma Navarro dropped just three games against Caty McNally as both Americans moved into Round 3.

NEW YORK -- One year ago, Americans Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro both reached the semifinals here.

It isn't happening at this US Open, because the draw won't allow it -- if they continue to advance, the good friends would collide in the quarterfinals. For now, they are both safely into the third round after eerily similar Wednesday victories.

The No. 4-seeded Pegula was a 6-1, 6-3 winner over Anna Blinkova, while earlier No. 10 Navarro was a 6-2, 6-1 winner over fellow American Caty McNally.

“Yeah, really happy,” Pegula said in her on-court interview. “I've seen her beat a lot of top players. I really didn't want her to get into a rhythm because she's dangerous.

“I'm glad I came out fast and strong.”

Pegula has now won five of six matches against the No. 80-ranked Blinkova and will face Victoria Azarenka, a 6-3, 6-3 winner over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, on Friday.

“I know she hasn't been playing that much and she's been hurt and all these things, but at the same time, when she's on, she's probably one of the best baseliners we've ever had,” Pegula said of Azarenka. “I mean, she can go toe to toe with anybody when she's playing really well.”

This was the scene of Pegula's breakthrough in 2024, when she reached her first Grand Slam final before losing to Aryna Sabalenka. Previously, the 31-year-old had played in six major quarterfinals but never advanced further.

Fun (and revealing) fact: Pegula has now won 20 matches this year on American soil, more than any Hologic WTA Tour player.

One of Pegula's greatest strengths is her consistency. This was her 13th straight victory against an opponent ranked outside the Top 50 at US Open. She's also one of only two women, along with Iga Swiatek, to reach the third round of the US Open in each of the past five years -- and now the first American to do it six years in a row since Madison Keys (2015-20).

Confidence building 📈Emma Navarro is into the third round in New York.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/PMoYzWibJL

Blinkova, 26, had only prevailed in three of her 14 previous matches against Top 5 players, but one of those came last year at Indian Wells -- against Pegula.

After saving a break point in her first service game, Pegula came back to break Blinkova -- at love, with a backhand winner. It happened two more times in the first set with Pegula closing it with another sweet backhand winner, her 14th of the frame.

Blinkova opened the second set with a service break, but Pegula got it right back. Then she doubled up on Blinkova to take a 3-1 lead. That was when Blinkova broke again, sending the set back on serve. Pegula, taking advantage of a netcord, broke to give herself a 5-3 lead and served it out.

In the end, Pegula's superior anticipation and movement were the difference-makers.

Pegula broke Blinkova's serve six times and finished with 30 winners, against 17 unforced errors. Blinkova was credited with seven and 11.

Before the tournament began, Pegula was asked what aspect of tennis gave her the greatest joy.

“When you do hit that stride of when you're winning and you're problem-solving and finding ways to win or dig yourself out of matches or winning tournaments,” Pegula said, “the feeling that you get from kind of doing it on your own is kind of unmatched to some other sports. 

“You have to be pretty fearless to go out there and accept that one of you guys are going to fail in front of the world by yourself on a court. When you come out on the other end of those matches, it makes it really rewarding.”

A year after her best Grand Slam result ever, Navarro produced a clinically clean victory over McNally, converting seven of her eight break-point opportunities. It was her seventh straight win in the second round of a major and it required only 76 minutes.

“It was a little bit quicker than I tend to play my matches, but it wasn't easy,” Navarro said in her on-court interview. There's been some ups and downs this year, but there's something special in the air here.”

This year's path to the final four looks more difficult. Next up for Navarro: two-time Grand Slam singles champion Barbora Krejcikova, who took out Moyuka Uchijima in straight sets. No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva could await in the fourth round.

Navarro, 24, is now 2-0 against McNally, who was playing on a wild card granted by the USTA. McNally, 23, was trying to equal her best Grand Slam performance; she reached the third round here five years ago. She's now gone 0-8 against Top 20 players in the PIF WTA Rankings.

The match, played on a beautiful breezy day on the well-attended Grandstand Court, got off to a scratchy start, with three consecutive service breaks. But when a McNally forehand strayed long, at the 22-minute mark, it was 3-1, Navarro. There was another break in the seventh game and Navarro nailed down the first set when she converted her third set point.

Navarro got off to a quick 3-0 start in the second, but McNally broke through in the fourth game. Navarro shrugged it off, winning the last three games of the match, finishing with a forehand winner into the open court.

Azarenka moves on

She's 36 now and ranked outside the Top 100, but Victoria Azarenka -- a two-time Grand Slam champion -- still has some championship chops.

Her 6-3, 6-3 victory over No. 45-ranked Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova created several noteworthy milestones. Azarenka became:

“She started really strong,” Azarenka said of Pavlyuchenkova's early 3-0 lead. “I felt like had to find a little bit my feet, make a few more first balls and start dictating.”

Azarenka ultimately won 12 of the last 15 games.

The win over Pavlyuchenkova in Stadium 17 was her eighth in 10 meetings, the most she's had against any other player. Among active players, only Venus Williams (94) has appeared in more Grand Slam main draws than Azarenka (69).

Azarenka broke Pavlyuchenkova five times and finished with four more winners than unforced errors, 15-11.

NEW YORK — Can lightning strike twice for Alexei Popyrin at the US Open?For the second year in a row, the Australian is set to face the tournament's defending champion, this time world No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday.Last year, Popyrin shocked the tennis world with his third-round win over Novak Djokovic, who was chasing his record 25th Grand Slam title.

“For me, I feel like if I can stick to my game, if I can play the way I want to play, then I can cause trouble.”

That Djokovic win was a career highlight. It was Popyrin's third Grand Slam meeting with Djokovic that year, having taken sets off him at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon before Djokovic prevailed. But in New York, Popyrin turned the tables, arriving fresh after winning his biggest title to date at the ATP Masters 1000 in Montreal and stunning Djokovic in four sets.This season has been different. Currently ranked No. 36, Popyrin's best results are quarterfinal runs in Monte Carlo and Toronto. Without a title coming into the US Open, he admits confidence isn't quite as high but says he's leaning on his experience and preparation.“I think there's a game plan to beat anybody, I think everybody has some sort of weakness,” he said. “A lot of the top guys, they hide it really really well… But I feel like everyone does have a weakness.”“I just have to focus on myself, just have to focus on what I'm doing,” he added. “For me, that's playing aggressive and playing my game. I have to focus on myself and just doing what I've been doing in the last couple of months, because it's been working.”

Popyrin actually holds the head-to-head edge over Sinner, though their only meeting came on clay in Madrid in 2021—a lifetime ago considering the Italian's surge to the top. Sinner is now world No. 1 and the reigning champion at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open.“He's just an unbelievable ballstriker,” Popyrin said of Sinner. “You give him a little bit of time, if you give him a slow ball, he'll put you away. If you hit the same rhythm to him all the time, he'll be unbelievable.“His serve has improved over the years, and I think that's what got him to where he is now… his returns are good. He's just an all-around great player and an unbelievable mover too.”

Could Popyrin be primed for another upset?

Osaka has worn a floral-inspired Nike kit at nearly every Grand Slam this year. At the Australian Open, she rocked a sunflower-themed kit, complete with matching clips and earrings. At Roland Garros, she went full ‘sakura' with cherry blossom nails and magical girl-inspired hair.At Wimbledon, however, she hit pause on the floral looks, opting for a more understated white outfit after an early exit in Paris.“Since it's Wimbledon and I haven't really seen anyone doing anything, I felt like I was being the extra one again,” Osaka told press in London. “Spoiler alert, but the US Open (outfit) is really extra.”

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

The current grid have reacted to the upcoming returns of Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez, with the pair set to partner at Cadillac in 2026 after a year out each.

The F1 paddock has been reacting to the news that Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas will both return to the grid for Cadillac in 2026, with a number of drivers welcoming the announcement as well as giving their take on the challenge ahead for the veteran racers.

Amid months of speculation over who the new team would chose as their line-up for what will be their inaugural season in Formula 1, it was confirmed on Tuesday that the squad have opted for Perez and Bottas in a pairing that brings with it a wealth of experience.

One of the first to give their reaction during Thursday's media day at the Dutch Grand Prix was Max Verstappen, Perez's former team mate at Red Bull between 2021 and 2024. The World Champion said: “When I saw the news come out, I sent a message to him. Of course [I'm] very happy for him that he got a seat.

“He's a great guy and we always got along very well, so I'm happy to see him back on the grid. How he's going to perform I think will also depend on how good the car is going to be, so it's a bit difficult to say at the moment. But it's a new opportunity and I'm sure he's very excited for it.”

Perez was left without a seat in 2025 following a difficult campaign with Red Bull last year, resulting in both parties agreeing to part ways with immediate effect at the end of the 2024 season.

Pushed on whether he expects the Mexican to get back to his best at Cadillac, Verstappen responded: “It's a fresh start now. From his side, one half [of a season] or a season doesn't define what you can do.

“I think he's also quite easy in [his approach to] that – some people maybe dwell on it a bit more, but for Checo it's a new start, [he'll be] excited, and new cars also. And he has shown a lot of great things even before he got to Red Bull [and] during the Red Bull times. He just needs to go in there, enjoy it again and have a good time.”

With Perez having raced for the likes of McLaren and Force India prior to his Red Bull stint, Verstappen believes that this experience could prove valuable for the new Cadillac outfit.

“He has driven for a lot of different teams, so he knows a lot of things about how teams work,” the Dutchman explained. “Every single team works a little bit in a different way, so that's already I think a very interesting trait, that sometimes it's nice to understand what people are good at or what some are worse at – that's how it goes.""

Another driver to understand the benefit of experience is Fernando Alonso, who echoed Verstappen's view when asked about Cadillac's decision to opt for that asset over youth.

“It brings for sure some good things in the way that you understand the cars, you understand the needs,” said the Aston Martin driver. “They both have been working with top teams. Valtteri and Mercedes, Checo and Red Bull, so they know the philosophy that you need to apply every weekend to stay at the top.

“I think for a new team, for sure, they bring some great experience and some great value. I'm happy for them, happy to welcome them again on the grid and have fun next year.”

Pierre Gasly, meanwhile, hailed the return of two “unique” personalities to the sport, with the Alpine racer commenting: “I think it's amazing for the sport. They are two amazing characters, very successful F1 drivers and being very much part of it over the last 10 years.

“Getting race wins, fighting for podiums, and they are two unique characters in their personalities. I think it's great to have them both back in the paddock and I'm sure they'll add good spice to the racing.”

Alex Albon, meanwhile, reflected on how much of a challenge returning after a year on the sidelines can be, having experienced this himself when he found himself back on the grid with Williams in 2022 following a season spent as a test and reserve driver for Red Bull.

“I would say one of the benefits to my year – and I think also to Checo and Valtteri's year – is the regulation reset, so you don't get the drivers carrying the experience of the last few years in that car regulation, and then it's a bit more of a level playing field when you return,” Albon conceded.

“I don't know how involved they were in terms of keeping sharp and training and driving or whatnot. I remember in my year I was doing some Pirelli tests and doing a lot of simulator work, which definitely helped.

“We're in slightly different positions because they have a lot of experience, so they could probably get away with not doing anything [in their year off], but my year was a bit more spent on trying to learn and still make sure that I was as prepared as I could have been for my Williams seat.

“I don't think with their experience they've missed out on much, but I think they'll fall into things pretty quickly.”

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Pirelli have confirmed the tyre compounds that will be used across the Dutch Grand Prix weekend.

The second half of the 2025 F1 season gets underway this weekend at the Dutch Grand Prix – and tyre suppliers Pirelli have now confirmed the compounds that the teams and drivers will have available to them.

For the event at Zandvoort – which will also mark the 500th World Championship round in which Pirelli have had a presence, with their first being at the maiden championship race at Silverstone back in 1950 – the compounds in play will be the C2 as the hard, the C3 as the medium and the C4 as the soft. This selection is one step softer than that brought to the 2024 Dutch Grand Prix.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

In terms of why this year's compounds are a step softer than those used in Zandvoort last year, Pirelli's weekend preview explains: “The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.”

Reflecting on the conditions that the drivers and teams can expect, the preview continues: “A lap of the Zandvoort track is 4.259 kilometres in length, running through the dunes on the North Sea coast, just under 40 kilometres from the capital of the Netherlands.

“It boasts 14 low to medium-speed corners – four to the left and 10 to the right – of which the third and last are banked at angles of 19 and 18 degrees respectively, much steeper than the turns at Indianapolis.

“These corners generate very high vertical and lateral loads on the tyres, which requires the teams to pay close attention to set-up and management of the car-tyre package. The aerodynamic downforce level required is very high, similar to that seen in Budapest.

“The track usually offers low levels of grip and this can be greatly exacerbated by sand blown onto the surface by the coastal winds. Being just a few hundred metres from the North Sea, the weather can be very changeable and, at the end of summer, temperatures are usually already below 20C.”

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

All the talking points rounded up as F1 ACADEMY's drivers prepare to hit the track at Zandvoort.

Putting the summer break behind them and dusting off their race suits, the F1 ACADEMY grid reunite for an all-important visit to Zandvoort.

The only venue to have featured across all three F1 ACADEMY seasons so far, and following testing there last month, the field should be well-acquainted with what to expect.

Yet with title fights and maiden podiums at stake, we'll be waiting to see who comes out swinging in Round 5.

Picking up her third win of the campaign in Montreal, Doriane Pin not only became 2025's first repeat winner but, crucially, regained the lead of the Drivers' standings after a two-round break.

It's not only the top spot that has changed, as Chloe Chambers has become her nearest rival, 20 points behind the French racer. Contact from her Campos Racing team mate Alisha Palmowski cost the Red Bull Ford driver a chance at victory in Montreal Race 1, but Chambers' mood was improved after she scored her first victory of the year with a controlled performance from pole.

Dropping to third, Maya Weug endured a nightmare weekend in Canada, with technical issues denying her a chance to fight for meaningful points. Race 3 proved to be the Ferrari driver's only silver lining, as she gained nine places to go from 15th to sixth, but she is left 37 points adrift of Pin.

A very competitive outing in Zandvoort last year saw Pin earn her first clean sweep, securing pole position, fastest lap and the win in Race 2.

If she outscores Chambers by more than 19 points, she'll move over a maximum weekend points haul clear of the American – with 39 points up for grabs this weekend.

The most Pin has outscored Chambers by so far is 12, but she has a golden opportunity to head into the final two rounds in Singapore and Las Vegas with the title within touching distance.

Alisha Palmowski will be looking to get back on form after a disappointing time in Canada. That's not to say the Red Bull Racing driver wasn't quick, netting a second consecutive front row start in Qualifying.

Yet her high hopes dissolved on the opening laps, with a brave move into Turn 1 causing contact with Chambers in Race 1, and a tangle with McLaren's Ella Lloyd in Race 3 costing her a chance at the podium.

Relinquishing the top rookie spot to Lloyd – who claimed three consecutive P2 finishes – Palmowski is still firmly inside the chasing pack in fifth.

Fortunately, the forecast looks optimistic for Palmowski. With rain expected across the weekend, the weather could play to her strengths as the Briton relishes the wet conditions. Combined with strong performances during in-season testing at Zandvoort, her return to silverware shouldn't take long.

Although PREMA Racing are two-time Teams' Champions, they haven't always looked like the squad to beat this year. Following Round 3 in Miami, PREMA were stuck down in third, 20 points behind leaders Campos Racing and six behind MP Motorsport.

One round later and the Italian team now hold a 27-point lead over Campos, outscoring their rivals by 47 points.

Pin's victory and P3 finish in Race 3 were complemented by Alpine driver Nina Gademan's double podium and Aston Martin's Tina Hausmann matching her best result in F1 ACADEMY with a P4 finish in Race 3.

By contrast, Campos missed out on four points-scoring opportunities in Montreal, two more than they'd lost out on across the previous three rounds. Marking the first time they've sat top of the Teams' Standings all season, can PREMA keep up the pace or will we see a resurgence from Campos?

Sitting in sixth, Tommy Hilfiger's Alba Larsen remains the highest-placed driver yet to score a podium. Her best result came courtesy of a P4 finish in Race 2, in what was a stellar debut weekend in Shanghai. Since that point, the Dane has kept consistent, delivering four further top-five finishes.

Interestingly, following Emma Felbermayr's win in Montreal Race 2, 2025 has witnessed three of the top-five youngest race winners. Crucially, the Kick Sauber driver was only a month older than Bianca Bustamante was when she set the record aged 18 years, 3 months and 18 days at Valencia Race 2 in 2023.

As a result, only Larsen, her MP Motorsport team mate Joanne Ciconte and TAG Heuer's Aiva Anagnostiadis are eligible to beat that record by the end of the season.

Based on their performances up to this point, wins and podiums don't seem too far away for Larsen, and with her getting picked up by the Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy for 2026, she's certainly one to take note of.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will resume their intra-team fight at the upcoming Dutch Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri has taken a moment to reflect on his battle against McLaren team mate Lando Norris this season, with the championship situation finely poised ahead of the decisive 10-round run-in.

Making the most of an ultra-competitive McLaren package, Piastri and Norris often found themselves in a fight of their own over the first 14 Grand Prix weekends – the Australian winning six races to the Briton's five so far.

While there have been some dramatic moments, such as a collision at the Canadian Grand Prix and close calls during wheel-to-wheel scraps in Austria and Hungary, the two drivers have maintained cordial relations.

Speaking ahead of the campaign resuming at the Dutch Grand Prix, Piastri provided some more insight on the intra-team environment – and how the two McLaren drivers are balancing their respective bids for the individual title with the team's collective goals.

“Our relationship hasn't really changed,” Piastri, who leads Norris by a slender margin of nine points, explained in an interview for the official McLaren website.

“The competitive environment is quite different this year, yes, but our relationship is pretty much the same. The way we work together, how we try and help the team, and what we want from the car, it is all the same.

“I think we're both very conscious that we want to have success with this team for a long time. That is not lost on either of us. Healthy competition is important, of course, but it is important to keep the team united, and I think we both have that in the back of our minds.”

Piastri, who is navigating his third season in F1, compared to Norris' seventh, also reflected more generally on how he has dealt with the weight of being in contention for the title.

“I would say I've handled it well, but this has been the part of the year when the pressure isn't really on in the championship fight,” he commented.

“Obviously, you don't want to give away points, but it has been far too early to be thinking of the season in that way. At this stage, you just want to go into the weekend trying to get the most out of it as you can, rather than thinking of the championship overall.

“So yes, I think I've handled it well, but I haven't concentrated on it much.”

Looking ahead, though, Piastri admitted: “The pressure is only going to increase from here. When we get to the latter part of the year, that is when the pressure will ramp up.”

While Piastri and Norris' head-to-head looks set to rumble on, McLaren are cruising towards back-to-back Teams' Championship titles for the first time since 1991 – boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari in the standings.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Heading to the Dutch Grand Prix? Here's your guide to all things off-track in Zandvoort, plus what to see, eat and do in Amsterdam while you're visiting the Netherlands.

Rain clouds might be rolling in over the Dutch coast for the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix weekend, but that's all part of the classic Zandvoort experience. This is Formula 1 at its most atmospheric: an old school seaside circuit where the roar of engines mixes with the crash of waves from the North Sea... not to forget the occasional downpour.

For travelling fans, heading to the Dutch Grand Prix offers more than just wheel-to-wheel action. Between the sand dunes and the coastline cafes, the winding streets of Zandvoort and the canals of nearby Amsterdam, there's plenty to explore come rain or shine.

Here's your guide to making the most of it: what to pack (you'll fit right in with something orange), where to wander, and the little hacks all fans should get to know.

Zandvoort isn't just known for its racetrack, it's been a beach resort since the 19th century. That means plenty of cafes, a lively promenade, and rolling sand dunes right on the circuit's doorstep.

Coffee with a view
Independent beach cafes line the seafront – the perfect place to sip a cappuccino while watching the waves.

Beach life (with a twist)
This is the North Sea, not the Caribbean. Sunny days do occur in August, but breezes are guaranteed, and the sea is bracing at best. Pack layers and a windbreaker along with your sunglasses. On warmer days, you'll see paddleboarders and surfers; on cooler ones, a brisk beach walk is just as good. A beach towel and a poncho might both be useful on the same day.

The dunes
Behind the town lie the Zuid-Kennemerland dunes, part of a national park that is home to red deer, highland cattle, and foxes. Cycle or hike through – but be warned, it's beautifully exposed, so if the weather turns, you'll feel it first!

Zandvoort sits on the North Sea coast, just 25 miles (40km) away from Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport. The circuit encourages fans to arrive sustainably by public transport, bike, or shuttle bus:

Cars
During the Dutch Grand Prix, Zandvoort and surrounding municipalities are closed to cars and motorcycles, so opt for park and bike, or park and bus options for your journey.

Bus
If you're staying in the Amstelland or Haarlemmermeer region, public bus transport is a great option. Boarding at a nearby bus stop, you are then dropped off within a short walk of Circuit Zandvoort.

Shuttle Bus
Another option for comfortable travel to the Grand Prix is by luxury coach. Tickets start at €30, for guaranteed seating, and you'll disembark right at the gates of the circuit. Afterward, you'll be returned to your departure point. Simple!

Train
Taking the train is a popular travel option for fans, as the Zandvoort aan Zee station is within walking distance of Circuit Zandvoort. Extra trains are being run over the Grand Prix weekend to keep waiting times as short as possible. However, if you're taking the train to the circuit from Amsterdam, go earlier than you think you'll need to. Carriages turn into a rolling orange army, and it's all part of the experience! Fans are advised to buy train tickets in advance to save time when travelling.

Cycling
Cycling to the circuit is one of the most unique travel experiences on the F1 calendar. Feel the breeze in your hair as you head along costal paths surrounded by hundreds of other fans – there's nothing quite like it! Don't have a bike? No need to fear, as you can rent one for the duration of the weekend, with cycle parking included. Head here for more information.

Circuit Zandvoort is famed for being old-school, narrow, and full of character. Drivers rave about its fast, sweeping corners and dramatic banking, while fans get incredible photo ops.

Top corners to take in the views
Tarzanbocht (Turn 1) is legendary for overtakes. The Arie Luyendykbocht, the banked final corner, slings cars onto the pit straight at around 180mph.

Fanzone
Expect lots of music, activations fun for fans of all ages, and plenty of orange everywhere. Just don't rely on your phone signal when the crowd is at full capacity – screenshot maps ahead of time and agree on meeting spots with your friends.

Photo spots

When the engines stop, the party continues in Zandvoort! Here are some ideas on how to spend your evenings after the on-track action halts for the night:

Live music at the Fanzone
Head to the Main Stage at the Fanzone for a host of music and entertainment that goes deep into the evening, from Dutch pop stars and rock bands to hip-hop acts and world-class DJs, and even a 90s disco. See the full line-up here.

Zandvoort Race Festival
Based on Zandvoort beach is a festival of motorsport celebration with plenty of activities and experiences to get your teeth into.

Beach bars & fire pits
Toast the day with your toes in the sand – a relaxing option after a busy day at the circuit.

Local Flavours
Try some Dutch seafood, from fried fish snacks to mussels – or go sweet with the infamous stroopwafels and poffertjes.

Nearby Haarlem
Just a short train ride away, this smaller city feels like a “mini-Amsterdam” but brimming with medieval character. With cobbled streets, gabled houses, and canal-side cafes, it's a great option for an evening adventure outside of Zandvoort. There are plenty of dining options and bars to enjoy, or relish in an evening stroll around the city's outlying tulip fields and art museums.

Watch out for bikes
Locals cycle fast and always have right of way. Cycle lanes are sacred in the Netherlands – step into one while posing for a photo and you'll be sure to get a stern Dutch glare!

Tap & go everywhere
Contactless payments are king in the Netherlands. Trains, trams, buses, supermarkets – just tap your debit/credit card or phone, no ticket machines needed.

Weather-proof packing
Even though it's August, assume it'll rain at some point. Locals carry foldable rain jackets, not umbrellas (too windy!). Copy them, they know best!

Keeping hydrated
Tap water is safe and high quality, so need to keep buying bottles.

Key Dutch phrases to learn
Nearly everyone speaks excellent English in Amsterdam and the surrounding areas but learning a few basics like 'dank je wel' (thank you) or 'alsjeblieft' (please) gets you extra smiles.

Public Transport Etiquette
Don't stand on the left of escalators – that's the side for overtaking. The Dutch are big fans of public transport but it's important to remain respectful of others around you.

Bike hire wisdom
If you decide to rent a bike, perhaps avoid the busiest parts of Amsterdam (Damrak, Red Light District). Instead, try the canals around Jordaan or Vondelpark for a more relaxed and scenic ride.

Most fans flying in will pass through Amsterdam, and it's worth a short trip if you have a few extra days in the area before or after the race weekend. Just 30 minutes from Zandvoort by train, the capital offers culture, food, and nightlife in equal measure.

Canal Belt magic
Amsterdam's historic canal ring is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it's as photogenic as it gets. Pro tip: as mentioned above, a rain jacket is better than an umbrella – sudden showers + cobblestones + bikes can get messy.

Museum Mile
Amsterdam boasts over 70 museums and art galleries – but be sure to make your way to Museumplein for many of the big hitters such as the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, and the Stedelijk for modern art. Perfect for a drizzly afternoon. Timing trick: Amsterdam's big museums are busiest late morning. Head early (just after opening) or later in the afternoon for a calmer experience.

F1 Exhibition
For a limited time, the Formula 1 Exhibition heads to Amsterdam! Until September 7, immerse yourself on a journey though the world of F1 and it's history... and future.

Neighbourhood wandering
Amsterdam consists of numerous quaint neighbourhoods and streets to explore. Some notable mooching spots including De Jordaan, with its narrow lanes, cosy cafes, and boutique shops – even in drizzle, it's charming, – and De Pijp, consisting of buzzing terraces and the Albert Cuyp street market, ideal for foodies.

Amsterdam is a compact city, so it's relatively easy to tick off a bunch of these in a single walk. Just watch out for bikes when you're pausing for the shot!

There are endless options for unique food and drink experiences within Amsterdam and the surrounding areas. Stroopwafels, poffertjes, and fries with mayo are all Dutch staples you'll find everywhere – try these and it'll be clear why they're beloved delicacies in the country! Feeling brave? Try raw herring “Amsterdam style”, eaten with pickles and onions.

From canal-side pubs to big squares such as Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein, Amsterdam keeps the party going late.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Cadillac have plumped for a veteran driver pairing of Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez to lead the charge when they arrive in Formula 1 next year – but who did other new F1 teams choose as their first driver pairings – and how did they fare?

Veteran racers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are set to lead the charge for Cadillac when they arrive in Formula 1 next year.

The Finn and the Mexican have bags of F1 know-how and boast 527 Grands Prix, 16 victories, and 106 podiums between them.

Not every new team opts for such an experienced pairing for their debut season though. We've taken a look back at the new teams who have arrived in F1 across the last three decades to see what kind of line-up they went for, and how things panned out…

Formula 1 had two new teams in 1997, as Lola and Stewart Grand Prix joined the fray. Lola opted for the inexperienced Vincenzo Sospiri and Ricardo Rosset, but the occupants of the machinery mattered little considering the team was woefully off the pace. They failed to qualify in Australia, and then disappeared off the grid entirely amid financial problems.

Stewart, meanwhile, eventually morphed into the title-winning Red Bull Racing outfit. When Sir Jackie Stewart and son Paul brought their eponymous team onto the grid, with support from Ford, they recruited Rubens Barrichello and Jan Magnussen, father of former Haas racer Kevin.

Barrichello had four years of competing for Jordan, which had yielded him a pole and two podiums, while de facto rookie Magnussen was a highly rated youngster with one stand-in appearance in 1995 to his name.

Stewart's SF01 was unreliable and saw the finish just eight times out of 34 across the two cars, but Barrichello stayed out of trouble in a rain-hit race in Monaco to score a remarkable second place – the team's sole points of 1997. Barrichello stayed for three years, before moving on to Ferrari, though Magnussen was axed partway through 1998, and replaced by Max Verstappen's dad Jos.

BAR technically acquired the entry of the once-mighty Tyrrell outfit, but to all intents and purposes they were a new team for 1999, kickstarting the operation that now operates as Mercedes after phases as Honda and, unforgettably, Brawn.

BAR recruited Jacques Villeneuve, the 1997 World Champion, with the Canadian managed by the outfit's Team Principal, Craig Pollock. For the other seat they snapped up rookie Ricardo Zonta, who had claimed successive titles in Formula 3000 and the FIA GT Championship.

BAR had high hopes and bold claims pre-season, but 1999 proved to be a disaster. The car showed glimpses of performance but unreliability stymied any hopes of big points hauls, with Villeneuve retiring from the first 11 races.

An injured Zonta was replaced by Mika Salo for three Grands Prix and the Finn took the team's best result of seventh – but even then failed to see the flag due to a technical issue.

Villeneuve stuck around until 2003, before brief stints at Renault and Sauber/BMW, while Zonta was replaced after 2000, following which he started just seven more rounds as a stand-in at Jordan and Toyota.

Toyota spent a couple of years preparing for their Formula 1 entry, including a sizeable testing programme in 2001, and went for two experienced drivers – though only one with Formula 1 race experience.

Mika Salo was a veteran of the midfield, with six seasons under his belt and two podiums during his stint as Michael Schumacher's injury replacement at Ferrari in 1999. Alongside Salo was Allan McNish, who had first tested Formula 1 machinery in the late 1980s, before embarking on a prolifically successful sportscar career, sparking the link with Toyota.

Despite the team's finances and build-up, their TF102 car often remained towards the rear of the field, with Salo scoring two points via a pair of sixth places in attritional races in Australia and Brazil.

McNish failed to score and brought his season – and Formula 1 race career – to a premature halt after a violent accident during Qualifying for the finale at Suzuka, with the subsequent race proving to be Salo's swansong as both were axed for 2003.

Super Aguri joined the grid in 2006 as an effective Honda satellite team, handily providing refuge for one-time podium finisher Takuma Sato after he lost his seat at BAR-Honda.

Sato's selection was widely expected but the identity of his team mate was a surprise, as Super Aguri signed his compatriot, 31-year-old Yuji Ide.

Super Aguri joined the field with an updated version of a 2002-spec Arrows A23 and were consequently off the pace, with Sato faring significantly better than rookie Ide, who was a frontrunner in Formula Nippon and Super GT but had zero experience of the Formula 1 landscape.

After a string of dire displays – which included tipping Christijan Albers into a spectacular barrel roll at Imola – Ide was replaced by Renault tester Franck Montagny, who performed respectably, before a third newcomer, Sakon Yamamoto, took over the seat for the remainder of the season.

Super Aguri's performances improved and Sato capped the season with a top-10 result in Brazil. Neither Ide nor Montagny raced in Formula 1 again beyond their brief Super Aguri spells.

Formula 1 welcomed three new teams in 2010 and each took a different approach to their driver line-up.

Lotus, run by Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes, with cars designed by former Jordan, Renault and Toyota engineer Mike Gascoyne, went for experience.

Jarno Trulli had been left unemployed by Toyota's decision to withdraw from Formula 1, and he put pen to paper at Lotus, bringing with him over 200 starts, 11 podiums and a victory.

Heikki Kovalainen was another refugee, after his replacement by World Champion Jenson Button at McLaren, where he had spent two years and taken a win and three podiums.

Kovalainen regularly led the ‘new teams' charge in 2010 (more on which below), though neither he nor Trulli troubled the top 10, with the Lotus T127 off the pace of the midfield outfits. Trulli exited at the end of 2011, and Kovalainen after 2012, as the spiralling team chased alternative options.

Virgin Racing were another new team in 2010, run by prolific single-seater outfit Manor Motorsport, and they opted for experience and youth.

Like Trulli, Timo Glock found himself on the market after three years at the departing Toyota team, where he had claimed three podiums. Virgin signed rookie Lucas di Grassi for the second car, after the Brazilian had spent several years as a frontrunner in the GP2 Series.

The VR-01 was off the pace and unreliable, and typically it was Glock who led the charge, but without any realistic threat of scoring points.

Glock spent three years at the team before worsening finances prompted the squad to look for other drivers, ending his Formula 1 career, while Di Grassi lasted only one season.

Hispania arrived in 2010 on a wing and a prayer following financial strife and managerial upheaval during the months of preparation for their first race.

Bruno Senna – nephew of F1 legend Ayrton – was signed in late 2009 when the team were still under the control of Campos, and the GP2 Series runner-up and one-time Honda test driver's contract was honoured by the new ownership.

Karun Chandhok was signed just a couple of weeks before the season opener, and such was the rush that his first laps in the F110 came during Qualifying for the season opener in Bahrain.

Ex-Super Aguri and Spyker racer Sakon Yamamoto came on board mid-season, initially in place of Senna, before taking Chandhok's seat, while ex-Red Bull racer Christian Klien had two starts later in the season.

None stayed on for 2011, though Senna did go on to have slightly more success during a half-season with the Lotus-branded Renault team, and then with Williams.

Haas went for experience when they joined the grid in 2016, taking on Romain Grosjean and Esteban Gutierrez.

Grosjean had spent four years at Renault/Lotus, following an initial abortive spell in 2009, picking up 10 podiums, and his recruitment was aided by the financial uncertainty that enveloped the squad in the mid-late 2010s.

Gutierrez spent 2013/14 competing for Sauber, and 2015 as Ferrari's test driver, before linking up with Grosjean.

The Frenchman stunned on Haas' debut by taking sixth, improving next time out to fifth, and scored all of Haas' points that season.

Gutierrez was often in the shadows, and beset by the lion's share of the team's issues, and the partnership ended after just one year, ending Gutierrez's Formula 1 career.

But Grosjean spent five seasons with Haas, and his fourth place in Austria in 2018 remains Haas' best result in Formula 1.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31.

*From the last four races in the Netherlands

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference.

You don't really appreciate the banking until you go around it at Turn 3. The theory is multiple lines, but everyone just bolts for the outside line and tries to get the exit right. And again, coming through the final corner as well, running the banking.

It is a nice, flowing track. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well...

“For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The teams will have a choice of the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, whereas in 2024 the available compounds were C1, C2 and C3.

“The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.

“[In 2024], 16 drivers lined up on the grid on the medium tyre, while three – Lewis Hamilton, Yuki Tsunoda and Valtteri Bottas – went for the soft, with Kevin Magnussen starting from the pit lane on hards. Three quarters of the field made just one stop during the race, taking on the hard as the second set, while Magnussen went with the medium.

“The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium.

“Nico Hulkenberg drove the longest stint of all, completing 57 laps on the hard. Oscar Piastri topped the list with the medium on 33 laps, while Hamilton ran 24 on the soft.”

The season resumes with things still very much all to play for in the Drivers' Championship. Just nine points now separate leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris at the top of the standings, with Norris seemingly holding the momentum after winning three of the last four Grands Prix before the summer break.

Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far.

It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. However, McLaren have also voiced their concerns about the possibility of the squad's rivals posing more of a challenge in the second half of the campaign.

Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again.

Red Bull, meanwhile, faced a challenging weekend at the Hungaroring, with the RB21 struggling to match the team's competitors. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans?

Elsewhere, the midfield battle remains as tight as ever. Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort.

James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented.

In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out.

Once the rest of the field had eventually pitted, Hunt found himself in the giddy heights of P1 – a position Lauda was desperate to reclaim. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation.

It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Watch how it all unfolded in the video player below...

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

With record-breaking attendance, unprecedented digital engagement and a blockbuster film captivating audiences worldwide, Formula 1's momentum shows no signs of slowing.

The first half of the 2025 Formula 1 season has delivered drama, innovation and record-breaking achievements, both on and off the track.

From thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing and sold-out Grands Prix to the global success of F1 The Movie and ground-breaking activations, the sport continues to accelerate into an exciting new era.

As the sport returns from the summer break, refreshed and raring to go racing once again, let's look at some of the highlights from the season so far.

The 2025 season began with a spectacular celebration of Formula 1's 75th anniversary at London's O2 Arena – F1 75 Live.

Tickets sold out in just 20 minutes, as the event brought together all 10 F1 teams – for the first time ever – to unveil their liveries ahead of the new campaign. 16,000 fans enjoyed an incredible evening that combined the glamour of Formula 1 with world-class entertainment, featuring performances from global music stars such as mgk, Take That, Tems, Kane Brown and Brian Tyler's Are We Dreaming.

The response to the event was phenomenal and helped the sport reach new audiences. Live broadcast coverage from 42 broadcast partners spanned 37 territories across the world, while 7.5 million viewers tuned in across Formula 1's social channels.

The F1 YouTube livestream alone, watched in 211 territories, was the most successful in the channel's history – setting a new record with over twice as many views as the previous best performing stream.

June saw the global release of F1 The Movie, which has become the largest-grossing sports film of all time and the highest-grossing Apple film to date, surpassing $600 million at the box office.

Directed by Joe Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the movie – Pitt's highest grossing film – has been praised for its authenticity, earning a 97% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and an ‘A' CinemaScore rating.

The production captured over 185 hours of footage at iconic circuits during actual Grand Prix weekends and was supported by more than 1,900 crew members – with roughly 400 members of the crew at each event.

More than 2,000 hours of F1 broadcast footage was recorded for the movie, which saw New York's Times Square transformed into a Formula 1 showcase for its world premiere in front of huge crowds. The European premiere in London's Leicester Square followed a week later, with both events attracting Hollywood icons, A-list celebrities, award-winning global music stars and, of course, F1 superstars.

Fan enthusiasm to attend a Grand Prix has reached unprecedented levels, with 3.9 million fans attending the first 14 races of 2025 – the highest mid-season total in Formula 1 history.

Eleven events sold out completely, with six setting new attendance records. Silverstone and Albert Park drew crowds of 500,000 and 465,000 people respectively, while Belgium, Canada, Spain and Austria also recorded attendances exceeding 300,000.

Formula 1's digital footprint has continued to expand, particularly among younger audiences, with the sport's social media following growing to 107.6 million — a 21% increase year-on-year, and up from 18.7 million in 2018.

Fans continue to watch race weekend action after events, with YouTube views for highlights climbing by 30%. The Australian Grand Prix highlights alone attracted 13 million views within the first week, making it the second largest audience on the channel after the Abu Dhabi 2021 season finale.

More time is also being spent on F1.com and the official Formula 1 app, with total content views up 17% compared to last year.

Television audiences have remained strong across key markets, with 13 of the 14 races recording year-on-year growth in live viewership.

The season-opening Australian Grand Prix weekend had over 60 million cumulative linear TV viewers worldwide, while in the United States, live race viewership is up 23% vs. the 2024 season average – the Miami Sprint also setting a new viewership record since the format was introduced in 2021.

Twelve of the 14 races this season have seen year-over-year viewership growth on ESPN in the US, with seven of them setting event viewership records. The broadcaster has also seen a 14% increase in its younger demographic (between 18-49) in comparison to 2024.

The growing global appeal of F1 has resulted in several extensions and agreements with broadcast partners around the world.

Tencent were renewed as the broadcaster for Formula 1 in mainland China, while there was a long-term extension agreed with Bell Media in Canada and Globo was confirmed as the Brazilian broadcaster from 2026.

Formula 1 now boasts a global fanbase of 827 million, cementing its position as the world's most popular annual sporting series with a year-on-year increase of 12% – and a 63% increase compared to 2018.

The fanbase is becoming younger and more diverse too, with 43% of fans now under the age of 35 – a growth of 51 million year-on-year – and female representation rising to 42%, up from 37% in 2018.

Interest in F1 continues to grow in heritage markets such as the UK (+24%), Italy (12%) and Brazil (+9%), and in growth markets including the US and China where interest has surged by 11% and 39% respectively.

The United States fanbase, supported by three unique races, has reached 52 million and is the largest F1 market for YouTube viewership (135 million) and social media followers (5.8 million), with social followers up 26% year-on-year.

Meanwhile, a sold-out Chinese Grand Prix weekend saw 220,000 fans attend earlier this year — up 9% vs. 2024 — as China reached over 221 million claimed F1 fans, up +39% year-on-year. Over half have started following the sport in the last five years, while 46% are female and 40% are aged between 16-34.

F1 holds an increasing number of prestigious partnerships, specialising in a wide variety of sectors and appealing to markets across the world, that has more than doubled since 2020 – going from 12 to 27 partners in just five years.

The first half of 2025 saw Formula 1 strengthen its commercial portfolio with major global brands. A 10-year deal began with luxury group LVMH, bringing Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Moët Hennessy – and a range of their brands including, Moët & Chandon, Belvedere, Whispering Angel and Glenmorangie – into the sport.

In May, PepsiCo joined as an Official Partner until 2030 with brands including Doritos and Sting Energy, plus Gatorade became the Official Partner of F1 Sprint. Disney's Mickey & Friends also announced a partnership set to begin in 2026.

At the start of the year, Michelin-starred chef Gordon Ramsay became a partner of the sport, delivering a world-class culinary experience in F1 Garage across 10 Grands Prix this year. Barilla, the world's biggest pasta producer, also became the Official Pasta Partner at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

Elsewhere, multi-national lottery-led entertainment company Allwyn became an Official Partner in a multi-year deal, PwC signed up as the sport's Official Consulting Partner and ALT Sports Data became the Official Betting Data Supplier, while MSC Cruises agreed a partnership extension until 2030.

There was a host of innovative partner activations that captured global attention too. At the Miami Grand Prix, for example, the Drivers' Parade featured 10 life-sized LEGO F1 cars, each built from nearly 400,000 bricks and capable of reaching 20 kph, driven – or, more accurately, raced – by the F1 drivers.

The activation received an incredible reception from media, fans, and the drivers themselves, becoming the most viewed partner content on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook ever.

The British Grand Prix also saw LEGO-designed trophies presented on the podium, celebrating the sport's 75th anniversary, while other highlights included Barilla's culinary showcase with Massimo Bottura – holder of three Michelin stars and a green Michelin star – in Bahrain, and Qatar Airways' pop-up barbershop with celebrity hair stylist Sheldon Edwards (HD Cutz) at Silverstone.

F1 ACADEMY announced multiple new partnerships too, as it continues to grow. TAG Heuer became the series' first ever Official Timekeeper, while TeamViewer, More than Equal, Wella Company and PepsiCo's Gatorade also partnered with the all-female series.

2025 has seen several Formula 1 events get long-term extensions, with the majority of the F1 calendar now contracted into the 2030s and Miami and Austria contracted until 2041.

An extension through 2028 was agreed with the Mexico City Grand Prix, while the Canadian Grand Prix was extended through 2035 and the Belgian Grand Prix was renewed on a multi-year extension.

The calendar for the 2026 season has also been announced, including further improvements to the geographical flow of races and a new circuit in Madrid – adding to the excitement of next year's new era of regulations.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Max Verstappen has done more than dominate Formula 1. He has transformed the sport in the Netherlands. From the return of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort to the rise of the Orange Army, Verstappen has turned F1 into a national passion. His victories, direct personality, and loyal fanbase have created a cultural shift that now resonates worldwide, redefining what F1 fandom looks and feels like.

At first glance, the atmosphere could be mistaken for a football match or a summer festival. Grandstands packed with thousands of fans in head-to-toe orange, flags waving and music blaring.

But this isn't a stadium or concert. It's the Dutch Grand Prix. And the Dutch fans, now known worldwide as the 'Orange Army', have turned race weekends into something closer to a national celebration.

At the centre of it all is one man: Max Verstappen. His rise to superstardom hasn't just filled grandstands, it has transformed the way the Netherlands connects with Formula 1 and reshaped the culture of the sport itself.

In the decades before Verstappen, F1 sat in the background of Dutch sporting culture. Unlike countries such as Italy, Britain or Germany, where racing heroes were household names, Dutch drivers never reached the same heights.

Jan Lammers kept the Dutch flag on the grid in the late 1970s and early 80s. Jos Verstappen, Max's father, brought excitement in the 1990s with a pair of podiums. In the 2000s, Christijan Albers added further representation, although mostly in struggling teams.

Each played a role in sustaining Dutch interest, but none managed to ignite mass appeal. TV audiences stayed loyal, but F1 remained overshadowed by football and cycling.

Everything shifted in 2015. Verstappen made history when he joined the F1 grid at just 17 years old with Toro Rosso (now Racing Bulls), becoming the youngest driver ever to start a race. Although his debut at the Australian Grand Prix ended in retirement, his flashes of raw speed made him impossible to ignore.

A year later came the turning point. After just four races of the 2016 season, he was promoted to the Red Bull team. Incredibly, he repaid their faith immediately and in his very first outing for the squad, and at 18 years and 228 days old, he became the youngest race winner in F1 history.

Suddenly, the Netherlands had its superstar. It wasn't just the records that set him apart, but the way he raced: fearless, aggressive, and unafraid to take on established champions. That same fire carried into the paddock, where his blunt answers and meme-worthy one liners to the media made him refreshingly direct and unapologetically himself.

From there, a fan movement exploded. Dutch supporters rallied around Verstappen and began travelling in massive numbers to races across Europe, especially to nearby tracks like Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps and Austria's Red Bull Ring. Whole grandstands became seas of orange, the national colour of the Netherlands, creating a carnival-like atmosphere wherever they went.

In many ways, it redefined what F1 fandom could look like. Italy has Ferrari and their dedicated Tifosi, whose passion runs deep but is tied to one team above all. Britain has its Silverstone loyalists, patriotic and knowledgeable, who turn their home race into a celebration of motorsport heritage.

The Dutch, however, brought something entirely different. Their fandom wasn't confined to a single circuit or tied to decades of tradition. Instead, they turned following Verstappen into a travelling movement, more like a football away crowd, with orange shirts, wigs and flags aplenty. They created a visual and vocal spectacle that occupied entire grandstands.

What makes them stand out even more is that their devotion has grown in lockstep with Verstappen's dominance. As he racked up victories and World Championships, setting records for consecutive wins and season victory totals, the Orange Army only became louder and more visible.

The Verstappen effect wasn't limited to the racetrack. As Dutch FIA Deputy Race Director Claire Dubbelman recalled on the BBC's Chequered Flag podcast, “The last time I lived in the Netherlands was around 2015–2016, and motorsport was in a very difficult place. When Max entered Formula 1, it's been the revival of the sport in that country.”

That revival came into full view in 2021 when the Dutch Grand Prix returned to Zandvoort after 36 years. Tickets sold out within hours, millions tuned in worldwide, and Verstappen delivered the fairytale by winning the first edition. By the following season, attendance at Zandvoort had surged by 81 percent, a clear measure of Verstappen's influence. He claimed three consecutive victories from 2021 to 2023, all from pole position, before Mclaren's Lando Norris ended the streak in 2024.

Sponsors were quick to capitalise. From global giants to local homegrown brands, companies lined up to associate with Verstappen. His face appeared on billboards, in adverts, and across merchandise that stretched far beyond core motorsport circles.

With that came something larger: a sense of national identity. Verstappen was no longer simply an athlete. He had become a cultural icon, embodying Dutch pride both on and off the track.

The ripple effects have extended far beyond the Netherlands. The Orange Army is now part of F1's global identity, their seas of orange as recognisable as Ferrari red or Mercedes silver. Their travelling presence adds spectacle to broadcasts and has inspired other fan groups to raise their game, making races louder, more colourful, and more vibrant.

Verstappen's rise has opened new doors for the sport. Dutch fans quickly became one of the sport's fastest growing markets, while the Orange Army's spectacle turned into a selling point for promoters worldwide.

Their energy is celebrated in broadcasts, documentaries, and campaigns highlighting a new era driven as much by fans as by the racing itself. And through it all, Verstappen's story sits at the heart of this shift. His dominance has given his fans more to celebrate, and their devotion has helped redefine the atmosphere of the sport.

With the Dutch Grand Prix back at Zandvoort this weekend and for the second-last time before a scheduled farewell in 2026, the Orange Army may be gearing up to make its most passionate statement yet.

Whatever comes next, Verstappen's legacy is already secure. He did more than win races, he gave the Dutch a reason to fall in love with F1 – and in doing so, changed how the world experiences it.

Norris was also the race winner when F1 visited Zandvoort in 2024 – but can the 25-year-old repeat that this time around, or will Piastri return to the top step of the podium?

The producers behind popcorn thriller 'G20' were sued on Wednesday for copyright infringement. There's been an uptick in accusations of infringement in recent years, though that hasn't led to much success for those filing the lawsuits. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	It's a tale as old as Hollywood: A writer drafts a screenplay and submits it to various competitions. They get some buzz, maybe even placing in a few, though their script ultimately doesn't land anywhere. Then, they see a movie that feels similar to what they wrote. And after looking at the film's IMDB page, they realize that they're a couple levels removed from one of the title's producers or writers, who they suspect may have read their screenplay once upon a time and ripped it off. They file a lawsuit.


	Most copyright infringement lawsuits don't go anywhere, but a writer suing over popcorn thriller G20 is looking to flip the narrative. In a complaint filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Clarice Eboni Boykin-Patterson alleges the producers behind the Viola Davis action flick copied her screenplay.

					George Clooney Scales Back Venice Itinerary as He's Feeling Under the Weather at Start of Festival		
			









	With G20, Davis joined the pantheon of action heroes tasked with saving the world from calamity. She's the president of the United States with an extensive military background and weapons training but wait, she must also balance her very serious work life with a family. When viewers meet Davis' character, she's bickering with her 17-year-old daughter after the teen snuck out to a party at a Georgetown bar. 


	Boykin-Patterson, an entertainment reporter for The Daily Beast, challenges both works featuring “intense violence” with “warm, relatable familial drama,” among other things.


	Like G20, Boykin-Patterson's screenplay follows a Black woman in politics that must save an auditorium of people, including her family, from terrorists, led by a man with a personal vendetta, who've taken over the international conference (warning: spoilers ahead). She ultimately evades capture but her husband — whose main role is to support the political ambitions of his wife in both works — is kidnapped and used as a bargaining chip. In the movie and screenplay, titled “Election Night,” the protagonist's friend appears to die but are eventually shown to have survived.

	











	The lawsuit adds both works “feature the same themes; who gets to legislate and be in power in the future, does an inclusionary style of leadership edge out those who traditionally held power, and who inherits power and gets to wield it.” It also says they share the same genre: Tense thrillers that feature a race against the block with an “underlying tension and dread that result from the precariousness of the central characters, i.e. their gender and race and their overcompensation for these traits.”


	While these broad similarities alone may not be covered by copyright law, the lawsuit alleges that, when aggregated together, they can constitute infringement. There's some truth to the argument: Courts have found that a writer stringing together several elements that aren't typically protected by copyright — like a ragtag group of misfits banding together to pull off a high-stakes con — can serve as the foundation to an idea theft claim. Still, there's an uphill battle to climb. 


	In April, Showtime Networks and Lionsgate's Entertainment One defeated a copyright lawsuit over Yellowjackets. The court found in that case that several of the alleged similarities are common tropes found in survival thrillers, pointing to the death of a head coach and survival of his two children, attempts by survivors to escape isolation and the division of groups into rival factions. If two works share basic plot points, it's natural for them to have identical tones, the court reasoned.

	











	“There can be no serious dispute that escape attempts by shipwrecked or stranded survivors are prevalent throughout fiction and history, from Odysseus, Robinson Crusoe, and Gilligan to Shackleton and the Uruguayan rugby team,” the judge wrote in an order dismissing the lawsuit.


	A major factor in the case will be whether the producers and writers behind the movie have read Boykin-Patterson's screenplay. In 2021, “Election Night” was submitted to the ScreenCraft Screenwriting Fellowship contest, where it was a quarterfinalist, and the Launch Pad Feature Competition, where it got to the second round, while being shopped around to various production companies.


	The lawsuit stresses that Logan Miller and Noah Miller, the writers of G20, are managed by Daniel Sherman, an executive producer on the movie who's been a judge in the Launch Pad competition, the same event Boykin-Patterson submitted her screenplay.


	The decision comes amid a shift in the vetting of copyright lawsuits that's increasingly encouraged creators to sue. In recent years, federal appeals courts have been cautioning lower courts against early dismissal and from imposing their views on whether two works overlap enough to warrant allowing lawsuits to proceed. One of those rulings — at least the third since 2020 overturning a defense-friendly decision in a copyright case — reversed a federal judge's decision to toss Francesca Gregorini's lawsuit against M. Night Shyamalan and Apple over Servant on the premise that dismissal was premature because “reasonable minds could differ” on whether her and the acclaimed horror director's works are substantially similar.

	











	That's contributed to an uptick in copyright lawsuits actually getting to trial. Earlier this year, juries considered claims of infringement against Disney over Moana and Shyamalan over Servant. Both ended in defense verdicts.


	The findings in those trials reaffirmed the high bar in convincing a jury that any alleged similarities between two works constitute copyright infringement. Copyright law doesn't protect general ideas — like incidents, characters and settings considered standard in the treatment of particular topics (think a priest in a movie about possession) — only the particular expression of those ideas. 


	The last case in which a plaintiff may have come out on top involves the Shape of Water. After a federal appeals court in 2020 revived the lawsuit from the estate of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel, which alleged that the makers of the Oscar-winning film ripped off Let Me Hear You Whisper, a settlement was reached.


	MRC, which distributed the movie, and JuVee Productions, Davis' production banner, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The state saw a nearly 400 percent jump in applications to get filming subsidies. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Apple TV+'s The Studio and a new HBO series from Larry David headline the first round of subsidies to Hollywood after California's historic expansion of the state's entertainment tax credit program, designed to woo productions back to their cultural home.


	In total, 22 TV productions will get $256 million in incentives for shooting in California, the film commission announced on Wednesday. They're projected to generate $1.1 billion in economic activity across multiple industries with ties to the entertainment industry and employ 6,500 cast and crew members, as well as 46,100 background performers. Most of the filming is expected to take place in Los Angeles, where workers have been experiencing a shortage of jobs since the dual writers and actors strikes.

	This allotment of subsidies saw a nearly 400 percent increase in applications, according to the film commission. The main changes to the program reflect its increased popularity: the increase of the total cap from $330 million to $750 million; the 35 percent base credit; the expansion of the category of productions that qualify to include shorter TV shows, sitcoms, animated titles and large-scale competition shows.


	“California has long been the entertainment capital of the world — and the newly expanded film and TV tax credit program is keeping it that way,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. “This program means paychecks for middle-class workers, opportunities for small businesses and investment in communities up and down the state. We're not just protecting our legacy — we're reminding the world why the Golden State remains the beating heart of film and television.”  

	











	Other shows that will receive tax credits include a new 20th Television drama from This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman, Warner Bros. Television's Presumed Innocent, Sony Pictures Television's SWAT Exiles, CBS Studios's NCIS Origins and Group Chat, and a 20th Television pilot from Kenya Barris.


	“As an L.A. native, I feel lucky to have been able to shoot so many projects here throughout my career and love that we'll be able to continue spotlighting our incredible city, its people and the culture,” Barris said in a statement. “Not only does this credit allow us to work with the best crews and craftspeople around but, more importantly, it allows us to create jobs and support the LA film community at a time when it's more important than ever.”


	A main tenet of the changes to California's program involved swaying TV shows, long an anchor of production in the region, to shoot in the state. There's a separate incentive for productions that relocate from another state to California, which Tom Segura's Netflix series Bad Thoughts is taking advantage of as it moves away from Texas.


	California has steadily been losing production as other regions beef up their incentive programs in a race to host Hollywood. One example: In June, Texas passed a law that increased by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years.

With ‘Dead Man's Wire' premiering out of competition in Venice, the elusive auteur looks back on a career defined by risk, reinvention and ignoring all the rules.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	There's no such thing as a typical Gus Van Sant film.


	With the possible exception of Steven Soderbergh, no American filmmaker working today has had a career marked by such radical shifts in style, budget and artistic ambition as the 73-year-old director from Louisville, Kentucky. From edgy indies to blockbuster crowd-pleasers, prestige Oscar bait to experimental movies, Van Sant has spent the past 40 years delighting, surprising and confounding his audience.




	His early films — the “Portland trilogy” of 1988's Mala Noche, 1989's Drugstore Cowboy and 1991's My Own Private Idaho — were gritty, realist dramas about outsiders: migrant workers, nomadic drug addicts and gay hustlers. The mid-'90s saw Van Sant pivot to more studio-friendly fare: the glossy camp of the 1995 dark satire To Die For, featuring Nicole Kidman in a career-making wig, and 1997's Good Will Hunting, a $225 million global hit that introduced the world to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

	But at the height of his studio success, in between his first Oscar nomination for Good Will Hunting and his second for 2008's political biopic Milk, Van Sant veered in an entirely different direction.


	His “death trilogy” — 2002's Gerry, 2003's Elephant and 2005's Last Days — was a sharp turn into art house experimentation. Loosely scripted and influenced by European auteurs Béla Tarr and Chantal Akerman, these films favored long, choreographed shots, languid pacing and a disregard for Hollywood conventions. Around the same time, in 1998, he made his notorious shot-for-shot color remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, a $60 million studio picture that now plays like a conceptual art installation.

	











	“I think it goes back to the beginning, when I started making short films with my friends,” Van Sant says of his frequent shifts in style. “We were experimenting, scratching on the film, drawing on the film, animating directly onto 8mm. But we were also going to the cinema in this small town in Connecticut every Friday, watching war movies, or cartoons, or whatever. We'd watch Bonanza on TV. The experiment became: Could I extend my experiments in film into dramatic storytelling, to make something that looked like the things I would see on TV?”


	Van Sant credits his high school English teacher David Stone with introducing him to experimental cinema, showing 14-year-old Gus Canadian Film Board shorts and Citizen Kane in class. “Things like Stan Brakhage, Stan Vanderbeek, the Kuchar brothers, Ron Rice — people like that.”


	Other early influences included a stint assisting Ken Shapiro, director of 1974's pre-SNL sketch spoof The Groove Tube. “Lorne Michaels was actually working for him as a writer when he pitched Saturday Night Live to NBC,” Van Sant recalls. The job gave him a taste for counterculture comedy and the nuts and bolts of indie production.


	At the same time, he was bingeing on films from an emerging queer cinema scene. Apart from John Waters — whose 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos played every Friday at midnight at New York's Quad Cinema — “there weren't really other gay filmmakers that I knew,” he says. “In Hollywood, there was a queer scene, though it wasn't called that. At the gay film festival at the Vista Theater, [the American entries] were mostly old Tennessee Williams adaptations with gay themes, alongside Danish, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish titles. But no new American films. Americans weren't really making independent queer films.”

	











	So Van Sant made one. With $25,000 he'd earned in New York advertising, he financed Mala Noche, a 16mm black-and-white adaptation of the Walt Curtis novel about an almost-romance between a gay store clerk and two young Mexican immigrants.


	“Walt Curtis wasn't a typical city gay man,” says Van Sant. “He was more the kind of queer man who would get kicked out of a gay bar. So Mala Noche wasn't about mainstream gay culture. It was about a sidelined, independent gay man.”


	The film arrived during a golden moment for American indie cinema, fueled by upstart distributors like New Line, Orion and Miramax and the booming home video market. “Around the same time I made my film, Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch were making their first movies — She's Gotta Have It and Stranger Than Paradise — all in black-and-white and all low-budget.”


	Van Sant credits his chameleon-like approach to filmmaking to the way he shape-shifts when working with actors: “One director — I can't remember who, probably Frank Capra — was asked, ‘How do you direct different people?' And he said: ‘If they want to hear Chopin, you play Chopin. If they want to hear rock ‘n' roll, you play rock ‘n' roll.' I'm obsequious enough to mold into their needs, to understand what they want to do and how to make that thing happen.”


	He has often gravitated toward real-life stories: Mala Noche, Drugstore Cowboy and Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot were all adapted from memoirs; Milk was a biopic; To Die For satirized the Pamela Smart murder case. His latest, Dead Man's Wire, premiering out of competition in Venice (where Van Sant will receive the Campari Passion for Film Award), is based on a bizarre 1970s hostage standoff in Indianapolis. Bill Skarsgard plays Tony Kiritsis, a former developer who wired a shotgun to his mortgage banker's neck in a bid for a public apology and a payout.

	











	The project originally was set up with Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage. When they dropped out, producer Cassian Elwes — who had worked with Van Sant on Gerry — called to offer it to him. “Werner is so extreme that you start to see the extreme qualities in the story,” Van Sant says. “I also really knew the quality of this Midwest, middle-class life. My father [and] my grandfather were these types of Midwest small-town businessmen.”


	Van Sant is currently developing another real-life tale, a project about disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried.


	“Working with real stories is less about what I can bring to the story than about the story bringing itself to you, feeling like it's something you are connected to,” he says. “With Sam Bankman-Fried, I just thought this is an amazing sort of car crash in the crypto world. And then someone sent me a script about it.”


	There might not be anyone out there quite like Gus Van Sant. But asked about a kindred spirit, even a possible successor, he names Sean Baker.


	“It's amazing what he's doing. The fact that Anora just swept the Oscars shows there's hope. He comes by a style that's where I've always lived: You make something with small intentions but find the humanity within those intentions,” says Van Sant. “You don't let the money take over your sentiment as a filmmaker. You cast people that are new, that haven't been used before, and simplify the set to not have too many working parts. If you see a shot of a Bergman set, there's like four people. Or watch Godard making Breathless. There's a shopping cart and two guys.”

Peacock will become available in Amazon Channels, as the NBCUniversal streaming service pursues more bundles and channel deals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, will become available as an add-on for Prime Video customers as part of a wide-ranging deal between Amazon and Comcast.


	The agreement will see Peacock Premium Plus (that's the ad-free tier) become available via Prime Video's channels offering for $16.99 per month or $169.99 per year. Prime Video Channels has become a major aggregator of streaming services, with HBO Max, Paramount+, Starz and Apple TV+ among the services offered, underscoring its effectiveness in driving subscriptions and Amazon's one-stop billing capabilities.

	Peacock has largely eschewed from participating in bundles and channels programs up to this point, but a source familiar with the talks says that the company is likely to become more aggressive in pursuing those sorts of arrangements moving forward, using the Amazon deal as a template.


	While Peacock has been available as part of bundles within the Comcast Xfinity environment, and in a deal with Charter Spectrum, Prime Video Channels is the first tech platform to offer the service as an add-on. Google's YouTube and Roku also have robust channels offerings, while Disney and HBO Max have been opportunistically seeking bundle arrangements.


	The Amazon deal is likely the first of a number of deals that will expand the availability of Peacock, which is still smaller than many of its subscription streaming competitors with about 41 million subscribers. Peacock has shifted much of its focus to live sports, and will add the NBA this fall.


	The deal also improves Prime Video's sports proposition, with the platform also recently adding Fox One to its channels offering. With both Peacock and Fox One, Prime Video now provides access to four of the five national NFL packages (ESPN is still the lone holdout for now).

	











	The Amazon-Comcast deal also includes extensions on distribution deals covering a number of other areas, ensuring Peacock's continued availability on Fire TV devices, Prime Video availability on Xfinity X1 devices, and allowing users to continue to buy and rent films from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on Prime Video.


	“This multi-faceted set of agreements is a testament to our close collaboration with Amazon, delivering significant value across our businesses and expanding exposure of our world-class content,” said Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation. “Millions of Amazon customers can continue to enjoy NBCUniversal's popular shows, films, and live events on Peacock via Fire TV or through Prime Video Subscriptions, or buying or renting on Prime Video, while also accessing Amazon's premier entertainment on Xfinity X1 — ensuring they can watch what they love, wherever and however they choose.”


	“At Amazon, we are always working to make customers' lives better every day and these new agreements with Comcast NBCU are fantastic for millions of customers, who are looking for the fastest and easiest way to find all their entertainment and sports in one place,” added Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “Adding Peacock to our growing list of subscriptions – while renewing our long-standing agreements for Fire TV, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and Xfinity X1 – deepens an incredible working relationship with Comcast/NBCU, and we look forward to a future of mutual distribution that benefits our shared customers.”

The hit leads Billboard's 100-position Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century retrospective. Below, find a breakdown of the 2000-24 top 10.


													By
												

	Trevor Anderson



The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” outshines all competitors on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart. The smash lands at No. 1 on the survey, which is based on performance on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from the start of 2000 through the end of 2024.


	“Blinding Lights” claims the shiny prize largely for its unprecedented longevity in the top 10: 59 weeks, the most of any song not only in the quarter century but in the entire history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, dating to its 1958 consolidation into a single, genre-encompassing listing. Of its run in the top 10, “Blinding Lights” snagged 11 frames at No. 1 — the most among The Weeknd's nine career champs.


	In November 2021, “Blinding Lights” crowned Billboard's Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs chart, dating to the weekly list's August 1958 start. “I don't think [it] has hit me yet,” The Weeknd told Billboard upon learning of the song's all-time, all-genre command. “I just count my blessings, and I'm just grateful.”


	Reflecting the biggest names in R&B and hip-hop from Y2K to today, check out the top 10 songs on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart below and the entire 100-position ranking in Billboard's Greatest of All Time charts menu.


	Following the reveal of Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the 21st Century chart and the unveiling of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums of the 21st Century chart, check back Friday (Aug. 29) for Billboard's rundown of The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart, with all coverage of Billboard's 21st Century Charts here.


	Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century recaps reflect performance on weekly charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024. The Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists category ranks the best-performing acts in that span based on activity on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. (Titles released prior to mid-1999 are excluded, although such entries that appeared on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums or Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in that span contribute to the calculation of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists chart.) The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart reflects producers with the most No. 1s on weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024, with ties broken by most top 10s and most overall chart entries.


	The star team-up dominated the summer of 2013 and beyond, racking up 16 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs that June through October. For all three hitmakers, who have enjoyed multiple No. 1s on the chart, “Blurred Lines” remains their longest-leading ruler.


	After a nearly eight-year break between albums, Maxwell returned in 2009 with BLACKsummers'night and his biggest hit single. “This song, it's about wanting to be with somebody but meeting them too early,” the singer-songwriter shared at a 2008 concert in which he performed the song pre-release. With its flight to No. 1, “Wings” and its 14-week Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs reign returned Maxwell to the summit for the first time in a decade, since “Fortunate” in 1999.


	Despite a No. 2 peak on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, SZA's “Snooze” passed many of its contemporaries in the long run thanks to strong consistency, as the 2022 release resonated after the height of its promo campaign as a single. Radio strength was an essential asset, as it claimed a record 37-week command atop the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.


	Post Malone and Swae Lee swung to No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and stuck to the top rank for 11 weeks with their Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack smash, which began its run in early 2019. Both knew the feeling of an extensive stay well: Post Malone previously … posted 14 weeks in charge via “Rockstar” in 2017-18, while Swae Lee and his brother Slim Jxmmi, as duo Rae Sremmurd, ruled for seven weeks with “Black Beatles” in 2016-17.


	Bruno Mars had much to like in 2017, as singles from his ‘90s R&B-inspired album, 24K Magic, reaped massive rewards. “That's What I Like,” the album's second single (after its title track), celebrated 10 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 2019, it was revealed as the second-biggest hit on the chart for the entire 2010s decade.


	“Thrift Shop” notched 14 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2013, pushing its main creators, duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, to a banner breakout year. Follow-up single “Can't Hold Us” captured seven weeks at No. 1 later that year, and “Thrift Shop” wrapped 2013 as the year-end No. 1 track on the annual Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs recap.


	“Sure Thing” was already a hit upon its release, hitting No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for a week in 2011. An unexpected revival from TikTok in 2023, however, pushed it into the history books. Thanks to that second wind, the single added 30 weeks to its chart run and became the track with the most weeks, 89, in the 67-year history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.


	Blige's devotional ode ranks as the top song by a woman for the quarter century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The crown chart jewel of the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul's collection conquered the tally for 15 weeks in 2006, longer than Blige's five other leaders combined. In its run, the track surpassed two other of the genre's juggernaut tracks (Deborah Cox's “Nobody's Supposed To Be Here” and Mariah Carey's “We Belong Together”) as the longest-leading hit by a woman, a mark that Blige owned for the next 17 years.


	Erasing any notion of being a one-year wonder, Lil Nas X found more hits in 2021, including his smash collaboration with Jack Harlow. The rising talents' joint effort was a runaway success, posting 19 weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. At the time, Lil Nas X owned the two longest leaders, with 2019's “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus) in first place, with 20 frames.


	Ascending from the underground alt-R&B scenes of Toronto to international stardom, The Weeknd reached unprecedented stature with the glistening “Blinding Lights.” The single spent 11 weeks in charge of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart — chief of Abel Tesfaye's nine champs — and a record 59 weeks in the top 10. The blockbuster claims history on other Billboard recaps, ruling the Top Hot 100 Songs of the 21st Century chart, announced in January, following its coronation on the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs retrospective.

The post reached the milestone in just six hours.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce‘s post on Instagram announcing their engagement got a lot of, well, engagement. 


	According to data shared with Billboard on Wednesday (Aug. 27), Meta counts that the photos of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end proposing to the pop star have surpassed 1 million reposts on Instagram — more than any other post has ever received on the platform. Even more impressive, the couple's announcement achieved that record in just six hours. 


	The news comes after Billboard previously reported that the post had earned 14 million “likes” in just one hour. At press time, Instagram displays that it has surged past 29 million.

	











	If there was ever going to be a post that would garner such high stats, it's Swift and Kelce's. The duo's big reveal — which they shared by writing, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married” — sent the internet into an absolute frenzy, with fans flooding social media with messages of shock and congratulations. Even President Donald Trump got in on the action, setting aside his grievances with the 14-time Grammy winner to say during a cabinet meeting, “I think he's a great guy, and she's a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The engagement comes after about two years of dating for Swift and the athlete, who popped the question two weeks prior to their Tuesday (Aug. 26) announcement, according to Kelce's dad, Ed. The lovebirds now have wedding planning to add to their busy schedules, which features the beginning of the Chiefs' football season on Sept. 5 and the release of the musician's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.

The singer/actress shared a nostalgic meme celebrating the longtime friends' parallel engagements.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Longtime best friends Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez have shared a lot over the years — and now they get to share their engagement journeys.


	On Wednesday (Aug. 27) — the day after Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce shared that they're getting married following two years of dating — Gomez shared the news on her Instagram Stories with the message: “When bestie gets engaged 🥰.”


	Gomez herself is also engaged, sharing the news back in December that she and pop producer Benny Blanco are getting married. “forever begins now..,” Gomez captioned the Instagram announcement, with Swift responding in the comments: “Yes I will be the flower girl.”

	











	In a second Instagram Stories post on Wednesday night, Gomez also shared a fan-made meme from X user @solelynostalgia. The meme shows a quote-tweet of a 2009 post from Swift, in which she wrote to Gomez: “Real love still happens sometimes. It's not just something we make up when we're nine. I have to believe that. You do too.” Above that nearly two-decade-old tweet, a message reads, “16 years later,” above side-by-side images of Swift and Gomez's engagement photos.

	While they haven't shared a wedding date, Gomez and Blanco's nuptials are rumored to be coming very soon, with the girls trip the singer/actress was on this past weekend reported to be her bachelorette party.


	Swift and Gomez have been friends since 2008 — the year before Taylor's sweet Twitter message about love. Their friendship started when they were both dating Jonas Brothers (Taylor dated Joe while Selena dated Nick), and Gomez said after their respective breakups: “I like to say the best thing we got out of those relationships was each other.”

Sting is being sued by his former Police bandmates Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland over alleged missing royalties for their signature song “Every Breath You Take,” according to reports published by the Los Angeles Times and other titles.

	Summers and Copeland filed their lawsuit in London High Court, in which they claim they were never properly credited as songwriters on “Every Breath You Take,” their biggest hit in the U.S. The pair also claim they never received royalties for their contributions to it.

	Sting (real name: Gordon Matthew Sumner) and his publishing company, Magnetic Publishing, are listed as defendants in the suit.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Released in 1983, “Every Breath You Take” logged eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, longer than any other single that year. It was the band's first and only leader on the chart, and won a brace of Grammy Awards, for song of the year and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals.


	The evergreen number grew wings when Summers' arpeggio was sampled on Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' Notorious B.I.G. tribute from 1997, “I'll Be Missing You.” In 2023, Puff Daddy went on the record as saying he pays Sting $5,000 every day for the use of that sample, a comment he later walked back.

	











	In 2022, Sting sold his entire song catalog from his early days in The Police through his solo career to the Universal Music Publishing Group, a business decision that reunites his music publishing rights with his master recordings.


	While terms of that deal were not disclosed, Billboard previously reported that Sting had been shopping a music asset bundle that produced an annual royalty income stream of about $12-$13 million and was looking at a roughly $360 million payday.


	With their bleach-blonde hair, tight performances, and collection of radio friendly hits, including “Roxanne,” “Message in a Bottle”, “Walking on The Moon”, “Don't Stand So Close to Me”, “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” “King of Pain” and more, The Police were arguably the biggest band in the world, certainly for an album cycle or two.


	In the UK, the band landed five consecutive No. 1s on the Official UK Albums Chart. In the U.S., Synchronicity logged 17 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The bandmates went their separate ways after completing the 1984 world tour in support of Synchronicity, before reuniting briefly in 1986 for a re-recording in “Don't Stand So Close To Me,” which appeared on a greatest hits collection.


	The former bandmates settled their differences to mount a 2007–08 world tour, marking the 30th anniversary of their formation. Sting is booked to perform at QPAC's Glasshouse Theatre in Brisbane next year, where he will present his musical The Last Ship.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: The Saturday Night Live exit carousel continues with Michael Longfellow becoming the latest cast member to leave.


	Longfellow joined the show as a featured player in Season 48 and was promoted to the main cast ahead of Season 50.


	He joins Devon Walker, who joined at the same time, and Emil Wakim, who are also both leaving ahead of Season 51. More are expected to depart before the season starts. 


	Longfellow's departure is somewhat of a surprise given that he was seemingly being primed to take over the Weekend Update desk at some point after some successful stints behind the desk, joking about topics such as TikTok and Real ID. He even appeared on Weekend Update on his first ever show (see below).

	In May, he joked that he wasn't on the show much in Season 50.  “I work like 12 hours a week. When you love your job, it never feels like work. No, I'm just not in that much stuff this season. It's fine, I walk around, they don't really keep tabs on your whereabouts here,” he joked on Weekend Update alongside Colin Jost.


	His departure comes as creator Lorne Michaels shakes up the cast ahead of Season 51. Writers Celeste Yim and Rosebud Baker have also departed.


	Outside of SNL, Longfellow starred in Good Burger 2, and he is a touring stand-up, having appeared on the Netflix is a Joke festival, as well as on NBC comedy reality series Bring The Funny, which was hosted by his future colleague Kenan Thompson. 


Saturday Night Live, which is produced by Broadway Video in association with SNL Studios, returns on October 4.

Damn !!!!
They are getting rid of everyone I like. 🤬🤬🤬🤬
I wish Michael the best. He deserved better.

I wasn't aware of him, but after watching this, I think he's funny. He'll be great on a scripted HBO comedy show or movies. I like his style. 

Perhaps as a taller, good looking everyman Adam Scott type with more swagger and a sense of mischief.

Terrible decision. Should have been chosen to take over Weekend Update.

With these recent cuts, who will play “waiter” in all the sketches now?

Love Michael.  Cannot wait to see what he does next.  

But these announcements are like Thanos.

It was a pleasure working with you all. 3, Life is amazing. We just don't ever know what's gonna happen. How great! Turn toward the light. Always. Huge thank you to you all.”


	Howarth won a Daytime Emmy for his work on One Life to Live in 1994.

	Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings and Amy Adams have officially been set to join Ryan Gosling in Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Starfighter. Shawn Levy is directing the pic, which was penned by Jonathan Tropper.


	“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said Thursday, when the casting news was revealed on Starwars.com, along with the news that production has begun in the UK. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The post also included a first look at the set, with Gosling and Gray leaning and sitting, respectively, on what looks to be a landspeeder. See it above.

	











	“From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally,” Levy continued. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”


	The film is set to bow on May 28, 2027. Levy produces with Kennedy. Executive producers are Gosling, Dan Levine, Mary McLaglen and Josh McLaglen. 


Details of Starfighter were unveiled in April at the Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo. The film is set five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the Skywalker saga and currently stands as the final feature chronologically on the Star Wars timeline.

	











	When Deadline broke the news of Smith's casting, sources said he would be playing the villain role.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Damn, Alex Garland really wanted to make his Elden Ring movie","https://www.avclub.com/alex-garland-begged-to-make-elden-ring-movie","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 02:53:00 GMT","

A few months back, we reported on the slightly surprising news that Alex Garland—whose filmography runs through strange, frequently subversive, but also highly modern cinematic worlds like Annihilation and Civil War—was getting into the video game adaptation game. Specifically, Garland had been announced to write and direct a film version of Elden Ring, our (and many other outlet's) 2022 pick for Game Of The Year. It was a bit of a weird fit, partly because Garland's never dipped a toe into fantasy, and partly because Elden Ring is such a deliberately eclectic property in its own right, filled with ambiguities, and highly hostile to straightforward interpretation. But, it turns out, Garland really, really wanted the job, to the point of generating 160-page scripts on spec and then flying across the planet to pitch them to the game's creators.

This is per IGN, reporting on a wider story from The New Yorker about film studio A24, which is bankrolling Garland's project. Said story makes it clear that “Let's make an Elden Ring movie” was an idea that came pouring out of Garland's brain, full stop: He apparently called up the company's head of film, Noah Sacco, to rant at him about the game, before showing him its fantasy fighting in action to try to get a green light. (“The lush visuals and fantasy setting reminded Sacco of the Lord Of The Rings movies. He replied, ‘Fuck yeah.'”) Garland then spent some not-inconsiderable amount of his own time writing a script for a movie nobody had actually asked him to make yet, which he then took to Japan to present to the developers at From Software. (He also apparently compiled another 40 pages of visual references to help make his pitch, apparently successfully, to From's highly esteemed designer and president, Hidetaka Miyazaki.)

So, regardless of how it ends up going, never let it be said that A24's Elden Ring movie suffered from a lack of passion. (Even if we can't help but get a little nervous about another video game adaptation anecdote from that same New Yorker piece, centered on the studio's planned adaptation of Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding games. Learning that Sacco asked Kojima—a man possessed of both brilliant ideas and absolutely no ability to edit or modulate them—“Are you sure you don't want to direct?” the movie himself produced in us the same feeling that the question “How about we go outside in the dark woods and split up for some pre-marital sex?” might generate in connoisseurs of slasher flicks. Blessedly, Kojima apparently said no to the offer.)

The streaming era has changed a lot, but we can still count on autumn to usher in a lot of new television. On Thursday, Adult Swim announced the premiere dates for Smiling Friends and the new comedy Haha, You Clowns. Smiling Friends will return for its third season on October 5 at 11:30 P.M. Haha, You Clowns (which first began as part of the animated shorts line up for Adult Swim SMALLS) will premiere October 19 at 11:45 P.M. 

Ahead of its return, Smiling Friends has already been renewed for a fourth and fifth season. The third season “finds Pim, Charlie, Flint and the whole gang going absolutely bonkers once again, diving headfirst into their ultimate quest to spread joy upon the land,” according to a synopsis from Adult Swim. “We'll see a bunch of unexpected stuff here such as Mr. Frog running full speed at the camera, the team finally collecting all the spirit gems they need, and a totally epic showdown spectacle with an Ancient Witch of some sort. AHHHHH!!!!”

The full-series version of Haha, You Clowns was announced last year at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival and later enjoyed its world premiere at San Diego Comic-Con 2025. Created by Joe Cappa, some of the voice cast guest stars include Sean Astin, Justin Theroux, and Cheri Oteri, according to Fox 5 San Diego. The series follows “the Campbell boys, three doting teenagers and their tenderhearted dad, as they live, laugh, love their way into your living rooms. They're big dudes with big feelings who are learning to navigate life in the wake of their mother's death, sensing her presence in everyday adventures.” You can check out a first look photo below. 

“We love shows that make you smile and go ‘haha'- and that's what you'll get with Smiling Friends and Haha, You Clowns. It's right there in the titles.” Adult Swim president Michael Ouweleen said in a statement. “While totally different from each other, these two shows are united in that they're hilarious, gently unnerving, and sometimes even profound.”

TIFF and NYFF are just around the corner, but we're finally starting to see trailers for some of the films that already made waves at festivals earlier this year. The latest offering is Kleber Mendonça Filho's The Secret Agent, which Neon snagged the rights to after it received widespread acclaim at Cannes this spring. Filho and Wagner Moura left the Croisette with the Best Director and Best Actor awards respectively, so this is definitely one to look out for.

The film's trailer portrays an energetic but chaotic vision of 1977 Brazil. “Marcelo (Moura), a technology expert in his early 40s, is on the run,” the film's logline reads. “He arrives in Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes that the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.” Marcelo may also not be quite as much of a pacifist as he likes to envision himself. “I am not a violent person,” he says at the end of the clip. “But this man… I'd kill him with a hammer.” 



The Secret Agent is a Portuguese-language film, marking a return to Moura's native language after starring in English-language productions like Civil War and Dope Thief. “It's incredibly liberating to act in Portuguese,” the actor told Variety in May. “When I work in English or Spanish, the words don't come out of my mouth filled with memories the way they do in Portuguese. For me, it's pivotal to keep connected to Brazilian cinema.” 

Filho, who previously competed at Cannes with 2016's Aquarius and 2019's Bacurau, also expressed a lot of pride in the film and its portrayal of his country. “The film takes place in a pre-globalized Brazil,” he said. “Globalization standardized worldwide aesthetics, which made it even more beautiful to work on recreating 70s Recife. People went to their families to look for pictures of their parents, to understand how they dressed, how their houses looked… I believe this brings a great level of authenticity. As I've said, I'm very happy with the film.”

The Secret Agent opens November 26 in select theaters.

Actor Floyd Levine, who people know from movies such as “Norbit,” “Good Burger,” and “Death Wish,” sadly passed away on August 24. Not only was he a well-known actor, but Levine is also the father of Brian Robbins, the celebrated producer and director. He was 93 years old. Now, fans of the beloved movie and television star are paying tribute to his legacy. 

Levine's daughter-in-law, Tracy Robbins, announced his passing on her Instagram account. The now edited post begins, “My beloved father-in-law, Floyd Levine, passed away peacefully yesterday on August 24, surrounded by his beautiful family (and probably wishing someone would bring him a martini).”

She continued, “The best father-in-law, grandpa, and all-around jokester, Floyd loved Frank Sinatra, classic films, and making everyone laugh. He started out as a cab driver in New York City before chasing Hollywood dreams in California, building an amazing acting career along the way. Brian is basically his twin, and we will see Floyd's grin every time we look at him.”

A post shared by Tracy Robbins (@mrstracyrobbins)

The post then said, “I will miss him dearly, but I know he's making the angels laugh already and back together with his beautiful wife Rochelle( give her the biggest squeeze from us). Don't worry, I will take care of your baby boy always and forever. Love you, Grandpa. And yes….you always did it your way to the very end.”

Levine appeared in numerous television shows and movies throughout his illustrious career. As a result, fans from around the world are remembering his legacy following his passing. 

One fan wrote on X, “Farewell to Floyd Levine, that indispensable supporting actor who was always there, in all the TV series in history (STARSKY AND HUTCH; MURDER, SHE WROTE; POLICE SQUAD; MELROSE PLACE; KNIGHT RIDER…) and in all the movies (AIRPLANE II: THE SEQUEL…).” 

Someone else wrote, “RIP Floyd Levine (February 23, 1932 – August 24, 2025). He was an actor known for Death Wish, Babylon 5, Hill Street Blues, Cellar Dweller, Norbit, Meet Dave, and so many other roles.”

According to IMDb, Levine has just under 100 acting credits. The first came in 1972 with an uncredited role on “Come Back to Charleston Blue.” Two years later, he appeared in “Death Wish.” Later, he was cast in “The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries,” “Starsky and Hutch,” and the original “Wonder Woman” TV series. 

Levine then continued his acting career in the 1980s with roles in works such as “Hill Street Blues,” Airplane II: The Sequel,” “Curse of the Pink Panther,” “Three's Company,” and more. Later, he appeared in films such as “The Hangover,” “A Thousand Words,” and “Coach Carter.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tia Mowry Shares Heartfelt Wisdom on Co-Parenting & Raising Independent Kids","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/tia-mowry-shares-co-parenting-wisdom/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:57:23 GMT","

It's been two years since Tia Mowry's divorce from Cory Hardrict was made official. The actress, who starred in Hallmark's “A Gingerbread Christmas” in 2018, has acknowledged that she and Hardrict maintain a positive relationship. In an interview with Parents.com, she revealed what she views as the most crucial thing former couples need to remember.

“The main important thing is making sure that the children still see the parents together and communicating, and still see them [being] cordial,” she said. “That's what keeps children beautifully adjusted. It keeps their nervous system calm and at ease when they see their parents are still together, we all come together as a family.”

Her actions have proven that these aren't mere words. Earlier this year, she posted Instagram photos showing the exes celebrating their kids' birthdays together. But beyond co-parenting, she's also making sure to foster independence — no matter how challenging it may be.

A post shared by TiaMowry (@tiamowry)

A post shared by TiaMowry (@tiamowry)

“I don't think it is your job to make your kids happy,” Mowry told Parents.com. “I think that it is your job to keep your kids safe, nurture them, guide them, but they have to learn on their own how to make themselves happy, because we don't want to create co-dependency.”

A recent event showed that her methods are working. When 7-year-old Cairo went to the school nurse after being hit with a ball, the nurse asked if she should call Mowry. Cairo replied, “No.”

“I desperately wanted to speak to her and hear her voice to make sure that she was OK,” Mowry said. “But I had to allow this opportunity for her to gain independence and say, ‘I got this.'”

Mowry's thoughts on letting her kids have their own voice align with her beliefs about raising self-sufficient children. If her kids are uncomfortable with something, she doesn't expect them to do it. She admitted her upbringing was much different. 

“I think growing up, it was definitely a cultural thing where it's like, ‘My house, my rules,'” she clarified. “I didn't want to do that with my children. I wanted my children to never be afraid to express themselves.”

She may want her kids to learn independence, but she also cherishes every moment she has with them, especially with her 14-year-old, Cree.

“Sometimes I enjoy saying, ‘Did you put on your deodorant today? Did you brush your teeth?'” Mowry said, getting emotional. “Because I know I hate to sound so cliché, but I am counting down the days I have.”

For moms, few moments are bigger than seeing their children find happiness. Donna Kelce celebrated her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a heartfelt online tribute. 

The day after the couple announced their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner photo to a collage of Travis and Taylor's childhood pictures. 

The side-by-side shots showed Swift leaning against a prop tree in a school portrait while a young Travis posed in a flannel shirt against a blue backdrop. 

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

Even before the big announcement, Donna had hinted at the happiness in her son's life. Speaking to People in an interview published August 25, she shared, “I think his mind is settled. That's about all I can tell you. I think he feels calm and he feels like he's on a mission and he knows exactly what he wants.”

At the time, her ex-husband Ed Kelce had already confirmed that Travis had proposed earlier in August. As he told ABC Cleveland, “Travis actually did the proposal maybe two weeks—not quite two weeks ago.”

Travis had initially hoped to wait until just before the NFL season kicked off on Sept. 5 to make his proposal, but both his family and Swift's dad, Scott Swift, encouraged him not to delay.

“Scott said, ‘Come on, when are you going to get this done?'” Ed recalled on The Jimmy and Nath Show on August 26. “He was going to make a big production out of it. Wanted to make it uber special. And I told him the same thing Scott told him—asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it.”

When the NFL star finally got down on one knee, both families were overcome with joy. “The family—both sides—kind of assumed this was going to happen because we'd never seen our kids so happy,” Ed added.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

While the engagement marked a new chapter for the couple, Travis and Taylor had already been sharing glimpses of their romance online.

Taylor's first Instagram post featuring Travis was a selfie with Prince William, Princess Kate, and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, backstage at her Eras Tour show in London.

Travis shared his own Instagram debut with Taylor in July 2025, including a cozy dinner photo that revealed their matching lockscreen pictures of each other.

Taylor Swift‘s BFF has entered the chat. 

Two best friends, two soulmates, and two love stories unfolding in the same year, it almost feels like a movie. Selena Gomez is celebrating Taylor Swift's fairytale engagement in the sweetest way. 

After Travis Kelce, 35, proposed to Swift, 35, in a romantic garden setting, Gomez couldn't resist sharing her excitement with fans.

“When bestie gets engaged,” Gomez wrote on her Instagram Story August 27, alongside photos from the couple's enchanting proposal. The short but heartfelt message quickly went viral among fans. Here are the sweetest reactions: 

Oh after y'all set selena up to look like she never posted Taylor solo now yall wanna ost what she posted first. Selena fans have the right to be nasty to all of yall. https://t.co/tRZJIBJYrR

The post also tied back to a nostalgic chapter in their friendship. 

Gomez reshared a fan post that featured Swift's 2009 tweet, in which she wrote: “Real love still happens sometimes. It's not just something we make up when we're nine. I have to believe that. You do too.” The fan added side-by-side images of both stars' proposals, captioned, “16 years later,” a moment Gomez proudly highlighted.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

Swift announced her engagement to Kelce on August 26 with an Instagram carousel showing the Kansas City Chiefs star down on one knee surrounded by flowers. The Grammy winner captioned the post, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” while showing off her sparkling diamond ring.

The proposal was witnessed by both families, who were overjoyed to see the couple take this next step.

The engagement follows a milestone of Gomez's own. Last December, Swift left a playful comment under Gomez's Instagram post announcing her engagement to producer Benny Blanco, teasing, “Yes, I will be the flower girl.”

Now, with both women celebrating love at the same time, their enduring friendship continues to be a source of joy for fans.

Donna Kelce marked her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a touching online gesture. The day after the couple shared their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner to a collage of their childhood photos. The sweet side-by-side images showed Swift posing against a prop tree in a school portrait, while a young Travis smiled in a flannel shirt against a classic blue backdrop.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent engagement has spawned reactions from fans and friends all over the world.

On Aug. 26, the superstar couple announced their engagement via a gorgeous, flower-filled Instagram post captioned with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”

Now, fans want to know all of the details, including when and where the lovebirds will tie the knot. While no details about the upcoming wedding have been shared publicly, it's no surprise that the suggestions are rolling on—and that includes a cheeky idea to host the wedding at a beloved college football stadium in Swift's home state of Pennsylvania.

A post shared by Penn State University (@pennstate)

Hours after Swift and Kelce revealed they were engaged, a post on Penn State University's Instagram page featured a photo from the proposal.

The university's Nittany Lion mascot was then added in, with a bubble that read, “Congrats on your engagement! We have the perfect wedding venue to seat 107k of your closest friends.”

A second slide showed photos from the couple's flower-filled engagement day, as well as shots of Swift performing in State College, PA.  Another photo featured reception tables, seemingly from past events at the school.

‘Don't shake this off because this is our type of love story 🫶,” came the caption. “Wedding in @jordancenter and reception in @beaver_stadium!”

For more than 60 years, Beaver Stadium has been home to the Nittany Lions at Penn State's University Park campus. The stadium has an official seating capacity of 106,572, which makes it the second-largest stadium in the country, per gopsusports.com.

The Bryce Jordan Center is a 15,261-seat arena on Penn State's main University Park campus.

A post shared by Penn State Football (@pennstatefball)

While the Travis and Taylor Penn State wedding idea is pretty far-fetched, weddings have been held at the iconic Beaver Stadium in the past.

The Knot previously posted photos from the nuptials for two PSU alumni in 2015 after their wedding was held at their alma mater's Beaver Stadium.

The groom even proposed to his fiancée right outside the stadium during homecoming weekend, and the entire wedding featured Penn State's navy and white color scheme.

According to Philadelphia magazine, the stadium has four event rooms in varying sizes —The Letterman's Lounge, the Recruit's Lounge,  the President's Suite & Lounge, and the supersized  Mt. Nittany Club space.

Imagine if Michael Haneke's “Funny Games” were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia.” 

Jesse Plemons stars as a galaxy-brained conspiracist beekeeper who's either severely mentally ill or the only prophet among us, hijacking his cousin (Aidan Delbis) into a scheme to kidnap a big pharma executive (Emma Stone) whom he believes to be a body-snatched alien sent to end the planet.

 










Lanthimos works from an on-the-nose-for-the-now feature screenplay by “Succession” and “The Menu” writer Will Tracy, diverting from the droll theater of cruelty present in scripts by Efthimis Filippou (“Kinds of Kindness”) or the florid repartee of Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”). “Bugonia” has all the streak of Tracy's kill-the-rich brand of satire, but with the Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker interrogating the potential performativity of such capitalist-fighting crusades.

That's because Lanthimos brings to this film his signature stamp of perverse detachment, though without the fish-eyed lenses this harrowing time around depravity's merry-go-round. Recall that the most unexpectedly mainstream-friendly film of his career, “Poor Things,” revealed a tender, even hopeful side to the “Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Dogtooth” director known for his clinical stance on humankind's worthiness; “Kinds of Kindness,” though, snapped us back into his grim worldview with a trio of nihilistic tales about mental manipulation.

“Bugonia” falls somewhere between that film, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” and “The Lobster” in terms of both its double-sided callousness toward and guarded optimism about our willingness or ability to reverse course. 

It's both a funny, fucked-up trifle — one that hurtles toward a hilariously unsubtle, “Burn After Reading”-esque note of we-learned-nothing existential futility — and an earnest message movie for our disintegrating present, a warning that we are probably too late to effect any real change on the world we so vaingloriously messed up. Accusations of Lanthimos veering toward the twee of late (or always) apply less to “Bugonia,” which has no shortage of entrails or a torture scene set to, of all songs, Green Day's “Nick Shea.” 

 










Lanthimos' tenth feature would have been more consistently engaging, a real home run, as a 90-minute feature as opposed to two hours that encroach on a tedious overplaying of their themes. But would it then seem important enough? “Bugonia” is either profound or profoundly silly. It's also both.

This time, Lanthimos takes a stab at a remake, faithfully re-mounting, save for a few significant changes, Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 Korean sci-fi movie “Save the Green Planet!” Ultimately, this film's absurd existentialist deadpan aligns Lanthimos' work here closer to Ruben Östlund than ever — himself a filmmaker likely drawing from Lanthimos these days — to mine the comedy of repetitious futility to disorienting effect. Social burnout Teddy lives in the kind of paranoiac's hovel where the windows are papered over by tinfoil, and where you can all but feel the bugs crawling over you, while not working as a factory lackey for biomedical company Auxolith in middle-of-depressing-nowhere U.S.A. He maintains multiple beehives in his backyard, obsessing over the colony collapse disorder that threatens not just his bees, but all of them everywhere. Is his property the control room of a hoped-for utopia, or an unkempt truther's hell-hole bunker? You decide.

At the top of the Auxolith's pyramid is decorated CEO Michelle Fuller. She keeps a picture with Michelle Obama in her office, but bristles at the language of DEI training while knowing well enough to put on a placid, phony smile and encourage her employees to, sure, head home by 5:30 p.m. — one of many requisite gestures of pity toward her underlings that, dear God no, should not be understood by them as compulsory. One of those “we care about our employees” little treats of false gratitude that always comes with an asterisk, a footnote, and then that other footnote. 

 










Anyone who's been a cog in the corporate world can resonate with the hollow ring of Michelle's posturing, as if a gun was put to her head by a committee demanding she do better. In the boardroom, she's all for socially conscious messaging around her company's questionable medical advancements, but off the clock, when she's not popping mystery pills and singing to Chappell Roan in her shiny SUV, she has no trouble sleeping at night despite her company having destroyed lives with a vanguard opioid-withdrawal medication that backfired.

Teddy is one such casualty of Auxolith's pioneering biotechnology, with his mother (Alicia Silverstone) now in a coma bed with tubes attached after a drug trial gone wrong. So it makes sense that the chosen target of his master plan is Michelle herself. Jacked up on steroids, Teddy and his dutiful, clearly exploited cousin Don stage a home invasion, drugging and kidnapping Michelle to drag her back to Teddy's disheveled outpost. Lanthimos and cinematographer Robbie Ryan stage and shoot said home invasion like a Jacques Tati sequence — that is to say, from an amused, ironic distance that watches humans squirm and scramble without intervention. Though, of course, Lanthimos not intervening or getting too close to the action is its own sort of intervention, doing by not doing.

 










But “Bugonia” will eventually rub your face much closer into viscera and shrapnel and other bodily horrors. Emma Stone actually shaved her head for the movie, appearing to do so on camera with commendable, unfazed dedication to the task, as Teddy and Don hold Michelle hostage, and she starts to play along with the idea that, yeah, sure, she might be an extraterrestrial sent to our Earth to wreak havoc. Anything to get her out of those damned chains, and convince Teddy to loosen his tightening grasp, hell-bent on Michelle withdrawing her supposed species from Earth before the next lunar eclipse. Is Teddy insane, or actually onto something? The film is clever in how it constantly shifts our allegiances, and its own.

“Bugonia” is fascinating in contrast to a film like “Kinds of Kindness,” which Lanthimos shot almost as a lark, a slice of escapism from the large-scale demands of “Poor Things,” with a minimalist crew and set. His latest film is even more scaled-down — until it isn't — than “Kinds of Kindness,” serving almost as a stagelike chamber drama wrought on Super 35 and VistaVision. The canvas may be small, but Lanthimos colors inside the lines with grandeur, treating the deceptively walled-up material with the application of a bigger-budget studio project.

 










Stone is predictably great, but her Michelle Fuller is closer to her spiraling flip-anthropist in TV's “The Curse” than the can't-take-her-down feminist Bella Baxter of “Poor Things.” Lanthimos' skepticism of humankind's capacity to evolve is a welcome comfort, as always, in our politically miserable era. Some hot-button jokes land better than others, though “Bugonia” is always questioning the ideology on either side. Teddy confesses to having tried alt-right, “alt-lite,” Marxism, you name it, with no costume quite fitting his mentally collapsing outlook. There's a great line in which Teddy calls college education a “credentialist scam for laundering privilege,” and it's spoken so convincingly that it makes you wonder, well, isn't it?

A superb and unvarnished Plemons, who played a cherub-faced corporate drone in one of three roles in “Kinds of Kindness,” slims down and goes gaunter and more manic, physically and emotionally, than ever to play a borderline-psychopathic conspiracy head with sadistic tendencies. And don't count out Stavros Halkias in a Paul Walter Hauser-type performance as Teddy's childhood babysitter who's now the town cop. When cops show up at the door for a wellness check at an ongoing, in-the-basement hostage situation at any house in the movies, well, we know how that story ends.

 










The timely urgency of “Bugonia” could be identified from outer space unless you've been living under a celestial object these days, as rogue vigilantes taking down corporate bigwigs have, in a post-2020 world, turned into the folk heroes dominating headlines and activating internet warriors. That's not to say “Bugonia” carries an empowering message: If anything, it's distrusting in humanity's ability to rise above our own failures, arguing that while it's not too late to turn things around, we probably won't anyway.

“Bugonia” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Focus Features will release the film in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

Fall festivals supply the nutrients for a rich diet of films for the next six months, all the way until Oscar night. Venice launched Wednesday with Francis Coppola paying tribute to his friend Werner Herzog. On Thursday, Telluride revealed its lineup, which plays over the Labor Day weekend. (And, yes, the German maverick will fly to Telluride, as always.)

He's among the Telluride regulars who return for the summer-camp vibe in the mountains of Colorado. Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy usually throw a party. So does Muppet scion Lisa Henson. Oprah Winfrey is coming this year, even without a film, as are filmmakers Rian Johnson and Jason Reitman. (Herzog does have a film: documentary “Ghost Elephants,” shot in Namibia and Angola.)

“Our community is a real community,” said festival director Julie Huntsinger in a phone interview with IndieWire. “And I want everybody to hang out together and have fun and watch.”

This year, Huntsinger wants to avoid the scheduling snafus that led so many loyal badge holders ($780 each) standing in line for hours without seeing the big films. Distributors like to see how movies play for Telluride's cross-section of the national arthouse audience, passing word of mouth from line to line.

 










One clue that something special was happening last year with Sean Baker's Palme D'Or-winner “Anora” was the huge number of turnaways when the film was booked in small venues (patron passes, which cost $4,900, get in first). “Anora” eventually won five Oscars, including Best Picture. “Nobody saw that coming, I promise you, to the extent that it was popular,” said Huntsinger. “It's a crapshoot, what people will go crazy for.”

Huntsinger and her programmers cherry-pick titles from Sundance, Berlin, and especially Cannes. And well before Telluride co-founder Tom Luddy's death in 2023, Huntsinger has been flying solo and booking a strong lineup of highbrow awards contenders, classics, and idiosyncratic discoveries.

“We have exactly what we wanted,” she said. “Everything that plays in Cannes is fair game. We'll contact people and say, ‘Oh, we'd very much like to show it.' And I don't think we've ever been turned down.”

When it comes to new titles, though, the competition is fierce, even if Huntsinger pretends that Telluride doesn't truck in “world premieres,” and landing the celebrities who go with them. That requires distributors like Netflix to pony up for a private jet to fly George Clooney, Laura Dern, and Adam Sandler from Venice to Telluride for Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” a profile of an aging actor looking at himself in the mirror.

 










Also making the trek from Venice are Yorgos Lanthimos and his regulars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons, returning to the festival for Focus Features' “Bugonia.” “It's [Lanthimos'] usual, ‘Oh, my God. What was he thinking?,'” said Huntsinger. “This time, he has kicked the living shit out of Emma Stone. What more will he ask her to do? But it's a fantastic ride. Jesse Plemons will be the talk of everything.”

On the other hand, Kathryn Bigelow's Netflix film “A House of Dynamite” will not travel from Venice to Telluride. And so far, Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” starring Oscar Isaac as the scientist and Jacob Elordi as the monster, has not been announced. But there's always a “secret screening” or two as the festival runs its course.

Some titles on Telluride's top-secret lineup circulate in advance — inevitable as other festivals reveal their premieres and publicists organize their schedules. Prominent showings include Netflix's “Ballad of a Small Player” (Edward Berger's return after “Conclave”) starring Colin Farrell as a sad-sack gambler, and Chloé Zhao's adaptation of the bestselling tearjerker “Hamnet” (Focus), starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William and Agnes Shakespeare.

“Ballad of a Small Player” proves Berger's virtuosity, said Huntsinger. “It is true that Edward can direct anything, his versatility is so underrated. This is unusual and dreamy and almost like a bit of a Wong Kar-Wai feel. But he never feels derivative or copycat.”

 










“Hamnet” represents something of a homecoming: It was born out of a walk in the woods at Telluride 2022 with Zhao and Mescal when he was there for “Aftersun.” 

“The film is a meditation on loss from a feminine perspective,” said Huntsinger. “It shifts the story around Shakespeare to focus on his wife, but it doesn't diminish anybody in the process. Chloé's working with Paul and Jesse. They're like a beautiful instrument, all three of them working together.”

Other first-time showings include “Crazy Heart” director Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” (20th Century Studios). “It delivers,” said Huntsinger. “It's one of those movies that, on paper, sounds good, although musical performances can be iffy. But [Timothee] Chalamet knocked it out of the park with ‘A Complete Unknown.' Jeremy Allen White does the same, it's all his voice. It's not a singing-performance heavy film with the giant concert scenes. This is [Scott Cooper's] best movie.”

Huntsinger usually offers a few unexpected gems, like last year's “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics), which launched major new auteur Embeth Davidtz. This year's surprises include “Tuner,” the feature-directing debut of “Navalny” Oscar-winner Daniel Roher, starring Dustin Hoffman. (Its sound designer is “The Zone of Interest” Oscar-winner Johnnie Burn.) Huntsinger also made room for a last-minute submission from Ondi Timoner with her short film about losing a home to the Altadena fires, “All the Walls Came Down.”

 










Telluride launches Oscar conversations and reminds everyone of Cannes gems in the awards hunt. These include three prize-winners from Neon: “It Was Just an Accident” (director Jafar Panahi will accept a special tribute), “The Secret Agent,” starring Best Actor Cannes winner Wagner Moura, and Norwegian Oscar entry “Sentimental Value,” starring Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Rensve.

Skarsgård's son Alexander stars in risque entry, “Pillion” (A24), which debuted in Un Certain Regard. MUBI brings two films starring Josh O'Connor with Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound” and Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind.” Also showing is Harris Dickinson's directorial debut “Urchin” (1-2 Special), starring Un Certain Regard actor-winner Frank Dillane. Some missing titles, like Neon's “Sirat,” will turn up on the schedules at Toronto and NYFF.

Not screening at Telluride, or any of the fall festivals, is MUBI's $24-million Cannes pickup “Die, My Love” from Lynne Ramsay, which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. It earned mixed reviews at Cannes and might continue to do so. MUBI plans a wide release on November 7.

Also not in the festival lineups is Paul Thomas Anderson's Leonardo DiCaprio-starring “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros., September 26). Anderson doesn't like attending festivals.

 










Dickinson and Mescal will attend Telluride even though they're shooting one of Sam Mendes' Beatles movies (Dickinson is Paul McCartney; Mescal is John Lennon). The actual McCartney is on tour, so he will not be there to support Morgan Neville's Wings documentary “Man on the Run” (Amazon/MGM). Related: McCartney's former roommate, swinging '60s music producer Peter Asher, is the subject of Telluride documentary “Everywhere Man: The Life and Times of Peter Asher.” (McCartney once dated Peter's sister, Jane.)

Sundance hit “If I Had Legs I Could Kick You” could reignite Oscar talk around Rose Byrne's incendiary performance as a frayed mother with a special-needs child. And Berlin breakout “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) marks not only two festival entries from Richard Linklater, who also directed Cannes' “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix), but the Austin director's first visit to Telluride.

“Blue Moon” stars Telluride tributee Ethan Hawke as alcoholic songwriter Lorenz Hart, sadly watching his former partner Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) celebrate the opening night of “Oklahoma!” at Sardi's. (Scott took home the Berlin Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.) Hawke will also be at Telluride to support his Merle Haggard documentary, “Highway 99: A Double Album.”

 










Telluride continue to support documentaries, which are often neglected at festivals like Cannes. (Ironically, Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux directed a documentary, “Lumière, le Cinéma,” which is among the 15 in the main SHOW.) “Sometimes they're better than the scripted films that are out nowadays,” said Huntsinger.

Telluride docs include “Summer Tour” (Grateful Dead & Co.); “Ask E. Jean,” Ivy Meeropol's portrait of E. Jean Carroll, who is now 82; Laura Poitras' “Cover-Up,” a profile of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh; Nick Hooker's “Karl,” about Karl Lagerfeld, and “Lost in the Jungle” from Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, a search-and-rescue mission about Colombian children who survived a plane crash. “It is a thriller,” said Huntsinger. “Even though you know the ending.”

There's a plethora of films from the U.K., from Plan B's adaptation of bestselling memoir “H is for Hawk” starring Claire Foy and an Eurasian goshawk (it's already screening for distributors), to Riz Ahmed's South Asian take on “Hamlet.” “That country, that culture, they support filmmaking,” said Huntsinger. “Every aspect of it.” She's grateful, as the American supply of films feels diminished, “with our cupboard being a little bare right now.”

After Venice and Telluride come the larger amplifier festivals Toronto and New York and a series of regional festivals from the Hamptons and Middleburg to SCAD. Oscar campaigners will relentlessly bang the drums through March. But Telluride gets the beat started.

Hungarian-Jewish filmmaker László Nemes has returned with his first film in seven years and — it's no coincidence — his third successive movie set in or around wartime. Considering the neorealist “Orphan” is based on his father's own upbringing in post-war Budapest, it's easy to see why world chaos and its impact on everyday life has become something of a fixation for him. 

Its conceit is a neat one for a film — and totally believable for a family history from anarchic Eastern Europe after the Second World War. A boy is raised with fables of a long-lost father assumed to have fallen victim to the Nazi camps. Young Andor (Bojtorján Barabas) still clings to hope he may return, despite the best efforts of his mother Klara (Andrea Waskovics) to persuade him that 12 years would surely be long enough for him to have returned to Budapest safe and well.

Instead, a burly butcher called Mihály (Grégory Gadebois) shows up at their door, claiming to be Andor's father. Mihály's arrival — or return — prompts an existential crisis for Andor. Mihály is a brute who mistreats his mother. And he kills pigs for a living. For Andor, this is a personal and ethnic catastrophe, prompting unwelcome questions about who he was brought up to be. Mihály lives in the countryside, rides a motorbike, drinks heavily, and prefers boxing to football. Even in an era in which red flags are holy, this all stands out as excessive. Andor runs away to the synagogue his family had attended before the war, but finds no fulfillment there, either.

 










More pressing than Andor's personal crisis is the political one engulfing Hungary. The Soviets have put down a rebellion against the puppet government that ruled in Budapest and are now in the process of picking off the politicians, students, and general who had led it. One of those still hiding underground is the older brother of Andor's best friend Sàri (Elíz Szabó). Amid the chaos and fear, Andor doesn't have the space to explore his bubbling uncertainties. They risk overflowing and threatening more than just his family's safety.

Andor's adolescent romance with Sàri is a silver lining in a dark place. They roam the streets together and get up to general mischief. Andor is cheeky and has charisma, which endears him to Sàri. More important than his rizz, though, is a gun he picked up somewhere along the way. Andor attends Seder at Sàri's house, where her grandfather reminds them: “The adults and the children fled to Egypt. But only the children entered the promised land.”

Nemes' assessment of that sentiment — that these kids would inherit a promised land in post-war Eastern Europe — is not optimistic. Though “Orphan” has a soft sepia glint (and, on the 35mm film it was shot on, it sings), this is far from nostalgia. The subtext of “Orphan” seems to be that Eastern Europe's Jews must survive the post-war order by getting into bed — sometimes literally — with some unusual, unsavory characters. Klara's pragmatism disillusions Andor, but she is a grown-up: without any faith in a coming promised land, what else is there to do?

 










The depiction of the social anarchy that befell once-great cities of Europe after the war for decades after it ended is distinct and effective. Nemes is clearly influenced by the greats in this area. Andor's escapades have shades of “Bicycle Thieves.” More directly, “Orphan” seems to be impacted by Roberto Rossellini's under-appreciated “Germany, Year Zero,” about another lonesome fair-haired boy, filmed in the rubble of post-war Berlin. It helps that Barabas as Andor has the face of a neo-realist hero, and Gadebois the face of a neo-realist villain. In fact, Gadebois could be a fairly convincing villain in any genre and any era. 

“Orphan” is not a low-budget film by any means but its filmmaking is minimalist. Nemes, as he always has, thrives on trickery, choreography, and blocking rather than grand set pieces. As Andor and Sàri sprint through the busy streets of Budapest past shops and trucks, a wooden plank is missing from a vehicle at exactly the height so we can see their faces. In another scene, a wooden cut-out where people can pose as pilots of an airplane is being carried past Klara and Mihály, who inadvertently appear inside it — but there isn't room onboard for Andor. 

Nemes' understanding of the filming methods of the era in which his movie is based sets “Orphan” out from other, more conventional historical dramas. As with “Son of Saul” and “Sunset,” this is a sophisticated endeavor and, in craft terms, a level above the norm. Credit to cinematographer and longtime Nemes collaborator Mátyás Erdély for shooting a film that doesn't look like anything else at Venice this year. It doesn't sound like much else, either. Russian composers Evgueni and Sacha Galperine opt for an old-fashioned swelling score that sits well with the '30s-era pop songs Klara is often seen listening to. 

 










But it's not all fun and games: as sirens wail in Budapest, they continue like long notes even after the police have departed. Even in moments of relative calm, alarm is only ever around the corner.

“Orphan” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

A fly-on-the-wall documentary about the making of an $120 million movie that nobody saw and even fewer people liked, Mike Figgis' “Megadoc” — shot on the Fayetteville, Georgia set of Francis Ford Coppola's “Megalopolis” — boasts all the fineries of a DVD bonus feature, and makes little effort to contextualize its footage for anyone who isn't already on a first-name basis with immortal characters like Clodio Pulcher and Wow Platinum. (Both of whom were only immortal in the figurative sense, of course, as the former was hanged upside down like Benito Mussolini, while the latter was killed by a crossbow that Jon Voight disguised as his dick.) But don't let that stop you from watching it.

Yes, it's true that I belong to the small cohort of critics who were charmed by the childlike optimism of Coppola's greatest folly. And no, my feelings about “Megalopolis” — which I saw as the strangely egoless self-portrait of an eccentric genius who dared to stake his fortune on a more optimistic vision of the future — haven't diminished since the film's humiliation ritual of a release, even if public opinion about the movie has somehow gotten worse over the last 15 months. 

 










I don't mention all of that as a point of pride (it's not), but rather to establish where I'm coming from when I argue that Figgis' doc — patchy and unpolished as it is — reaffirms what I found so vital about “Megalopolis” at the same time as it illustrates why it was still a singular trainwreck. 

“Cinema is the only art that kills what it's trying to preserve,” Coppola declares, and the last 30 years of his career — starting with “One from the Heart,” but very much including “Jack” — have stemmed from his efforts to capture that thing without snuffing it out. To create a cinema that doesn't feel like a succession of taxidermied images. To his mind, movies are so moribund because people approach them as work; as fossilization rather than creation. “Toil gives you nothing,” he declares at some point during the long and wacky rehearsal process for “Megalopolis.” “Play gives you everything.” 

But at what cost? It's no secret that Coppola invested a fortune of his own money to fund this movie, and to buy himself the luxury of making it on his own terms. The prospect scares him, as he confesses to his late wife Eleanor in a brief snippet of footage that Figgis includes from before the shoot (it's fitting that “Megadoc” begins and ends as a tribute to the director of the greatest Coppola-in-crisis documentary ever made), but as Jacques Tati once said: “Who cares if you died broke if you put all your money into something you think is beautiful?” 

 










A lot of people, it turns out. Made in the face of an industry so choked of its creative lifeblood that movie-lovers have started evaluating films like accountants, “Megalopolis” should have been received with the graciousness of an unsolicited gift, but most pundits were more only interested in the receipt. I can't begrudge anyone for rolling their eyes at such a clunky, garish, and unrelentingly sincere technofable that feels like it's been reheated in the microwave one — or 100 — too many times since Coppola started thinking about it in 1983, but I was saddened by the sheer hostility that greeted the mere idea of a self-funded passion project, as if it were gauche and embarrassing for a revered auteur to sink his wine money back into art without any real hope of recouping his investment. “What currency am I paid in?,” Coppola asks a combative Shia LaBeouf. The actor guesses “love.” The correct response was “fun.” 

The movies have always been inextricable from the cost of making them, but what might it look like if they weren't? The collective eagerness to mock the mere existence of “Megalopolis” leads me to suspect that most people may not really want to know the answer. “When we leap into the unknown,” the great Cesar Catilina once said, “we prove that we are free.” The trouble with freedom, of course, is that it exposes our limitations, which can be incredibly frustrating in its own right. Play gives you everything — including a new kind of toil all its own. 

 










“Megadoc” doesn't offer any kind of who's-who or what's-what for people who aren't already familiar with Coppola's film, and I can't pretend to imagine what Figgis' documentary might be like for people who don't know what “Megalopolis” is about, but I suspect that it still manages to resolve as a broadly fascinating look at the full toll of filmmaking — not just on the wallet, but also on the soul. 

There's octogenarian Francis Ford Coppola, giddily discussing the Days Inn he bought as a production base and happily misquoting Dante to his cast on the first day of their open-ended rehearsal process (“Abandon worry all ye who enter here,” the director insists). There's Wow Platinum herself Aubrey Plaza playing some kind of improv game with Dustin “Nush” Hoffman and Nathalie Emmanuel. There's LaBeouf, looking malevolent without eyebrows as he candidly discusses how he “fucked his whole life up” in the time since he first read the script, and how he had to make amends to Jon Voight as part of the ninth step of his recovery process; this will be the only time the film alludes to incidents of sexual violence, though Figgis appears to include the briefest of snippets from the shoot where Coppola allegedly kissed female extras without their consent. 

 










“Megalopolis” is one of those movies that feels like it offers an accurate window behind the scenes of its own creation process, and “Megadoc” confirms as much without ever becoming redundant. Everyone on location for rehearsal seems excited to be there, even if nobody knows exactly where “there” might be. Although the project had been gestating for so many decades, the footage makes clear that Coppola was still most animated by the thrill of discovery, and that he was eager to run with any of the enthusiasm that his collaborators brought to the table. 

The specifics of how that worked are largely left to the imagination (“Megadoc” is curiously short and scattershot for a documentary that must have been culled from untold hours of footage), but the mad circus vibe comes through loud and clear. Everyone seems to be high on the “is this really happening?” of it all, especially the department heads, who appear equal parts thrilled and nervous about the scale of the job at hand. 

Likewise, almost nobody seems bothered by the presence of Figgis' Nikon Z8 camera, as if there's a communal agreement that it would be wrong not to record the making of a movie that has been fighting to get off the ground for so long. (“Megadoc” includes several clips from earlier table reads and test shoots, which feature the likes of Robert De Niro and a young Ryan Gosling.) Adam Driver is the only person who may have been uncomfortable with the intrusion; a non-presence until the very end of the documentary, his elusiveness makes “Megadoc” feel considerably smaller than its title might imply.

 










Things become considerably more volatile when the actual shoot begins and Coppola's Willy Wonka-like charm — as Plaza describes it — is put to the test by the demands of realizing his mad vision once and for all. And by the demands of working with Shia LaBeouf, whose method hinges upon antagonizing his director at every turn. Shooting “Apocalypse Now” was a field day compared with the challenge of getting LaBeouf to accept the blocking of a simple dialogue scene, and Coppola — whose eruptions of anger and subsequent retreats to his Airstream RV fly in the face of the spirit he was trying to cultivate on set — eventually concedes that LaBeouf is “the biggest fucking pain in the ass of any actor I've ever worked with.” More than that, Coppola is forced to wonder if he's become too old and grouchy for this kind of work, which is a crushing thing to ask for someone who's done everything in his power to make it feel like play. 

There are still rules, even within the ultimate freedom. Actors still need direction, bills still need to be paid, and personal boundaries still need to be respected. But to watch “Megadoc” is to appreciate why “Megalopolis” feels more vital than so many other films, and also why it feels completely out of control at the same time. It's to understand how a legendary auteur can marshal all of his power and personal finances towards the ultimate bet on the future of his art form, only for it to feel like an act of charity — like everyone who participated in the project was only doing so to humor him. It's to understand that “Megalopolis” was riveting less for its story than for its Schrödinger-like ability to articulate why the movies feel so alive even while they're dying, and also why they feel so dead even when there's still so much life in the people who make them.

There is only one Werner Herzog. The stoic German who, after being shot during an interview, replied in his signature deadpan, “it is not a significant bullet,” has an affinity for those at the end of the world — death row inmates, loners, mystics. Across his extraordinary body of work he has slipped between fiction and documentary with the ease of a man who doesn't fear death. Now, aged 82, he has been steadily making documentaries exploring a mixture of modern and ancient phenomena — anything that enables him to travel and interview interesting oddballs. “Ghost Elephants” arrives with a little extra fanfare, premiering in Venice alongside the festival awarding him a lifetime achievement award in the form of an Honorary Lion.

On the surface, “Ghost Elephants” appears to be a throwback to one of Herzog's canonical classics “Grizzly Man” (2005). Ill-fated American bear enthusiast and filmmaker Timothy Treadwell and living South African conservationist and explorer Dr. Steve Boyes are both men more comfortable living within nature than amongst their fellow humans. We meet Boyes misty-eyed at The Smithsonian National History Museum as he stands before the taxidermied corpse of the largest bull elephant to be exhibited in any museum. This, he explains, is “Henry” and Boyes has carried a photo of him around for a decade, only now seeing him for the first time. It is his dream to find the living descendants of Henry who he believes may roam in an elevated Angolan plateau nicknamed “the source of life.”

The hubristic nature of the expedition that follows, and the landscapes captured, call to mind a very different Herzog title. Although Boyes is far mellower than the wild-eyed Klaus Kinski, the pointless desire to make inroads in a land that does not need him evokes something of “Fitzcarraldo” (1982). This judgement is mine, for Herzog is far subtler and more ambivalent in his framing of Boyes, not fully suggesting in this film — made for the National Geographic with Disney money — that his subject is a loon but, equally, not leaving that interpretation off the table.

If Herzog has been compelled by the nature of the assignment to show reserve in the depiction of his leading man, he is more full-throated when it comes to his portrayal of the elephants in question; in the gulf between his enthusiasms, it is possible to see where his strongest sympathies lie. For although the scene at The Smithsonian initially seems set up to introduce us to Dr. Steve Boyes, it also introduces us to Henry, a majestic mammal technically called “The Fénykövi Elephant” after his killer, Josef Fénykövi.

To contextualize Henry, Herzog makes the most of time spent in Namibia, where Boyes has gone to find a crack team of master trackers from the Ju/Hoansi San Bushmen in the Kalahari, one of the oldest cultures on Earth whose language includes clicking. We meet a man named Xui who can “read tracks like a newspaper.” We also meet an aspiring soccer player turned anthropologist who tells the story of how Henry was shot and then chased for 15km in stark, brutal terms. 

 










Herzog inserts a clip from the 1966 film “Africa Addis” of a family of elephants being gunned from a helicopter (anecdotally, a member of the audience was sobbing), as well as photos of a grinning Fénykövi in front of the wrinkled mountain of Henry's fallen body. The absurdity of men thinking it's an achievement to destroy beautiful creatures comes across in powerful terms. As the anthropologist puts it, “Man is on a mission to destroy what he's part of, which is biodiversity.” It's hard not to remember one of Herzog's most iconic and indelible lines, “I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility, and murder.”

Times have changed and big-game hunting is out of fashion, although coming so soon after harrowing images of elephant poaching, it is alarming when we witness the trackers working a deadly poison into a dart. “Ghost Elephants” is nothing if not a film which commits to asides, and it is compelling when Xui tells a story of his own brush with the poison. Indeed, it is in the patchwork of vignettes that unfold around Boyes, rather than the portrait of the man himself, that the film breathes and Werner Herzog's auteurial colors flourish. 

His whimsical adoration of the mighty beasts at the heart of things is expressed in footage of elephants moving underwater. These sequences — and cut-aways to other rare beasts — offer a magical respite from the underbaked plans of a man whose motive in finding the ghost elephants is never fully articulated. The implication is it's part of a conservation effort and yet, as Dr. Boyes, Werner Herzog, San Bushman trackers, and trackers from the Luchazi tribe make the 2-day trip from Namibia to the Angolan highlands, the end goal is not given any anticipatory gravity. 

 










Herzog weighs every scene equally, not using one to hype up the next. An audience with the King of Nkangala — whose permission is required to track the ghost elephants — unfolds as casually as  footage of a tribesmen spending all day fixing his instrument. There is, in fact, more awe to the latter sequence as expressed in narration: “I know I shouldn't romanticize him but I know that … surrounded by chickens … it doesn't get any better than that.” 

This is a jazz film held together by Herzog's distinctive narration with its irreverent sense of humor. It is both frustrating and intriguing to be kept in ignorance regarding his true views on Boyes. His subtle negging at the point of narrative climax is entertaining, yet it does also impact the structure of “Ghost Elephants” itself, denying us an overarching sense of perspective. The pleasure of listening to Herzog speak comes from his bracing candor, so it's hard not to feel that something is amiss in his implication-driven take on Boyes. 

Still, for those willing to piece the picture together from its most glorious sections, this is an affectionate and affection-inducing pursuit of real animals and unreachable dreams. 

“Ghost Elephants” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The greatest shaved female heads in cinema history are undoubtedly Renée Falconetti in “La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc” and Sigourney Weaver in “Alien 3.” Between those two poles of follicle-free cinema lie a universe of filmmaking — and a new entry is about to enter its ranks: Yorgos Lanthimos‘s “Bugonia,” which just released its official trailer timed to its Venice debut (it had already shown footage at CinemaCon). 

“Bugonia” stars the director's now-repeat collaborator Emma Stone as a corporate CEO living the life: power suits, indoor pools, Time and Forbes covers. The only annoyance in her life is making sure she nails the bit of corporate jargon she's supposed to make sound natural in a video shoot. Then she's kidnapped, her head shaved by her abductors, and she's told her hair “has been destroyed” to prevent her from using it to contact her mothership.

Ah.




			Popular on IndieWire		






Jesse Plemons plays the abductor, a conspiracy theorist who fashions himself as the leader of the human resistance against what he believes is an alien takeover of Earth… and he thinks Stone's CEO is an alien. So we're guessing on the “shaved head cinema” spectrum, this will veer closer to “Alien 3.”

 










“Bugonia” is a Venice premiere and is Stone's fourth teaming with Lanthimos after “The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and “Kinds of Kindness.” It's written by “The Menu” co-scribe Will Tracy, who also wrote for “Succession,” so expect some pointed satire indeed. And, it's a remake of the 2003 South Korean movie “Save the Green Planet!”

Producer Jerry Ko said last year, “We started out with the belief that the film's concept was ahead of its time and that [maybe we] could make an indie movie, but as we traveled around Hollywood, we realized that there were many hidden fans of the original film,” said Ko. “I happened to be in L.A. and saw Ari Aster moderating a screening of ‘Save the Green Planet!' at a theater, so I reached out to him and asked him to be a part of the production. So he came on board as a producer. Then Will Tracy, a screenwriter of ‘Succession,' came on board and wrote the story. The buzz started to build from then on.”

Focus Features will release “Bugonia” in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and expand wide on Friday, October 31. Watch the trailer for “Bugonia” below.

Yeah, Earl Sweatshirt is rapping his ass off again. Since he was a teenager, you could count on him for that the way you can count on Aaron Judge to hit a moonshot to centerfield. For some years now—probably since he hopped on a Drakeo the Ruler remix talking blue strips and Ksubi jeans—it's felt as if he's been in a hip-hop bootcamp, soaking up, if I had to guess, everything from the casual flexes of the Michigan rap scene to the head-bustin' word-foolery of the Ultramagnetic MCs.

His loose-lipped guest verses on the posse cut “Real hiphop” and El Cousteau's “Words2LiveBy” are formative in that respect, balancing the heavy with the light, seriousness with some swag: “Free Gaza, we on the corner like Israelites.” His new album, Live Laugh Love, isn't as obviously ambitious as his coming-of-age statement, I Don't Like Shit I Don't Go Outside, or the stylistic rebirth that is Some Rap Songs, but that's not a bad thing. On this album, he avoids any stagnancy by digging deeper into feelings that are both uncomfortable and life-affirming.

Live Laugh Love—the title seems to slightly troll the inspirational slogan you might find framed in a T.J. Maxx—sounds straight out of a half-remembered dream. Barely over 24 minutes, it's a flurry of conversation scraps, inside jokes, hoops references, repurposed song lyrics, childhood memories, and moments of self-discovery that seems to put just as much into how the words sound as what the words mean. Earl leans into a lyrical absurdity and stream-of-consciousness that isn't quite at Buhloone Mindstate levels of eccentric silliness (he shouts out De La's Dave Trugoy on the bleary “Gamma (Need the <3)”) but has a little of that sauce. “Jiggy bricklayer like J Hov breaker breaker they can't close,” he raps from the gut on the intro “gsw vs sac.” The density is overwhelming, and yet he makes it sound so effortlessly cool and easy to listen to.

A lot of that tension comes from the warmth and fried bounce of Live Laugh Love's instrumentals; they amplify the sentimentality and anxiety in Earl's stitched-together fragments. The beats by the Long Island producer Theravada are especially ragged, like a basketball that has been pounded into the pavement till its rubber's peeled (apparently a lot of the album was recorded after Earl and Theravada's pickup hoop sessions). But they also have a real slow-dance-with-your-girl groove to them. I can hear that in the sweetness of the gentle piano riff and mellow soul loop of “Infatuation” that turns a little warped in moments because of how the beat cuts in and out, as well as in the hazy funk flip of “Forge” that would be smooth if the background screams and zooming cars didn't make it sort of uneasy. “I'm playin' bae I'm still in love with you let's get in the tub,” raps Earl on “Forge,” sounding kinda affectionate, but also kinda deadly afraid of the responsibilities that come with love.

If IDLSIDGO became known as the Earl is sad album, there might be a tendency to label Live Laugh Love the Earl is happy now album, but it's more complex than that. His excitement for marriage and fatherhood has the all too real fear of What if I fuck it all up? and yet, with the comic timing of a long-winded standup, he gets out of his own head with jokes. On “exhaust,” that comes in the form of taking a break from all of the personal meditations with a play on an old 2 Chainz hook: “Ya love stank bitches that's your fuckin' problem.” While on “Crisco,” Earl digs into the childhood anger that's still affecting him to this day, but just before that, he declares, “Get these white girls out my home like Babyfather.” Dr. Umar would be proud.

The way his flow has become a lot more loose and unpredictable helps him draw out certain emotions, too. In the final few moments of “Static,” the disgusted pause he takes before he says “It didn't shock me” turns some seemingly ordinary shit talk into a devastatingly funny lecture, in a DOOM kind of way. Speaking of DOOM, Earl still has a splash of the masked villain in his cadence, but mixed in with so many contemporary references done with his own flavor. When he spouts out, “Affogato cream and coffee, wally walker out the bottle drinkin', I never got on LinkedIn” on “Heavy Metal aka ejecto seato!,” the sensible gibberish reminds me of California street rap, specifically the first few bars of WhoHeem's “Dum Hands.” Also, “Live,” where over a Black Noi$e beat that is like haunted Backwoodz vibes meets sputtering StepTeam drums, Earl slurs his words almost as hard as Veeze. And not for no reason, that flow makes the song sound so deeply insular.

It's a lot. Live Laugh Love is equal parts heart and style, and is as much about Earl the grown man as Earl the hip-hop head. Earl shouts out friends, blots the album with relationship details that maybe only a few other people in the world would fully comprehend, and brings up his emotional bond with his son. These are his touchpoints, so it makes sense that everything else—the word-association marathons, the flowery punchlines—seems like an inconsequential blur. There are a few moments that ground it all even further: the dream he mentions on “Heavy Metal aka ejecto seato!” that he had years before his son was born, in which the baby was walking on the ceiling; on “Tourmaline,” the best song on the album, when in a romantically woozy rap-sing he goes, “She found me on the streets, she vowin' to keep my feet grounded for my sweet child” so earnestly. There's so much musical and personal inspiration colliding at once, you can feel the passion even when you can't quite crack it all.

In a dark gallery, looking into a bright room with snow-covered floors and a square hole cut from its center—this is how a viewer experiences A Cold Hole, an installation by artist Taryn Simon. But it's not a static encounter: Watching from the gallery, you'll routinely see someone enter the bright room, climb into the hole, and plunge into icy water beneath it. Simon sought to probe questions about public praise and personal desire. But when singer-songwriter Dana Foote saw the piece at an art museum in Western Massachusetts, the dark pit struck her as a powerful metaphor for a period of depression or stagnancy—a “psychological winter,” she's called it.

Foote was in one such winter while writing Swallow the Knife, her latest record as Sir Chloe. Inspired by Simon's piece, she started referring to this state as being “in the hole,” and named the opening track on her new album after it. “The thrill is gone/And nothing's new,” she sings, despondent, over a crunch of guitars, “I've been in the hole.” It's a bouncy, deceptively upbeat song, especially given the circumstance it describes—and a fitting opening for a record of combustible, cathartic indie rock that mulls dark themes.

Foote began recording music as part of her senior thesis at Bennington College; after a track from her first record went viral on TikTok, she landed a major-label deal, capping her 21st-century trajectory with a grungey, '90s-inflected album, I Am the Dog. (The relationship with her label soured and they have since parted ways.) Her latest release follows in this vein, channeling PJ Harvey and the Pixies while detailing Foote's experience extricating herself from an abusive relationship and her grief in the face of what she endured. “Go on and tell me you're the victim/Go on and tell me I'm the cruel one,” she hisses over a plucky guitar riff on “Kiss,” then chews through the syllables of the fuzzed-out chorus. “I don't want love,” she repeats, “I want revenge.” These are songs fueled by rage, but beset by migraines, secrets, shame, tears.

Foote is a commanding singer, her voice evoking a particular slice of the millennial canon: St. Vincent on the foreboding “Holy”; Metric's Emily Haines on the swaggering “Forget It.” On “Complicated,” she's haunted by the past, her voice nearly shaking then growing steadier: “I won't forget the cold and seething sound/It wakes me up and follows me around.” She stretches her range on “Take It,” murmuring its verses and howling its chorus—and delivering the bridge as spoken word, a risky move that she mostly pulls off thanks to a cool, detached tone. These are compact, punchy songs; they rarely offer any real surprises, though they do, savvily and consistently, manage to generate a sticky riff or memorable hook within their first 30 seconds.

Swallow the Knife loses steam in the final stretch, slowing down to offer a handful of quasi-ballads: the newly infatuated “Eyes,” whose intro doesn't not recall “Fade Into You”; the mournful “Too Much (Not Enough).” Its final track, “Candy,” is an extended metaphor about a toxic relationship—a partner who seems like a treat at first, but ultimately can't offer anything of substance, only “aching teeth.” The song's power rests in its simplicity: just fingerpicked guitar and Foote's voice, which eventually resolves into a series of girl-group-inspired harmonies that start off sunny but become unsettled. After an album of angst, betrayal, and survival, it feels like a tactical retreat—like washing out a sour aftertaste to make way for something sweeter.

Across two albums and a near-perfect singles collection in the early 2010s, Hunx and His Punx spritzed a campy perfume cloud in garage rock's musky basement. The California-based band crash-landed with catchy-as-fuck songs about eating makeup and hooking up with guys with shitty music taste, delivered over fuzzed-out guitar and stacked harmonies that tossed the Ramones and the Shangri-Las into a blender. Lead singer and guitarist Seth Bogart, vocalist and bassist Shannon Shaw, and drummer Erin Emslie's candy-colored, John Waters-inspired rock'n'roll fantasia relished in vulgarity but had a bleeding heart, even as they indulged in art-punk antics onstage (see: sky-high wigs, elaborate stage design, or Bogart drinking from water bottles filled with his own piss between songs).

On comeback album Walk Out on This World, their first outing since going on hiatus in 2013, Hunx and His Punx mature in their own way. Following several years reckoning firsthand with grief—Shaw lost her fiancé in a car accident in 2022, and Bogart's Los Angeles home was devastated in the Eaton fires earlier this year—here the band sheds its early mischief in favor of jangling garage rock filled with heartache and disillusionment about both lost loves and the burning Earth itself. Coming together like a series of lucid morning-after revelations, Walk Out on This World sharpens the band's toolkit through brawny guitar riffs, rousing lyrics, and near-equal time given to Bogart and Shaw's voices, adding depth and color to their punk and girl-group homages.

Despite the occasionally serious subject matter, Walk Out on This World's themes still arrive tucked into jubilant, hard-nosed punk. A kick drum knocks like a heartbeat on “Rainy Day in LA,” where Shaw delivers a sorrowful treatise. “Since you went away I had to warm up the thoughts in my mind/Since you went away I had to thaw out my frozen insides,” she sings, until the weight of the sentiment gives way beneath her. Recalling The Moon Is in the Wrong Place, Shaw's stellar, heartbroken 2023 album with Shannon and the Clams, her wildly expressive, gravelly voice evinces a spectrum of emotion: disappointment, resignation, and eventually anguish consume her. She carries the same gravitas on the title track, a gorgeous slow-burner that sounds like it's echoing from a jukebox in a smoky roadhouse. “What if I walked out on this world?” she asks over a swinging, rockabilly guitar. “I'm just so numb/Is it time to go home?” Shaw's spiral finds clarity during the song's moving chorus, injecting emotion with her gale-force voice: “Right on time/He floats into my mind and says/‘Oh, what a waste that would be.'”

When Bogart takes lead, meanwhile, the band locks into a hive mind around him. Whether it's his charmingly snotty delivery on “No Way Out”'s whirling chorus or the doo-wop-style spoken word bridge on “Wild Boys,” Bogart's queeny vocal style is still a welcome anomaly in rock music a decade and change later. It works especially well on “Top of the Punks,” where he laments the worst parts of fame: “I don't wanna sing those songs but everyone expects it from me,” he admits, “I can't walk around anywhere in my town without hearing, ‘Are you Hunx?'” It's funny, but there's a deeper pull, his doubt adding a new layer of complexity to a persona often consumed with the hedonistic pleasures of a rock'n'roll lifestyle.

The band still makes time for those pleasures, too. “Little Richard” is Shaw's ode to the diva himself, as sincere in its intentions as it is campy fun, calling on “Uncle Richard” for spiritual guidance in the face of chaos. “Grab Yr Pearls,” meanwhile, turns that chaos on its head, offering up a bacchanal instead. “Don't turn on the TV, I can't read the news/It's all bad, all I wanna do is cruise,” Bogart bemoans, letting some of his alter ego's obstinately horny side peek through again. “Nothing good is happening in the world tonight…/The world's so fucked up, but don't we look good?” Like the best songs on Walk Out on This World, the moment beams their sound through a new prism, tackling grander concepts with their typical humor and verve.

Should we blame whoever it was who introduced a teenage Morgan Wallen to Take Care? (I just know a young Morgan got in his feelings to “Good Ones Go Interlude” after a session at the batting cages.) Or Earl Sweatshirt for making fun of “White Iverson” so hard that he scared Post Malone into ditching FKi beats and Key! features for Nashville bars and Super Bowl ads with Shane Gillis? Or maybe it was when we lowered the bar, in 2019, by letting “Old Town Road” dominate the world. Could it be when a former Goth Money Records collaborator fused 2000s radio-rap nostalgia with honky-tonk aesthetics for one of the biggest singles of the 21st century? (There's an alternate universe where Shaboozey is hanging out backstage at Bladee shows instead of on Beyoncé albums.) Whatever it is, the algorithmic cross-pollination happening between popular rap (mostly from the South) and pop-country has been leading to a lot of shitty music lately.

Obviously, this isn't anything new. I was kid when Nelly and Tim McGraw's duet was on the radio and Bubba Sparxxx's pig wrestling music video for “Ugly” was on TV. It does feel particularly inescapable now, though, to the point that when I'm walking around Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn it's not unusual to run into a country-themed bar with knockoff 808 Mafia hi-hats rumbling into the streets whenever the bouncer opens the door to let in a couple dressed like John Travolta and Debra Winger in Urban Cowboy. There's also a tradition of deeply Southern rap that isn't country music but still country as hell. For example, anything associated with Pimp C and Trill Entertainment, especially Boosie on Bad Azz talking about his preacher grandfather, mustard greens, and his $40,000 Dodge Charger in his bluesy twang. Grounded stuff out of Georgia, too, like Ghetto Mafia's “Straight From the Dec,” T.I.'s “Still Ain't Forgave Myself,” and Field Mob's “Project Dreamz.” And pretty much whatever was hot in Houston and Dallas before Obama first got elected.

BigXthaPlug is a Texas boy. He grew up listening to UGK in the car with his mom. As far as a New Yorker like myself can tell, he is country, but his relationship with country music itself was fairly nonexistent until he released a track called “Texas” back in 2022. It's a hell of a song. Over a funky Shuggie Otis sample and with his molasses voice that sounds naturally screwed, he depicts his home state as the land of gun-toting, lean-sipping money-getters, shouting out Z-Ro, Devin the Dude, Pimp C, Yung Nation, and more along the way. It's real vibrant, groovy, and kinda sweet, so much so that country music titans like the fiery Luke Combs and ol' Morgan started showing him love. At the time, BigX wasn't familiar with Wallen, but his team described the singer to him as a country Drake.

In the last few years, over a few decent mixtapes, BigX built a reputation as the torchbearer of Texas storytelling rap. He's got an interesting story, one that could be in a Larry McMurtry novel if Larry McMurtry wrote about Black dudes. He's a big guy from Dallas who earned his way onto the football team at a small Christian college in Minnesota. He started to get into trouble, got kicked out of school and banned from his apartment complex, and ended up getting an ex pregnant while he was still staying at his granny's house. Motivated by fatherhood, he started putting it all into his music.

While BigX was building momentum, country music firmly took over the Billboard charts. And a lot of the most successful songs threaded trap production and hip-hop-style talk-singing ways into traditional mainstream country themes. As I write this, there are eight country songs in the top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100 and only one rap song. That one rap song is Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther,” which has writing credits by Ink, who contributed to Cowboy Carter.

Ink is also singing forgettably on Track 9 of I Hope You're Happy, BigXThaPlug's new country album, which was written in the midst of a breakup. For the album, BigX embedded himself into Nashville's country music scene, doing, I guess, what you're supposed to do when you go there: go to bars and smoke cigarettes with Post Malone. He also had to take time to adjust from the off-the-cuff recording habits popular in rap (i.e., smoke a bunch of weed and make a dozen songs in one night) to the meticulous and structured songmaking process of Big Nashville. It was probably a good time, as the scene, which has been historically hostile to Black artists, seemed to welcome him in with open arms. It's nice that he may have had some good times, but the music isn't any good; it's tidy and professional to the point that none of the emotion feels real.

Surrounded by a bunch of big, hokey hooks from veterans and newcomers of the pop-country elite—Daris Rucker, Luke Combs, Thomas Rhett—and an army of songwriters, BigX goes through the ups and downs of a broken heart. “Ayy, if it's over, it's over, so fuck it/Just don't act like my love wasn't nothin',” he raps on the album's hit single “All the Way,” with a chorus by the scratchy-voiced Bailey Zimmerman that sounds like some god-awful Nickelback shit. (Remember when Bailey made that dog-shit song with YoungBoy for Fast X?) BigX's wounded lyrics don't save the song, either, trying so hard to be relatable to everyone that it's missing the regional specificity that made “Texas” so cool. Less insufferable but still a complete misfire is “Pray Hard,” with Luke Combs, mostly because the overly extravagant trap-country production makes me feel like I'm at the happy hour of a Western-themed restaurant with a gift shop.

In fact, there are so many contributors over the 11 songs that BigX's perspective seems drowned out and scaled back. It doesn't help that a bunch of the choruses are a tough hang: Jelly Roll's melodramatics come off so whiny, and Tucker Wetmore, another former college football player, has a colorless voice born to soundtrack The Summer I Turned Pretty breakups. I get any feeling from only Ella Langley on “Hell at Night,” as she has a sentimentality that makes you not even realize she's talking revenge. That same song has one of the only BigX verses that doesn't sound like it was workshopped to death, as he hits his ex with a bitter tirade that's a little funny and a little messed up: “I hope you, I hope you turn your heater on and it blow cold/I hope you leave your car runnin' at the store and it get stolen,” something he might actually say on one of his other tapes, which doesn't happen enough.

But, for the most part, it's pretty hard to tell what exactly interests BigX about country music other than that the scene fucks with him (“The best hip hop sound to come out of Texas in this century,” said Charley Crockett, a Texan and country traditionalist) and that he's about the bag. BigX doesn't try to sing even a little, too, so he's got nothing in common with the blues of NoCap's “Drown in My Styrofoam” or Rod Wave's Hank Williams Jr.–sampling “Cold December” and how the little vocal imperfections maintain the rawness of melodic Southern rap. Nor does he seem to have much of an opinion on what makes good country music, so all of the feature, production, and writing decisions feel like they were made by a spreadsheet. I Hope You're Happy is an album without any personal taste, and that's about the most boring thing you can do.

At least Post Malone, for all his faults, went into his country era looking to pull from outlaws Waylon Jennings and Sturgill Simpson, so that even if that has yet to turn into any music I'd ever want to listen to, I can understand what he's going for. Without that, it's hard not to think of the music as nothing else but a way to fill tour seats and maybe even capitalize on the general masses' fascination with the aesthetics, politics, and culture of middle America and the rural South. That goes for the rappers collaborating with any country singer with enough Instagram followers and any country singer looking to gain some street cred by collaborating with a rapper. (C'mon, no way Lil Durk ever cared that much about the girls bar-hopping on the Nashville strip.) And, anyway, there's still plenty of good rap out there that scratches the country itch without having to do too much cosplay. You have, the mumbled gloom of Rylo Rodriguez, MexikoDro's bible-thumping trap, Moskino's new-age Mystikal thing, Monaleo's stomp-stomp Houston rap-alongs, and so on. They may not come with a cowboy hat and a Morgan Wallen co-sign, but they're there.

The first teaser trailer for The Carpenter's Son—a biblical horror movie starring FKA twigs as Mary, mother of Jesus—is here. Nicolas Cage plays Joseph in the movie, and you can see them both in the clip below. Lofty Nathan wrote and directed the film, which stars Noah Jupe as Jesus. It is set for release this autumn, but no date has been set.

A movie synopsis shared upon the film's announcement last year said The Carpenter's Son “tells the dark story of a family hiding out in Roman Egypt. The son, known only as ‘the Boy,' is driven to doubt by another mysterious child and rebels against his guardian, the Carpenter, revealing inherent powers and a fate beyond his comprehension. As he exercises his own power, the Boy and his family become the target of horrors, natural and divine.”

FKA twigs recently starred opposite Bill Skarsgård in Rupert Sanders' remake of the 1994 cult classic The Crow. She also has a new album, Eusexua Afterglow, on the way—a standalone, full-length follow-up to Eusexua, according to her publicists.

							By 

	Alan Sepinwall



	In an episode of the new HBO miniseries Task, Pennsylvania garbageman Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) briefly takes hostage one of the members of the law-enforcement task force that's been chasing him for his side gig robbing drug stash houses. After getting to know his prisoner a bit, Robbie laments, “I've kidnapped the most depressing human.” 


	The thing is, there's no shortage of Task characters who could make a claim for that title. Created by Brad Ingelsby, who already gave us the incredibly grim — if often excellent — 2021 Emmy winner Mare of Easttown, it's another dark wallow full of sad characters with few prospects for emotional health, most of them assaulting the audience's eardrums with the long-O sounds of the Delco accent. Like Mare, there are things to admire here, including the performances of Pelphrey, Mark Ruffalo, Emilia Jones, and others, plus a plot that grows more propulsive as the seven episodes move along. But it's somehow even more dour than Mare, which at least offered occasional respites of lightness from some of its supporting characters (notably Jean Smart as Mare's mom), as well as highly memeable glimpses of Kate Winslet going to town on hoagies. It wouldn't be an Ingelsby show without at least one character enthusiastically devouring the local cuisine, but that job here falls to Martha Plimpton in a relatively small role as Kathleen, the FBI supervisor who sets up the task force that pursues Robbie and his partners. 

	











	Tom (Ruffalo), the leader of the task force and co-protagonist with Robbie, also downs a hoagie at one point. But it's in no way charming, because he's such a black hole of misery and grief that all light vanishes whenever it tries to get close to him. Like Mare, he has suffered a devastating family loss in the not-too-distant past, and like her has to wrestle with guilt over whether he failed to provide enough help to his emotionally troubled son. Once upon a time, he was a priest, who became an FBI agent almost by accident. But his recent Book of Job-like streak of bad luck has erased any belief he once had in God.

	Ruffalo is one of the greatest actors of his generation, and has several opportunities to demonstrate that in Task, particularly in the final episode. But he and Ingelsby are a dangerous combination. Ingelsby scripts like Mare or the Ben Affleck alcoholism film The Way Back are fundamentally solemn, even if they offer hope for their characters near the end. And while Ruffalo has solid comedy chops (demonstrated throughout much of his time playing Bruce Banner in the MCU), he has a weakness for bleak material, like his Emmy-winning turn in HBO's 2020 slog of a miniseries I Know This Much Is True. Put those two together, and it's a feedback loop of gloominess, that turns the process of watching early episodes feel like trying to walk up a muddy hill in the middle of a downpour.


	The setup for the story has an uncanny similarity with Apple's recent Dope Thief miniseries that starred Brian Tyree Henry(*): Two buddies (in this case, Robbie and Cliff, played by Raúl Castillo) have an inside source feeding them info on stash houses they can rob, and a caper where they bring in a third man leaves an unexpected body count, plus a much bigger and more dangerous score than either partner was expecting.  


(*) Dope Thief had its own issues, running out of narrative steam well before its finale. But at least it made room for weird humor and other surprises along the margins of its story.  


	But the focus here is split between what Robbie is doing — including asking his dead brother's daughter Maeve (Emilia Jones from CODA) to raise the kids he had with his ex — and Tom reluctantly taking the lead on a task force that seems unlikely to accomplish much, given its scope and lack of institutional support. Tom's three partners are Anthony (Fabien Frankel from House of the Dragon), Lizzie (Alison Oliver from Conversations with Friends), and Aleah (Thuso Mbedu from The Underground Railroad). All come with some baggage, though the only obvious problem at first is that Lizzie is wildly distracted while going through a divorce(*). Because Robbie's crew is targeting other criminals — all of them members of a biker gang led by Jayson (Sam Keeley) and Perry (Jamie McShane) — their work is a relatively low priority for law enforcement at first. But when innocents get dragged into the mess Robbie has created, the task force becomes more important than any of its members appear ready to handle.

(*) All are also played by international actors having varying degrees of success at the different regional dialects they're attempting. Even the great Winslet struggled to sound like she was from the area in Mare. Maybe Ingelsby can set his next crime story elsewhere, just to see if actors from Australia and Croatia can sound like they were born in Wisconsin?   












	The early episodes move very slowly. And because Tom is both reluctant to return to active duty and wrestling with family trauma, those chapters are carried largely by the charisma of Pelphrey, who's been doing scene-stealing supporting work for years in shows like Ozark and here proves more than capable of taking the lead. Robbie tries to act like an eternal optimist despite a long streak of tragedy, but it's clear that his rage is always lurking just below the surface, and lord help anyone near him whenever it gets out. Jones is terrific as a young woman forced to grow up much too soon, who is running out of patience having to constantly clean up her uncle's many messes, and McShane pops off the screen in a smaller role as a character whose anger is even less controlled than Robbie's. 


	Ingelsby takes his sweet time answering various questions introduced early on, like what exactly happened with Tom's family, and who is feeding Robbie and Cliff intel on the gang's drug trade. But the narrative isn't complex enough to sustain seven episodes, and it's not until all the storylines start to converge in the fifth hour that Task gains any real momentum. 


	That said, just as Mare came together satisfyingly in the end, the last three episodes of Task are very strong as both suspense and character studies. And in the finale, Mark Ruffalo has a scene in a courthouse that reminds you why he was compared to a young Brando in his breakout role in the 2000 gem You Can Count on Me, as one half of a pair of adult siblings who have never quite recovered from the childhood loss of both parents. When he's locked in and the material is right, nobody's better. 


	But You Can Count on Me, Zodiac, and many of the other projects Ruffalo has appeared in that feature sad backstories, or present-day darkness and violence, still come with at least a little tonal variation of the kind to which Ingelsby seems allergic. (Zodiac is among the most unnerving movies ever made, but it also has a running gag about Ruffalo's character loving to eat animal crackers.) It's possible to tell dark stories about people in terrible situations without making the audience feel like they're being punished for even thinking about queuing up the episode. In both these HBO projects, Ingelsby and his collaborators do so many things well, it's frustrating that they can't ease up just a little on both their characters and the audience watching them.

	Before an early heist, Robbie plays peaceful music in the car, explaining to one of his buddies that he finds it “transportative,” because it “takes you away from your reality, puts you in another.” Robbie dreams of living in places with white sand beaches, or perhaps a bucolic island in Canada, and the music takes him there. Task is transportative, too, but it will take many viewers to a less pleasant place than they may want to spend seven hours visiting.

							By 

	Andy Greene



Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts played Chicago's Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island on Wednesday evening, and near the end of the main set, they debuted a brand new song entitled “Big Crime” that absolutely scorches Donald Trump and his federal takeover of Washington, DC.


	“Don't need no fascist rules,” Young sings. “Don't want no fascist school/Don't want soldiers on our streets/There's big crime in DC at the White House…No more money to the fascists/the billionaire fascists/Time to blackout the system.”


	Complete video of the public performance has hit YouTube, and Young posted audio of the soundcheck rendition along with the lyrics on the Neil Young Archives. Head here to check it out in full on the NYA, and look above for the live performance.


	“Big Crime” is the only tune in the set that makes specific reference to Trump and his policies, but there are numerous protest songs – including “Be The Rain,” “Southern Man,” “Ohio,” and “Sun Green” – that show exactly where Young's head is at right now.

	











	Earlier this year, Young voiced concerns that he wouldn't be let back into America following a European tour because of his public opposition to Trump's immigration policies. “If I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” he wrote on the Neil Young Archives. “That is happening all the time now. Countries have new advice for those returning to America …If you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA if you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We'll all find that out together.”

	











	A few weeks later, he responded to Trump's public assaults on Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” Young wrote. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel.”

	Bizarrely, Trump is a big Neil Young fan who has seen him in concert on several occasions. “He's got something very special,” Trump told Rolling Stone in 2008. “I've listened to his music for years. His voice is perfect and haunting. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.”


	Young's tour continues Friday night at Milwaukee's BMO Pavilion, and wraps up September 20 at Farm Aid's 40th anniversary concert at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, where he'll share the bill with Kenny Chesney, Dave Matthews, Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, and Steve Earle.


	The complete “Big Crime” lyrics:


	No more great againNo – no more great againThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	Don't need no fascist rulesDon't want no fascist schoolsDon't want soldiers on our streetsThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	Got to get the fascists outgot to Clean the white house outDon't want soldiers on our streetsThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House

	An attempted ousting of the nation's head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A series of resignations amid escalating pressure from the Trump administration to change vaccine policy. As Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the agency and attempts to mold it in his vision of vaccine skepticism, the CDC has been plunged into bedlam as America's public health care hangs in the balance.


	On Wednesday, after the The Washington Post reported that Susan Monarez had been ousted from her role as director of the CDC, HHS appeared to confirmed the ousting in an X post. “Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people,” the agency wrote. “@SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.”


	Attorneys Mark S. Zaid and Abbe David Lowell, who are representing Monarez, confirmed to Rolling Stone that she was notified Wednesday night “by a White House staffer in the personnel office that she was fired.” However, they argue that as “a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her” and say “we reject the notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director.” Her legal team said that they had notified the White House Counsel of their position.

	In a previous statement to Rolling Stone, Monarez's lawyers accused Kennedy and HHS of having “set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.” The continued, “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.” At the time, they stated that Monarez, who has served across several federal health agencies for decades, “will not resign.”

	Amid the turmoil, a series of resignations have taken place.


	Four top CDC leaders said they were resigning on Wednesday, per Reuters and NBC News, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Debra Houry, CDC Chief Medical Officer; Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Director; and Jen Layden, Director of the CDC Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology.


	Multiple former and current CDC staffers confirmed the attempted ouster and series of resignations to Rolling Stone, adding that there was widespread fear among former and present personnel that the void will be filled by RFK Jr.-style diehards and zealots. Rolling Stone also reviewed copies of resignation letters.


	“MAHA craziness is gonna run the table,” one source warned. “It's really bad now but things can always get worse.” A former CDC staffer adds: “This is the work of a death cult.”


	In June, Kennedy fired a panel of 17 medical and public health experts that advised the CDC on vaccine policy, and is expected to restaff them with individuals aligned with his skepticism over vaccines. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated Covid vaccines for fall but limited who is eligible for the shots to adults 65 and older, and younger people who are at higher risk. The announcement arrived as Covid-19 levels in the U.S. have been on the rise for months.

	In their earlier statement, Monarez's lawyers said that this “is not about one official. It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science.” They added, “The attack on Dr. Monarez is a warning to every American: our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within. Science and integrity can never be compromised.”

T
he first ICE detention center inaugurated in the second Trump era is a squat, soot-colored building surrounded by parking lots, warehouses, and petrochemical holding tanks on a deserted stretch of industrial waterfront in Newark, New Jersey. 


	In May, this patch of asphalt and chainlink was the site of a dramatic showdown between nearly two dozen federal law enforcement officers and four Democratic officials. That encounter has culminated in one of the most shockingly brazen political prosecutions in recent history — a case that, depending on its outcome, could augur a new political reality for anyone willing to challenge the president's regime.


	Delaney Hall is operated by GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison contractor whose for-profit facilities have been dogged by allegations of wrongful death, sexual abuse, and exposing inmates to toxic chemicals. Its corporate PAC was also the first to max out donations to Donald Trump's 2024 reelection campaign. 

	











	Almost as soon as Trump re-took office, GEO Group inked a 15-year, $1 billion contract to warehouse immigrants at Delaney Hall. Before the mothballed facility reopened, inspectors flagged at least two dozen fire code, plumbing, and electricity issues, according to the city's lawyers, who sued in an unsuccessful effort to prevent GEO from resuming operations there.


	Today, Delaney Hall holds 548 individuals — 89 percent of whom have no criminal record — rounded up in the Trump administration's immigration dragnet. 

	











	On May 9, a few days after GEO Group began housing detainees at the Newark detention center, three members of Congress representing New Jersey — Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, in whose district the facility sits — arrived at Delaney Hall to perform an oversight visit. 


	Weeks earlier, the same delegation checked in on a similar facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. (Such inspections are a routine part of Congress' function.) But, this time, their tour was being slow-walked. The members of Congress had already been waiting for an hour and half when Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrived. Baraka was standing inside the fenced area — a guard let him in — when nearly two dozen officers arrived and confronted him. They told Baraka he was trespassing, and threatened to arrest him.

	Video of the incident shows 80-year-old Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman trying to reason with them. “You are here on private property— ” she is saying, as an officer interrupts her. “Ma'am, this is the last warning,” he tells her. 


	“It's ‘Congresswoman,'” McIver replies sharply. “Show some respect!”  


	Baraka agreed to leave, and he was outside the facility a few minutes later when an officer with the Department of Homeland Security announced he would be arresting the Newark mayor anyway, “per the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.” (This is according to body camera footage described in court documents filed as part of an ongoing criminal case over the incident.)


	The crowd of protesters already gathered outside the facility was outraged. “Circle the mayor!” one yelled, as officers — some in windbreakers, others in riot gear — fought their way toward Baraka. Later, as Baraka was violently forced into a pair of handcuffs, McIver could be seen pushing through the crowd after him. The entire scene looked more like a mosh pit than anything else, with everyone — demonstrators, journalists, elected officials and federal officers — shoving and struggling against each other.

	A judge would later excoriate the Justice Department for its “hasty” decision to arrest Baraka, “a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences” — and a choice that, the judge added, “suggests a worrying misstep by your office.” 


	The charges against the mayor were dropped a little more than a week later. But they were replaced by new ones: this time against McIver, who was indicted for  “assaulting, impeding, and interfering” with a federal officer — a trio of charges that, together, carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison.

	











	“The days of woke are over,” President Trump said, speaking about the charges against McIver. “That woman — I have no idea who she is — she was out of control. She was shoving federal agents… The days of that crap are over in this country.”


	Trump has been loudly declaring his desire and intention to “lock up” his political enemies since his first campaign for office, but that bluster has taken a more sinister turn since the president returned to office in January, emboldened and enabled by a stable of sycophantic appointees eager to do his bidding. In the last few weeks alone, the Justice Department has announced investigations of Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and New York Attorney General Letitia James, each of whom oversaw high-profile investigations of Trump after his first term. The FBI recently searched the home of former Trump adviser-turned-critic John Bolton. The DOJ has reportedly opened criminal investigations into John Brennan and James Comey, the CIA director and FBI director who both served in Trump's first administration, and, in what may be a prelude of things still to come, Trump's director of national intelligence has accused Barack Obama and his officials of a “years-long coup” against the current president. 


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said last month, referring to Obama and members of his administration. 


	Unlike with California Sen. Alex Padilla (handcuffed and escorted out of a press conference in Los Angeles), or New York City Comptroller Brad Lander (detained at immigration court, before the charges against him were dropped), or some of the other Democrats Trump has threatened or his administration is investigating, the Trump administration appears determined to prosecute McIver to the fullest extent of the law.


	Her case will be an important test of what, if any, guardrails remain to prevent the Trump administration from siccing a pack of Justice Department lawyers on anyone with the temerity to question his administration's authority.


	Sitting in her office in June, wearing a pair of fluffy pink slippers and snacking on a pack of peanut M&Ms after a long day on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, McIver doesn't much resemble the menace U.S. attorney Alina Habba — Trump's former personal lawyer, and the acting, but disputed, United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey — has portrayed in her indictment.

	











	McIver, who favors bright suits and colorful glasses, is gregarious and warm, fussing over anyone who enters her orbit — staffer, colleague, stranger — like they're her own child. The quality of her energy can make McIver seem older than she is. At 38, she is among the youngest sitting members of Congress, and, having arrived here in Washington, D.C., less than a year ago, she is also among its greenest. 


	And yet, with the full force of a weaponized Department of Justice bearing down on her, she  remains remarkably composed.


	“I really look forward to court,” she tells me with a shrug. “To lay out all of the facts, to go through everything that happened and to make sure that the truth is told.” 


	“We know why we were there,” she adds. “To do our jobs.”


	The first thing you need to know about LaMonica McIver is that, despite her disarming demeanor, she is not afraid of a fight. Growing up in the heart of Newark's Central Ward, she got into plenty of them. 


	“I was always getting suspended for fighting,” she says. “My mom, at some point, was like, ‘I'm gonna stop taking you back to school because all you gonna do is get suspended again. I don't need to keep running back here.'”


	It was her fifth grade teacher — future Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — who helped her find an outlet for her energy, inviting her down to his campaign headquarters to volunteer. Baraka was the cool teacher — the one who showed up in Timberland boots, whose voice you can hear on the interstitial tracks on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the one who challenged Newark's longtime mayor, Sharpe James, running on the slogan “Shorty for Mayor,” when he was just 24 years old.


	“She was always feisty, no nonsense,” Baraka says of his former student. “As we like to say: She didn't take no tea for the fever. But, at the end of the day, she grew up in a rough community, rough neighborhood, and always had to defend herself — or defend other people.”


	In those days, Baraka's campaign headquarters were in a repurposed strip mall doctor's office, flanked by a Chinese restaurant, a fish market, and a nail salon. “I'll never forget — the place was so raggedy that it still had the hospital bed in one of the rooms. I remember we used to go back there and take a nap,” McIver says, laughing. Her first day was volunteering at the African American Day parade, where Lauryn Hill was riding with the candidate on the truck, and all the kids from McIver's school were marching around it in T-shirts that said “Take It Personal” — the campaign slogan that year. McIver was hooked.

	











	She started canvassing the neighborhood for the campaign, handing out literature in her spare time. At first she says that she just liked telling people what to do — ”Go out and vote!” — but eventually she was possessed by a larger sense of civic purpose. “Learning your community, learning what it means to be ‘of service,' learning what it means to care about people — to learn that at 10? To have someone instill that in you? And it wasn't just Ras Baraka,” she says. “It was all the people around him, who were from the city, involved in public service.”


	Baraka ended up losing that race in 1998. But the loss didn't deter McIver — neither did the many, many losses that followed. Through middle school and high school, she returned every four years when he launched a new bid for office, and helped out with the clothing drives, food drives, voter registration drives they mounted in the political off-season. 


	By the time Baraka won a seat on the city council, in 2010, McIver was out of college. She had spent the last years of her college career raising her three younger siblings — her brother, in high school, and two sisters, both in elementary school — after her mother entered rehab for drug addiction. 


	During the 19 months her mom spent in treatment, McIver commuted between college and home, packing her siblings lunches and helping them with their homework between her own classes. “It wasn't as hard an adjustment as you might think,” McIver's sister, LaShay McIver, tells me. “She was playing a parent figure in our lives for a very long time — probably since her early teens… Making sure our grades are good, making sure we're behaving in school. When she would get her paycheck, she would buy me clothes.”


	After she graduated, McIver worked in school districts all around the state of New Jersey, before she felt the call to run for office herself in 2018. The Newark city council skewed older and male, and she decided there ought to be someone there advocating for the interests of young parents like herself — by this time, she had her own two-year-old daughter — so she decided to mount a campaign.


	She ran against nine men, and won, becoming the youngest woman in city history to sit on the council. Two years later, in 2020, she was elected council president — right as the pandemic was poised to bear down on Newark. “I'll never forget,” she says. “We were going inside our larger senior buildings, having to get assistance to pull dead bodies out, because the hospitals were taxed, the funeral homes couldn't take another person. We had to get our police department to rent ice trucks inside of our city parking lot, just to get bodies out of the buildings.” 

	











	Those horrific months were followed by protests ignited in the wake of George Floyd's murder, when, McIver says, “We had people showing up from all over the world trying to burn down downtown.”


	Things had barely returned to normal in Newark, when she set her sights on a higher office. It was 2024, and Congressman Donald Payne Jr. — who, with his father before him, had represented this district most of McIver's life —  suddenly died of a heart attack. 


	McIver made it through the special election gauntlet, arriving in Congress in September of 2024, to little fanfare and no orientation — just a massive backlog of constituent services cases to deal with. By then, her district had been without a congressional representative for five months. She was only in D.C. for a week before the session adjourned, and she had to head back to New Jersey to campaign in the general election — her fourth race in as many months.


	She won, but returned to Congress in November with a new reality waiting for her, as a soon-to-be member of the minority party, under a dangerously emboldened Trump administration. “It's been unreal,” she says, looking back. “I did not come here for this.”


	“All my life, I've been wanting to serve in public service, to work for people, to deliver,” McIver tells me over lunch at The Yard, a burger joint in downtown Newark's Military Park. Everyone seems to know her here. When we walked in, she was met with applause and pledges to support her legal fund. Her profile, already outsized after representing this area first in City Council and now in Congress, has only continued to grow since she became a target of the Trump administration. “I just feel like, in this moment, there is nothing to deliver. We have a party in control that is not interested in delivering help — at least not for people that I represent.”


	Roughly one-third of McIver's constituents are immigrants, and from the moment Trump took office, the community has been in the crosshairs of the federal government. Two days after Trump's inauguration, ICE raided The Net, a Portuguese neighborhood in downtown Newark. 


	“They were out on the street in this little quaint neighborhood with big guns, Army vests, everything — and they scared the crap out of these residents,” McIver says. “From that day on, it's been downhill, in most of my communities in the 10th [congressional district].”

	











	Weeks before she and her colleagues went to Delaney Hall to perform the infamous oversight visit, McIver and her colleague, Rep. Rob Menendez, met with ICE officials at their office in Newark to discuss the fallout from those raids and, at the very least, try to open a line of communication.


	“We were like, ‘Look, the people of the East [ward] are scared to death. Businesses are not booming. This is an area where there are usually droves of people walking, shopping, eating in restaurants. Since ICE came down, though, people are scared — not even because they are here undocumented, just because they're like I don't want to be approached,” she says. “We went to these folks' office to meet with them, saying, ‘Hey, can we try to establish a better relationship? …Let's just work together. We want a safe border too — a protected one. We just don't want you harassing communities. So, what can we do?'”


	The meeting went smoothly, which is why she was caught so off guard by the disturbingly disproportionate response she and her colleagues were met with a few weeks later at Delaney Hall. 


	“They say this whole thing is about ‘criminals,' but it's not about criminals — it's about being cruel and attacking anybody who is here that is, basically, not white, to be honest with you,” McIver says. “I just think people didn't sign up for this, they're like, ‘Hey, when you get criminals, get the criminals. But not my neighbor. Not the people that cook our food, not the person trying to get their green card or going through citizenship, who is 60 years old, or people who were given protections to be here and now you tell them, Screw you, you're gone.'… It's just heartbreaking. To see families being ripped apart, to see kids with cancer being deported, to see people in college who are here — being innovators, engineers and teachers — to see [people say to] them, ‘Oh, your student visa is gone.' No explanation, no due process.”


	It's just all so senselessly punitive, McIver tells me. And a similar sentiment might be expressed about her own legal predicament — the breathtakingly political prosecution of a sitting member of Congress, one with virtually no precedent in recent history. How that case will ultimately resolve remains an open question.


	In June, McIver pleaded not guilty to all three charges against her, and, just last week, her lawyers submitted a new motion to dismiss the charges, drawing comparisons between the conduct she is alleged to have committed against federal officers while exercising her statutory and constitutional oversight responsibilities, and the conduct demonstrated by some 160 rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 — “throwing explosives, beating federal officers with baseball bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray” — all of whom recently had their charges under the same statute dismissed by the Justice Department.

	McIver, for her part, is spending as little time as possible thinking about the case. She's too busy with work. “I'm angry that the administration is choosing to waste taxpayers dollars and energy, to charge me for going there — for doing my job,” she says. “But at the same time, I'm not mad about representing the people that I represent here in New Jersey, or for going to check on their family members at Delaney Hall because that's what they sent me to Congress to do.


	“I can't be scared about doing that.”

Halsey will celebrate the 10th anniversary of her debut album on the road this fall on her just-announced Back to Badlands Tour.


	Less than a week after the singer concluded the For My Last Trick tour, Halsey announced Thursday she will return to the stage in October; however, instead of playing arenas this time around, Halsey will instead play theaters, ballrooms, and Fillmores across North America.


	“A Badlands club tour. Tiny venues. GA floors. 10 years later. I've been waiting a decade to re-live it all over again with you,” the singer wrote on social media Thursday.

A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey)


	The Back to Badlands tour kicks off October 14 with “a very special show” at Los Angeles' Hollywood Forever before the trek moves eastward. Stops include Atlanta's Roxy, Washington DC's the Anthem and New York City's Hammerstein Ballroom before the North American leg concludes January 17 at Detroit's Fillmore. After that, the Badlands 10th anniversary tour moves to Europe and Australia.

	The tour announcement comes one day before Halsey drops her Badlands: Anthology reissue of her 2015 debut LP, featuring previously unreleased demos, a 2015 concert recording and other rarities. Halsey has also planned a “double feature” for the album tracks “Drive” and “Gasoline.”


	“I can't believe it's been 10 years,” Halsey previously said in a statement. “So much has happened in the last decade, but Badlands remains the most exciting musical journey of my life. I have so many unbelievable things planned for this month to celebrate the album that changed my life and introduced me to the fans I'll love forever. This is just the beginning.”

	Last year, during the promotional cycle for her latest album, Eternal Sunshine, Ariana Grande responded to inquiries about a potential tour with uncertainty. Her last run of shows, in support of both Sweetener and Thank U Next, was nearly six years ago — and they were emotionally draining for the singer. Grande expressed a need to define her relationship with her own concerts before she could return to the road. And now she's ready to do so on her own terms with the Eternal Sunshine tour.

A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)


	The tour kicks off next June with two dates in Oakland, California, before moving to Los Angeles (both Crypto.com Arena and Kia Forum), Austin, Texas, Grande's native Sunrise, Florida, Atlanta, four nights at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, Boston, Montreal, and finally two nights at Chicago's United Center on August 3 and 5. The trek will then jump the Atlantic for five nights at London's O2 Arena.


Similar to 2019's Sweetener world tour, the newly announced slate of performances will span two albums: Eternal Sunshine and Positions, the R&B opus Grande released in late 2020. “I think that I was buying myself time — I didn't want to do that,” she told the Zach Sang Show earlier this year, referring to the idea of taking two albums on the road again. “I was like, yeah, and then the album will never happen, and then the tour will never — no, no, no. I'm kidding.”

	











	At the time, Grande shared that she was “not ready to announce any sort of thing or get people too excited because I don't want to disappoint.” She added: “I had a really hard time emotionally on my last tour, but I think that's because of where I was at … So just like with music, I think I'm really excited to redefine my relationship to shows when I'm ready and to see what that looks like.”

	











	In between the two albums, Grande was relatively busy — mostly with living in the World of Oz as Glinda in the big-screen film adaptation of Wicked. The movie was split into two parts, with the first premiering last Thanksgiving. It will resume with Act II on Nov. 26, 2025.

A new report from a crowdsourced UFO-sighting app found that among the hundreds of reports of unidentified metallic orbs between 2022 and 2025, the majority were spotted in the dead of night near military installations in California, New York and Arizona.

Enigma, which allows users to report their own UFO sightings, logged more than 8,000 reports in the U.S. between Dec. 2022 and June 2025, according to the report. Of these, 422 described the presence of a metallic orb, the majority of which were observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military bases.

Investigating such mysterious flying objects is the work of the Pentagon's All-doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which logged 757 cases between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the office's annual report. Twenty-one of these cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Of the 422 metallic orbs reportedly spotted by Enigma users, 360 of them were seen near military bases such as Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base in California.

""While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma,"" the report said. ""Often spotted at high altitudes near sensitive infrastructure, these orbs are described as hovering silently or darting across the sky at seemingly impossible speeds.""



""Consistently seen across the globe, the orbs typically lack visible propulsion systems or control surfaces.""

""What makes these orbs especially compelling isn't just how often they appear, but where and how they operate. They are frequently observed in restricted airspace, near nuclear facilities, and have even been tracked on radar or captured by high-resolution infrared systems,"" the report added.

According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. The 24-second video was taken by an MQ-9, an unmanned aerial vehicle, though it was determined to be a ""typical"" unresolved UAP.

""While AARO assesses the object in the clip is not exhibiting anomalous behavior, the object remains unidentified,"" the AARO report said.

Of the hundreds of reports of metallic orbs, 43% mentioned the appearance of light and 40% said the object flew very low, according to Enigma. Another 35% said the object flew rapidly, fast or quick, and 38% reported the object was hovering.

A common theory about the metallic orbs paints them as surveillance devices, whether deployed by terrestrial governments or by ""non-human intelligences,"" the Enigma report said.

""Some skeptics argue metallic orbs may be misunderstood weather balloons, optical illusions, or rare atmospheric conditions (like ball lightning),"" the report admits. ""And others maintain that they are a psychological manifestation, projected by the human mind during altered states or high-stress moments.""

""Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown.""

People have seen the largest number of metallic orbs over military installations in the US. Even military personnel have reported seeing them. Most of them appeared between 1 and 4 am. They hover for some time and then dash away within seconds. Pentagon officials are scratching their heads.

Metallic orb-like unidentified flying objects have swarmed the skies over military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. People have reported seeing thousands of mysterious things that can't be explained in the past two and a half years. Of the 8,000 sightings, 422 of them were metallic orbs, according to the crowdsourced platform Enigma. The majority of them were seen between 1 and 4 am, and almost all of them were hovering over a site linked to the US military. This has once again ignited rumours about these places hiding something, a secret being kept from not just Americans, but the entire world. What strengthens the argument that these objects could have been from another world is that even military personnel said they saw them. Civilians and pilots also said they saw UFOs. Enigma data shows that 360 metallic orbs were seen within a few miles of military bases in the US. In three of these cases, the orbs were seen multiple times within a distance of five miles from Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base.

The description of what these orbs do is also almost similar - they hover silently over an area, and then bolt at extreme speeds without leaving any smoke or ice trail. A lot of these sightings are accompanied by videos. One person saw two liquid metallic orbs in Brooklyn's Fort Hamilton in June 2024 for a full two minutes. In Los Angeles, a metallic orb appeared after several planes flying in a formation flew by. This has piled up a lot of work for the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which was made to find explanations for these sightings. While it dismissed most of them as either birds or planes, several of them still remain unresolved. AARO's annual report mentions that 757 UFOs were seen between May 2023 and June 2024, and 21 cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Eyewitnesses reported the maximum number of orbs in Texas and Florida. Government officials believe that they could be advanced drones that can dash from a place within seconds, an NYT report stated. Meanwhile, some even think that they could be surveillance devices sent by Russia and China. UFO sightings have been reported not only in the US but also in many other parts of the world. The Buga Sphere, which was captured from Colombia, has been generating a lot of buzz. Researchers say that it has wires inside it and has even grown in weight since being caught. It is even said that it dried up all the grass in the place it fell. A video clip on X even suggests that it is responding to Sanskrit shlokas and chants.

MACON, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) – Visit Macon and the Macon Beyond team are hosting an overnight ghost hunt at one of the city's most historic landmarks, the Burke Mansion, according to Visit Macon.

The exclusive event will be held October 3, and will allow guests to spend the night in the 1887-built mansion while participating in an immersive paranormal investigation.

The ghost hunt will be hosted by actress and producer Carrie Genzel, known for her roles in “The Walking Dead,” “Supernatural,” “Jennifer's Body” and other horror films and series. She will be joined by spiritual medium Morrighan Lynne and paranormal investigator Jonathan Morgan.

The evening begins with a reception featuring wine, signature cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a guided paranormal investigation through the mansion's most storied spaces. Guests will also receive tickets to Rock Candy Tours' Macon Macabre Walking Tour.

“This team has had so much fun exploring the most requested sites in Macon for legends and lore in our video series,” Genzel said. “I have been fascinated with the unexplained, and have had numerous encounters. Moving to Macon sparked my passion for exploring the city's haunted sites and interacting with its supernatural inhabitants.”

Two ticket options are available:

Ghost Hunt Event Only — Friday, October 3, beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $45 and include the cocktail reception, guided paranormal investigation, an event T-shirt and the walking tour.

Luxury Stay + Ghost Hunt Experience — October 3-5. Packages include a two-night stay at Burke Mansion with breakfast, parking, a themed gift basket, a VIP meet-and-greet, the walking tour and access to the ghost hunt. Suites for one to two guests are $500, while the carriage house for two to four guests is $1,000.

“This is all in good fun,” said Gary Wheat, president and CEO of Visit Macon. “We saw the attention and sincere appeal for Macon's October events last year, so we have to keep building on that by creating a calendar full of activities and a place where guests will want to stay with us this season.”

Macon has been named by HGTV as one of the best small towns to celebrate Halloween and highlighted by Travel + Leisure as one of the nation's top destinations for haunted mansions and ghost tours.

More information and tickets are available at maconbeyond.com.

  The entire first season of Charmed existed before I was even born, and it finished airing as I was learning how to add and subtract. Yet, I've still been infatuated with the witchy TV series for as long as I can remember.



  For those out of the loop, Charmed is an eight-season supernatural drama that ran from 1998 to 2006, following the lives of the Halliwell sisters, a trio of witches known as the Charmed Ones who are prophesied to be the greatest force of good to ever live. Like similar paranormal shows — Supernatural, Lost Girl, Grimm — the sisters fight a new baddie in each episode, which generally leads to season finale clashes with increasingly powerful forces of evil. Unlike those shows though, Charmed at its core isn't about fighting the forces of evil, but championing the goodness of love in all of its mundane and magical forms.



  As I come off my sixth re-watch of the series, (that's more than 800 hours), I've realized that it's become a comfort in some of my hardest times. Between its fully fleshed-out characters and interesting villains, seasons consisting of 20 or more hourlong episodes, and behind-the-scenes drama that encapsulates early 2000s pop culture, Charmed is like a long, warm hug to me.



  Honestly, I think it's the best TV show ever made. (The 2018 reboot, with all of its innovative and unique additions, doesn't hold a candle to the original.)



Charmed finds strength as a series in its characters. Rather than a group of one-dimensional witches focused solely on the craft, creator Constance M. Burge gives each of the sisters their own hopes and dreams beyond their duties as the Charmed Ones.



  The oldest sister is Prue (Shannen Doherty), who has the power of telekinesis. She's regarded as the strongest and is rigid in that eldest sibling kind of way (there's an entire episode where her sisters try to get Prue to say ""I love you"" to them). When we meet her she's an arts appraiser at the Buckland Auction House, but as she realizes she wants to create art herself, she takes a job as a photographer at a magazine.



  Then there's Piper (Holly Marie Combs), the middle sister with the power to freeze time. In the beginning she's working as a restaurant manager, but right when Season 2 starts, she opens her own nightclub, P3. Though it's an indication of Piper's character growth, it's also a clever way to add killer musical acts such as The Cranberries, Dishwalla, Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Navarro, to name a few, to the show.



  Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) is the youngest sister and the most rebellious. She's often fighting with Prue over the past. However, Phoebe's power of premonition and later, her skills as an empath, quickly adds a level of maturity to her character. By the final few seasons, Phoebe is the premiere advice columnist in all of San Francisco.



  After Prue abruptly and unceremoniously dies in the Season 3 finale — in 2023, Doherty finally confirmed that she left the show due to drama between her and Milano on set — we meet the fourth Halliwell sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Paige is their half-sister on their mom's side, and she inherits Prue's power of telekinesis. Her addition effectively changes the sisters' dynamic, which makes the show feel refreshed as it enters its fourth season.



  Beyond the main characters, their love interests are often compelling additions to the story. We meet Leo (Brian Krause), the Charmed Ones' whitelighter, or guardian angel, early on in the series. While posing as the sisters' handyman, he and Piper begin to fall for each other. Phoebe's first love interest, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), turns out to be a half-demon who wants to turn her evil. He sticks around far longer than he should, but he's just a joy to hate.



  And unlike some shows that absolutely fumble at the end (looking at you, Game of Thrones), the show's final season wraps everything up in this perfect little bow. Piper and Leo grow old together, Phoebe literally falls in love with love (his name is Coop and he's a cupid), and Paige finds her own destiny somewhere between her calling as a witch and a whitelighter. ♦

Home - News - Supernatural creator reveals canceled Sam and Dean plot that ""could have changed everything""

Kateryna Danshyna

News editor

Exactly 20 years have passed since Supernatural debuted on the air, and fans have seen 15 (!) exciting seasons and a generally satisfying finale. However, few people know that showrunner Andrew Dabba planned a completely different story for the last episodes.

One of the ideas was that the Winchester brothers would make their knowledge of the supernatural universe public.

“One storyline we talked about for a long time was that Sam and Dean would go public. They said: “We're making a public service announcement that monsters are real. If you see something strange in your city, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We are just going to spread the word.”

In the end, this plan was abandoned because it would have forced Supernatural to go in a completely different and “weird” direction. Dubb clarifies that the brothers' publicity would have been “logistically challenging for the show.”

“All of a sudden Sam and Dean became world famous, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but in reality, I think it would have ruined the show. It wouldn't have been a good thing, and that's one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

Among other canceled ideas for the show: the return of the Antichrist, played by Gattlin Griffith, in a “different form.” The character, also called Jesse Turner, was introduced in season 5, where Castiel (Misha Collins) predicted that he was destined to help Lucifer in the war against Heaven. Initially, Jesse had no idea who he was until Sam and Dean revealed the truth to him, prompting the character to go into hiding, and his whereabouts remained unknown even after the series ended.

The last episode of Supernatural aired on November 19, 2020. Now, 5 years after the show's end, the trio of main actors has a chance to reunite in another project. In February, the official page of the show published a video with Jensen Ackles gathering his colleagues Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins to appear in the fifth season of the Amazon series — all of them are rumored to appear in the same scene.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ""Independent Media"".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ""Beyond the Light Barrier"", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the ""Sunday Tribune"" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the ""lightning bird"" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

In an exclusive excerpt from a new book about their 25 years working together, see how the lawman and medium found trust in each other

St. Martin's Publishing Group

 Before we left the office, I quickly grabbed a few extras from female colleagues: a bracelet, a compact mirror, a woman's watch, and a necklace. Control items, I thought. If this guy was legit, he should be able to tell the difference between what belonged to Fran and what didn't, right?


 I was still sitting on a fence of extremes when it came to this psychic.


 Part of me still thought he was a fraud, and the lawman in me wanted to take him down. I even researched reasons to arrest him. Wire fraud? Mail fraud? And yet, my stubborn heart wanted to believe he was the real deal.


 We arrived at his office in Long Island as a family was leaving. They were crying and thanking the young man, whom I took to be John, in the center of the room. The mother threw her arms around him and hugged tight.


 “You have no idea what you have done for us today.”


 I could feel my anger rising. This guy was taking advantage of a grieving family. The young man — he had a boyish face, brown hair, and glasses — approached me.


 “Hi, I'm John. Are you Agent Hilland?”


 He was not what I expected. From the voice on the radio, I imagined an older man with a grand, theatrical, presence. This guy was younger than me, humble and unassuming. He looked like someone's kid brother. He looked like goddamn Harry Potter.


 “Yes. Thanks for seeing us,” I said, introducing Dansman.


 “Glad to help. Oh. You're not FBI,” John said to Dansman.


 “You're right, I'm not,” said Dansman. He shot me an I-told-you-so look. See?


 Okay, one point for the psychic. But what else will he know? I was prepared for this to be a bust. We sat at a large, wooden desk in a plain, unadorned room. No candles, no incense, no crystal balls.


St. Martin's Publishing Group

 “My assistant tells me you need help with a case,” John began. “The first thing I need to say is that if I end up helping you, it must stay private between us. I don't want you to mention it to the press, I don't want to be in any paperwork.”


 “That's not a problem,” I told him.


 “Good. Have either of you worked with a psychic before?”


 “I have,” said Dansman. “A few times, in other cases.”


 “Never,” I said.


 “Let me explain how I work. The information comes to me from my spirit guides in three different ways: clairvoyance, clairaudience and clairsentience. That means I see pictures, I hear thoughts and I get feelings or sensations. I will interpret what I'm seeing, hearing and feeling using my own frame of reference, and hopefully you'll understand it.


 “Some of the information you might understand right away. Some you might not. It's important that you write everything down, even if you don't understand. It could make sense to you later.”


 We took out our notebooks and pens, ready to go.


 “I'll get people above you, to your side, and below you,” John continued, “meaning older, the same age, and younger. I might be off by a name, but not by an initial.”


 And one more thing, he emphasized.


 “Do not give me any information or try to steer me in any direction. I want to describe to you exactly what I'm getting without interference.”


Erica Schultz

 We nodded.


 “Before we begin, do you have any questions?”


 “Yes,” I said. “I want to confirm. This is an active case. It's not our practice to discuss our investigations with the public, so ...”


 “As far as I'm concerned, you were never here.” John said, cutting me off. “I prefer it that way. Nothing personal, but I don't like to get involved with law enforcement. My only condition in helping you guys is that you don't mention to anyone that you met with me.”


 Good. We were on the same page. Though I could see slight disappointment on Dansman's face.


 “Let's get started,” said John. “Did you bring any belongings of the person you are looking for?” John asked.


 Dansman pulled the items from a bag and placed them on John's desk. John closed his eyes, took a deep breath, cupped his palms together and focused on them. After a minute, he reached over and moved the “control” items — bracelet, mirror, watch, necklace — from the group and put them in a pile to the side.


 I was stunned. He figured it out right away.

 “I don't know what these things are,” said John, “but they have nothing to do with the reason you're here,” he said.


 Dansman and I glanced at each other. Point two for the psychic. John returned his focus to Fran's items and picked up her eyeglasses. He looked up, almost past us, as if he was staring at someone behind us.


 “I'm seeing a woman. She looks older than her actual age. She's crossed over. She has two names like Mary Anne, Barbara Anne ... but people called her by her second name ... ​there's an F sound like Fern or Fran ... wait. It's Fran.”


 My heart raced. Dansman's eyes were locked on Edward. The next chunk of information came in a rush of words.


Paul Arasim

 “She was vain about her appearance. She had breast implants — they're showing me serial numbers on them — and dyed blond hair. Blue eyes. She wore a lot of makeup. Fran was a smoker. I smell cigarette smoke and strong perfume, like when a person tries to cover up the smoke scent with a lot of perfume. She's also showing me that she couldn't walk, like she broke her leg? She's showing me crutches. I feel a strong pain in the back of my head. Was she struck in the head? Yes ... ​she was hit in the back of the head with something. She didn't see it coming. Weird,” John said, still looking beyond us.


 “I feel like she was tricked into going somewhere by someone she trusted. A boyfriend or husband. He is still here, he hasn't crossed. He has a simple J name, like John or Jim or Joe. And a second S name, very common, like ... ​Smith.”


 I shivered. This was unreal.


 John put down the glasses and picked up the hairbrush.


 “After she was hit in the head, the J-S name — let's call him ‘Smith' — strangled her to make sure she was dead. Not like a bloodbath or anything. It was like he knocked her out with one blow, then strangled her.”


 I sat back in my chair, stunned. What the actual hell? Was he was seeing all this play out in front of him? I looked over at Dansman, who was equally shocked. I barely had time to register the horror he described when another rush of information came.


 “He was much younger than her,” John continued. “Maybe 10 years. She was angry. Was there another woman? She thought there was another woman. But not in the same state where they were living.""


 “She's showing me stairs. They were upstairs, on a third floor if not higher. There was an argument. She confronted him about a bunch of things, not just one issue. It feels like a whole bunch of different things. Smith was lying to her and she knew it. She called him out on it. He felt like his worlds were crashing together.”


 John shook his head.


 “Man, this guy has major control issues. Major. He needs to be in control. Whatever she did or said, she was taking that control away from him, and he didn't like it.”


 Dansman and I scribbled notes as fast as we could, trying to keep up.


 “The woman, F name — Fran — was fed up and demanded Smith take her somewhere. He was lying to her about so many things. I don't understand this. She's showing me furniture. Did he steal her furniture? There's also a second home. Like I said, she was calling him out an all his lies.”


 Dansman and I kept nodding. John kept getting hit after hit, like a pinball whacking against the bells in a machine. Tilt, tilt, tilt. But not only was John confirming details we already knew, he was giving information we didn't know — details that made sense, information that rang true that we could follow up on.


 We kept scribbling. He kept talking.


 “So, Smith calms her down, he appeases her somehow. Like, ‘Don't worry, Honey, I'll show you everything is okay.' I see them walking out of an apartment building or condo. She's using crutches. It's in the daytime, not at night. Wait, other people saw them leaving — a couple who live in the same building. It feels like they were walking in as she and Smith were leaving ... Oh.”


 John looked at Dansman. “You interviewed these people?”


 Dansman nodded.


 “And they told you they saw them leaving together. But the timing doesn't line up. It's like he kills her on a Saturday but you guys don't know she's missing until a week later.”


 Again, Dansman nodded. He was speechless.


 “So, he, Smith, helps this woman, Fran, to the car. He drives. She thinks she is going somewhere to see something she believes he is lying about. He's taking her to this place ... ​it feels right off a major highway. It's ironic. She was nervous and pissed off, because she knew she was about to expose his lie. And he was nervous and pissed off, because he knew she was about to expose his lie. They both knew.""


 “So, whatever this place is, it has an industrial feel to it, like metal and steel, blacktop, concrete ... ​I hear the highway. It's near a major highway with lots of traffic. There are many doors ... ​metal garage doors ...”


 I was so charged up I couldn't stay quiet any longer.


 “Like a public storage unit?” I asked.


 John's eyes lit up.


 “Yes. It absolutely feels like that. Definitely New Jersey, not far from where they lived and where he worked.”


 Again, Dansman and I exchanged a glance. Smith had that public storage facility in New Brunswick, N.J., where Fran's furniture was supposed to be.


 John continued.


 “It was still daylight. I see him pointing to a door and drawing her attention away from what he was about to do. Then he just did it.”


Hartford Courant/MCT/ABACAPRESS.COM; New Haven Police via Getty

 John's eyes darted around, as if he was watching it happen.


 “For her it was in an instant,” he said. “She didn't even know what happened, she was unconscious before she hit the ground. Then, instantaneously, he pulls her inside whatever this thing is, this garage unit, and closes the door so nobody can see what's happening.”


 John paused, as if trying to process the deluge of images.


 I had to ask. He said not to steer him in a direction, but he didn't say not to ask questions.


 “What did he do with her body?”


 John glanced at me, then gazed again beyond me. He squinted, like he was trying to see or understand something.


 “She's not in one piece,” he said. “He dismembered her and put the pieces in something. She's encapsulated.”


 “What do you mean?” I asked.


 John's brow furrowed.


 “She's encapsulated in something. I keep seeing cylinders ... ​I'm not sure what this is. He's very smart. Whatever he put her in, it's got no smell and it's somewhere no one would suspect there was a body ... ​or pieces of a body.”


 “Like what?”


 “I don't know. I keep seeing cylinders. Her body is in these cylinders but also in something to keep her preserved, like fluid ... ​or concrete.”


 I'm sure Dansman was thinking what I was thinking. Smith worked at an industrial company called Carborundum, which produced refractory, heat-resistant concrete blocks.


 “You know when you see a new development being built, and they have these huge concrete ... ​I don't know what you call them ... storm drains?” John asked.


 “Sewer drains?” I asked.


 “Yeah. Like that. When you find her, her body parts will be remarkably intact. Well preserved.”


 My heart was racing now. I was hanging on his every word.


 “So, we will find her?”


 John paused. He looked thoughtfully at whatever invisible presence was behind us.


 “I think so. But it's not going to be easy,” he said. “And it won't be anytime soon.”

Porepunkah, Australia — Australian police said Thursday they will not rest until they catch a 56-year-old gunman who fled into the bush two days earlier after allegedly killing two officers. Detectives said they were speaking to the man's partner and searching rugged, forested terrain near the small town of Porepunkah, in the northeast of Victoria state.   The suspect, identified by police as Dezi Freeman, escaped on foot after opening fire when a team of 10 police arrived at his property on Tuesday, allegedly killing two policemen and wounding a third.

 Police say the man — described by local media as a radicalized conspiracy theorist — is heavily armed, has bush survival skills and knows the area well.

 ""We will not rest until we apprehend the offender,"" said Russell Barrett, Victoria police deputy commissioner for regional operations.

Police were in contact with the man's partner, had searched a number of properties, and believed he was still in the area, Barrett said.

 But ""we've had no confirmed sightings,"" he told a news conference.

 Anyone harboring the man would be prosecuted for committing a criminal offense, Barrett warned.

 Police said they were moving carefully through the bush, and warned people not to travel into the surrounding alpine area to go skiing.

 ""It is really difficult terrain. It is complex terrain,"" Victoria police superintendent Brett Kahan said.

 Police say the shooting happened in a matter of minutes when they descended on the man's property on Tuesday morning to execute a search warrant. 

Police fired at the suspect but apparently did not wound him, they said.

 The shootout resulted in the deaths of 59-year-old detective Neal Thompson and 35-year-old senior constable Vadim De Waart.

 Police say the wounded officer has undergone surgery and is expected to recover.

 Australia's The Age newspaper said Freeman was a self-professed ""sovereign citizen,"" referring to a movement whose adherents falsely believe they are not subject to laws passed by the government.

 Police have not commented on those reports.

 While fighting a speeding penalty in a Melbourne court last year, Freeman referred to police as ""frigging Nazis,"" ""Gestapo,"" and ""terrorist thugs,"" according to a copy of the judge's ruling.  Freeman told the court that ""even the sight of a cop or a cop car… it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier,"" according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Deadly shootings are relatively rare in Australia, and police fatalities even rarer. The latest deaths listed in a national memorial to fallen police showed three officers were killed on duty in separate incidents in 2023, including one by gunshot.

 In December 2022, four police arrived at a tree-lined property near small Queensland town of Wieambilla and came under fire from the family living there.

 Six people were killed in that incident, including two police officers. Police later blamed the family's fundamentalist Christian beliefs for what was termed a terrorist attack.

 A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place in Australia since a 1996 mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people. 

Then-newly-elected Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative and close friend of George W. Bush, pushed through the sweeping gun control legislation just 12 days after the shooting.

""The hardest things to do in politics often involve taking away rights and privileges from your own supporters,"" Howard CBS News' Seth Doane in a 2022 interview, looking back at the landmark legislation.

The new laws banned the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forced people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy a firearm; and — perhaps most significantly — called for a massive, mandatory gun-buyback. Australia's government confiscated and destroyed close to 700,000 firearms, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.

""People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'"" Howard recalled. ""And I'd tell them: 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder?'""

ByAgustino Fontevecchia,

Contributor.

Every week that passes, a new scandal emerges. It must be the heat of the campaign. One of the latest ""victims"" is the controversial Justice Minister, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, who appeared on a hidden camera offering his influence to Tim Ballard, another contentious character. Ballard, a former Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security's Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce has led multiple anti-child trafficking NGOs over the years, some of which he's been expelled from accused of sexual misconduct and irregular donation procurement. He denies the accusations.

In the leaked video, Minister Cúneo Libarona tells Ballard that after watching the film ""Sound of Freedom,"" where Hollywood star Jim Caviezel plays Ballard embarking on a dangerous mission to the Colombian jungle to rescue captive children, he was inspired to write a legal project that he wishes to send to Congress. He invites Ballard to read it and then offers him access to media outlets, journalists, and even judges and ministers to ""tell your story and the issues."" He goes on to tell Ballard he will help him ""clear up that misunderstanding that occurred in our country.""

It wasn't immediately clear what misunderstanding Cúneo Libarona was speaking of, but Ballard's name became a feature in mainstream Argentine media earlier this year when television gossip star Viviana Canosa promised to come out with serious accusations of sexual abuse and even pedophilia against several colleagues including Florencia Peña and Lizy Tagliani. Canosa's accusations sparked a media scandal and multiple legal proceedings, many against Canosa herself. She indicated that Ballard had given her information about child-trafficking, forcing the former Special Agent to admit having meeting her, but denying they ever spoke about these issues.

The opposition has called for Minister Cúneo Libaron's head, indicating he is colluding with a foreigner who is also an interested party in passing purported legislation, adding that he is an interested party. Even within the ranks of the Javier Milei administration, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has called Ballard a fraudster with multiple accusations against him. Why would someone with the political backing of President Milei and the power of a Security Minister agree to a meeting with Ballard, and then go on to incriminate himself so directly? Who filmed him? And why was the video leaked?

One of the connective threads behind the multiple scandals faced by Milei and his top officials is CPAC, the conservative think tank that counts with the Argentine President and Donald Trump as some of its highest-profile members. According to Perfil's Giselle Leclerq, the former Special Agent was part of the CPAC summit held in February where both Milei and Trump were in attendance. National deputy Esteban Paulón says that Ballard was introduced to Milei by Laura Belén Arrieta, the infamous single passenger of the private jet owned by Leondro Scatturice who entered the country with ten pieces of undeclared luggage. Arrieta, one of the organizers of CPAC's Latin American chapter, is employed by Scatturice, who has close ties with Argentina's intelligence agencies and Santiago Caputo, the controversial political aide to President Milei who runs Cúneo Libarona's Ministry through his deputy, Sebastián Amerio. Everything is connected, it seems.

Back to Bullard, his anti-child trafficking work crossed paths with the wild conspiracy theories associated with QAnon, which has a solid belief base among the ranks of the right wing-conservative MAGA movement, as Leclerq noted. The belief that a cabal of sex-traffickers and pedophiles led by prominent Democrats and Hollywood stars has led the QAnon world to ""invade"" the digital campaigning of the traditional NGOs in the space, as the New York Times reported, which also interviewed Ballard who noted the increased awareness was an opportunity. The idea that the QAnon cult can stop human-trafficking has led to dangerous situations such as the hostage showdown at Comet Ping Pong, where a radicalized person walked into the restaurant armed with an AR-15 style assault rifle in order to investigate the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy.

In Argentina, there was the troubling disappearance of five-year-old Loan Peña in Corrientes province. As the investigation was underway a man who claimed to be a member of multiple US security agencies and who was known as ""the American"" was arrested after trying to get involved with the case. His real name is Nicolás Gabriel Soria and he said he had worked with Ballard, something the latter denied. As Leclerq reported, a lawyer for two of Bullard's sexual abuse accusers noted that Soria had been brainwashed to believe he was helping to battle in the front lines of the battle against child-trafficking by Aerial Recovery, one of the NGOs Ballard worked with. He was part of a program aimed at helping war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who received some basic training and then become ""loyal mercenaries sent to 'work' across the globe."" Soria ""got involved in the case thinking he was a child trafficking expert because he was given some sort of certification and he truly believes the whole [QAnon]



Rodrigo Tripolone, the attorney, suggests that Ballard has a fraudulent modus operandi: in order to feed his image as a ""pedophile hunter"" he presents himself as an expert, cozies up to local authorities, and then tags along in domestic police operations to gain credibility. Many of these types of images can be seen on his social media.

For whatever it's worth, Ballard's video with Minister Cúneo Libarona adds another spot to the tiger. The MAGA world appears to have easy access to Milei and his cabinet through CPAC, allowing Ballard to sit with the Justice Minister to attempt to clear his name, or 10 bags to get smuggled into the country without proper investigation on Scatturice's airplane, by his employee. A recent investigation showed that Scatturice's technology firm, OCP Tech, received a $78-million government contract for maintaining Wi-Fi connections in schools. Along the same lines, B class characters like Hayden Mark Davis, Julian Peh, along with local connections Mauricio Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy got President Milei to participate in a meme coin rugpull scam that is now under investigation by the US judiciary. Furthermore, Karina Milei's political task force, a company named Tech Security, owned by the family of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Martín Menem and advisor Eduardo ""Lule"" Menem, received a contract worth four billion pesos from government-owned Banco Nación. And now, the Spagnuolo scandal in the ANDIS agency for the handicapped.

The smear campaign is in full force. Several weeks ago there was a purge of the Buenos Aires Province police force accused of campaigning on behalf of Maximiliano Bondarenko, libertarian candidate in the third electoral section that is a historical bastion of Peronism. Together, all of these and other ""operations"" or coordinated information leaks destined to harm political opponents indicate that the traditional method of doing politics in Argentina is alive and well, and it includes illegal espionage. This doesn't mean those on the receiving-end are innocent, quite the contrary in many cases. Expect the freakshow to continue.

A 19-year-old Chinese man barely survived the worst four months of his life after being seduced and then sold into slavery by his 17-year-old girlfriend.

Chinese media recently reported the shocking case of a young man from Zhanjiang, in China's Guangdong province, who endured four months of captivity and torture at the hands of a scam ring in Myanmar, after being lured into a trap by his teenage girlfriend. The victim's sister claims the two met at a local pool hall where the 17-year-old girl hung out in revealing outfits and wore counterfeit designer handbags to project an aura of wealth. Her brother was instantly drawn to her and hung on her every word when she bragged about her family's operations in Southern Asia, even though she never offered any proof. She repeatedly tried to convince the 19-year-old to travel with her to the neighboring country for lucrative work opportunities, and eventually, he accepted, despite his family's opposition.

 In February of this year, the pair secretly traveled to Thailand, with his family learning about his whereabouts from his friends. On their way back, while approaching the Thailand-Myanmar border, the 17-year-old girl made up a story about having to pick someone up close by and simply abandoned her boyfriend in the middle of nowhere. Shortly after, a group of armed men approched him, took all his documents and his mobile phone before taking him to a secret compund.

“My brother told me people with guns had taken him away,” the teen's sister recalled, adding that this was all he was able to text her before his phone was taken away.

The 19-year-old Chinese man was taken to a secluded camp, his head was shaved, and he was forced to sit in front of a computer for 16 – 20 hours a day, carrying out scams against his fellow countrymen. If he failed to reach his daily quotas or if his efforts didn't bear fruit, the young man faced severe physical punishment, including being hit with metal rods over his back and head.

During his captivity, the 19-year-old victim lost over 10 kilograms due to food deprivation, and due to the repeated beatings, he suffered permanent hearing loss. However, because he turned out to be extremely bad at scamming people, his captors decided he wasn't going to make them any money that way, so they decided to contact his family and ask for a ransom.

In June of 2025, the teen's family managed to raise the 350,000 yuan ($49,000) ransom and secured his release. However, the rescued teenager lives in constant anxiety and fear of being abducted and tortured again. He has nightmares about his four months in captivity and has developed paranoia.

As for his treacherous girlfriend, she was arrested after returning to China following a ten-day vacation in Thailand and now faces charges for her involvement in the victim's abduction by the Myanmar scam ring.

“She's only 17 years old. Who would have thought she could do something so evil?” the victim's sister told reporters. “It's unbelievable that she's capable of such despicable acts at such a young age.”

Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T reported a higher third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates but also booked restructuring charges as the bank works to shore up deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls and adjust to a cap on U.S. retail assets imposed by regulators. 

TD earned profit of $3.34-billion, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31. That compared with a quarterly loss in the same quarter last year after U.S. regulators hit the bank with a US$3-billion fine over serious lapses in its programs to prevent money laundering. 

Adjusted to exclude that one-time charge, TD said it earned $2.20 per share, which was higher than the $2.05 consensus estimate among analysts. 

The quarterly earnings were affected by $262-million incurred from TD's moves to restructure its U.S. balance sheet, which has included selling loans to stay under the regulatory asset cap. 

TD now has US$386-billion of assets in its U.S. business, which is below the US$434-billion limit. TD also took a $333-million restructuring charge in the quarter as part of a previously announced plan to spend $600-million to $700-million over several quarters to reduce its overall staffing by 2 per cent and eventually save $550-million to $650-million annually, before tax. 

A bright spot in TD's third-quarter results was its Canadian retail banking division, which reported profit of $1.95-billion, up 4 per cent from last year. The division has lagged rival banks in recent quarters, but has emerged as a key point of emphasis as the bank's ambitions to grow in the U.S. have been curbed for the time being.

Profit from U.S. retail banking was $760-million, compared with a loss in the same quarter last year. Loans were down 7 per cent because of asset sales, and the division had higher governance and control costs.

Wealth management and insurance profit was $703-million, up 63 per cent from a year ago. And profit from wholesale banking was $398-million, up 26 per cent year over year. 

“We are well positioned to build on this momentum as we compete, grow and build our bank for the future,” chief executive officer Ray Chun said in a statement. 

TD set aside $971-million in provisions for credit losses, or money earmarked to cover loans that may default. That was lower than the second quarter and well below the $1.2-billion analysts anticipated, according to LSEG.

TD's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its resilience in times of stress, is 14.8 per cent. 

TD plans to hold an investor day presentation on September 29 to unveil its updated strategy under Mr. Chun to analysts and shareholders.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that TD earned profit of $3.37-billion in the third quarter. The bank earned profit of $3.34-billion. This version has been corrected.

Canada is not making it easy for asylum seekers from the US to find safe harbor.

For several hours, the woman and her children lay in the mud, hoping not to be found by Canadian authorities. She was in the middle of her 14 days — the amount of time that a person who entered via the United States has to be in Canada before making an asylum claim. During those 14 days, asylum seekers cannot be caught. They have to live underground. And even harder, they have to be able to prove that they were in Canada for 14 days when they go to make their asylum claims. If they're found or caught, or if they can't prove Day 1 or Day 14, their claim will be denied, and they will be deported.

On July 13, a U.S. citizen driving an SUV allegedly drunk in southern Quebec crashed into a van carrying 12 people who had entered Canada from the United States. Another van following behind, also carrying migrants, veered away to not be caught by authorities. The first van rolled over, and four people were injured and brought to a hospital. Frantz André, coordinator of the Comité d'Action des Personnes Sans Statut (a committee that supports people without legal status in Canada), is helping some people from both vans, and he says that the remaining eight fled into the woods, as did the passengers in the other van to avoid being caught. The mother who hid in the mud with her children was among this group. After the crash, they lay in the mud for four hours, until another van came to get them.

Experts insist that these kinds of events will continue to increase.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“It's inhumane” says Jean-Pierre, a Haitian refugee who crossed into Canada from the United States with his wife and child and made his request for refugee status in 2021. Sharing his story in an interview with Truthout, he asked to be identified by a pseudonym to avoid repercussions to his refugee claim. He and his family had been living in Indiana and are now in Western Canada. Jean-Pierre cannot work as he's been waiting for a work permit since April.

Haitians in the United States have had a Temporary Protected Status since 2010, and the status has been canceled, appealed, and renewed many times since then. After U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem declared that Haiti no longer meets the program requirements for Temporary Protected Status, the status was set to expire on September 2, 2025. A judge has temporarily blocked this order, extending the Temporary Protected Status designation again until February 3, 2026, but the Trump administration says it “vehemently disagrees” with the judge's ruling and “is working to determine next steps.”

All of this uncertainty has driven many Haitians, like Jean-Pierre, to cross into Canada, usually at Quebec. But now, people are even more afraid, and Canada has made it even harder than before for Haitians and anyone else fleeing the United States to be given asylum.

Already, the largest group of migrants ever tried to enter Canada in the back of an unventilated cube van, just a few weeks ago. The Canadian Press reports that 44 people, mostly Haitians, crossed into Canada on foot on August 3, and were picked up by the cube van. Once the van was intercepted, the migrants were sent to be processed. If they don't have a first-degree relative living in Canada, it is likely that they will be sent back to the United States.

That's because the primary way for someone who is Haitian to stay in Canada is to have a first-degree relative, rather than simply claiming asylum, and Canada has no plans to make it easier for anyone coming from the United States to claim asylum in Canada. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada spokesperson Matthew Krupovich told Truthout that the government of Canada has extended to November 19, 2025, a temporary measure in place to allow people who have a first-degree relative in Canada to enter through a special program. “These measures help keep families together and give Haitian nationals in Canada a safe place to work and study,” he said.

André is critical of the program, which he describes as being a family reunification program rather than a true asylum program. André argues that by allowing Haitians who have first-degree relatives to stay in Canada while not accepting people who are claiming asylum from the United States, Canada is not upholding its responsibilities under international law to accept refugees. Moreover, he says he has seen situations where families are broken up because one person has a direct relative in Canada but the other person in a couple does not.

There are 80,000 Haitians who live in Montreal, and 47,550 of them were born in Haiti, and 140,000 people of Haitian descent who live in Quebec. The vast majority chose Quebec because it is North America's only majority French-speaking jurisdiction.

But the passage into Canada has been made particularly perilous due to the “Safe Third Country Agreement” — a policy that says immigrants who are crossing into Canada from the U.S. cannot immediately seek refugee status in Canada because they are coming from a country deemed to be “safe”; once they have been in Canada for at least 14 days, however, they are then allowed to seek refugee status in Canada.

While the Supreme Court of Canada found parts of the Safe Third Country Agreement to be constitutional in 2023, it bounced the question of rights violations back to a lower court. In February, the Canadian Council of Refugees and Amnesty International renewed their call for the agreement to be scrapped. They wrote, “Canada's assertion that the United States remains a safe country for refugees under the Trump administration is a cruel irony to those fleeing persecution today. It must be urgently rescinded, and tariff threats must not blur the plight of those at immediate risk.”

“Canada's assertion that the United States remains a safe country for refugees under the Trump administration is a cruel irony to those fleeing persecution today.”

Canada has no plans to eliminate the agreement, though. In fact, rather than preparing for more people to come to Canada as a result of the end of the American Temporary Protected Status, Canada's new Liberal government's second bill would make it even more difficult for people to seek asylum from the United States. If passed, Bill C-2 will eliminate the 14-day period that people are currently waiting before they make a refugee claim and instead make it impossible for someone to make a claim at all if they cross into Canada from the United States, whether via an official port of entry or not. The bill was presented on June 3, 2025.

André says Canada's confusing asylum rules aren't enforced evenly and can change depending on which agent someone deals with, and the stakes are considerably higher now that Trump's administration has stepped up deportations. He tells the story of a man living in the United States who had both a Canadian and American visa, and who had applied for Temporary Protected Status. He planned to visit Canada for a few weeks. Upon trying to enter Canada, he was told that he couldn't bring a scooter he had with him to give to a family member, as it didn't meet certain standards. The man was given two choices: either leave the scooter at the border or go back. The man decided to go back into the United States with the scooter and within days, he was captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sent to an immigration jail where he currently awaits deportation.

What's worse is that while the Canadian government is squeezing migrants at the border, the government of Quebec has doubled down on ethnic nationalism as a political strategy, demonizing immigrants and refugees in general and Haitians in particular. While the federal government controls Canada's asylum system, Quebec is the only province that manages its own immigration levels. The province is currently in a process to determine its immigration levels for the next four years, though the governing Coalition Avenir Québec has made it clear that it does not support making it easier for people to claim asylum from the United States.

In a statement given to Truthout in French, Xavier Daffe-Bordeleau, a representative of Quebec's Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration, explained, “Quebec remains committed to offering a dignified and secure welcome to asylum seekers, with help from … community groups, who have already done a lot over the years to welcome asylum seekers. The cumulative effect over the past many years has placed pressure on the Quebec public and we have largely surpassed our capacity.”

Quebec's government has formally requested that the Canadian government reduce the number of work permits and refugee status granted from 416,000 in 2024 to 200,000 by 2029, especially in the greater Montreal region, even though cutting immigration levels has already placed Quebec into population decline.

Neither the Canadian nor the Quebec governments have demonstrated meaningful regard for the humanity of asylum seekers, and neither have any plans for the inevitable wave of people who will request asylum in Canada when the Temporary Protected Status ends. The situation in Haiti continues to deteriorate, with the UN-coordinated police force from Kenya having largely been a failure. And with Erik Prince's Vectus Global about to deploy mercenaries in Haiti, most Haitians in North America are left with only one option: asylum in either the U.S. or Canada.

Despite the crisis, Canada knowingly sends people back to the U.S. where they can face deportation, a kind of deportation by proxy, says André, when really, all they want is the safety and security that every person wants.

“What they need and are looking for is a safe place to rebuild, to build a life and to eventually have their family reunite with them,” André told Truthout. “That was the perception of Canada years ago, which is no longer what's happening.”

            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing to keep her job on the board, which helps set interest rates, after President Donald Trump said he was removing her from her role earlier this week.
    


            Cook's lawsuit, filed Thursday morning in federal court in Washington, DC, asks for a judge to rule that Trump's attempt to remove her is unlawful and that she remains an active member of the Federal Reserve.
    


            A hearing on her request for a temporary restraining order has been scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Friday in front of Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden.
    


            Cook's lawsuit sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes legal battle with major implications for the Fed and the power of the presidency, even as Trump moves to consolidate his hold over parts of the government once considered sacrosanct and free from political influence.
    


            “Without emergency relief, defendants are now likely to allow an unexpired vacancy to occur for which President Trump has indicated he is ready to fill,” Cook's lawyers wrote in their request.
    


            The White House, however, said that Trump's firing of cook was lawful.
    


            “The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Thursday. “The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.”
    


Trump's firing of Fed's Lisa Cook tests Supreme Court's limits on presidential power



            Cook is claiming in her lawsuit that Trump's abrupt firing of her violated her due process rights under both the Constitution and federal law, which she says include receiving proper notice of her alleged wrongdoing and a hearing through which she can respond to the allegations.
    


            “Governor Cook received neither notice nor a hearing before her purported firing,” her attorneys wrote in the suit. “This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook's Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven.”
    


            She also argues that Trump is attempting to redefine the meaning of “cause” in a way that would allow him to fire any board member “with whom he disagrees about policy based on chalked up allegations.”
    


            “President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally redefine ‘cause' – completely unmoored to caselaw, history, and tradition – and conclude, without evidence, that he has found it,” her attorneys wrote.
    


            On Monday, Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire the central bank official. The letter cited accusations of mortgage fraud first raised by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.
    


            Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence. The Trump administration has said it is investigating other perceived political opponents of the president for alleged mortgage fraud, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff of California.
    


            The Justice Department has said it plans to investigate Pulte's allegations. Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
    


            Cook is also asking the court to declare that “an unsubstantiated allegation of mortgage fraud prior to a Governor's confirmation is not cause for removal” under federal law.
    


            Cook's situation may be legally complicated around her dismissal, given Trump's belief he can fire her for cause even if allegations are unproven and an investigation isn't complete.
    


            The 24-page complaint, filed at a federal court in Washington, DC, accuses Trump of using fraud allegations in an attempt to end-run federal law intended to protect her from such interference by the president.
    


‘It's a genie you can't put back in the bottle': Economist on Trump targeting Federal Reserve's independence



            “It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,” Cook's attorneys wrote in the lawsuit.
    


            “This is a big case,” said Jane Manners, an associate professor at Fordham School of Law who researches presidential power. “If we're going to allow politics to determine the membership of the Fed, what does that mean for the future of our economy?”
    


            Several other quasi-independent federal government officials have been unsuccessful in holding on to their positions, despite their emergency lawsuits.
    


            The majority conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed Trump to fire leadership of independent government agencies this year. However, the court has drawn a line in the past around the Fed. In May, the court called the Federal Reserve a “uniquely structured” agency with a long history of insulation from political interference from the White House that shouldn't be changed.
    


            A court would have the power to say whether Cook can continue serving in her role now or must step aside until the legal proceedings are resolved in a fuller way later.
    


            The Fed said in a statement on Tuesday it will abide by a court's decision in Cook's challenge of her attempted firing.
    


            “Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,” the Fed said.
    


            The president has the power to fire any Fed governor for cause, but it's unclear whether unproven allegations meet that threshold.



            The president has blamed the Fed's leadership for moving too slowly, in his view, to lower interest rates.
    


            If Cook is allowed to remain a Fed governor, without any restrictions, she'll be able to vote at the Fed's upcoming September 16-17 meeting. Fed policymakers are widely expected to deliver the first interest rate cut since December, according to futures.
    


            Cook hasn't publicly spoken about the economy since Pulte raised accusations of mortgage fraud against her. Her latest comment on the economy was after the release of the July jobs report on August 6 during a moderated discussion hosted by the Boston Fed.
    


            She said that the weak streak of job growth in recent months was “concerning” and that the labor market could be at a turning point.

Washington has told Copenhagen to “calm down” after its charge d'affaires was summoned by the Danish foreign minister over an alleged US influence operation to push Greenland toward secession. The island is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.

Copenhagen's protest came after local media reported that at least three Americans with ties to US President Donald Trump had allegedly been working to weaken relations between Greenland and Denmark and to recruit people for a secession movement. 

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that such attempts were unacceptable and ordered US Charge d'Affaires Mark Stroh to appear at the ministry for talks. 

A State Department spokesperson has confirmed Stroh met with Rasmussen and had a “productive conversation” that “reaffirmed the strong ties” between Greenland, Denmark and the US. 

Meanwhile, the White House has refused to confirm whether any influence campaign was ever underway, with an official telling CBS News on Wednesday, “we think the Danes need to calm down.”

The spokesman added that he could not comment on the “actions of private US citizens in Greenland,” but stressed that Washington respects the right of the island's residents to “determine their own future.”

Danish intelligence agency PET has previously warned that Greenland is being targeted by “various kinds of influence campaigns” aimed at creating discord in its relationship with Copenhagen. It has said this could be attempted through “traditional, physical influence agents or via disinformation” and announced it has strengthened its presence in the world's largest island.

Trump has long indicated that he wants to bring Greenland under US control, calling the island of less than 60,000 people a strategically vital asset. He has not ruled out using military force to achieve that goal, citing its mineral wealth and location in the Arctic. The territory is already home to a US military base and is seen in Washington as important for security in the North Atlantic.

Alleged US attempts to take control of Greenland come amid broader competition with Russia and China in developing the Arctic. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the region as a zone of “enormous potential” for trade and development.

MOSCOW, August 27. /TASS/. Russia will take tit-for-tat measures against Norwegian fishing vessels if Norway does not reconsider its position within one month, head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries Ilya Shestakov said.

""In case the Norwegian side does not reconsider its position within one month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone for Norwegian fishing vessels. Furthermore, fisheries and distribution of catch quotas in open waters of Barents and Norwegian Seas will be carried out on the basis of Russian national interests,"" Shestakov said, cited by the agency's press service.

In July 2025, Norway introduced the fishing ban in its exclusive economic zone for two Russian companies.

Alejandro ‘Alito' Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña grabbed and shouted at each other over the presence of foreign troops

Mexico's senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country's top politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion over the presence of foreign troops.

Alejandro “Alito” Moreno, head of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary party (Pri), grabbed at Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the senate president from the ruling Morena party, after lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to mark the end of the day's session on Wednesday.

“I'm asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly in the livestreamed video.

“Don't touch me,” Fernández Noroña responds.

When Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. When an aide to Fernández Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor.

As Fernández Noroña tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at the senate leader.

“[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I'm going to beat the shit out of you, I'm going to kill you.'”

Moreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.”

The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied.

Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”.

The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries.

The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.

In a statement on X, Moreno accused the governing party of changing the order of the day at the last minute in order to silence the opposition.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia attacked a Ukrainian Navy vessel, killing one crew member and injuring several others, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 28.

""Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues,"" Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Other details of the attack, including the time and location, have not yet been disclosed.

Earlier in the day, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that a Russian naval drone hit the Ukrainian medium reconnaissance ship Simferopol near the mouth of the Danube River, alleging that the ship had sunk.

Simferopol is a Ukrainian Navy reconnaissance ship of the Laguna-class. It was launched in 2019 and officially joined the fleet two years later.

The vessel is designed for radio, electronic, radar, and optical reconnaissance, and was armed with a 30 mm AK-306 artillery system.

While Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, reports of Ukrainian naval losses are extremely rare.

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has targeted multiple civilian vessels in the Black Sea, including foreign ones.

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.



The Aug. 28 call came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial strike on Ukrainian cities overnight.

At least 18 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

This marks the first time a vessel carrying fuel from the blacklisted facility has entered a Chinese import terminal.

The attack on the junction station occurred around 5 a.m. in Tver, a Russian city northwest of Moscow.



Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles.

Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker.



""This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day,"" the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as ""an attack on Hungary's sovereignty,"" saying it ""endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves.""



""No diplomatic mission should ever be a target,"" top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles, among them two Kh-47 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

			Federal government will run Union Station, which it claims has ‘fallen into disrepair' in latest bid to strengthen grip on US capital

The Trump administration plans to seize control of Washington's Union Station in the president's latest move to strengthen federal power over the US capital.

One of America's busiest rail hubs will now be run by the Department of Transportation as part of the White House's bid to reinvigorate Washington DC, which President Trump has portrayed as a run-down city.

The takeover was announced on Wednesday night by Sean Duffy, Mr Trump's secretary for transport.

Mr Duffy claimed the terminal, which is run by non-profit Amtrak, has “fallen into disrepair” and should be a “point of pride” for Americans.

He said Mr Trump had a vision to beautify the 118-year-old station, which is a short walk from Capitol Hill.

“He wants Union Station to be beautiful again,” Mr Duffy said. “He wants transit to be safe again. And he wants our nation's capital to be great again. And today is part of that.”

It is Mr Trump's latest attempt to bring key services in the city under his power.

Earlier this month he deployed National Guard troops on the city's streets after claiming, without evidence, that crime in DC is out of control.

Since then, six Republican-led states have sent troops to DC to be federalised, increasing the military presence.

The White House has increased the number of federal law enforcement and immigration agents in the city and taken over the Metropolitan Police Department.

Last week, Mr Trump said he would ask Congress for $2 billion (£1.48 billion) to help “beautify” Washington and improve safety. The funds would be spent on resurfacing roads, fixing street lights and improving green spaces, he said.

Mr Duffy said the federal government could do a better job of running the train station.

His department plans to attract shops and restaurants that will generate revenue to pay for the upgrades.

Mr Duffy said: “We are going to make the investments to make sure that this station isn't dirty and we don't have homelessness in Union Station.”

The station, which opened in 1907, has been through a number of management changes.

It faces billions of dollars in delayed maintenance and key spending on track, parking and other operations.

The rail terminal has also contended with homeless people and crime including a February murder in a parking garage.

DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, who is a Democrat, supports Mr Trump's “amazing initiative” because her office cannot afford the upgrades to the station.

“It has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation,” Ms Bowser said.

The Department of Transportation has estimated that a new roof and public bathrooms will be needed as part of renovations and would by themselves cost $170 million (£126 million).

Last week, JD Vance, the vice president, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence, were shouted down by protesters when they visited National Guard troops at the station.

Amtrak, which set a new passenger record last year, launched new high-speed Acela trains on Wednesday on the Northeast Corridor that links Boston to Washington.

There are more than 800,000 daily trips in the region which represents 20 per cent of the US economy.

At a court hearing on Wednesday, the judge didn't rule on Mario Guevara's petition to be released.

Award-winning journalist Mario Guevara, who had begun documenting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, has been detained since his arrest at a protest on June 14 in DeKalb County, Georgia. 

Guevara has spent almost all of his detention in ICE custody, although he is authorized to live and work in the United States. He immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. Guevara settled in Georgia and continued to work as a journalist, first for Mundo Hispánico, and then, in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MG News, which had recently begun filming ICE abductions.

In a phone interview from an ICE jail in South Georgia, Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution that the agency is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” Some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

On August 20, Guevara's legal team, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Georgia, filed a habeas corpus petition requesting that the court allow Guevara to pay the $7,500 bond set by an immigration judge on July 1. Federal prosecutors had appealed the bond order to the Board of Immigration Appeals and were granted a stay, or pause, of the order, thereby preventing Guevara's release.

At a hearing on Wednesday, the judge did not rule on Guevara's petition and requested briefs from both sides.

Guevara's saga began more than two months ago when he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest, which was part of a nationwide day of action to protest President Donald Trump. According to the petition, body camera footage from the protest shows an officer instructing other officers to, “Keep an eye on the guy in the red shirt. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. . . . He's been warned multiple times.” Another officer asked, “Press?” The first officer replied, “Yep.”

About a minute later, Guevara stepped off the sidewalk as he moved out of the way of police officers coming through the area, and was promptly arrested. Video of his arrest shows that Guevara is wearing a red shirt underneath a vest clearly marked with PRESS on the front and back.

After his arrest, ICE placed a detainer on Guevara. Although all criminal charges related to the protest have been dropped, federal prosecutors have fought to keep him locked up in ICE custody. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that ICE arrested Guevara because he is a journalist. In an email to Truthout, DHS claimed that he “is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004,” which is false. 

The immigration judge who granted Guevara bond wrote that the journalist “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.” 

The habeas petition quotes extensively from the government's filings to demonstrate that ICE is targeting Guevara because he is a journalist. 

“In the Notice of Appeal, the Government states that Mr. Guevara is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed' law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,'” it reads. “The Government further states that ‘[l]ocal law enforcement reviewed the respondent's public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.'”

Guevara is currently held in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day at the Folkston ICE Processing Center, according to the petition. For two hours a day, he's confined to a larger cell where he can “see the sky and breathe fresh air.” During his detention, he has lost approximately 20 pounds. “The freedom of press is only for U.S. citizens,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on a call from Folkston. “If I'm outside again, I don't think I will be on ICE anymore because everything is different now.”

Jake Sullivan claims his stance has changed because Israel's “war” is different now than it was under Biden.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Top Biden administration officials have begun rewriting their ironclad support of Israel throughout the end of President Joe Biden's term, now claiming to oppose Israel's starvation policy in Gaza as it's officially tipped into famine — a famine that they fully laid the groundwork for over the first 16 months of the genocide.

In an interview with “The Bulwark” published Wednesday, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that he now supposedly supports withholding weapons from Israel because, he claims, the situation in Gaza is different than it was last year.

“I have in fact told a number of members [of Congress] who were thinking about the votes on these resolutions that the situation as it stands today, following the breakdown of the ceasefire in March, means that a vote to withhold weapons from Israel is a totally credible position. That is a position that I would support,” Sullivan said, likely in reference to resolutions introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) to block the sale of certain weapons to Israel.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

He claims that, throughout 2024, Israel was facing threats from other countries that it doesn't face today, and that a hallmark moment was when Israel showed its obstinance in unilaterally ending the ceasefire deal in March. He also points to the UN-backed declaration of famine in Gaza last week as a sign of conditions being worse. These changes mean that current pro-Israel policies are less legitimate than the Biden administration's stance, he said.

“My view is that people who, you know, thought this was wrong from the start didn't stare squarely at October 7th. And people who think it's just and righteous today are not staring squarely at what is happening in Gaza right now, you know, with the killing and the starving of innocent people,” Sullivan said. He ignores the fact that Israel was killing and starving innocent Palestinians immediately after the October 7, 2023, attack — with the stated intention of doing so.

Sullivan's claims are dubious for numerous reasons. For instance, he touts the Biden administration's supposed success in holding off a famine declaration in Gaza due to pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid. 

But the famine declaration last week has been forewarned for over a year, with Israel having used starvation as a weapon of war from the beginning of the genocide with little to no pushback from the Biden administration.

In fact, reports found in December of last year that the Biden administration had pressured the U.S.-backed Famine Early Warning System Network to retract a report warning of imminent famine in northern Gaza. Far from pressuring Israel to ease its humanitarian catastrophe, officials in the Biden administration would often say in public statements that they opposed the starvation campaign, but would do nothing in practice to stop it. Other times, they would outright lie about Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid.

For instance, in October of 2024, Biden officials sent Israel an ultimatum demanding that it increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, or else the U.S. may end its military support. Israel, in turn, actually decreased the aid flow to record lows — and the administration said that it has not assessed that Israel was in violation of its ultimatum.

Sullivan's argument that military aid to Israel was legitimate last year is also completely undercut by the International Court of Justice's opinion in January of 2024 that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide and ordered it to end the siege and lift the humanitarian blockade.

Other former Biden officials have attempted to backtrack in recent weeks. In an interview with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner published Tuesday, Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, said that the situation now is “very, very different” from what it was under Biden with regards to starvation in Gaza — even as experts had warned countless times that there were potentially thousands of deaths to starvation and other causes not being counted in the official death toll.

Like Sullivan, Lew also defended the genocide as it was conducted under Biden. In comments that garnered outrage, he said that Israel's pattern of killing children in Gaza was justified and legitimate. When pressed, he said that the children killed in strikes on schools and shelters were acceptable collateral damage because they were often found to be family members of Hamas fighters.

“We could almost never get answers that explained what happened before the story was fully framed in international media, and then when the facts were fully developed, it turned out that the casualties were much lower, the number of civilians was much lower, and, in many cases, the children were children of Hamas fighters, not children taking cover in places,” Lew said.

“​​It is not the simple question that it originally appears to be when the initial report makes it sound like the target was just an empty school that families took cover in,” he went on.

            Kyiv was bombarded overnight by Russia's second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with at least 21 people killed, including four children, according to officials.
    


            Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
    


            Among those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.
    


            Ukraine's air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
    


            Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”
    


How Russia's drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide



            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow is still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia's way of describing the war, “continues.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in a post on X.
    


            “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
    


            Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine.
    


            The mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
    


            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
    


            “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
    


            The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in a post on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
    


            The bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.
    


            Trump is “not happy” but “not surprised” by the strikes, the White House said Thursday, adding that he was watching the developments “intently.”
    


            Trump, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, wants the war to end, but both Putin and Zelensky “must want it to end as well.” She said the president would
    


            A British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Putin is “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
    


            London has summoned the Russian ambassador, British foreign secretary David Lammy said in a post on social media, adding: “the killing and destruction must stop.”
    


            Later Thursday, the Spanish foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy's charge d'affaires in protest of the “unacceptable attack.”
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
    


            The White House's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes, writing on X that “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
    


            Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
    


            The couple were getting ready to go to their building's bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
    


            “I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
    


            “As of now, my wife hasn't been found. Her phone doesn't respond. She's not listed anywhere. I don't know… we're still searching,” Protsiuk added.
    


            Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
    


            Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
    


            The major attack on Ukraine's capital comes just over two weeks after Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
    


            But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
    


            On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia's defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
    


            A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
    


            Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
    


            Ukraine's outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
    


            “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
    


            In his analysis of Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
    


            Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
    


            Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
    


            Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘Something has to change': Manchester United plunges to new low against fourth-division Grimsby Town","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/sport/soccer-manchester-united-grimsby-intl","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:29:00 GMT","


            Just when Manchester United fans thought it couldn't get any worse, up steps fourth-division side Grimsby Town to plunge the once-great club even further in the mire.
    


            The League Two minnow – sitting three divisions below Manchester United – was well worthy of its League Cup win on Wednesday, beating Ruben Amorim's team 2-2 (12-11) in a marathon penalty shootout that came after a rollercoaster game at Grimsby's Blundell Park.
    


            The host, by far the better team in the first half, led its Premier League opponent 2-0 heading into the final 15 minutes of the match. Two late goals from the Red Devils, though, looked to have denied Grimsby a historic victory, but the underdog bit back in an astonishing shootout which United manager Amorim couldn't bring himself to watch.
    


            And while the night should be remembered for the Grimsby Town celebrations at full-time – it is arguably the greatest result in the club's history – it's hard not to question what on earth is going on at United.
    


            The scene looked all the more bleak after a mammoth thunderstorm drenched the ground in the second half, with the image of a soaking-wet Amorim frantically consulting his tactics board serving as the perfect metaphor for the club's current state.
    


            “I just want to apologize to our fans,” a furious Amorim told ITV Sport after the humiliating defeat.
    


            “You can feel it. Something has to change. I don't know what to say anymore to our fans. It's hard to face.”
    


            He later added to reporters: “We were completely lost and it's hard to explain and that's why I think they spoke really loud.
    


            “I know the best team won today. The best players lost – because when you are a team you can win any game. It was really fair the football today.”
    


            The Portuguese manager has now been at Manchester United for nine months and pressure to get results is looming larger than ever – he has so far overseen just 16 wins in 44 games.
    


            Given he arrived part-way through last season and told fans he would need time to implement his style of play, many gave him some leeway for the team's disastrous 15th-place finish in the league.
    


            But after an entire preseason schedule and backing in the transfer market – the club has signed an entirely new frontline in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Šeško and Matheus Cunha – there is very little credit left in the bank.
    


            To put it simply, there is still so much wrong with the team which has picked up just one point from its first two Premier League games of the new season.
    


            The goalkeeper situation, for one, has become untenable. Both André Onana and Altay Bayındır have been used in the three games this season and both have made blunders that have led to conceded goals.
    


            The defense, certainly against Grimsby, looked incredibly unsure of itself and the attackers are struggling to convert the very few chances they are creating.
    


            Both new signings, Cunha and Mbeumo, missed vital penalties in Wednesday's defeat. New star striker Šeško also opted to be the last outfield player to take a spotkick.
    


            “It was obviously not good enough today,” United defender Diogo Dalot told ITV Sport. “We cannot give up, whatever the situation but, like I said, it's not good enough and I think its something we need to look deeply into ourselves.
    


            “Tomorrow is a new day, we need to fight back and show to ourselves that, to be at this club, we need to do more much.”
    


            There is also the sticky situation about the team's formation.
    


            Amorim was praised on his arrival at the club for having a distinct style of play. The 3-4-3 formation had worked so well at his former club, Sporting CP, and many felt a strong identity was exactly what a rudderless Manchester United needed.
    


            But Amorim's dedication to his system, which was once deemed a strength, is now turning into a weakness. Even if it's not working, or if the players are struggling to adapt, the manager is seemingly not changing his mind.
    


            Last season, the Portuguese boss said things would get worse before they got better. United fans, though, are running out of patience, despite some brief signs of improvement during spells of matches this season.
    


            “It's not about the formation,” Amorim insisted again on Wednesday. “The system is not important. We can play with three defenders, four defenders, five defenders, that doesn't matter.
    


            “What matters is that we need to be different, and that's the job of the coach, and you can see that nothing has changed.”
    


            There is still a week left in this summer's transfer window and Manchester United will likely be busy – perhaps more so with outgoings.
    


            There are still several players, including Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, who are seemingly surplus to requirements at United, as Amorim looks to freshen up a team which has been thrown from one disaster to the next in recent years.
    


            The clear out, which has seen the likes of Marcus Rashford leave the club on loan, was supposed to usher in a new era of positivity at the 20-time top-flight champion.
    


            The club's new minority owner, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has backed the need for change, investing in a renovated training center and promising to build a new world-class stadium.
    


            Already, though, this ‘new' Manchester United has lurched into its latest calamitous chapter.
    


            Next up for the team is a Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Nothing but a comfortable win will ease the growing pressure on Amorim and his job as manager of the Red Devils.

• A shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis Wednesday, killing two children. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            • The shooter, now dead, was identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman. Westman shared a “manifesto” on social media that is being investigated, police said. The shooter graduated from the school in 2017.
    


            • The attack is the latest in a string of deadly shootings in Minnesota. It is also the 44th school shooting in the US this year, according to a CNN analysis. It has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control.
    


Our live coverage of the Minneapolis school shooting is now here.



            The attack at a Catholic school in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning was the fourth deadly shooting the city had seen in roughly 24 hours, according to CNN affiliates KARE and WCCO.
    


            Speaking before the attack on Annunciation Catholic School, police chief Brian O'Hara called the level of gun violence in the city over the last day “deeply unsettling,” according to KARE.
    


            The first was at about 2 p.m. on Tuesday in south Minneapolis, when a shooter killed one person and wounded six others, KARE reported, citing police.
    


            At around 8 p.m. in another location, a shooter killed one man and injured another.
    


            Then at around 2 a.m. Wednesday, a shooter approached a group on a sidewalk and started shooting, killing one and wounding another, WCCO reported.
    


            Minneapolis Police said Wednesday they did not know if the three shootings were connected.
    


            The Democratic National Committee abruptly ended the final day of its summer meeting in Minneapolis on Wednesday after getting word of the deadly school shooting at the nearby Annunciation Church.
    


            DNC chair Ken Martin announced the shooting had occurred “no more than 10 minutes from where we are now” and urged anyone with medical training to help if they could.
    


            The DNC meeting's closing session, which was scheduled to last three hours, ended after less than 12 minutes. Martin, a native of Minnesota, began the shortened session by saying, “We are heartbroken.”
    


                    “This is the first week of school for students at Annunciation. These families woke up this morning to celebrate milestones in their children's lives,” Martin said.
                





            After a short prayer, the committee voted to unanimously approve all committee reports and adjourn early.
    


            The DNC leader told attendees that Wednesday's shooting came “on the heels of a tragic year where we already lost our dear friends Melissa and Mark Hortman,” referring to the former Democratic speaker of the Minnesota state House, who was assassinated along with her husband at their home in June.
    


            Democratic leaders opened this week's summer meeting by honoring Hortman's legacy. Many Democrats are renewing calls for new gun control measures in the wake of Wednesday's shooting.
    


            Em Paulson, a paraprofessional at a Minneapolis-area elementary school, told CNN Wednesday's shooting at Annunciation Catholic School hits close to home.
    


            “It's so riveting hearing about any school shooting no matter what profession you're in, but when you work in a school, it hurts just a little bit more,” they said.
    


                    “My teaching community is constantly reminded about how, one day, we may need to stand in between these children and violence,” Paulson added.
                





            Paulson shared video from one of several vigils were held across the Twin Cities Wednesday evening. The video, from Minneapolis' Lynnhurst Park, shows residents standing in silence and holding candles while music plays over loudspeakers.
    


            Vincent Francoual, a prominent Minneapolis chef, told CNN's Laura Coates his daughter, who was in Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, is traumatized after surviving the deadly shooting.
    


            There have been 44 US school shootings this year, according to a CNN analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.
    


            That number is one higher than the number of school shootings, 43, that had happened at this point in the year in 2024.
    


            The years since the pandemic have seen a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008, when CNN began tracking such events across public and private K-12 schools and colleges/universities across the United States.
    


            Of the 44 shootings in 2025, 22 shootings have been reported on K-12 campuses and 22 on university and college campuses.
    


            An uncle of the Minneapolis shooter has called today's attack at a Catholic school Mass “an unspeakable tragedy,” according to the Associated Press.
    


            Bob Heleringer, who is a former Kentucky lawmaker, told the AP the shooter was one of his sister's children. He said he did not know the shooter, Robin Westman, well and last saw his relative at a family wedding several years ago.
    


            “I wish (Westman) had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer said.
    


This post has been updated with more information from AP.



            The family of former Democratic Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, who were killed in June during a series of attacks, said today's shooting was a “senseless act of violence” and called on elected officials to act on “common-sense measures.”
    


                    “Mark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that families should be safe in their homes,” the statement says.
                





            “We hope this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common-sense measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.”
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said locked doors during Mass may have helped prevent an already “unthinkable” tragedy at Annunciation Catholic Church from becoming even worse.
    


            “A number of the doors had been locked once Mass began, which is part of their normal procedure,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. “We believe that this step also played a part in ensuring this tragedy did not become that much worse.”
    


            Children also described getting down,  taking cover and helping others take cover, as they had practiced before during training drills, O'Hara said. The Annunciation Catholic School handbook notes it conducts three lockdown drills during the school year.
    


            The police chief described law enforcement responding to a difficult scene, with the first officer running in “not wearing a helmet, not with any rifle or SWAT gear” and quickly heading in the shooter's direction.
    


                    “First responders that came here this morning just walked into this unthinkable, unthinkable act of violence,” the police chief said. “This is one of those scenes that's just deeply, deeply traumatizing.”
                





            In a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump highlighted “the need for pre-emptive intervention in identifying potential school shooters.”
    


            Trump wrote that early warning signs “are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions.”
    


                    “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society — beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer,” Trump wrote in her post.
                





            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara gave an update on the status of the injured children tonight.
    


            Two children died in the shooting. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins the remaining victims are expected to survive and that some of the children have been released. “A number” of them still remain at the hospital, the police chief said.
    


            “They had a range of injuries. One, I believe, was like a graze wound from a gunshot,” O'Hara said. “All the way to some very, very serious and life-threatening injuries that thankfully they are expected to survive from.”
    


            Three firearms recovered from the scene of the Minneapolis shooting had been legally purchased by the shooter, who had recently been issued a permit to purchase firearms, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.
    


            “I don't have information about where specifically those weapons were purchased, but they were purchased lawfully,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


Context: In Minnesota, a permit is needed to purchase firearms and also to carry the firearms in public. The state doesn't differentiate between open and concealed carry.
    


            Local and federal investigators searching for a motive in the deadly Minneapolis shooting have conducted four search warrants at several locations, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.
    


            “One is the church, and then there are three residences in the Twin Cities metro that are associated with the shooter,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins tonight, adding that at least one scene is still being processed.
    


            The FBI is helping the Minneapolis Police Department sort through documents that have been retrieved from the scene.
    


                    “What we've seen so far is just a variety of hate,” said O'Hara. “Right now, we don't have a clear motive to establish why (the shooter) did this at the church today, we're obviously open to every possibility, and we're hopeful that once we are able to go through the scene and all of the evidence that's collected, that we'll be able to be able to better provide answers for our community.”
                





            Earlier Wednesday, O'Hara said the shooter, Robin Westman, released a “manifesto” on YouTube that “included some disturbing writings.”
    


            The 23-year-old had a personal connection to the church and school, O'Hara told CNN.
    


            “We believe that the suspect, at some point, was a student here, or a member of the parish, and that a family member here also worked for the church,” O'Hara said.
    


            It was just before 8:30 a.m. when young children were attending Mass at a beloved Catholic school in Minneapolis to mark the first week of classes. Moments later, those students and their families' lives were forever changed after a shooter killed two praying children and injured more than a dozen other people.
    


Here's what you should know:



CNN's Tori B. Powell, Aditi Sangal, Chris Boyette, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Chelsea Bailey, Andi Babineau, Morgan Rimmer, Jill Martin, Samantha Waldenberg, John Miller, Mark Morales, Holmes Lybrand, Barbie Latza Nadeau, Michael Rios, Emma Tucker, Matt Lait, Taylor Romine contributed reporting.



            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett about the mass shooting that killed two Catholic school children attending mass in Minneapolis, calling for love rather than hatred in the wake of this tragedy.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed gratitude for Annunciation Catholic School staff, who he said “threw their bodies on top of children” to protect them as a shooter opened fire this morning.
    


            “They did the right thing to protect what could have been so many more children dead,” Frey said of school faculty tonight at a vigil in the community.
    


            He went on to thank law enforcement and first responders across the state “who ran towards danger when so many of the rest of us could have ran in the opposite direction.”
    


            Attendees of the vigil held this evening in Richfield for the victims of the shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis spoke with CNN about the impact of the tragedy on the small and connected community.
    


            Annunciation Catholic School alumni Kailee Poling, 27, said she was attending the vigil with her husband and daughter. Poling, who attended the school from first through eighth grades, spoke through tears as she said, “you never think it's going to happen in your community.”
    


                    “Being a parent, I just can't imagine what those kids went through this morning,” she said. “Annunciation is such a tight knit community that when I heard the news, I was just really impacted knowing it's so close to home and knowing it's a community I've been a part of for so long.”
                





            Paul Hartzheim, 48, said he attended the vigil to be connected to his community in Minneapolis where he's lived his entire adult life. “This hit me different today… When it's in your own backyard, it's different,” he said.
    


            Vigil attendee Rhonda Miska, 45, serves at another Catholic parish said she came to support her fellow Catholics after the tragedy.
    


            Miska said the line into the vigil was wrapping around the building when she arrived, adding: “Clearly this is a testament to the need that we have as human beings to not face challenges alone and to be in community.”
    


            Laura Pueringer, 31, from Richfield, went to Annunciation's sister school and said she was reflecting on the moments she learned about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and 9/11 after today's shooting, which propelled her to attend the vigil to call for change.
    


            “We are demanding change. Enough is enough at this point,” she said.
    


            US Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN tonight that a former staffer's daughter witnessed two of her friends get shot — one in the neck and the other in the stomach — during the shooting this morning at Annunciation Catholic Church.
    


            The senator said the girl was at the church with her siblings when the shooting took place.
    


                    “The kids were crawling under the pews and then she ran out,” Klobuchar said. “She was the one that told the dad of one of the kids that his child had been shot.” 
                





            While describing the horrific scene, Klobuchar said there was also incredible bravery and kindness in the moment as older kids made sure to protect the younger children, she said.
    


            Klobuchar said this is a crucial moment for change, saying that children praying during a new school year shows how desperately it's needed.
    


            “These kids praying in a church, packed into the pews, joyful about their first week in school, their new teacher, and then getting shot through church windows. If that isn't enough to move people that we have to make some changes in this country, I don't know what is,” she said.
    


            A vigil for the victims of the Minneapolis school shooting is underway in Richfield, Minnesota, with a line of people spilling out onto the sidewalk wrapping around the building.
    


            The vigil is taking place at the gymnasium of Academy of Holy Angels High School, which was seen packed with people in attendance.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar are present at the vigil.
    


            One mother, whose two kids survived the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School today, expressed relief that her children were not hurt, but anger at the long trend of gun violence in schools.
    


                    “I have such mixed feelings right now, so many of them. But I am just incredibly grateful that this school did and had been preparing and also just incredibly sad and angry that this has to be a thing in any school,” Carla Maldonado told CNN, getting emotional.
                





            The school has active shooter drills “very often,” her husband, Pedro Maldonado, said. About two years ago, Carla Maldonado said she was volunteering and was there when the school had a “lockdown drill.”
    


            Carla Maldonado said when they arrived to the church earlier today, her husband began yelling for their two children.
    


            They were able to reunite with their 7-year-old daughter in the parking lot and later found out their 11-year-old son was sheltering in the basement of the building.
    


            Carla Maldonado said school shootings and gun violence in classrooms is starting to feel like a “broken record.” The mother pointed out that she's not the first parent to have these kinds of feelings and fears.
    


            “The lives that were lost is too much. One is too much,” Maldonado said. “It's not OK.”

NEW YORK (AP) — About 780,000 pressure washers sold at retailers like Home Depot are being recalled across the U.S. and Canada, due to a projectile hazard that has resulted in fractures and other injuries among some consumers.

According to a Thursday recall notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is recalling certain models of its Ryobi-branded electric pressure washers because the products' capacitor can overheat and burst, “causing parts to be forcefully ejected.”

That poses serious impact risks to users or bystanders. To date, the CPSC notes, the power tool and equipment company has received 135 reports of capacitors overheating in the U.S. — including 41 reports of explosions that resulted in 32 injuries and/or fractures to consumers' fingers, hands, face and eyes. A corresponding notice from Health Canada noted that no additional incidents were reported in Canada.

Consumers in possession of the now-recalled pressure washers are urged to stop using them immediately and visit Ryobi's recall website to learn about how to receive a free repair kit, which includes a replacement capacitor.

The Ryobi washers under recall have model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM. About 764,000 were sold in the U.S., in addition to 16,000 in Canada.

In the U.S. these products were sold at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024, the CPSC notes, for about $300 to $400 in stores and online.




TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is a subsidary of Techtronic Industries (TTI). The Associated Press reached out to the company for further comments on Thursday.

Beyond Thursday's pressure washer recall, TTI also recalled Ryobi-branded mowers and hedge trimmers earlier this year — due to fire and laceration hazards, respectively.

President Donald Trump has fired one of two Democratic members of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to break a 2-2 tie before the body considers the largest railroad merger ever proposed.

Board member Robert E. Primus said on LinkedIn that he received an email from the White House Wednesday night terminating the position he has held since he was appointed by Trump in his first term. The vacancy would allow Trump to appoint two additional Republicans to the board before its decision on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger though the Senate would have to confirm them.

Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific's acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition. He was named Board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Board member Patrick Fuchs to Chairman.

This follows Trump's previous firings of board members at the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Reserve, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are all supposed to be independent agencies.

“Robert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.”

Primus said he doesn't think the firing is valid because the White House didn't offer any cause for it, and he plans to fight. He also rejected their explanation for the move because he has long tried to encourage railroads to serve every industry better and help them grow, but he has already been removed from the STB website.




“I've been pro growth across the board in terms of encouraging growth in the freight rail network, which in turn will grow our national economy. So if that's not being in line with America first, then I don't know what America he's saying is first,” Primus said to The Associated Press.

He said the firings at all these agencies threaten their independence and credibility. Primus said in his tenure the STB always strove to be impartial and apolitical. 

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who serves on the Commerce Committee, said it's clear that “Donald Trump is trying to stack the deck so the federal government rubberstamps the merger as a huge favor for Wall Street and wealthy railroad owners.” She said Primus has been a fair regulator who worked hard to make sure railroads delivered for their customers and focused on safety.

Every rail worker union and the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association also quickly condemned the firing.

“The explanation provided for this decision — that his position has been “eliminated” — is nothing short of outrageous. Appointed bodies established through federal code are not designed to be erased at the whim of powerful corporate interests,” said the SMART-TD union that represents concductors. “This action is unprecedented, unlawful in spirit, and reeks of direct interference from hedge funds and the nation's largest rail carriers.”

The board is set to consider Union Pacific's $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern in the next two years before deciding whether to approve the nation's first transcontinental railroad and reduce the number of major freight railroads in the U.S. to five.

Primus said the biggest problems in the industry are the lack of growth and poor service after all the deep cuts railroads have made over the last decade in the interest of efficiency and improving profitability. He hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal, but he doesn't think mergers will necessarily improve competition.

“We don't need to merge to increase competition. We need to understand that we have to grow,” he said.

President Donald Trump has threatened to dispatch the National Guard to Chicago and other big cities. But data shows most U.S. violent crime has been in a steady decline in recent years (AP video: Mike Householder)

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

CHICAGO (AP) — The Trump administration asked a military base outside of Chicago for support on immigration operations this week, offering a clue of what an expanded law enforcement crackdown might look like in the nation's third-largest city. 

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles. 

Although details of the administration's plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don't want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don't want to create any speculation around what's going on.” 




City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn't contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn't received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization. 

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago's homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we're not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don't have people running scared and it doesn't create chaos on our streets, we're willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he's trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump. 

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago's long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration. 

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren't capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network. 

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday's White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics. 

“This is JB Pritzker's legacy, by the way,” she said. 

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities -- St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia -- had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor's blessing, the armories aren't available for use.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida taxpayers could be on the hook for $218 million the state spent to convert a remote training airport in the Everglades into an immigration detention center dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz.”

The center may soon be completely empty as a judge upheld her decision late Wednesday ordering operations to wind down indefinitely.

Shutting down the facility for the time being would cost the state $15 million to $20 million immediately, and it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if Florida is allowed to reopen it, according to court filings by the state.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the airport suitable for a detention center, a state official said in court papers.

Built in just a few days, the facility consists of chain-link cages surrounding large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. 

An Associated Press analysis of publicly available state spending data showed that Florida has signed at least $405 million in vendor contracts to build and operate the facility, which officials had initially estimated would cost $450 million a year to run. A previous AP review found that as of late July, the state had already allocated at least $245 million to run the site, which opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

The center has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system. 




It's also facing several legal challenges, including one that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled on late Wednesday. She denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations, after agreeing last week with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe that the state and federal defendants didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

The Miami judge said the number of detainees was already dwindling and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.” That's despite Department of Homeland Security lawyers saying the judge's order would disrupt that enforcement.

When asked, the Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say how many detainees remained and how many had been moved out since the judge's temporary injunction last week.

“DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities,” the department said Thursday in an emailed statement.

Environmental activist Jessica Namath, who has kept a nearly constant watch outside the facility's gates, said Thursday that fellow observers had seen metal framing for tents hauled out but no signs of the removal of FEMA trailers or portable bathrooms. 

“It definitely seems like they have been winding down operations,” Namath said.

Based on publicly available contract data, The Associated Press estimated the state allocated $50 million for the bathrooms. Detainees and advocates have described toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, although officials dispute such descriptions.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees as of last week, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to a rabbi about chaplaincy services.

Funding is central to the federal government's arguments that Williams' order should be overturned by an appellate court. 

Homeland Security attorneys said in a court filing this week that federal environmental law doesn't apply to a state like Florida, and the federal government isn't responsible for the detention center since it hasn't spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of the detention center.

“No final federal funding decisions have been made,” the attorneys said.

Almost two dozen Republican-led states also urged the appellate court to overturn the order. The 22 states argued in another court filing that the judge overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system.

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.”

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley said she would have taken the New York Knicks head coaching job if it had been offered.

Staley, 55, interviewed for the position before the Knicks hired Mike Brown in July.

""I would have had to do it. Not just for me. For women. To break (that door) open,"" Staley said on the ""Post Moves"" podcast. ""I would have had to. It's the New York Knicks. I'm from Philly. But it's the freaking New York Knicks.""

Staley was one of many candidates the Knicks interviewed for their head coaching vacancy. The Knicks also interviewed former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, former Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori.

Staley said she thought she did well in the interview but questioned whether she hurt her chances by asking the Knicks how they would handle the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach.

""How, if you hired me as the first female head coach in the NBA, would it impact your daily job? Because it would,"" Staley said. ""You're going to be asked questions that you don't have to answer if you're a male coach. There's going to be the media and all this other stuff that you have to deal with that you didn't have to deal with and don't have to deal with when you hire a male. That got them to thinking, ‘Maybe she's right.'""

Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on the reaction to the Minneapolis school shooting that left two children dead and several other injured. Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham also weighs in on the aftermath during 'America's Newsroom.'

Vice President JD Vance slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Thursday after she criticized prayer in the aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota. 

In an X post, Vance defended prayer in the wake of the tragedy and demanded to know why the former White House press secretary would attack the practice when the children who were killed the day before were praying.

""We pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know God listens. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action,"" Vance said, adding, ""Why do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?""

In a follow-up post, Vance wrote, ""Of all the weird left wing culture wars in the last few years, this is by far the most bizarre. ‘How dare you pray for innocent people in the midst of tragedy?!' What are you even talking about?""

Police have identified the shooter responsible for opening fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, when they said two children were killed and 17 others were injured during morning Mass.

Vance's remarks came in direct response to Psaki's Wednesday post slamming people for offering thoughts and prayers in response to the tragedy.

She wrote, ""Prayer is not freaking enough.  Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school.  Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers.""

In a separate post, Psaki also used the tragedy to criticize the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. 

""When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy.""

Tommy DeVito was waived by the New York Giants on Tuesday, but the fan favorite quickly found a new home.

DeVito, 27, was claimed off waivers Wednesday by the New England Patriots. He will slot in as the team's third-string quarterback behind starter Drake Maye and backup Josh Dobbs.

DeVito became the odd man out with the Giants as the fourth quarterback on the roster after the team overhauled its quarterback room in the offseason. The Giants signed Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston in free agency and traded up to draft Jaxson Dart in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

DeVito has started eight games and appeared in 12 over his two-year career. In 2023, he went 3-3 and completed 64% of his passes for 1,101 yards with eight touchdowns and three interceptions and was thrust into the national spotlight as ""Tommy Cutlets.""

Last season, DeVito started two games but struggled. The northern New Jersey native completed 70.5% of his passes for 257 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions.

DeVito played well in the preseason, especially against the Patriots. In the Giants' 42-10 win over New England, he completed 17 of 20 passes for 198 yards and three touchdowns.

Across three preseason games, DeVito completed 30 of 38 passes for 323 yards with four touchdowns and one interception.

""Just strengthening the roster, certainly, at a premium position and continuing to add pieces, whether that's offensively, defensively or guys that we feel like can help us on special teams,"" Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday.

Vrabel also acknowledged that having vice president of player personnel Ryan Cowden — who previously was an advisor to the Giants general manager — was beneficial in providing insight into DeVito.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is coming undone. The White House announced last night that it had ousted the agency's newly sworn-in director, Susan Monarez, whose lawyers insist that she still has her job because only President Donald Trump himself can fire her. (Yes, it's a mess.) Four top officials resigned yesterday. Two of them—Demetre Daskalakis, who was the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Debra Houry, who was the chief medical officer—told me that the group quit together to signal that they believe science is being ignored and that public health is in danger.

The departures leave a leadership void that, according to current and former CDC officials, has demoralized the agency's staff and will further undermine its ability to provide reliable guidance to Americans. As Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, who resigned from the agency in June as co-leader of a group that advises outside experts on COVID vaccines, told me, “It feels like the CDC is over.”

I spoke with Daskalakis this morning just before he and Houry were escorted from the CDC's Atlanta headquarters. He told me that his decision to resign was prompted by a number of factors, including “the replacement of science with ideology” and “the sidelining of scientists so that their data cannot be seen.” He also fears that important information isn't finding its way to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. According to Daskalakis, no one from his center had been allowed to brief Kennedy directly on any of the issues that it covers, including polio, measles, COVID-19, and various vaccines. “I'm not sure where he's getting his information other than Substacks that are erroneous,” he said.

A spokesperson for Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview with Fox & Friends this morning, Kennedy declined to comment on personnel matters. “CDC has problems,” he said, accusing the agency of spreading “misinformation” during the coronavirus pandemic. “We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded—I would say—malaise at the agency, and we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.”

The CDC had already been in turmoil for months before this week's departures. Health workers at the agency were caught up in the Trump administration's mass government layoffs earlier this year. In June, Kennedy removed all 17 members of a respected vaccine-advisory committee and appointed eight new members, including Robert Malone, a prominent COVID-vaccine critic who believes that the United States government has “reality-bending information-control capabilities,” and Vicky Pebsworth, who, like Kennedy, has a long history of insinuating that vaccines can cause autism despite decades of high-quality studies refuting that connection. In response, CDC workers and alumni protested outside the agency's headquarters, calling for Kennedy to resign. Then, early this month, a 30-year-old man who blamed COVID vaccines for his depression fired nearly 200 shots into the campus, killing a police officer. A letter signed by hundreds of CDC employees after the shooting objected to the “politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization"" and accused Kennedy of being “complicit in dismantling America's public health infrastructure and endangering the nation's health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.” (After the shooting, Kennedy posted a statement on X in which he lamented the shooting and the officer's death. “Public health workers show up every day with purpose—even in moments of grief and uncertainty,” he said. “We honor their service.”)

Yesterday's attempt to remove Monarez as director was the last straw in the four officials' decision to resign, Houry said. (Along with Houry and Daskalakis, the resignees include Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Jennifer Layden, who oversaw the agency's Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology.) Houry told me that officials across the CDC were excited for Monarez to take the helm when she was confirmed last month. At the time, Kennedy praised her as a “public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials” and a “longtime champion of MAHA values.” (She was apparently not the administration's first choice for the position: Before nominating Monarez, the White House withdrew the nomination of David Weldon, a physician and former congressman, over concerns that his anti-vaccine views would undermine his Senate confirmation.) Then, just weeks later, Monarez was shown the door. “When we knew that her job was in jeopardy, that we weren't going to have scientific leadership anymore, that was the final tipping point for us,” Houry told me. “We could not stay if there was not a scientific leader at CDC.”

A statement from Monarez's lawyers said that she had been targeted by Kennedy because she “refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.” Yesterday afternoon, a post on the Health and Human Services X account said that Monarez was “no longer director” of the agency. But Monarez's lawyers said that, even though she had been notified by a White House staffer that she'd been fired, she believes that her termination has to come from President Trump himself. A statement from the White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that the director had been fired after “refusing to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so.” The statement also said that Monarez is “not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.” (Monarez didn't reply to an interview request.)

Last night and this morning, current and former CDC employees told me that many scientists who remain wonder how they will continue, and whether the agency is still dedicated to providing science-based guidance to the nation. “People are at their wit's end, and there has been trauma after trauma after trauma,” one longtime CDC official, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from HHS, told me today. “I just don't know how much more our staff can take.”

Daskalakis and Houry told me that they had stayed at the agency despite their misgivings about Kennedy's views and concern about those he appointed to key positions. They stayed after he cast doubt on the safety of the measles vaccine amid the nation's largest outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. They stayed after he canceled $500 million in funding for mRNA-vaccine development. They felt that as long as they were able to put out accurate data, remaining at the CDC was worthwhile. But after Monarez's ouster, they no longer believe that's possible.

The discipline points to constructive ways to celebrate differences in the workplace.

One of the prickliest issues in business over the past decade is encapsulated in a single word: diversity. Starting in the 2000s, the received wisdom from consultants and human-resource firms was that increasing some kinds of diversity—predominantly race and gender—would improve not only fairness but business outcomes as well. A boom in DEI programs occurred at organizations large and small. These programs institutionalized new hiring and promotion targets, mandated diversity training, and revised grievance systems.

Two decades on, DEI programs have come under attack. Some of this criticism has involved a political backlash, but some has involved research questioning their effectiveness. As far back as 2016, Harvard Business Review published an article titled “Why Diversity Programs Fail,” showing that, as generally practiced, DEI programs actually reduced gender and racial diversity in companies. Last year, psychologists reviewing the literature found that these policies also generally lowered the performance of the targeted groups and increased the perception of workplace unfairness. Many companies are now rapidly unwinding DEI programs.

Companies tend to run in a herd, which results in being either all in or all out for an innovation such as DEI. But if we allow the debate about DEI to fall into this binary trap, where diversity is just great or totally terrible, we risk losing some important insights. Instead, we should expand our understanding of the ways that diversity can truly enhance organizational success, and focus on those.

There are two kinds of human diversity. The first is the type celebrated by the philosopher Aristotle, who argued that because “of all animals man alone is capable of deliberation,” we have a unique potential to be the most diverse species on Earth. He was talking about what modern researchers call acquired attributes—education, skills, opinions, and the like. This is not the kind of diversity that most DEI programs focus on, which is the second type, based on innate or inherited attributes such as race.

Conor Friedersdorf: ‘DEI' has lost all meaning

The early business case for higher diversity of this second type came from studies purporting to find that it was good for financial performance. One such survey in 2009 linked greater representation of women and minorities on sales teams to better results; another study, involving experiments with college students, showed that when small teams assigned a murder-mystery puzzle were all white, they discussed the problem less than when they included a minority member, and the greater discussion led to improved outcomes.

Whether these benefits resulted specifically from greater racial and gender diversity was not clear, however. Another plausible explanation is that the team's decision making improved by having people on the team from different backgrounds and with divergent experiences and opinions—diversity more of the Aristotelian variety, which newer research finds to be truly valuable. The most effective teams are cognitively and creatively diverse, combining people who come up with different kinds of ideas with others who are good at developing those ideas.

This is especially important for driving innovation, according to a 2020 study. But it doesn't stop with creative style. The authors also found that ideological diversity among colleagues—seeing the world in different, even opposing ways—was beneficial (though “too much” ideological diversity, implying more frequent disagreement, had a negative effect on innovation). An obvious conclusion from this finding is that viewpoint diversity protects against groupthink, which has been shown to harm companies.

This isn't so easy, however. Some people naturally embrace or resist diversity in ideas and thinking, which is at least in part a function of personality. Writing in 2023 in the Journal of Research in Personality, three psychologists found that people high in extroversion and openness enjoy “psychological richness” (meaning diverse experiences that change a person's perspective) much more than introverts and those low in openness. Personality traits such as these are about half genetic. And for some people, a resistance to new ideas is biological: Research has linked varying degrees of openness with activity of the amygdala, which also controls the fight-or-flight response. In short, it is possible that new ideas might scare some people.

Achieving ideological diversity in the workplace is especially tricky because, in aggregate, people's resistance to accepting political differences is growing. According to the polling firm YouGov, back in 2016, only 10 percent of both Republicans and Democrats said they had no friends with whom they significantly differed politically; by 2020, this figure had risen to 12 percent for Republicans and 24 percent for Democrats. This trend was corroborated by the research firm Generation Lab and the publication Axios, which found in 2021 that 71 percent of college students who are Democrats said they wouldn't go on a date with a Republican, while 31 percent of Republican college students said they wouldn't date a Democrat. Similarly, 41 percent of Democratic college students would not support a Republican-run business, 37 percent would not be friends with a Republican, and 30 percent would not work for one. (The Republican numbers regarding Democrats were 7, 5, and 7 percent.) You probably have your own ideas about how to account for this. Unfortunately, though, I am not aware of any differential studies of the amygdala response of progressives and conservatives.

Whatever the fate of modern DEI programs in corporate America, diversity of experience, thought, and ideology is a meritorious goal for a company to pursue. Done right, it will be good for business. Here are three pointers for that purpose.

1. Demographic proxies are not enough for useful diversity.

I have little doubt that diversity of ideas and experience correlate to some degree with categories of race and gender. But the research above has shown the possible costs of using these categories as proxy measures. This practice may harm the very people they purport to help, not least by making implicit assumptions about the way people of a particular gender or race think and act—which is not just incorrect and counterproductive, but also fairly insulting. Companies need to identify different kinds of thinkers without relying on demographic categories as a shortcut to do the sorting.

Listen: The great political sort is happening at the office

2. Look for people with high openness to new ideas.

The diversity that has the greatest business benefit is in people's style of thinking and how they see the world. Look for ways to get more balance and broader representation in your workplace by making this a priority. For example, search specifically both for people who have a lot of ideas and for people who are passionate about bringing ideas to fruition. By all means, seek those who learned critical-thinking skills at good universities, but also seek those formed by very different experiences—in the military, in missionary or volunteer work, or through a hardscrabble childhood.

3. Get serious about political diversity.

I shared the evidence on political intolerance, but political views might seem a special case, outside the concept of diversity we're trying to address here. I don't believe it is. By all means, encourage civility and tolerance at work—no one needs a pot-stirrer who bullies others with their opinions and creates bad blood—but true political diversity can offer a trove of valuable market information and keep organizations from making errors. Think of the companies that have stumbled into a major political controversy because they assumed that what everyone in their bubble thinks is the same as what everyone in the rest of this huge country thinks. Political diversity protects against that.

Diversity of thought is, in many ways, harder to be comfortable with than demographic diversity. Here's one last thought about how to make viewpoint diversity easier to achieve in the workplace and in life: Cultivate curiosity. I have written previously that a good way to achieve a more harmonious life with friends and relatives who vote and think differently is to adopt the mindset of a social scientist, genuinely fascinated by the things that others believe and say, without having either to agree or to do battle. Lots of research shows that such curiosity about others can foster trust, well-being, even health.

Corporate leaders are in an ideal position to turn curiosity about others' beliefs into a cultural norm. This will attract and empower the diversity most needed in our society today. And it'll be great for their business, too.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The CDC is collapsing. Will America's health follow suit?

The simmering showdown between US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the leadership of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has finally boiled over.

The White House said on Wednesday that CDC director Susan Monarez was fired — and Monarez's representatives quickly responded that she wouldn't leave her post without a fight. In protest of the ousting and Kennedy's leadership, four senior CDC leaders resigned.

The tension had been building for months. Once Kennedy took the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, he laid off thousands of workers at the CDC and other health agencies. He has rolled back longstanding vaccine policies over the objections of many experts inside and outside of the CDC. Then, earlier this month, a man angry about the Covid-19 vaccines fired nearly 200 bullets into a CDC office building. Although no one was hurt, CDC workers criticized Kennedy and others for stoking anti-CDC sentiment and for not speaking out after the incident. President Donald Trump has still not publicly commented on the shooting.

The final straw came yesterday when the Food and Drug Administration announced limited approval of new Covid vaccines updated to better match the variants currently circulating. The FDA approved the new shots — but only for the elderly and people who are at higher risk because of underlying health conditions. The vaccines had previously been approved for all Americans 6 months of age and older. The CDC would have been expected to make new Covid vaccine recommendations that matched the FDA's narrower approval, excluding healthy adults, pregnant women, and children — but, according to the New York Times, Monarez refused to commit to that policy in a private meeting with Kennedy

What happened next was chaos. National news outlets reported Wednesday afternoon that Monarez had been fired, less than a month after her Senate confirmation. Over the next few hours, Monarez's representatives responded that she was refusing to step down (her attorney suggests that her firing had been illegal), but the White House insisted she had, in fact, been terminated. And so began an exodus of more CDC leaders.

One of those officials — Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — explained why he was leaving the agency in a post on X. He portrayed the CDC situation as an existential battle between science and anti-science, noting in his post that no one on his team had ever even briefed Kennedy since he was sworn in as US health secretary in April.

“I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public's health,” Daskalakis wrote. “Public health is not merely about the health of the individual, but it is about the health of the community, the nation, the world. The nation's health security is at risk and is in the hands of people focusing on ideological self-interest.”

The CDC that will be left behind will be less science-driven and more beholden to Kennedy and his agenda — precisely the warning that the departing CDC officials are trying to send and a sentiment echoed by other public health organizations. “THE SUSTAINED ATTACKS ON PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE U.S. MUST END NOW,” read an all-caps statement sent by the Infectious Disease Society of America to the media.

But there's a bigger story here than just the latest drama under Kennedy's leadership: What's unfolding is a fight over the narrative of public health in America — and for the public's trust.

The American public is still unmoored after the Covid-19 pandemic, and two sides are trying to win out: Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement along with the critics who attacked the public health establishment during that emergency, and the public health experts aligned with America's scientific institutions. The outcome will determine the future of collective health in the US.

Kennedy argues that the public health establishment of the previous generation has failed the public and must be razed and replaced. If you look at the recent CDC personnel issues through this lens, then dismissing public health officials with decades of experience in their field is in service of that goal. On the other side, most scientists, public health experts, and CDC officials would argue that public health largely has a record of success — though with some mistakes and failures along the way.

America's public health institutions did lose some trust during the pandemic amid confusing and often inconsistent guidance. But a longer record of vaccinations driving down disease and other public health campaigns yielding major gains in people's well-being is clear from historical data and decades of peer-reviewed research.

Science may be on the CDC officials' side, but we're still learning exactly how the public actually feels about public health. How average people react to this drama and the conflicting messages that Kennedy and CDC officials are sending will determine the long-term consequences of this fight.

This parade of firings and principled resignations is in part a performance — and the audience is the American public.

As I have written before, 25 years ago, there was a pretty clear public health consensus in America. The federal government and major medical organizations were usually aligned on the major questions — questions like which vaccines to get. And the public was widely in support. In 2001, around the time the US declared measles had been eradicated, more than 90 percent of US adults said it was “extremely” or “very important” for people to get childhood vaccinations.

It is difficult to imagine such unanimity about any public health-related issue today.

Right now, the percentage of Americans who think childhood immunizations are important is below 70 percent. According to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey, only 26 percent of Americans have a great deal of faith in scientists to act in the best interests of the public, about the same percentage as those who say they have not too much or none at all (23 percent). That is much lower than in 2019, the pre-pandemic era, when 36 percent of Americans said they had a great deal of faith in science being in the public's best interest and only 12 percent had none or little.

Most Americans are stuck in the middle; 50 percent say they have a “fair” amount of trust in scientists. One way to think about this group is that they are up for grabs.

Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement has gained steam because many Americans desire a fresh approach to health and wellness; Kennedy remains one of the more popular active political figures in the country, despite criticism from all corners of the public health establishment. As the country's top health official, Kennedy argues he has a mandate to overhaul public health policy on everything from vaccines, to the food supply, to fluoride in public water systems.

But the health risks of Kennedy's policy agenda are real, and that is the message that public health experts, including the resigning CDC leaders, are trying to deliver to the public.

The US has already seen what happens when childhood vaccination rates drop, with the worst measles outbreak in 30 years taking hold this year in a poorly vaccinated Texas community. Dentists in Utah, where Kennedy helped herald the removal of fluoride from local water systems in April, are preparing for a surge in cavities. The introduction of fluoride into US water systems led to a large decline in cavities over many years; now, Kennedy's policy agenda could move the country backward.

And now, the new restrictions on Covid vaccines announced yesterday could make it more difficult for many people to get them. Vaccines may not be as widely available at pharmacies, and insurers may not be willing to cover the vaccine without government approval. That could make it harder for both vulnerable people and their loved ones to get Covid shots. The science is clear on the relative safety of the Covid shots, and Kennedy has been criticized for the weak evidence that he has cited to justify the changes to the Covid vaccine guidance. People could get sick if these shots are harder to come by because of Kennedy's policies.

This is always a challenge in public health.

Short of emergency lockdowns and mandates, public health has always been about soft power: Can you persuade the public to take certain precautions in the best interest of not only themselves but the people around them? And that authority is always fluctuating. Around 90 percent of Americans get their childhood shots, but less than 50 percent usually get their flu shot in a given year.

Now, the headwinds facing good public health policy are stronger than ever, with Kennedy and his movement representing an active opponent of many well-supported public health interventions in charge of US health policy. For a while, Monerez, Daskalakis, and others seemed prepared to try to work within the system that Kennedy controlled. But they no longer believe that is possible, so they are taking the fight to the public.

Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill's efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. 

The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike's corporate staff. It's unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike's EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. 

""As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we're making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE,"" the company told CNBC in a statement. ""This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can.""

Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill's efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. 

Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women's, men's and kid's as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. 

Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike's innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. 

Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a ""small number"" of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.

In a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.

Staff will learn if they're impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.

""To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader,"" the memo said.

Since taking the helm of the world's largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. 

When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that's now starting to materialize. 

""Instead of a men's, women's and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve,"" said Hill.

Hill said the company would organize into ""sport-obsessed teams"" which would ""drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands.""

In this article

Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's artificial intelligence models to power AI features in its key products. It's trying to lessen that dependence.

The software company said Thursday that it's begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. The MAI-1-preview model is being tested on LMArena, a website where people can conduct evaluations.

""We will be rolling MAI-1-preview out for certain text use cases within Copilot over the coming weeks to learn and improve from user feedback,"" Microsoft said in a blog post. The company has published a form where developers can request early access.

Meanwhile, Microsoft remains a key backer of OpenAI and strategic partner to the AI startup that's now valued at about $500 billion. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, which in turn relies on cloud infrastructure from Microsoft to run its models.

Microsoft draws on models from OpenAI to power features in Bing, the Windows 11 operating system and other products. 

But the companies are clearly moving into competition in various ways. Last year, Microsoft added OpenAI to the list of competitors in its annual report. It's a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta.

And in recent months, OpenAI has turned to other cloud providers, such as CoreWeave, Google and Oracle, to meet heavy demand. The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week.

On LMArena, Microsoft's new model was ranked 13th for text workloads on Thursday, below models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, Mistral, OpenAI and xAI.

Microsoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips.

""We have big ambitions for where we go next — model advancements, an exciting roadmap of compute, and the chance to reach billions of people through Microsoft's products,"" said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft's AI unit, in a post on X.

Microsoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi.

Global popstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce are officially engaged — with a large diamond ring to prove it. But Swifties hoping to emulate the style may find it challenging to do so, experts say.

After a two-year relationship, Swift and Kelce announced their engagement through an Instagram post on their official accounts on Tuesday.

In the photos of their social media post appears a hard-to-miss diamond on Swift's finger, a style that's known as an old mine brilliant cut, Tree Paine, Swift's publicist, told The Associated Press. The ring was designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry in New York City.

""It looks to be upwards of 10 carats, and it might be a vintage stone given the cut,"" Paul Zimnisky, a New York-based diamond industry analyst, said via email. ""Given the quality of the diamond and the size, it could easily be worth hundreds of thousands."" 

Jared Jewelers told CNBC through a written statement that the ring could cost approximately $250,000 to $500,000.

However, ""no one knows for sure,"" said Amanda Gizzi, senior vice president of corporate affairs at industry group Jewelers of America. 

It's ""a lot of speculation at this point,"" she said.

While Swift's ring was designed for her, it wouldn't be unusual to see replicas or similar styles appear across the market, said Zimnisky. (The trend-setting Swift's engagement moved several stocks this week, including names related to jewelry and apparel, amid fan interest in her ring and engagement dress.)

A comparable diamond, meanwhile, may be harder to come by.

Old mine diamonds have a ""distinct elongated shape with curved edges"" and go back to the time when diamonds were cut, shaped and polished by hand, according to Sarah Hanlon, celebrity and entertainment editor of The Knot, a bridal site.

""Due to their rarity, true old mine diamonds can be harder to source,"" Hanlon said over email.

What's more, the larger carat weight a stone is, the rarer and more expensive it's likely to be, Gizzi said, ""especially when we're talking about natural diamonds versus a lab-grown.""

According to Zimnisky, lab-grown diamonds can be found for almost 90% less than the cost of a natural diamond. 

However, experts say the elongated style of the singer's ring has already been popping up among engaged couples — or as a song by Swift goes, ""It's been a long time coming.""

""This style is very much on trend for what we've started to see, which is elongated cuts like hers, as well as a return to natural diamonds and then also this idea of antique cuts,"" Gizzi said. 

According to Jared Jewelers, ""this ring aligns to recent trends in bold gold looks, fancy cuts, and oversized elongated stones.""

In fact, elongated shapes like marquise have been selling for a premium this year due to high demand, said Zimnisky.

Couples inspired by Swift's ring can find more affordable versions with less expensive gemstones, said Zimnisky.

While old mine diamonds are rare and can be more costly, diamond shapes like cushions, emeralds and Asschers are easier to come by, said The Knot's Hanlon.

Couples can also look into the vintage jewelry market, experts say. 

""There's no wrong way to go about it,"" said Gizzi. ""The inspiration is definitely something that can be found in different price points.""

When shopping for engagement rings, start off by defining your budget. While costs can range widely, the average couple spent $5,200 on an engagement ring, according to The Knot's 2024 Jewelry and Engagement study.

Instead of rules of thumb like spending ""three months' salary,"" your budget should come down to what you're looking for in a ring, experts say.

When shopping for natural diamonds, the four C's – the color, carat, clarity and cut – determine the feature of the diamond as well as the price. 

Lab-grown diamonds will no longer follow the same rules. In June, the Gemological Institute of America, the organization that designed the widely used grading system, said it will instead use descriptive terms to determine the quality of lab-grown diamonds and classify the gems as either ""premium"" or ""standard.""

The new grading system will be on the market on Oct. 1, said Stephen Morisseau, a spokesperson for the GIA.

Still, when looking at either lab-grown or natural stones, you want to understand the stone's dimensions, its brilliance, the shape and the weight, said Gizzi.

The European Union formally proposed Thursday to remove tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key element of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement and ensuring that lower automobile tariffs will be retroactive to the beginning of August.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement that the removal of duties on industrial goods, along with providing ""preferential market access"" for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, would ""ensure tariff relief by the US for the vital EU automotive sector starting retroactively from 1st of August.""

""These steps contribute to restoring stability and predictability in EU-US trade and investment relations, to the benefit of business, workers and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic,"" it added.

The proposal, which now needs to be approved by the European Parliament and Council, was first outlined last week in a joint statement from the two trade partners. In it, they said the United States ""expects the European Union's legislative proposals will be ... enacted by the necessary legislatures.""

It said tariffs on autos would be reduced from the first day of the month when the EU's legislative proposal were introduced — which means the duties should be cut from Aug. 1.

The U.S. and EU announced they had reached a trade deal — after weeks of tense negotiations — at the end of July. U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal would see a 15% tariff imposed on most European goods to the U.S., including cars.

The rate came as a relief to the United States' largest trading partner after Trump previously threatened it with duties of 30%. Under the deal, the EU also committed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest at least an additional $600 billion in the U.S.

The traditional approach to investing in the energy sector going back decades has often come down to making sure a portfolio has exposure to the ""majors"" — integrated oil and gas stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have also paid reliable dividends.

There are times when it hasn't worked well in recent history — such as during the peak existential fears over the past decade about an oil industry on the way out as a global source of power — but it has done reasonably well since that panic ended. Over the past five years, whether it's the market performance of Exxon Mobil, or the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), returns have been strong after bottoming out.

But this year, even as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and energy stocks as a category have produced positive returns, they have not been the big winners for investors playing the energy theme of the future, according to Paul Baiocchi, head of fund sales and strategy at SS&C ALPS Advisors.

He pointed to year-to-date outflows among investors in XLE of roughly $7 billion, the largest and most liquid energy market ETF. Some of that may be related to fears that the global economy will slump as a result of President Trump's trade war, and as oil prices remain under pressure, the shares of oil and gas stocks will face greater headwinds.

But it's also a sign of a broader change in how investors think about ways to gain energy exposure.

""It speaks to the fact that advisors and investors are starting to think about energy more in terms of power than just crude oil and natural gas,"" Baiocchi said on this week's CNBC ""ETF Edge.""

""The conversation about energy is evolving beyond simply, 'I have to own the large majors,'"" he said.

His firm has long offered a way to play a more concentrated bet within the broader energy sector, led by its 15 year-old Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and has seen net inflows this year. 

But the story behind the flight from XLE has a lot to do with the expectations for big changes in the power generation sector in the U.S., and decades of transformation ahead for the electric grid as demand surges, spurred by factors such as AI data centers. Some of Trump's policy priorities play into this trend as well, including support for U.S. artificial intelligence development in a new tech arms race against China, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and the promotion of nuclear power.

""We're talking about incorporating nuclear in a way we haven't in decades,"" Baiocchi said. ""The mix of what generates electricity is evolving and the way investors play energy is evolving.""

Jack Clark, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, said at a recent summit where big tech companies met with energy leaders that it estimates 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors.

While XLE has seen outflows this year, its utilities sector comp the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has seen inflows near $3 billion and has tripled the performance of XLE, up roughly 12% this year versus 4% for the broader energy sector.

According to Malcolm Dorson of Global X ETFs, who appeared alongside Baiocchi on ""ETF Edge,"" the investor thinking on energy is changing as power generation becomes central to ""all the technologies of tomorrow"" and a huge surge in demand begins.

""Not only AI, but electric vehicles and large factories, and the big picture is that the U.S. is sort of not ready for all of this,"" Dorson said. Global X has launched an ETF focused on the theme, the Global X U.S. Electrification ETF (ZAP). ""The U.S. needs to produce about 45% more electricity than it produces today by 2040, after almost two decades of stagnant demand,"" he said.

And that demand will also mean higher prices paid by electricity consumers, which are expected to continue to outpace general inflation in the years ahead, as they have since 2022. Electricity prices have nearly doubled the inflation rate for all goods and services in 2025, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026.

The ETF experts also weighed in on the impressive performance run for international stocks in 2025, sleeper markets like Argentina and Greece, whether it's time to take some profits, and where to place overseas bets next. You can review that debate in this week's full ETF Edge show.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Michael Saylor hit by market revolt as his Bitcoin premium sinks","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/28/michael-saylor-strategy-microstrategy-bitcoin-premium-sinks/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:17:07 GMT","

Michael Saylor's once-celebrated Bitcoin experiment is mired in a market backlash, raising questions about the sustainability of the corporate-treasury model he pioneered. 

Shares of Strategy Inc., formerly MicroStrategy, have fallen 15% this month, erasing much of the premium the firm long enjoyed over its Bitcoin holdings. The company, long a bellwether for crypto sentiment, is now drawing fresh skepticism.





At the center of the concern is the firm's financing tactics. Strategy's new preferred stock—billed as its main vehicle for future Bitcoin purchases—has drawn tepid demand. A recent sale raised just $47 million, well short of Saylor's ambition for blockbuster capital raising. To make up the shortfall, the company has returned to common-share issuance, despite earlier pledges to limit dilution. That reversal has rattled investors.





The stakes extend far beyond one company. Saylor's playbook—raise debt and equity, buy Bitcoin, watch the market assign a premium, repeat—inspired a wave of treasury firms that collectively hold more than $108 billion, or 4.7% of Bitcoin's supply, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. If Strategy's premium collapses, confidence in the model itself could unravel.





“The decreasing premium is a natural reaction to competition and alternative ways for traders to gain exposure to digital assets,” said Jake Ostrovskis, principal analyst on Wintermute's OTC Desk. “Additionally, walking back guidance around no share issuance under 2.5x mNAV has forced short-term reassessments of the corporate strategy.”




Strategy was never just a stock. It became a proof of concept: that a corporate balance sheet could be weaponized as a speculative engine — a permanent source of demand for Bitcoin. The wager rewired how markets imagined corporate finance and inspired a boom in imitators.





Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, was a modest enterprise software firm until 2020, when Saylor jolted Wall Street by shifting money into Bitcoin. The stock ceased trading on earnings potential and began trading on a multiple of its Bitcoin—known as mNAV.





That multiple has swung before. It collapsed during the Terra-Luna crisis, rebounded to 3.4 after Donald Trump's re-election, and now sits at 1.57. But this time is different: the decline comes not during a crypto winter, but amid a boom. Treasury-style companies are proliferating. Yet Strategy—the originator—is now issuing shares into a falling multiple, and the market is starting to resist.





In late July, the company pledged not to issue shares at a multiple below 2.5, with narrow exceptions. Two weeks later, the guidance was loosened, and on Aug. 25, the company sold nearly 900,000 new shares.





Some investors online viewed the move as a breach of trust. And issuing equity below mNAV now risks a negative flywheel: falling stock weakens the ability to buy Bitcoin, eroding confidence, further driving down the premium.




Online, Saylor dismissed the criticism, posting an AI-generated image of himself walking past a giant bear. The company didn't respond to requests for comment. His supporters argue that maintaining flexibility may benefit the company should it gain inclusion in the S&P 500 or if Bitcoin booms anew.





The broader cohort is under pressure. According to Capriole Investments, nearly a third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets now trade below the value of those reserves. Smaller firms are particularly vulnerable: limited liquidity makes equity issuance more painful, and reliance on convertible notes brings interest burdens and maturity risk.





Strategy has previously said it plans to retire all of its convertible notes over the next four years and shift to preferred stock: securities whose principal will never come due. Most of its smaller peers, lacking both scale and creditworthiness, are unable to replicate that engineering.





“What happens when Bitcoin drops 50%?” said Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole. “Enthusiasm for treasury companies will wane, mNAVs will compress and you will have 100s of companies start to question their treasury strategy altogether.”





The field has also grown more crowded. Over the past year, influencers and politically connected figures have rushed to launch crypto vehicles through SPACs and reverse mergers. Many lack the scale or trading liquidity of Strategy, and could prove less durable in a downturn.




“Is this market frothy? I think it is,” Jack Mallers, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twenty One Capital Inc., said during a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday. “What we learned is, creating a Bitcoin treasury company is not a scarcity within itself. Anyone can register a business, attempt to go public and try to raise money to buy Bitcoin.”





A further challenge has emerged from the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Initially, Strategy and the exchange-traded funds both benefited from a post-election rally. But the comparison has grown less favorable. Funds offer exposure to Bitcoin without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage or dilution.





“Investors are momentum investors,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University. “When the price is going up, they are buyers. When the price goes down or remains flat, there is less enthusiasm.”





At the same time, attention is shifting toward other digital assets like Ether and Solana, seen by some as better suited to decentralized finance. Ether-focused treasuries alone have committed more than $19 billion.





Bitcoin itself has eased back from highs reached earlier this month, but remains buoyed by institutional allocations. Many newer treasury firms bought in above $100,000 and lack underlying businesses to sustain them if the market turns.




“There is nothing behind Bitcoin other than sentiment,” said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University.

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Michael Saylor's high-stakes Bitcoin strategy is facing a sharp market backlash, as shares of Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) formerly MicroStrategy have fallen 15% this month. Once celebrated as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company's premium over its Bitcoin assets has eroded to 1.57, down from 3.4 after Donald Trump's re-election. The pullback comes despite an ongoing crypto boom, raising doubts about the sustainability of Saylor's corporate-treasury model. A key pressure point stems from tepid demand for Strategy's newly issued preferred stock, which raised only $47 million, falling short of expectations and forcing a return to common-share issuance despite earlier promises to limit dilution.

The model Saylor popularized borrowing and raising equity to accumulate Bitcoin has inspired other treasury-focused firms that now collectively hold more than $108 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, or roughly 4.7% of its supply. But as Strategy issues equity into a falling multiple, investor confidence could weaken further, potentially creating a negative feedback loop. Analysts note that the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has intensified competition by offering direct exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage, or share dilution. Nearly one-third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings, leaving smaller players especially vulnerable due to liquidity constraints and heavier reliance on convertible debt.

Investor sentiment is also shifting toward alternative digital assets, with Ether-focused treasuries committing more than $19 billion as attention diversifies. While Bitcoin prices remain supported by institutional allocations, many newer entrants have bought at levels above $100,000 and lack the business fundamentals to withstand volatility. Critics warn that if Bitcoin's price were to fall sharply, enthusiasm for treasury-style strategies could fade quickly, compressing valuations across the sector. Supporters of Strategy, however, argue that maintaining capital flexibility may still benefit the company, particularly if it secures inclusion in the S&P 500 or if Bitcoin rallies strongly again.","{'href': 'https://ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Four crypto whales have scooped up over $350 million of Ethereum's native token, ETH, in the past two days, raising questions about what it means for its price. Whale is a moniker for large investors with the capacity to allocate huge sums, which can often directly influence the market's direction.

Precisely, an Arkham Intelligence analyst spotted four addresses with similar patterns and time schedules purchasing $357.24 million of ETH from FalconX, an “institutional crypto prime brokerage,” as described by the company itself.

The identified patterns suggest these addresses could belong to the same entity, or at least to entities connected with each other. Responding to these signals, the analyst questions whether these whales are “buying the bottom,” in the sense that they probably expect—and could somehow influence—Ethereum's price to go up from here.

On a similar note, inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have skyrocketed to a total of $1.83 billion during the last five trading sessions, as Coinspeaker reported earlier today. The institutional activity is not only around ETH but also on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all with significant purchases in what looks like a bottom. For example, Smarter Web Company purchased 45 BTC at around $111,000 each, and Bitplanet will deploy $40 million into Bitcoin, becoming South Korea's first institutional BTC treasury.

Regarding Ethereum , technical indicators and historical price action corroborate the idea of a potential bottom for ETH and other cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum is currently changing hands at $4,747 per token, testing a potential support level. If this price support holds, ETH could bounce back up, consolidating the thesis of a potential bottom marked by large institutional and crypto whale purchases.

Interestingly, Ethereum could have indeed formed a bottom on August 26—since Arkham spotted the four whales that started buying—at around $4,320. Before that, we saw two other likely bottom formations, pushing the ETH price up on August 20 and 21, at $4,070 and $4,215, respectively.

The current price action happens really close to the 50-period exponential moving average in the four-hour chart (4H50EMA), which is an important indicator for the cryptocurrency. Whether a bottom will form at these levels is yet to be seen, but crypto whales and institutions apparently believe this will be the case.

Coinbase's Layer-2 network, Base, has become one of the most active blockchain ecosystems by NFT trading volume, surpassing Solana and Abstract.

DappRadar's blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a recent research report that Base has become a popular place for creators, thanks to cheap mints, creator-friendly tools, and “speculation around a potential airdrop.”

“Base NFTs hit $122M in trading volume and 6.7M sales in 2025, with June marking a breakout moment (+336% MoM volume),” Gherghelas noted.

The surge has been fueled by top collections such as DX Terminal, Onchain Gaias, Oracle Patron, Based Punks, and Get Based, blending retro-futuristic art, interactive gameplay, and, in the case of Onchain Gaias, the ability for holders to train AI-enabled agents across Web3 ecosystems.

The main driver behind Base's NFT boom is Zora, an open-source NFT protocol that lets creators launch low-cost NFTs and drops on Base for less than one U.S. dollar, while also offering an ERC-20 layer for creator tokens.

“Since July alone, Zora on Base has recorded 1.6 million tokens minted, generating $470 million in trading volume and $3.4 million in creator royalties,” Gherghelas wrote.

Data from DefiLlama shows that starting in July, Zora's revenue jumped to $4.7 million, marking a more than 312,000% increase compared to Q4 2024. On the marketplace front, OpenSea has emerged as the leader on Base, with Gherghelas attributing this to the fact that the marketplace was an early Base supporter.

Amid the recent uptick in NFT activity, OpenSea has overtaken Blur over the past 90 days, with trading volume of $389 million, compared to Blur's $312 million, according to Token Terminal.

What is the best crypto narrative of 2025? While mainstream attention focuses on established players, several overlooked sectors are quietly gaining momentum. Real-world asset tokenization projects, emerging layer 1 platforms, and select meme coins are beginning to capture serious investor interest. These under-the-radar opportunities may hold the key to surprising growth stories in the months ahead. This article explores why these asset classes could become standout performers in the next market cycle.

LINK floated between $23.52 and $28 this week, inching up 3.93% while staying above its 10-day average of $24.34. Buyers kept nudging the token higher, but the bid keeps stalling two dollars under the 30 ceiling. The 56 RSI and a mild MACD uptick hint that bulls still have energy, though no one is ready to chase at any cost.

Zoom out one month and the picture looks brighter. LINK has added 27.55% in 30 days and 61.95% in six months, soundly beating most large-cap rivals. The 100-day average sits at $24.82, almost level with the shorter trend line, so momentum is steady rather than overheated. Volume spikes have been modest, suggesting the move is driven by gradual accumulation instead of frantic hype.

If momentum holds, a clean break above $28 puts $30 in play. A push through that mark would open a path to $35, about 25%-35% above today's midpoint. Failure to clear $28 could send LINK back to $21.21, roughly a 15% slide, with a deeper dip toward $16.73 wiping out about 35%. Right now the bias leans upward thanks to recent gains and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, but traders need to see a daily close over $30 to confirm the next leg higher.

HBAR trades in a narrow $0.23-$0.26 band after a 4.90% weekly lift that trimmed part of last month's 16.70% slide. Even with that short-term dip, the token still shows a 21.40% gain over the past six months, keeping it above both its 10-day and 100-day simple averages at $0.24.

Momentum looks steady. RSI sits at 57, Stochastic at 69, and MACD edges above zero, all hinting at mild buying drive rather than overheated action. The nearest ceiling is $0.27; clearing it could open a sprint to the next barrier at $0.31, roughly 15%-20% above the current upper band. Support rests at $0.21, then $0.18. A slip to the first floor would shave about 12% from the current midpoint, while a drop to $0.18 would erase around 30% of recent gains.

Given the modest upward bias, a break toward $0.27 looks more probable than a plunge to $0.21. If buying volume grows, HBAR could test $0.31 within weeks, adding up to 20%. Failure to hold the $0.24 average would flip sentiment and drag the coin back to the $0.21 line, slicing near 15%. Traders watch that balance as the next move takes shape.

The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.

The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.

XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.



XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”

Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it's working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.

Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.

Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends

Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.

One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that's just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse's commitment to expanding its utility. It's a big move that gives the community something to actually use.

As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.

With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won't last forever—so if you're interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.

 

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity

SOL has sprinted 19.16% in the last 7 days and 11.33% in the past month. Stretch the lens to 6 months and the gain grows to 52.48%. The coin now shifts between $183.88 and $220.07, well above its 10-day average of $206 and its 100-day average of $200.09. Momentum is hot, but the pace is starting to look stretched.

Traders eye $234 as the next ceiling. If buyers clear that line, the chart opens toward $270.32, about 24% higher than the top of today's band. The main floor sits at $161.75; a slip there would point to $125.56, roughly 32% under the high side of the current range. Strength gauges back up the bullish case, yet both the 74.67 RSI and 94.62 Stochastic hint at overbought conditions.

The recent record says buyers keep winning, so an advance to $234 looks doable. A clean break could lift SOL another 15-25% in the short run. Still, the crowded long side could spark a quick shakeout toward $162, a dip of around 12%. Net take: trend up, but expect a breather before the next jump.

Ethereum pushed higher again. The coin trades between $4245 and $5136 after jumping 13.92% in the past week and 19.87% over the month. It sits near its 10-day and 100-day averages around $4620, showing the rally still has a base. Six-month gains now stand at 101.15%.

Market signals stay friendly. The strength index reads 59.86, in the safe zone. The fast oscillator is high at 85.31, flagging strong demand, while momentum adds 24.52. If buyers stay active, the first barrier sits at $5492.31. A clean break there points to $6383, about 30% above the current band.

Support rests at $3710.13 and deeper at $2819.04. A dip to the first floor would shave roughly 20%; the second would cut near 40%. Given fresh double-digit gains and positive momentum, the path of least resistance is up. A push toward $5500 looks likely, and a sprint to $6400 cannot be ruled out once the market catches its breath.

LINK, HBAR, SOL, and ETH offer solid upside in the ongoing 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) couples sports passion with meme energy, eyeing 20,000% gains through a community-led, media-backed roadmap.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, led by Bill Pulte, took an unusual step by reducing the number of Federal Home Loan Bank board director seats at most of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, with the steepest reductions at institutions located in heavily-Democratic cities. 



Efforts under the Trump administration to roll back certain regulations and engage with the industry in less confrontational ways will be an opportunity for banks, but it's unclear just how much benefit they'll see.



A federal jury in Puerto Rico on Tuesday convicted Oluwasegun Baiyewu, 37, of Richmond, Texas, in a money-laundering conspiracy stemming from wide-ranging wire, mail and device fraud schemes that funneled illicit funds to Nigerian transnational organized crime groups through car part auctions.



The European Central Bank is considering a central bank digital currency powered by public blockchain, which would enable EU issuers to compete with U.S.-issued stablecoins. Europe's Central Bank recently released a progress report on a pending CBDC, saying more than 70 organizations are testing payment use cases, and ways to integrate a digital euro with mainstream payment systems.

A Sioux Falls hedge fund accused of bilking millions from investors in a cryptocurrency scheme is the subject of a multi-state criminal investigation being led by the FBI.

And earlier this month a federal judge presiding over an open civil case against Benaiah Holdings — and its principal officers, Benjamin Wiener and Christopher Hmielewski — froze the company's assets after finding merit in allegations it committed fraud with the allure of digital currency.

“The court has reviewed the facts and information provided to it and has determined that plaintiff has presented evidence of a potential fraud, that there is imminent danger of further dissipation of assets, and that Benjamin Wiener (“Wiener”) engaged in deceptive and misleading statements,” Federal District Court Judge Camela Theeler wrote in an Aug. 15 ruling that ordered the confiscation of Benaiah's assets.

Aug. 28 (UPI) -- Buenos Aires has allowed certain local taxes, vehicle registrations, driver's licenses and fines to be paid with cryptocurrency for the first time as part of an effort to position the Argentine capital as a leader in using digital currency.

""The goal is for the city to be a global leader in crypto. We already have the human capital, and now we are creating the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make compliance easier for taxpayers and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here,"" said Jorge Macri, chief of government of Buenos Aires, at the launch of the project.
The initiative, called Buenos Aires Cripto, includes measures to modernize the tax system, promote foreign investment and position the capital as a regional benchmark in the field.
""The digital economy requires us to update and adapt with a government that is modern, agile, efficient and smart,"" Macri said. He added that new tax measures are being introduced to give businesses a friendlier regulatory framework, including simpler tax filings and changes in how some taxes are calculated.

The shift reflects the fact that both companies and individuals use cryptocurrencies in daily life, including to receive payments from abroad.
As of 2024, about 10,000 Argentines were receiving salaries from abroad through crypto, PayPal or Brazil's central bank payment system, PIX. Buenos Aires also has more than 10 million crypto accounts, representing 22% of those opened in Latin America.
""The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Argentina is not new,"" said Carlos Torres, lead partner of the Payments Practice at consulting firm EY. He explained that the trend has been growing for several years as a result of Argentina's economic troubles.
""It has been driven mainly by inflation, economic instability and currency volatility, where cryptocurrency was seen as a refuge in the national context,"" he said.
Exchange platforms such as Binance and Lemon are widely used in Argentina, with Bitcoin leading as the main investment alternative.
Francisco Diaz, director of the business school at Universidad Mayor in Chile, said restrictions on the foreign exchange and international capital markets pushed Argentines to seek creative solutions for using foreign currency.
""Cryptocurrencies, particularly the more stable ones -- stablecoins -- have been widely adopted in recent years as a means of payment, a tool for receiving funds from abroad, for transactions and as a way to save in assets less exposed to inflation. That has expanded awareness and acceptance and fueled the growth of an ecosystem of entrepreneurs and companies tied to the crypto world,"" he said.

Analysts say the outlook is favorable for Buenos Aires to become a leading city in crypto.
""Given this context, I believe Argentina has all the conditions to expand the use of crypto, especially now that it has the regulatory framework launched in 2024,"" Torres said.
Argentina recorded the highest number of cryptocurrency users in Latin America in 2024, receiving $91.1 billion in assets, a 6.7% increase from 2023, according to the State of the Crypto Industry 2024 report by Lemon.
Globally, India ranked first, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines, according to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.
""India stands out because of the size of its population, its widespread knowledge of technology and the broad use of the Internet and mobile devices, which create favorable conditions for developing this ecosystem,"" Torres said.
The use of virtual currencies brings benefits but also opens the door to crimes such as money laundering.
""The use of cryptocurrencies reduces transaction costs and makes it easier to create new financial instruments, but it also increases the risks of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering,"" Diaz said.
Recently, Argentina's Office of Economic Crime and Money Laundering reported a rise in the use of digital assets and virtual platforms to launder illicit funds or justify profits, mainly from drug trafficking.

The problem, Diaz warned, is that innovation is moving faster than regulation.
""It is the responsibility of governments and regulatory institutions, such as central banks, to create a framework that ensures transparency, traceability and cybersecurity. Digital technologies such as blockchain can facilitate traceability,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Exclusive: Crypto startup M0 raises $40 million to build out stablecoin network","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/28/m0-series-b-40-million-polychain-ribbit-capital-stablecoins/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 12:45:00 GMT","

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Another stablecoin startup has raised serious cash. M0, a company that develops stablecoin infrastructure, announced Thursday that it had raised $40 million in a funding round led by the crypto venture capital firm Polychain and the fintech investor Ribbit Capital. 

Other participants included the Endeavor Catalyst fund and existing investors like Pantera and Bain Capital Crypto. Luca Prosperi, cofounder and CEO of M0, declined to specify his startup's valuation. The Series B round was for equity and locked stashes of the startup's cryptocurrency, or tokens that can only be sold after a set time period. M0 has raised almost $100 million in capital so far.





“We cannot have 1,000 different Tethers and Circles,” Prosperi told Fortune, referring to the two largest issuers of stablecoins. “So what we did is create a layer where different issuers can come and connect and just ensure interoperability, liquidity among themselves.”





M0 is the latest startup to rake in funding from venture capitalists hungry for exposure to one of the buzziest sectors in crypto. 





Over the past year, the once niche asset, which is a cryptocurrency pegged to underlying holdings like the U.S. dollar, has become one of the shiniest objects in Silicon Valley. In June, Circle, the second largest stablecoin issuer next to Tether, went public in a blockbuster IPO that netted the company a market capitalization of now just over $30 billion. And in July, President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law, a bill that regulates and defines rules for the burgeoning stablecoin industry. 




The buzz has become so loud that Big Tech companies like Meta and Airbnb as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their businesses.





“Stablecoins are proliferating,” Josh Rosenthal, a general partner at Polychain, told Fortune. “This is one of the hotter areas within the market—within all of fintech, frankly,”





Proponents hope that the tokens will become the base layer of financial infrastructure and usher in cheaper, faster payments than bank wires or the international transfer system SWIFT. 





That ambition is partly why Prosperi called his startup, which aims to build what he calls the “layer zero of money,” M0. (That's not to mention that anything to the power of zero is one—just like the dollar value of one stablecoin, he said.)





A longtime finance industry veteran who worked at Morgan Stanley, among other institutions, Prosperi took a deep dive into stablecoins when he started advising MakerDAO, a project that issues a stablecoin controlled by a group of crypto investors, rather than a single entity. (Maker has since rebranded to Sky.)




In 2023, he teamed up with his cofounder Gregory Di Prisco, who also worked at MakerDAO, to launch M0. Their startup develops technology lower on the stablecoin tech stack than, say, the stablecoin company Bridge, which was recently acquired by Stripe.





M0 is building a network on which stablecoin issuers can deploy their tokens and not worry about the nitty gritty software decisions that go into transferring assets across blockchains like Ethereum or Solana or changing, say, Circle's token into PayPal's.  





For the time being, Prosperi isn't focused on making his company profitable. Just like Uber, which first expanded its operations across the U.S. before it paid attention to revenue, M0 aims to onboard as many stablecoin issuers onto its network as possible. That includes the crypto wallet MetaMask, which recently announced the launch of its stablecoin in partnership with M0.





“My mandate as a CEO in the next two to five years is to scale this network as much as possible,” said Prosperi. “This is the obsession.”

Bitcoin BTC$112,020.86 is trading too cheap relative to gold as its volatility falls to historic lows, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Thursday.

The bank highlighted that bitcoin's six-month rolling volatility has dropped from nearly 60% at the start of the year to about 30% today, the lowest on record. 

With volatility converging toward gold, the world's largest cryptocurrency is now only twice as volatile, the lowest ratio on record, the report noted.

JPMorgan argued that the digital asset is increasingly attractive for institutional portfolios. 

On a volatility-adjusted basis, bitcoin's market cap would need to rise 13%, implying a price of about $126,000, to match gold's $5 trillion in private investment. By the bank's models, bitcoin is currently undervalued by around $16,000 versus gold, suggesting room for upside.

Analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou linked the move to accelerating purchases by corporate treasuries, which now hold more than 6% of total supply, echoing how central bank quantitative easing once dampened bond volatility.

Corporate adoption is gaining momentum through equity index inclusion, drawing passive capital inflows, the analysts said.

Metaplanet (3350), for instance, was upgraded into FTSE Russell's mid-cap category and added to global benchmarks, while Nasdaq-listed Kindly MD (NAKA) is raising up to $5 billion after a $679 million bitcoin buy. 

New entrants like Adam Back's firm are also aiming to rival MARA Holdings' (MARA) treasury position behind Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), the report added.

 The US government announced on Tuesday that it is publishing economic data onchain to boost transparency for government spending. 

The US government has tapped Chainlink and Pyth, two blockchain oracle providers, to publish economic data onchain.

Chainlink was selected to provide data feeds from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and will publish additional data feeds in response to consumer demand or at the behest of the US government, a Chainlink spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

These feeds include real gross domestic product (GDP), personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, and real final sales to private domestic purchasers, the company said.

Pyth was also selected by the Department of Commerce to be a publisher of gross domestic product (GDP) data — the total economic output in a year — according to an announcement Thursday.

Publishing government data onchain is part of the Trump administration's plan to make government spending more transparent in a bid to improve accountability and make the US a “world capital” of crypto.

Bringing government economic data onchain will provide positive benefits to spot crypto markets, a Chainlink spokesperson said.

These include automated trading strategies that execute based on changing government data, real-time prediction markets for macroeconomic developments and risk-management strategies for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Stablecoins, tokenized government bonds, perpetual futures contracts, real-world tokenized assets (RWAs) and other digital financial instruments reliant on macroeconomic inputs also stand to benefit from onchain government economic data.

Proposals to bring public spending data and other macroeconomic figures onchain are currently fomenting in the Philippines, the United Kingdom and El Salvador. 

The price of Pyth (PYTH) surged by nearly 70% on the news, and LINK (LINK) posted modest gains of over 3% before falling back to about $25.

LINK has rallied by about 61% since the start of August, going from a low of about $15.43 per token to the current price level.

This new propulsion system could rewrite the rules of spaceflight—not to mention completely defy conventional physics.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 2001, British Electrical Engineer Roger Shawyer first introduced the “impossible drive,” known as the EmDrive. It was called “impossible” because its creator purported that the drive was reactionless, meaning no propellant required—in other words, it defied the known laws of physics (specifically, the conservation of momentum). 

As with anything that appears to thumb its nose at Newton and Einstein, scientists raised more than a few eyebrows, and two decades of testing eventually boiled down to an inevitable (and somewhat predictable) conclusion in 2021: the EmDrive was bunk. But that's the nature of the scientific method—take a seemingly impossible idea, put it through rigorous testing, and hopefully get to an unassailable conclusion (or new discoveries that lead in other directions). 

The not-based-in-physics dream of a propellant-less machine, however, didn't die with the EmDrive. Instead, a new challenger approaches, and this one has a former NASA scientist backing it up. 

While at NASA, Charles Buhler helped establish the Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center in Florida—a very important lab that basically ensures rockets don't explode. Now, as co-founder of the space company Exodus Propulsion Technologies, Buhler told the website The Debrief that they've created a drive powered by a “New Force” outside our current known laws of physics, giving the propellant-less drive enough boost to overcome gravity. 

“The most important message to convey to the public is that a major discovery occurred,” Buhler told The Debrief. “This discovery of a New Force is fundamental in that electric fields alone can generate a sustainable force onto an object and allow center-of-mass translation of said object without expelling mass.” 

Buhler stressed that this work is unaffiliated with NASA, and that he recently presented his findings at the Alternative Propulsion Energy Conference (APEC), which is a club of engineers and enthusiasts eager to find ways to overcome the limitations of gravity and physics—and not always with the most scientifically sound methods.  

In an interview with APEC's co-founder Tim Ventura, Buhler explained how his background in electrostatics led to the discovery. He says his team—made up of people from NASA, Blue Origin, and the Air Force—investigated propellant-less drives for decades before arriving at electrostatics. For years, their devices produced negligible thrust, but saw increases with each new iteration. This culminated in 2023, when this “New Force”-powered drive generated enough thrust to overcome Earth's gravity. 

“Essentially, what we've discovered is that systems that contain an asymmetry in either electrostatic pressure or some kind of electrostatic divergent field can give a system of a center of mass a non-zero force component,” Buhler told The Debrief. “So, what that basically means is that there's some underlying physics that can essentially place force on an object should those two constraints be met.”

Obviously Buhler's claims are pretty “woah, if true,” but the history of propellant-less drives is filled with seemingly positive results that are eventually dashed upon the rocks of scientific reality. For the EmDrive, hopes for the device skyrocketed after NASA's Eagleworks team, which is dedicated to investigating new forms of propulsion (i.e. warp drives), claimed to measure thrust from the “impossible” drive in 2016. However, subsequent studies—including an exhaustive (no pun intended) one at the Dresden University of Technology—found zero thrust. 

Before any alternative propulsion enthusiasts should start popping corks, rigorous, third-party research will have to verify the results again and again. While it's not impossible that Buhler et. al stumbled across some unknown quirk of physics, it's an extremely unlikely outcome. 

For now, let's call it an “improbable engine.”

Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague. 

“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.

The dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time. 

Jane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England's most evocative historic monuments.” 

The Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country's Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds. 

The current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287. 

And since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower's previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you're buried closer to the church, you're more important, and if you're buried inside the church, you're much, much more important, and if you're buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.

Known burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.  

“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower's community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University's School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals' lives.” 

The analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time. 

The second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.

“I'm looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”

Along with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn't usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them). 

“At the moment we've got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it's going to be really exciting to see whether we've picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”

Malty, hoppy or fruit-forward? Just as beers come in different flavours, so do beer enthusiasts. That's according to researchers who found that beer drinkers tasting a series of lagers fall into two distinct categories: those who prefer strong flavour chemicals and those who prefer mellow ones.

The team reported its findings on 18 August at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC.

How we taste sweetness: long-sought structure of human receptor mapped at last

When taste-testing a new beer, researchers tend to rely on trained panelists who can pick out citrus or floral notes in the same way a sommelier can with wine. Devin Peterson, a food scientist at the Ohio State University in Columbus, wanted to go beyond the professionals, to learn what the average beer enthusiast is drawn to, for a better “understanding of what's driving consumer behaviour”, he told Nature. 

So he and his colleagues tasked about 135 self-proclaimed beer enthusiasts with trying 18 different lagers across 3 tasting sessions and rating them. To level the playing field, the team ensured that the competing beers contained similar percentages of alcohol and had somewhat similar levels of bitterness. Participants evaluated characteristics such as the beers' sweetness and aroma intensity, and the researchers used mass spectrometry to determine each beer's predominant flavour chemicals.

The tasters split into two factions on the basis of their beer rankings, the team found. For the group that preferred stronger flavours, brands such as Samuel Adams and Brooklyn were at the top of the list, and Budweiser was near the bottom. Those who enjoyed a mellower-tasting beer placed the same brands in nearly opposite spots. The two groups are “polar opposites in how they're responding to the product”, Peterson said during the presentation.

Sample preparation remains a bottleneck for protein structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy. A frequently encountered issue is that proteins adsorb to the air–water interface of the sample in a limited number of orientations. This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions, or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.

Since the resolution revolution, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has greatly expedited the process of protein structure determination1,2. Advances in instrumentation and single-particle analysis now routinely enable high-resolution reconstructions for a wide range of proteins and protein complexes3,4,5,6. However, sample preparation issues have remained a major bottleneck7. In particular, one common challenge involves preferred particle orientation8,9,10. When the sample solution is applied to the cryo-EM specimen support, the hydrophobic regions of the protein surface adsorb to the air–water interface, so that only a limited number of viewing directions are present after vitrification. Strong preferred orientation limits the resolution of a single-particle reconstruction along certain viewing directions and can even make it difficult to obtain a reconstruction at all11.

Although several strategies can address preferred orientation issues, no universal solution has been found. Tilting the sample provides a wider range of particle views, but usually results in larger beam-induced motion, an increased ice thickness in the viewing direction and a defocus gradient across the viewing area12,13. Preferred orientation can be reduced by covering the air–water interface with detergents or small proteins to block adsorption of the particles of interest14,15. Moreover, different specimen supports, such as graphene, graphene oxide or other functionalized surfaces, can prevent some particles from diffusing to the interface16,17,18,19,20. However, adopting such strategies often requires time-consuming reoptimization of the sample preparation procedure. Adsorption at the air–water interface can also be minimized by limiting the time between sample application onto the specimen support and vitrification21,22,23,24,25,26. Although this interval can be shortened to a few milliseconds, particles generally diffuse to the interface within a few microseconds. Substantially faster preparation speeds would therefore be required to prevent the majority of particles from reaching the interface. Finally, machine-learning techniques have been developed to guess missing views27,28,29. However, such approaches cannot replace actual experimental observations.

We have previously observed that flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples with microsecond laser pulses reduces preferred orientation for some large, highly symmetric particles30,31,32. Flash melting seems to exert small forces on the proteins, altering their orientation and resulting in an uneven spatial distribution after revitrification, with particles clustering together in some areas30,32. High-resolution reconstructions suggest that the revitrification process preserves particle integrity and does not impose a fundamental limit on the obtainable spatial resolution30,33. However, the practicality of using flash melting to address preferred orientation and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we show that this effect extends to smaller proteins, as well as particles with lower symmetry. We also introduce two variants of the experiment that provide larger changes in preferred orientation for some proteins and that allow us to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

Our experimental approach is illustrated in Figure 1a (refs. 30,32,34,35). A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with 20-µs or 30-µs rectangular laser pulses, where the laser power is kept constant for the pulse duration (Fig. 1b). This causes some particles to detach from the air–water interface and change their orientation. Once the laser beam is switched off, the sample cools in just a few microseconds and revitrifies35,36, trapping the proteins in a non-equilibrium angular distribution (Fig. 1a). We performed in situ flash-melting experiments following previously described protocols, using a transmission electron microscope that we have modified for time-resolved experiments37,38. The sample is locally flash melted by aiming the laser beam (532 nm wavelength, 28-µm diameter spot size in the sample plane) at the center of a grid square of the holey gold specimen support (1.2 µm holes, 1.3 µm apart on 300-mesh gold). Typically, an area of 9–16 grid holes is revitrified. The samples are then transferred to a high-resolution electron microscope for imaging (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9–12 and Supplementary Table 1).

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse, which scrambles the orientation of the particles. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, trapping the particles in a non-equilibrium angular distribution. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape. c–f Reconstructions, with the applied symmetry noted in parentheses, and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), 50S ribosomal subunit (d), HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (e) and hemagglutinin (f). The SCF*, which is a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, as well as the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, as judged by the quality of the map.

Figure 1c demonstrates that flash melting reduces preferred orientation for a sample of the T20S proteasome. A reconstruction from a conventional sample is shown at the top, together with the angular distribution of the particles. It exhibits a series of maxima that arise from the T20S proteasome's strong preference to adsorb to the air–water interface on its side, resulting in sparse population of particles in the top views. Upon revitrification (bottom), the angular distribution broadens noticeably, with a larger fraction of the particles populating the less-favored views. At the same time, the sampling compensation factor (SCF*), a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, improves from 0.89 to 0.95. The SCF* takes values between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to a perfectly isotropic angular distribution5,39,40.

An even greater reduction in preferred orientation can be achieved for the 50S ribosomal subunit. Unlike the highly symmetric T20S proteasome (point group D7), the asymmetric 50S ribosomal subunit (C1) exhibits strong preferred orientation (Fig. 1d). In a conventional sample, the angular distribution features a small number of pronounced maxima, with many views absent altogether (white) and a low SCF* of 0.42. Upon revitrification, most of the missing views become populated, and the SCF* improves to 0.74. At the same time, the streaky artefacts that are visible in the reconstruction from the conventional sample and that are the result of preferred orientation disappear (Supplementary Fig. 5)41. Flash melting can also improve the angular distribution of much smaller proteins, such as the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (210 kDa), for which the SCF* increases from 0.89 to 0.99 (Fig. 1e). Among these examples, a noticeable gain in resolution is observed only for the 50S ribosomal subunit, the only protein for which the preferred orientation is so pronounced that many views are not populated at all. For the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein, the resolution slightly decreases. This seems to be largely due to astigmatism in the micrographs recorded for the revitrified sample.

Laser flash melting seems to be less efficient at reducing preferred orientation for proteins that are more strongly bound to the air–water interface. Hemagglutinin (170 kDa) exhibits a preference for top and bottom views (Fig. 1f). Although revitrification depopulates particles in the bottom views, the overall angular distribution remains similar, with the SCF* slightly decreasing from 0.60 to 0.56. This suggests either that flash melting detaches only a few proteins from the interface or that detached particles return to their preferred orientation rapidly after diffusing to the surface. Both explanations indicate that there is a strong interaction between hemagglutinin and the air–water interface. For the proteins studied here, diffusion to the interface is expected to occur in just a few microseconds, which is shorter than the duration of the experiment (30 µs).

Experiments with shaped microsecond laser pulses provide clues about the mechanism through which the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. We have previously shown that cryo-EM samples partially crystallize during flash melting with rectangular laser pulses35,42. This led us to speculate whether the transient formation of crystallites, which preferentially form at the sample surface43, might exert small forces on the particles, leading to their detachment and reorientation30. We test this hypothesis by melting samples with shaped laser pulses that feature an intense 1-µs initial spike and ten times the laser power (Fig. 2a,b)44. This increases the heating rate during flash melting to about 2 × 108 K s−1, twice the critical heating rate of 1 × 108 K s−1, so that the sample does not crystallize44. If crystallization was the dominant mechanism for reshuffling the particle orientations, we would expect the angular distribution to barely change under these conditions. Contrary to our expectation, flash melting with such a shaped laser pulse decreases preferred orientation even more drastically for the 50S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). The SCF* increases from 0.18 to 0.90 in revitrified areas of the sample, and the map resolution improves markedly, from 4.1 Å to 2.9 Å. Of note, the angular distribution of the sample is different from that in Figure 1d, despite both being prepared using the same procedure. This suggests that the interaction of the particles with the interface is very sensitive to preparation conditions and can be easily altered.

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a shaped 30-µs laser pulse that features an intense leading edge. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, and the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. b, Schematic of the laser pulse shape, which features an intense spike at its onset (1-µs duration with the laser power increased ten-fold). c,d, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the 50S ribosomal subunit (c) and hemagglutinin (d). The SCF* and the resolution of the reconstructions are shown below the maps. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

Clearly, transient crystallization of the sample cannot be the dominant mechanism for particle reorientation. Instead, the effect appears to intensify with increased heating rates, suggesting several possible mechanisms. Impulsive laser heating of a thin, suspended membrane, such as the holey gold film of the specimen support, induces drumming motions that typically persist on microsecond timescales45,46. With the larger initial heating power of the shaped laser pulses, such oscillations likely reach a larger amplitude and exert greater forces on the thin liquid film in which the particles are suspended. This could allow them to detach from the air–water interface more readily and reorient. The impinging laser beam also deforms the thin liquid film directly through the radiation forces47. Additionally, it is also conceivable that some particles detach from the interface owing to the evaporation of the liquid sample in the vacuum of the electron microscope42. Simulations indicate that, during the initial spike of the shaped laser pulse, the sample temperature briefly increases by about 25 K (Supplementary Fig. 15). Because the evaporation rate increases exponentially with temperature48, this could cause more particles to detach. However, there are also changes in preferred orientation when samples are revitrified at atmospheric pressure, under which evaporation is substantially reduced33,49. It is therefore unlikely that evaporation is the dominant effect that causes particles to detach from the air–water interface. For hemagglutinin, even shaped laser pulses cannot reduce the amount of preferred orientation, although they induce some changes in the angular distribution (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 14).

Our experiments suggest that the changes in the angular distribution induced by flash melting are the result of two opposing processes. First, particles must be successfully detached from the air–water interface to reorient. But given enough time, they can then diffuse back to the interface and return to their preferred orientation. A simple experiment allowed us to detach all particles from the interface before laser melting the sample, disentangling both processes (Fig. 3a). We deposited a 20-nm-thick layer of amorphous ice onto both sides of the sample by introducing water vapor into the volume surrounding the specimen in our modified transmission electron microscope50. After flash melting the sample with a rectangular laser pulse (Fig. 3b), the particles all began at a distance from the interface, having lost all memory of where they used to be located. The angular distribution obtained after revitrification then exclusively reflects the result of the particles' free diffusion.

a, A 20-nm layer of amorphous ice is deposited in situ onto the cryo-EM sample before it is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies with the particle orientations redistributed. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape used. c–e, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), the 50S ribosomal subunit (d) and hemagglutinin (e). The sampling compensation factor (SCF*) and the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

When we revitrify a T20S proteasome sample after depositing a layer of amorphous ice, we obtain the angular distribution in Fig. 3c (bottom, Supplementary Fig. 3). The estimated rotational timescale of the particles (about 5 µs) is shorter than the timescale of the experiment, so one might expect that this should yield an isotropic distribution. Instead, the distribution closely resembles that obtained without prior deposition of amorphous ice (Fig. 1c) and notably features a preference for side views. This clearly indicates that the particles have diffused back to the interface, which occurs on an estimated timescale of only about 4 µs, and have partially settled into their preferred orientations. The striking similarity of the angular distribution to that in Figure 1c suggests that both are the result of the free diffusion and partial readsorption of the particles. It therefore appears likely that, even without prior deposition of amorphous ice, the laser pulse efficiently detaches the T20S proteasome particles from the interface.

Flash melting of a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit, following the deposition of amorphous ice, similarly results in a broad angular distribution with a small degree of preferred orientation, indicating that some particles have readsorbed to the interface (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6). The SCF* increased from 0.42 to 0.90. Curiously, however, the distribution substantially changed, featuring maxima at orientations that were previously only sparsely populated. This suggests that the interaction between the particles and the interface was altered in our experiments. As discussed above, the preferential orientation of the 50S ribosomal subunit varies, even in conventional samples prepared under otherwise identical conditions (Figs. 1d and 2c), suggesting that the properties of the interface are easily modified. Sample transfer and handling could have introduced traces of surface-active compounds, thereby modifying the chemical composition of the interface. Additionally, the interaction between the particles and the surface could have been affected by the dilution of the buffer during our experiment. At the laser powers used, less material is evaporated than has been deposited, so that the sample thickness slightly increases overall. As shown in Figure 3e, we obtain a similar result for hemagglutinin (Supplementary Fig. 13). After amorphous ice deposition and revitrification, the particles show a substantial amount of preferred orientation, indicating that many have readsorbed to the interface. However, the prominent top views have been largely depopulated, whereas the bottom views now dominate the angular distribution.

Our experiments yield a simple picture of the competing processes that occur during laser revitrification. Flash melting detaches some particles from the interface (Fig. 4a,b), a process that becomes more efficient as the heating rate is increased. As these particles rotate freely, their orientations are scrambled, resulting in improved angular distribution. In a competing process, particles diffuse back to the interface (Fig. 4c) before the sample is revitrified (Fig. 4d), allowing some proteins to efficiently readsorb in their preferred orientation. This process generally is more efficient for small proteins because of their shorter diffusion times. It could be possible to improve the angular distribution of such proteins by reducing the duration of the laser pulse to below the diffusion timescale (a few microseconds), so that the particles do not have enough time to reach the interface. In some experiments, proteins readsorbed in a different preferred orientation, such as when we deposited a layer of amorphous ice prior to revitrification. Apparently, our experiment has altered the interfacial properties, making adsorption in new orientations favorable. This implies that it should be possible to purposely modify the interface before flash melting, for example through vapor deposition of a hydrophilic compound onto the cryo-EM sample. Upon laser melting, all particles should then desorb and randomize their orientation. Such experiments are currently underway in our lab51.

a, In a conventional cryo-EM sample, particles adsorb to the air–water interface in preferred orientations. b, Flash melting detaches the proteins from the interface, so that they are able to rotate freely. c, While the sample is liquid, many particles diffuse back to the interface, where some adsorb in their preferred orientation. d, The sample is revitrified and the ensemble is arrested in a non-equilibrium angular distribution.

Our experiments also provide a practical toolbox for addressing preferred orientation, with some proteins showing dramatic improvements in their angular distribution. For example, revitrifying a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit with shaped laser pulses improves the resolution by 1.2 Å under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 2c). To put this in perspective, 18 times as many micrographs of a conventional sample would be needed to achieve the same improvement. Reshuffling the particle orientations through laser flash melting can therefore provide considerable cost and time savings. Our method can be easily combined with other established approaches for addressing preferred orientation. Importantly, as a simple physical approach, flash melting does not require any time-consuming changes to the sample-preparation procedure, but can be easily integrated into existing workflows. As we have previously shown, cryo-EM samples can also be revitrified in an optical microscope equipped for correlative light and electron microscopy experiments33. This approach is technically less involved and might therefore be more accessible to other labs. It could also be integrated into vitrification devices, some of which already use an optical microscope to assess sample quality. Laser-melting experiments could be directly integrated into high-resolution electron microscopes at cryo-EM facilities. If a sample is found to exhibit preferred orientation during data acquisition, it could then be revitrified on the fly with little additional time.

Purified T20S proteasome (3.7 mg ml−1 in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM sodium chloride) and purified 50S ribosome52 (an optical density at 260 nm (OD260) of 40 per ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride) were gifts from A. Guskov, University of Gröningnen, and B. Beckert, DCI Lausanne respectively. The purified hemagglutinin sample (1 mg ml−1 in PBS pH 7.5) was purchased from MyBioSource (MBS434205). The cryo-EM samples of purified proteins were prepared by applying 3.5 µl of the sample solution to glow-discharged (0.25 mbar, 15 mA, 60 s) gold grids (UltrAuFoil, R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH). Surplus sample was removed by blotting for 2–4 s using a blot force of 10 in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, held at 20 °C, 100% relative humidity). The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (HIV-1 CH505TF Envelope SOSIP ectodomain)53 was generously provided by R. Henderson, Duke Center for HIV Structural Biology. The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (5 mg ml−1 in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol) was applied to glow discharged gold grids (Au-flat, 0.6 µm/1 µm hole diameter/pitch, 300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The sample was blotted with the minimum blot time that can be set (0 s). The conventional sample was blotted using a blot force of 10, whereas the revitrified sample was blotted using blot forces of 5 and 10. All samples were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen until experiments were carried out.

The revitrification experiments with rectangular laser pulses (Fig. 1) were performed in situ using a modified JEOL 2200FS transmission electron microscope equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS) and an in-column Omega energy filter38. The samples were loaded into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. The sample was melted and revitrified in the center of multiple grid squares (typically 80 – 100) through irradiation with microsecond laser pulses30,32,35. A 30-µs laser pulse was used for the 50S and HIV-1 samples, and a 20-μs laser pulse for the T20S sample. The hemagglutinin sample was revitrified with two 30-µs pulses with a 250-ms delay between the pulses. The laser pulses were generated by chopping the continuous output of a 532 nm laser (Ventus532, Laser Quantum) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic). The laser beam was focused to a spot size of 28 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum) in the sample plane, as determined by a knife-edge scan, and aligned to the center of the grid squares. The laser power was adjusted on the fly to keep the size of the revitrified region, typically 15–22 µm in diameter, approximately constant35. After revitrification, the grids were unloaded from the side entry holder and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection.

The revitrification experiments with shaped laser pulses (Fig. 2) were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)50,54,55. The plunge-frozen cryo-EM samples were inserted into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. Shaped laser pulses with an intense leading edge (1 µs initial spike at ten times the laser power) were generated by modulating the output of a continuous green laser (532 nm, Verdi Coherent) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic) that was controlled by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix AFG1062)44. The laser beam was focused to a spot of 38 µm FWHM in the sample plane, as determined by imaging the beam with a CCD camera placed in a plane conjugate to the sample plane. The laser power required for laser melting was determined by using ordinary rectangular pulses. The initial spike was then added to perform the revitrification experiment.

The experiments in Figure 3, in which the sample was revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)42,50,54,55. Amorphous ice was deposited by leaking water vapor into the volume surrounding the sample through a gas dosing valve50. The vapor enters the microscope through a stainless steel tube that terminates inside of the cold shield, in close proximity to the sample. To obtain a well-defined thickness, the deposition rate was first determined with the following procedure. A multilayer graphene sample on a gold specimen grid (UltrAu Foil, 600 mesh, R2/1) was cooled to about 100 K in an Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan). While amorphous ice was being deposited on the graphene sheet, the diffraction patterns of the growing ice layer were recorded. During the deposition, the intensity of the molecular diffraction pattern of the amorphous ice initially increased linearly but then leveled off and plateaued once the ice film was so thick that multiple and inelastic scattering became important. From the characteristic curve shape of the diffraction intensity as a function of deposition time, the deposition rate was then determined (typically 0.3 nm s−1)42,50, and the deposition time was adjusted accordingly (typically 74 s to deposit about 10 nm on each side of the sample, 20 nm total).

To perform the deposition and revitrification experiment, the cryo-EM sample was loaded into the microscope with a second Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan, approximately at 100 K). To begin the deposition, the shutter of the specimen holder was opened for the predetermined amount of time, before the shutter was closed to stop any further deposition of amorphous ice. The gas dosing valve was then closed, and the cryo shield surrounding the sample was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Once the pressure in the microscope column had dropped to below 5 × 10−5 Pa, the shutter of the cryo-transfer holder was opened, and the revitrification experiment was performed using rectangular laser pulses, as described above.

The T20S datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G3i, equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded as tiff images in super-resolution mode and binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV. The data were collected using a 100 µm objective aperture at a nominal magnification of ×130,000 during a 1.3-s exposure with a defocus range of –0.6 µm to –2.0 µm and a total dose of 67 e− Å−2.

The datasets were processed in cryoSPARC v4.4 and v4.5 (ref. 5). For the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, 3,479, 6,105 and 3,641 micrographs were collected, respectively. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion-correction and patch contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation before manual curation on the basis of CTF resolution estimation, ice thickness and total full-frame motion. Particles were initially picked with a blob picker with a diameter of 100–200 Å from 1,519, 2,287 and 2,255 high-quality micrographs for the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, respectively, and were then extracted with a box size of 512 px and down sampled to 128 px. After two rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classifications, the selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles assigned to the better resolved class were refined against the obtained volume in a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. The resulting volume was used to generate templates for template-based picking with a particle diameter of 150 Å. The particles were again extracted with a box size of 512 px, Fourier-cropped to a box size of 256 px, and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification. The selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with only one class, followed by homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and again directed into a homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. To ensure the comparability of the datasets obtained from the different experimental conditions, a low-pass-filtered volume (filtered to 30 Å) obtained from the conventional dataset was used as a reference input for homogeneous refinements for all the three datasets. Finally, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles.

The conventional, revitrified and deposited and revitrified 50S datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4 camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging facility in Lausanne, Switzerland. The videos were collected in eer format, with a 100 µm objective aperture inserted, at a nominal magnification of ×120,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.658 Å per pixel. Micrographs were collected with a defocus range of –0.4 µm to –1 µm using a total dose of 40 e− Å−2. The sample that had been revitrified with the shaped laser pulse and the corresponding conventional control were collected on a Titan Krios G3i, fitted with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded during a 1.2-s exposure at ×130,000 magnification, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.3255 Å in super-resolution mode. The data were binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å per pixel. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV and the objective aperture to 100 µm. The defocus used ranged from –0.4 µm to –1.6 µm, whereas the electron dose was 63 e− Å−2.

For the 50S datasets, 11,121, 6,174, 9,532, 7,416 and 7,725 micrographs were collected for conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified, conventional (control for shaped pulses) and shaped pulse revitrified, respectively. The micrographs were patch motion-corrected (40 fractions, no up-sampling), and patch CTF-estimated before being subjected to a manual curation in which low-quality micrographs, judged by CTF estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, were discarded. The selected 6,236, 5,870, 6,641, 3,485, and 5,227 high-quality micrographs were subjected to a blob picker with a particle diameter of 200–300 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 784 px and cropped to 392 px. After two rounds of 2D classification, selected particles were directed into an ab initio reconstruction with two to three classes. The particles from the best class were refined against the volumes from the best and worst class in one round of heterogeneous refinement. The selected particles from the heterogeneous refinement were directed into a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and refined through homogeneous refinement using C1 symmetry and a low-pass filtered volume from the conventional dataset as a reference. Ultimately, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles. Unlike the other reconstructions in this manuscript, the 50S ribosomal subunit maps were not sharpened to preserve the details in the flexible L1 stalk.

The HIV-1 datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 using a Falcon 4i camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were recorded in eer format using a magnification of ×96,000, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å per pixel. A total dose of 50 e− Å−2 was used and the defocus range was set to –1 µm to –2.4 µm.

For the conventional HIV-1 dataset, 2,614 micrographs were collected. For the revitrified dataset, data were collected from two different grids; from the first grid, 5,447 micrographs were collected; from the second, 5,081 images were recorded. All datasets were subjected patch motion correction, patch CTF estimation and a manual curation based on CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and the defocus range. Next, the particles were picked using a blob picker with a diameter of 100–150 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 480 px and down sampled to 240 px. The particles from the two revitrified datasets were combined before sorting in two rounds of two-dimensional classification. The selected particles were subjected to an ab initio reconstruction using two classes. Particles were further classified in three dimensions through two rounds of heterogeneous refinements, in which all selected particles from the first round of 2D classification were sorted against the good initial volume and five decoy classes, generated through the pre-mature termination of an ab initio reconstruction. The selected set of particles was then refined in a non-uniform refinement with C1 symmetry. Next, the particles were re-extracted at full box size, locally and globally CTF-refined before being directed into another non-uniform refinement, without dynamic masking and symmetry enforcement. Finally, 50,000 random particles were selected and again refined in a non-uniform refinement without dynamic masking using C1 symmetry and the filtered conventional volume as a reference, before being directed into an orientation diagnostics job.

The four hemagglutinin datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4i and a SelectrisX energy filter at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were collected in eer format at a magnification of ×165,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.732 Å. A total dose of 40 e− Å−2 was used for the conventional, revitrified and leading-edge revitrified and deposited and revitrified dataset, respectively. A defocus range of –0.8 µm to –2.5 µm and an energy filter slit of 10 eV was applied for all four datasets.

For the conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified and shaped pulse revitrified HA samples, 2,251, 6,476, 10,114 and 10,270 micrographs were collected. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation. The micrographs were manually curated on the basis of their CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, resulting in 1,651, 4,608, 7,982 and 8,590 high-quality micrographs. On 100 micrographs of each dataset, a denoiser was trained and subsequently applied to the curated micrographs. Particles were picked from denoised micrographs using a blob picker with a diameter of 80–140 Å. Next, the particles were extracted from the raw, non-denoised micrographs using a box size of 360 px, which was cropped to 180 px. The extracted particles were subjected to one to two rounds of 2D classification, followed by an ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles were then further cleaned up in one round of heterogeneous refinement using a decoy volume and the best-resolved ab initio volume as inputs. The sorted particles were then refined in a homogeneous refinement, before being re-extracted at full box size. Out of these, 50,000 random particles were selected and then subjected into a final homogeneous refinement with C3 symmetry, using the filtered conventional map as a reference, and an orientation diagnostics job.

The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and translocase of the inner membrane 23 (TIM23) complexes are coupled to control protein import across the outer and inner membranes, respectively. However, the mechanisms of protein recognition and sorting in the TOM–TIM23 pathway remain unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of a translocating polypeptide substrate captured in the active TOM–TIM23 supercomplex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the TOM complex, the polypeptide substrate adopts multiple conformations stabilized by hydrophilic residues from distinct regions of the Tom40 channel. In the TIM23 complex, the Tim17 and Mgr2 subunits create the translocation pathway, with a central restriction formed by four highly conserved hydrophobic residues. The substrate primarily interacts with hydrophobic residues along the Tim17–Mgr2 pathway. Substrate hydrophobicity modulates the association of Mgr2 with Tim17, enabling dynamic regulation of protein sorting toward either the matrix or membrane. These findings reveal a sophisticated translocation mechanism of the TOM–TIM23 supercomplex that ensures the efficient import of diverse mitochondrial proteins.

The restriction residues are colored green. b, Hydrophobicity distribution along the Tim17-Mgr2 translocation pathway. c, Charge distribution along the Tim17-Mgr2 translocation pathway. d, Surface presentations of the Sec translocon (PDB ID: 8RJC), shown in a side view (left) and a cutaway side view (right). The restriction (pore ring) residues are colored green. e, Hydrophobicity distribution in the Sec channel. f, Charge distribution in the Sec channel. g, Superimposition of the restriction residues in the Tim17-Mgr2 pathway and the Sec channel. Tim17, Mgr2, and Sec (PDB ID: 6ITC) are colored brownish pink, gold, and grey, respectively. The restriction residues of Tim17-Mgr2 and Sec are shown as balls and sticks, and colored forest green and grey, respectively. h, The substrate exit site of Tim17-Mgr2. The translocation direction toward the β sheet of Tim44 is indicated by a black arrow. i, same as h, except showing the hydrophobicity distribution of the exit site. The polypeptide substrate is represented as a curved line.

a, Mapping of the substrate in the TIM23 complex. The substrate residues around the α1 and α2 regions of the B2 segments are mutated to Bpa. The supercomplexes are assembled in the yeast strain yLS420 transformed with the plasmids pLSP2-x that encode the photoactive substrates. The cells are subjected to UV irradiation, followed by Mgr2 pulldown. The substrate, Mgr2, and their crosslinking products are detected by immunoblotting against the StrepII tag (Mgr2) and Flag tag (substrate). Position 155 of the substrate outside the TIM23 complex is included as a negative control. b, Comparison of the substrate passing through the restrictions of Tim17-Mgr2 (left) and the Sec channel (right, PDB ID: 6ITC). Tim17 and Mgr2 are colored brownish pink and gold, respectively. The N-half and C-half of the Sec channel are colored sky blue and plum, respectively. The restriction residues are shown as balls and sticks with those from Tim17-Mgr2 in crystal blue and those from Sec in red. The substrate density is colored green. The distances between the restriction residues and the centers of the substrate density are labeled. c, Spot assays to examine the growth of yeast strains with point mutations of the substrate-interacting residues of Tim17. d, Same as c except with additional Mgr2 knockout. e, Tim17 mutant selection on 5-FOA plates. The yeast strains, yLS270, yLS280, and yLS290, are transformed with Tim17 mutation plasmid pLSA4-X and selected on 5-FOA plates. The mutants that could not grow during selection are shown. f, Import of the metabolite carrier GGC1 via the TIM22 pathway into mitochondria with mutations of the restriction residues in Tim17. The imported and correctly folded GGC1 is detected as a ~ 100 kDa band in BN-PAGE 78.

Source data

a, Side chain orientations of all substrate residues from α2 of the modeled substrate during simulated translocation through the Tim17 groove in the presence (left) or absence (right) of Mgr2. This panel extends the analysis from Fig. 4c to include all substrate residues, providing a comprehensive view of their orientations. b, Initial model used for the MD simulations. The side chains of the substrate are labeled and shown as balls and sticks. c, MD simulations of the substrate-engaged TIM23 complex, demonstrating that the complex remains impermeable to water diffusion, irrespective of Mgr2's presence. Water molecules are depicted as red and white spheres. The orange spheres are the phosphorous atoms of lipids.

a, Scheme of the supercomplex assembly, showing two adjacent positions 135 and 139 of the substrate located in the TIM23 complex. Both positions are mutated to an amber codon for Bpa incorporation. b, Photo-crosslinking of the substrate with double Bpa sites. In wild type mitochondria, the double crosslinking product containing the substrate, Tim17, and Mgr2 could be detected. When Mgr2 is knocked out, no higher crosslinking bands above the “substrate x Tim17” band are observed.

Supplementary Tables 1–4.

MD simulations trajectories illustrating the translocation of a polypeptide substrate through the Tim17–Mgr2 pathway. The substrate was steered into the matrix (downward) by a pulling force in MD simulations. The polypeptide is depicted in green with side chains highlighted as balls and sticks. Mgr2 is shown in transparent yellow. Key hydrophobic residues of Tim17 and Mgr2 that interact with the substrate are shown as color-coded balls and sticks: orange, F65 of Tim17; lime, W68 of Tim17; purple, L12 of Tim17; deep pink, F67 of Mgr2; silver, F70 of Mgr2. Notably, the applied force was not constant and could be accumulated in certain polypeptide-trapped locations during simulations. This could result in uneven translocation rates of the polypeptide substrate.

Same as Supplementary Video 1, except that the substrate was pulled toward the IMS.

Same as Supplementary Video 1, except that the simulation was conducted without Mgr2.

Same as Supplementary Video 2, except that the simulation was conducted without Mgr2.

As the summer comes to an end, we're thinking about what unplugging—the ultimate luxury—looks like in 2025. With a growing slate of apps aiming to reduce our screen time and some tech leaders trying to reinvent the internet as it was, where are we heading? WIRED's features editor Jason Kehe joins us to discuss how as users we are now best positioned to take the power back.

Michael Calore: Hey, this is Mike. Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th in partnership with the local station, KQED. Lauren and I will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, and we'll have a special guest joining us for a conversation that you will not want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We cannot wait to see you there. Lauren, how you doing?

Lauren Goode: I am great. I made a little late-night purchase last night when I was browsing on the internet.

Michael Calore: You made a late-night purchase?

Lauren Goode: Mm-hmm. Do you want to know what it is?

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: It's not what Reese talked about before on this show.

Michael Calore: What is it?

Lauren Goode: I bought a Brick.

Michael Calore: You bought a brick?

Lauren Goode: Do you know what a Brick is?

Michael Calore: It's a thing that they use many of to build buildings.

Lauren Goode: Not that. It's a little silicone device that you attach to your fridge or some other surface in your home that's away from your bedroom, and then you tap your phone to it at night, and it automatically disables certain apps that you've preset it to. Then when you get into bed, you're not doomscrolling on your phone because you literally cannot access those apps. It's a physical block.

Michael Calore: It bricks your phone.

Lauren Goode: Bricks your phone.

Michael Calore: Well, that's cool.

Lauren Goode: I heard our colleague, Adrienne, talking about it a bunch, and I was like, “You know what? I'm going to do it.”

Michael Calore: What happens if there's an emergency?

Lauren Goode: You die. But you know what? You're not scrolling Instagram Reels when you do it.

Michael Calore: You wouldn't know because your phone ... It doesn't like that-

Lauren Goode: It's just bliss from ... Yes. You go to phone heaven.

Michael Calore: Well, that sounds very much on topic for today's show.

Lauren Goode: It is. I really think we should talk about this, because our phone addictions and our internet addictions are getting worse, and we've got to figure out the future.

Michael Calore: We do. Let's get started. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today, we are talking about the future of unplugging. Going off the grid, being offline, whatever you want to call it, it remains an aspirational goal for many of us. Apps like Opal and even physical devices like Lauren's Brick, which temporarily block distracting apps from your phone, are becoming increasingly popular. Here's the thing with these products, though. They still put a lot of the onus on us, the users, when, in fact, we're deeply locked into a much larger system that is designed to keep us completely attached to our technology. Technology is inescapable now, and we often read stories or report on them ourselves here at WIRED about people going back to flip phones or landlines or the entrepreneurs who are determined to revive some early-2000s era of the internet, which we'll get into. But our question for this episode is, who really in the future gets to unplug? Does unplugging just become the ultimate luxury? And how do the rest of us do it? I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture.

Lauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior correspondent.

Jason Kehe: And I'm Jason Kehe, features editor and all-around Übermensch.

Michael Calore: Thank you for being here, Jason.

Lauren Goode: Jason is in the middle of closing the print issue of our magazine, which just means the next two weeks are very hectic, and we really had to twist his arm to come into studio today. We are super appreciative of this.

Jason Kehe: And surely our beloved listeners have been clamoring for my return to the podcast.

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: They have. Emails every-

Jason Kehe: And for them, at least, I'm happy to be here.

Michael Calore: And thank you for unplugging and coming into the room with us. I want to start off by putting our cards on the table. What is everybody's daily average phone screen time, to the best of your knowledge?

Jason Kehe: I actually checked this recently, and I'm so pleased to report mine is under an hour a day.

Michael Calore: Wow.

Jason Kehe: I was in the company of, I think, three other people. One was at three hours, one at five, and another at nine. I, of course, won that-

Lauren Goode: Wait. Do you mean less than an hour on social media?

Jason Kehe: I checked the digital wellness setting or whatever it is, and it said average 59 minutes for everything, and it showed me 20 minutes on email, seven minutes on text, or whatever it was. Yes, that is my daily average.

Michael Calore: How does that compare to yours, Lauren?

Lauren Goode: I'm stunned. I don't even know what to say. Well, I originally was going to say I refuse to answer this question, Mike, not because I don't love you both, but I just feel no one really cares about my screen time. Mostly, it's because I feel what matters more is how crappy I feel after I have spent too much time scrolling Instagram and other social media sites. It's a qualitative analysis, not quantitative.

Jason Kehe: But what is the quantitative number?

Lauren Goode: I don't know. Hours. Hours holistically, not just social media, of course, because I'm constantly reading online, and I'm constantly texting, and I'm constantly texting with sources. Not just friends and my mom, but actual sources on multiple messaging apps. It's a lot. What about you, Mike? How much time are you online?

Michael Calore: A little over two hours a day.

Lauren Goode: I am going to look it up. Oh, my God.

Jason Kehe: What is it? What is it?

Lauren Goode: Oh, my God.

Jason Kehe: On-air reveal.

Lauren Goode: Eight hours and 43 minutes.

Jason Kehe: Incredible.

Michael Calore: What? Daily average? That is a lot of time.

Lauren Goode: It's mostly Safari, Slack, and messages, which tracks.

Jason Kehe: But back to the conversation I was having with friends recently about our screen time, the one who was at nine hours, the closest to you, was weirdly the most at peace with her phone use. I just recently subscribed to the print edition of the San Francisco Chronicle so that I don't have to look at news on my phone. I'm really in an unbundling. I think we should disaggregate our technological lives. The phone wants to be everything, but what if you just re-atomize your life into dedicated experiences and devices? Buy an alarm clock. Buy a GPS for your car. Subscribe to a newspaper.

Michael Calore: These are things that a lot of people are actually doing as solutions to the problem of spending too much time on their phone, when, in fact, they were just what we did before we had phones. My screen time used to be a lot worse. I took active measures to curb it, and then I have this new thing now where, whenever I'm eating a meal or watching a television show or something, I just turn my phone upside down, and it automatically silences notifications, puts it to sleep, and basically puts it into Do Not Disturb mode. And then when I want to, I can pick it up.

Lauren Goode: You are also one of the few people I know, Mike, who actually abides by those time limits that you set on Instagram. Sometimes I'll send you a meme, and you'll say, ""I'll check it later because I hit my limit.""

Michael Calore: I use the digital well-being settings on the Android phone to give myself 15 minutes of Instagram a day.

Lauren Goode: But I agree with what Jason's saying, because what you're describing, Mike, that is a very early 2020 solution. And we are WIRED. And what is the future of unplugging? Is it this disaggregation, as you put it? Because it's acknowledging we're not actually going to unplug. We're each going to have our own sort of approach to it. How do we actually build a life then that feels meaningful in all of the different compartments of the ways we use the internet?

Michael Calore: I have an answer. You buy a piece of technology to get you off of your technology.

Lauren Goode: Like Brick.

Michael Calore: Jason-

Lauren Goode: Jazz hands.

Michael Calore: ... you had a flip phone for an experiment for a number of months.

Jason Kehe: Yes. This was way back in 2018, I want to say.

Michael Calore: This was before the pandemic-

Jason Kehe: It was a full year, but yes.

Michael Calore: And, Lauren, you went out and bought the Brick?

Lauren Goode: I did. Hasn't arrived yet, but I'm so excited.

Michael Calore: There's also the Light phone, and there's other products like it. I think Punkt made one for a while, but basically it's a phone that works as a phone and looks like a smartphone, but it has very limited features. You can do things that you need a phone for, but very little else. I'm just curious about the Brick and about other apps that you've tried. I know there's an app called Opal that a lot of people have been using. Lauren, what is your experience with these things?

Lauren Goode: I haven't used Opal.

Jason Kehe: Nor have I. In fact, I think I kind of philosophically oppose the entire idea of using apps to get off apps or using technology to get off technology.

Michael Calore: I have to say that the apps to get you off of your apps have been very successful for me. I have used a couple of these things like the digital well-being timers on Android. Clearspace is another one that helps you get all the clutter off of your phone and keep it away from you, and it's been helpful for me.

Jason Kehe: But I guess my bigger problem is that I do think modernity has sort of conspired against the human will to perpetuate these conversations about the addictiveness of phones is to totally remove the fact that we are human beings capable of making decisions from the equation. And I don't think it's as hard as people want to believe in as the tech press, to a large degree, has contributed to. I resist these conversations, because I think, whether or not you're saying phones are addictive, the mere fact of you saying it adds to their power and their grip and their hold over our lives, and we think our connection to them is inevitable and unbreakable.

Lauren Goode: I'm so glad we brought you on today. No, I'm genuinely glad, though. Here's my thing, is that I think we've become beta testers. There's this promise right now from the purveyors of technology that agentic AI is going to start doing some of these tasks for us. I won't spend an hour shopping because I'm going to put in a prompt what I need, and then it's going to order it for me. In the meantime, that requires so much babysitting and so much hand holding and so much authentication and all these handshakes between apps and stuff. It's going to be that way for a while. It's still just sucking us in further with this promise that it's going to make our lives easier. In the meantime, we're mired in it.

Jason Kehe: AI will eventually kill the phone or at least our understanding of what a phone is right now.

Lauren Goode: Tell us about that, then. What does that future look like?

Jason Kehe: Well, if you look around at the ways people are engaging with AI now, I'm noticing that when I'm with friends, and someone wants to ask ChatGPT a question, for instance, they hit the side button on their iPhone, which is reprogrammed to launch Chat's voice, and then they talk to it directly. You kind of want to have a conversation that's faster than you can type it. I just think that's going to come for everything.

Michael Calore: That's an interesting observation, because what we're talking about is all of the companies that are trying to get us away from technology by introducing barriers between us and the technology. This thing you put on your fridge. These apps that shut down your apps after a certain period of time. These are all things that are barriers to the technology that's harming you. But what you're talking about, Jason, is a complete erosion of the barrier. Just take the phone out of the equation, and all of a sudden it just becomes you and the cloud.

Jason Kehe: Yes. It's amazing to me that people speak of phones as if they are permanent. They will come and go, as all technology does. The promise of tech, if it is a kind of seamlessness. The phone is all kinds of barriers. Maybe I'm kind of going back on my original position that friction benefits us in some ways because the phone, I do think, provides some degree of it.

Michael Calore: Well, we do need to take a break. And when we come back, we're going to talk about the internet. We're going to expand beyond just phones, and we're going to talk about how bad the internet is for us.

Jason Kehe: Fun.

Michael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Today, we're talking about brain rot. In the first half of the show, we talked about how terrible our phones are for us and why they're probably all going away very, very soon and being replaced by AI, as Jason outlined. In the second half, we're going to talk about the internet at large because parts of the internet are amazing, of course, but there is still just so much toxicity online, and fixing it feels like a tall order, but it has not stopped some tech leaders from trying. One of those tech leaders is Alexis Ohanian, the cofounder of Reddit. Earlier this year, he announced that he was partnering with his former competitor, Kevin Rose, to relaunch Digg. That's D-I-G-G with two Gs. It's a social media platform from the early 2000s that was very similar to Reddit. Our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, recently spoke with Ohanian for the first Big Interview episode of this Uncanny Valley podcast, which you should all listen to. It's in your feeds. Alexis shared that he wanted this new version of Digg to be way less toxic compared to the other social media platforms. Lauren, I know you have thoughts about this.

Lauren Goode: I don't know how I feel about this. On the one hand, I love Reddit. I do love those spaces in the internet that feel lightly or genuinely moderated and also provide some kind of niche value for the thing that you're looking for. Twitter has obviously changed so much in the past few years. I love the idea of some kind of revival of Digg and another healthy space in the internet. I just don't see how this gains a ton of traction.

Jason Kehe: Has something like this ever worked when someone's tried to bring back quote-unquote early-internet-glory-day site?

Michael Calore: Bluesky is a possible example, because Bluesky launched as the big open source, decentralized alternative social media network, and it got the influx of users after the 2024 presidential election when a bunch of people just didn't want to be associated with X or Elon Musk anymore. And it feels like blue state/red state vibes now, but it does feel like there's a toxicity that exists on X that does not exist on Bluesky.

Lauren Goode: Amendment.

Michael Calore: Yes?

Lauren Goode: When I published the story about vibe coding, which we talked about on last week's episode, there were just a lot of really strong opinions, capital O, on Bluesky. Most often, I think, from seasoned coders, developers, programmers who had a lot to say about the possibility of vibe coding leading to really low-quality code bases in the future and just creating a lot of bugs and breaches, even ... And they're not wrong. It was such a strong response. And then people who just kind of jumped to, ""You are an AI booster,"" and really kind of angry skeets, tweets, whatever we're calling them.

Michael Calore: Wow.

Jason Kehe: And the early internet was, to use your guys' word, toxic too. I don't know where we're even going back to or what we think we're moving toward, but Bluesky seems to me just as yucky as anyplace else.

Lauren Goode: It just feels so insulated.

Michael Calore: It is. It's an echo chamber. It's a liberal-leaning echo chamber. But, of course, as we know, your experience, and I'm sure other people have had experiences that are similar, where you say the wrong thing, or you step out of line, or you express an opinion that is not close enough to the majority opinion, and you just get excoriated.

Lauren Goode: Totally.

Michael Calore: Jason, to your point, the early internet was toxic as well, yes. I think we all remember chat rooms or forums in the early internet where you could just get completely roasted. But, it's amplified to a level now, where every platform has that on it, and I think that it's just overwhelming to too many people. In addition to that, you can't really go back to the way that the internet used to be. You can't have a nice internet unless you form a new community, and you say, ""The objective of this community is to be nice, and we have moderators, and we have block buttons, and we have all these mechanisms in place,"" and it will be very nice until it scales up and then it just inevitably turns toxic. So, I think there is an internet utopia community out there, and it's the first six months of any new cool app.

Lauren Goode: I disagree with the premise that it's going to happen in the way that the internet has scaled in the past. Like this idea that it scales and therefore becomes a cesspool. I actually think, at least I hope, the future of part of the internet is is that it's spaces with a lot of taste, for lack of a better word, and I do believe that that's how more and more people are curating their internet experience, but then there's this underlying cesspool of really low-quality, meme-ified, totally toxic information, and that part of the internet is actually very, very good at multiplying and sort of promulgating their ideas. That is also going to continue to exist.

Jason Kehe: Yes. I've started calling the thing you were formerly describing the prestige internet, and I would like to believe WIRED is part of that.

Lauren Goode: I think that a world exists in which someone can enjoy Emily Sundberg's “Feed Me” Substack as much as they enjoy Dylan Patel's “SemiAnalysis and the Semiconductor and AI Industry.” I read both, and what I like about them is that people are putting a lot of effort and thought and sort of doing mental gymnastics around what they want to say to their audience. I want to continue to see that internet thrive.

Michael Calore: I think that sounds lovely, and it's going to get a million pageviews. And then the guy who posts the video of ""How many Big Macs can I fit in my mouth at once?"" is going to get 80 million pageviews.

Jason Kehe: There will always be elevated media, to use Lauren's word, and then there's going to be everything else. But I do think, in a world of AI slop, there will be more effort on the part of most people to seek out some kind of quality experience.

Michael Calore: And, again, what you're talking about is putting the onus on the user. On the reader. On-

Jason Kehe: As it should be.

Michael Calore: ... the person to go out and find the things that are less toxic. And I think what these folks that we're talking about are trying to create is a platform where you don't have to do that extra work to find the happy place. The happy place is the platform itself. And maybe you have to find the work to get there, but then when you get there, you don't have to curate it for yourself. You don't have to join the right forums. You don't have to block the right people. You don't have to rely on moderators. It's just better all around because it's designed to be better.

Jason Kehe: But isn't the whole point of being a person in the world exactly that effort to find, seek out, discover? That's the pleasure of consumption, I think, finding something that you think is your own or is special in some way. I don't know if anyone actually wants to be fed some sort of externally curated list of quote-unquote high-quality content.

Michael Calore: I think a lot of people do.

Jason Kehe: When we were kids, didn't we take pride in finding stuff? We had to work our way toward it, and then we felt ownership of it. That still will always exist. Everyone has an impulse to be an individual, I think.

Michael Calore: I am in absolute agreement. I think that, once you have something like the internet at your fingertips, you're going to use it to find the things that you're interested in, and it's going to be there. There will be corners of the internet that we can hang out in that are happy places for us until the end of time.

Lauren Goode: I also think we may be making this bifurcation between what the kids are reading and what they're watching. I think it's a lot of watching in the future, and I don't think it's safe to say, just because the guy eating the hamburger video gets 80 million views, that the rest of the video consumption is ... There's also incredibly high-quality, curated, smart video stuff going on too.

Mike, you and I have had this conversation a few times about what it would look like if each of us felt like we'd kind of made it. We lived some life of leisure. And I joked that for me it was being able to have wallpaper in my home. Real wallpaper, not stick-and-peel. And you said, and I always think of this, that it's not having to carry your phone, wallet, or keys.

Michael Calore: Right. Nothing in your pockets.

Lauren Goode: Nothing in your pockets. And-

Michael Calore: Absolutely nothing.

Lauren Goode: ... that is because someone is carrying it for you, someone is managing that for you, because you don't need to even be on your phone.

Michael Calore: Right. You don't need a phone because you have a person for that. And you don't need a key because there's somebody waiting to let you into your home. The idea that you can just move around in the world with nothing in your pockets.

Jason Kehe: God, I love that.

Michael Calore: You never have to handle money. You never have to look at a bill to pay it, and you never have to text anybody back or set an appointment or do anything on a phone because somebody's doing that for you. That means that you have made it

Lauren Goode: These days, it just feels like paying rent and buying groceries in expensive cities means you've made it, but yes.

Jason Kehe: I leave my house without stuff in my pockets all the time. It's what I live to do, and it is as glorious as you say. How often do you guys leave the house without your phones?

Michael Calore: Never.

Lauren Goode: Oh, my gosh. Never.

Michael Calore: Never.

Jason Kehe: Try it.

Lauren Goode: I think what we're getting to is that the future of unplugging is actually the ultimate luxury. And Jason is saying ... Jason is doing the magazine article version of “Here's how to steal some of that luxury for yourself.”

Jason Kehe: I don't think it's the preserve of the wealthy to be able to disconnect, though that is, again, what people want us to believe, that the less well-off will be the ones who have to be constantly online and that the rich will be blissfully on an island without any technology, but I don't know how much I buy that, either. I do not have much money. A lot of people I know do not have much money, and yet they every day can live a life of glorious disconnection.

Michael Calore: The control is with the user.

Jason Kehe: Yes, it is. We have the power.

Lauren Goode: Well, Jason, when we're cohabiting, I'll make sure we have a nice reading room for us.

Jason Kehe: That's dreamy. But I knew you would bring up your marriage proposal. To listeners who don't know, Lauren's been proposing to me on and off for the better part of, I don't know, 10 years.

Lauren Goode: It's probably been about seven. Well, I don't know. I didn't propose to you when I was actually engaged.

Jason Kehe: Or did you?

Michael Calore: We could cut the tension with a knife. Let's take another break.

Well, thank you both for this candid and wide-ranging conversation about phone addictions, the rot of the internet, and the power being with the user. Thank you for being here, Jason.

Jason Kehe: My … I hesitate to say pleasure, but I will: My pleasure, Mike. And Lauren.

Michael Calore: We're not letting you go just yet, because we still have to do our recommendations. Lauren, do you want to go first?

Lauren Goode: I recommend a book. It's called The Ministry of Time. It's a 2024 fiction novel by Kaliane Bradley. This book's got everything. It's a spy thriller. It's romance. It's comedy. It's sci-fi. It's time travel. I will admit I have not finished it yet, but I plan to. I absolutely will finish this book. And I'm loving it. It's making me laugh out loud. It's just a nice little treat.

Michael Calore: Jason, have you read it?

Jason Kehe: No, but I've heard of it.

Lauren Goode: I can loan it to you afterward, if you want. I'll put it in our nook-

Jason Kehe: But, remember, I loaned you a book, and you still have it.

Lauren Goode: I know.

Jason Kehe: Months and months have passed-

Lauren Goode: I'm sorry. This has happened twice-

Jason Kehe: Marriage proposals-

Lauren Goode: I know. If I finish the books and get them back to you in a timely fashion, will you reconsider?

Jason Kehe: It's time for my recommendation, isn't it?

Michael Calore: Yes, it is.

Lauren Goode: See how well he evaded that?

Jason Kehe: Since I'm not a regular on the podcast, I wasn't able to talk up a quirky little movie I saw on Netflix called K-Pop Demon Hunters.

Michael Calore: Oh, no.

Jason Kehe: Which, yes, has now, I think, rightly turned into a global phenomenon. It's basically about K-pop saving the world. There's a girl group, and then there's a boy band of rival demons that they sort of have to slay. And at a time when K-pop is sort of known by many but not necessarily listened to by everyone, this movie comes along to make the case that it is a truly global and world-saving phenomenon. It's just a work of complete genius. Utterly convincing. And now I want to go to a K-pop concert.

Michael Calore: Nice.

Lauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?

Michael Calore: I am going to recommend a podcast. The podcast is called The War on Cars, and the episode is titled, “Should the Bus Be Free?” And it is about two weeks old. I just got around to listening to it, but it's pegged to the phenomenon of Zohran Mamdani, who is one of the candidates and the leading candidate to be mayor of New York City, who during his campaign said that, if he becomes mayor, he wants to make buses in New York fast and free. That leads to all kinds of questions: Like, can you make the bus free? How much does it cost to run the bus? When you do make the bus free, does it increase ridership? Who does it benefit? What are all of the knock-on effects of making that move in a big city?

The team on the podcast examines this from a research perspective, and they look at pilot programs and permanent programs that have run in other US cities and around the world, and they look at ridership numbers, and they talk through all the facts. It's really interesting to me to consider that, if there's something that you want in the world, and it feels impossible, like you want free health care, you want free college education, you want free transit in the city that you live in, and what does that look like? It's a really interesting thought experiment, and they do a great job on the show, so I want to recommend it. The War on Cars. Find it wherever you pod.

Jason Kehe: I don't pod. We should do another episode on why I consider podcasts the most dangerous medium today.

Michael Calore: Well, thank you for participating in this dangerous display of knowledge and opinion.

Jason Kehe: I'm telling you, it took a lot to get me here.

Michael Calore: All right. Well, thank you for sitting with us this week.

Lauren Goode: Thanks, Jason.

GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter, and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory.

A new report from local venture capital firm Madrona features three Seattle-based startups among the top 40 private artificial intelligence companies globally.

The annual Intelligent Applications 40 (IA40) list provides an overview of the leading startups that are integrating AI into business solutions.

To compile the list, more than 70 VC investors from 54 firms nominated more than 340 private companies. These investors then voted on a short list of finalists, and the results were combined with PitchBook's “Venture Exit Predictor Tool” to produce the final ranking.

The ranking, co-authored by Madrona, features a significant turnover rate with 27 new companies on the list, reflecting a rapid pace of innovation. The list also highlights the concentration of AI startups in San Francisco, which accounts for a significant proportion of the honorees.

While California-based startups dominate the list, three companies from the Seattle area made the cut:

The IA40 list highlights a small-but-impactful group of Seattle companies alongside a much larger representation from the Bay Area, which includes major players like OpenAI and Anthropic. GeekWire recently reported on the lack of superstar AI startups in the Seattle region, despite its brand as a global AI hub.

Key takeaways from the IA40 report include the rise of next-generation user interfaces that are conversational and “agentic” — systems that can reason and execute autonomously. 

The report also highlights a multi-billion dollar opportunity in new AI tools for software development, along with the success of “service-as-software” business models. These trends are supported by the continued importance of the data layer and the maturity of the enabling infrastructure that powers these innovations, allowing for strong vertical momentum as companies build AI-native products for specific industries.

Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE

Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is switching to a reusable cup program facilitated by Bold Reuse, a Portland-based startup, in the venue's ongoing bid to eliminate waste at sports and entertainment events.

The new cups will debut Saturday during the Seattle Storm WNBA game. Fans will receive their drinks in durable cups that can be returned to collection bins throughout the stadium. The cups are collected, professionally sanitized and returned by Bold Reuse.

They will be used at all Climate Pledge Arena events, from Kraken hockey games to concerts and more, replacing the arena's use of recyclable aluminum cups.

Climate Pledge Arena has received accolades for its environmental efforts, and in 2023 became the first sports stadium in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from a nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings.

The arena is named after The Climate Pledge, an initiative founded by Amazon and Global Optimism asking global corporations to become net zero carbon by 2040. 

Bold Reuse initially launched as GO Box in 2011, providing reusable takeout containers. Co-founder and CEO Jocelyn Quarrell acquired the business in 2018, and rebranded it four years later. The company expanded into Seattle in February 2024 and opened a 9,000-square-feet dishwashing facility in the city's Chinatown-International District.

Bold Reuse launched a pilot program with material science company Avery Dennison in June in which RFID tags are being implemented to track the entire lifecycle of reusable cups — from distribution and return to wash cycles and end-of-life. 

The two-month pilot was live at the company's Portland wash hub as well as two of the city's sports venues: Moda Center and Providence Park.

Earlier this month, Bold Reuse announced a new partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs — the first NFL team to offer reusable cups stadium-wide for every event. 

Reusable cups from Minnesota-based r.World are used at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo ZooTunes concert events; SIFF Cinema Downtown, the former Cinerama movie theater; and WAMU Theater.

Threads is testing a new feature that makes it easy to share long-form text on the social network, Meta confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. The feature lets users attach a block of text to a post instead of creating a thread of several different posts when looking to share more in-depth thoughts and ideas.

App researcher Radu Oncescu first spotted the new “text attachment” feature on iOS and shared a screenshot of it. According to the app's description of the new feature, it's designed to allow users to “attach longer text and get creative with styling tools to share deeper thoughts, news snippets, book excerpts, and more.”

The ability to share long-form content could help Threads retain creators and writers who want more distribution for articles that would otherwise be posted on their blogs or newsletter platforms like Substack. The feature also gets rid of the need for workarounds when looking to share text that goes beyond the word limit for posts, such as sharing a screenshot of a block of text in your phone's Notes app.

Threads user Robert P. Nickson shared a post using the feature to show what it looks like to viewers. A snippet of the long-form text is displayed in a gray box within the post, which people can then click on to read and scroll through the full content.

Threads competitor X already offers a way for users to share long-form content on the platform with “Articles.” While X's feature is only available for Premium subscribers, Threads' feature is accessible to everyone, but that could change in the future.

Additionally, Threads only allows users to share text, whereas X's lets people incorporate images and videos. Considering that the feature is still in the testing phase, it's possible that Threads could add support for multimedia in the future.

Meta says it plans to bring this to more users in the future.

Support for long-form posts is the latest addition among a series of new features Threads has introduced over the past year, including DMs, fediverse integrations, custom feeds, AI enhancements, and more.

Threads recently topped 400 million monthly active users  just two years since its launch. X, on the other hand, has north of 600 million monthly active users, according to previous statements made by former CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Lucasfilm just announced the cast of Star Wars: Starfighter, directed by Shawn Levy, which is now in production. Ryan Gosling stars, and he'll be joined by Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams.

“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said on the official Star Wars website. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”

Above, you get our first glimpse of the film, featuring Gosling and Gray. While there's still no official word on the plot of the film, that image certainly suggests the rumors about a mentor and mentee relationship are true. All the official site says is that it's “an all-new standalone adventure” and “an entirely original story set in a period of time never before explored in Star Wars.” That's referring to the time after the events of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.

In terms of the cast, Smith and Goth had been rumored, but several of the other names are brand new, and, among those, a few stand out. Aaron Pierre, who'll next be seen in the DC series Lanterns, is one. The talented Rebel Ridge actor is now also a DC and Star Wars guy. The other is multi-Oscar-nominee Amy Adams, who is also now a DC and Star Wars person. There's no word on who each is playing, but they are intriguing additions to the Star Wars universe.

With Starfighter now in production, it's locking in on its release date of May 28, 2027, which is almost exactly 50 years after the release of the first Star Wars.

There's something so intoxicatingly convenient about a game handheld. Despite the fact the Nintendo Switch 2's design hasn't changed from its 8-year-old prequel, it's still the epitome of gaming thanks to the dock that connects it to your TV. Sony's PlayStation brand seems to be hedging on the same bet Nintendo made nearly a decade ago. The latest rumors and leaks suggest Sony's rumored PlayStation 6 handheld could also dock with a TV and offer even better performance than both the Switch 2 and the upcoming Asus ROG Xbox Ally handheld.

See PS5 Pro at Amazon

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Amazon

Gaming hardware leaker Moore's Law is Dead spilled the beans on what could be Sony's PS6. The big update is that Sony may let users hook up the supposed handheld to a dock connected to their TV. This could unlock even better performance than the device in handheld mode. The dock itself may not provide more processing power, but like the Switch 2, the peripheral would allow additional power and thermal management to unlock better performance. The PS6 handheld may stick to 1080p resolution on a small display, but on a TV it could have performance beyond a PS5, according to the YouTuber.

The leaker has a relatively consistent track record, especially regarding the early pricing and specs of the PlayStation 5 before it launched in 2020. With the upcoming PlayStation 6 and long-rumored PlayStation handheld, Sony seems to be taking its design cues from multiple sources. The people behind the PlayStation brand may even create a lower-end, cheaper console again to the Xbox Series S.

Even so, we still would have to wait another two years to see any of these devices in action. At least, the PS6 generation seems like it will offer a smorgasbord of consoles for consumers. Which is all more exciting since the next generation could have much better graphics capabilities than either the Xbox Series X or PS5. According to Moore's Law is Dead, the handheld, dubbed “Canis” internally, will use a custom AMD APU, or accelerated processing unit. This kind of chip design has both CPU and GPU capabilities. The PS6 design will reportedly use AMD's anticipated Zen 6 CPU and RDNA 5 GPU microarchitecture.

The PlayStation 6 handheld may use a small 3nm chip with four Zen 6C cores and two extra low-power cores to handle the PlayStation's base software. The chip may house a GPU with 16 RDNA 5 compute units (CU). AMD's compute units are core clusters designed to handle the complex rendering tasks for graphics applications. RDNA 5 is supposedly 5% to 10% faster than RDNA 4 currently is. Even with its limited number of CUs, RDNA 5 could still be powerful enough to handle games from the PS5 era. The PS5 is running on AMD's older Zen 2 and RDNA 2 microarchitecture. Moore's Law is Dead suggests the PS6's CUs will be “60%” faster per unit than RDNA 2.

The saving grace for the PS6 handheld may not even be the explicit power of the device itself. AMD's AI upscaling tech received a massive boost this year with the introduction of FidelityFX Super Resolution 4. This is hardware-specific upscaling that takes frames rendered at a lower resolution and pushes them to look better at higher resolutions, all while keeping the better performance. Past FSR 3 and 3.5 were more hardware agnostic. The new version results in cleaner visuals and fewer artifacts created by upscaling, and it's nearly on par with Nvidia's DLSS 4.

The leaks seem to come from AMD, and we still don't have any specifics on the PlayStation 6 handheld's clock speeds or any other details that could help define what kind of power it's capable of. Previous leaks for the PlayStation 6, dubbed internally as “Orion,” also suggest the next console could be a big improvement over the PS5 and even the PlayStation 5 Pro.

The $450 Switch 2 has access to older versions of DLSS, and we've already seen how much of an impact that can have in games like Cyberpunk 2077, which runs even better in most scenarios than the same game on the $550 Steam Deck. The next-gen PlayStation will only be successful if it can meet or beat prices on competing hardware. Moore's Law is Dead suggests that the lower-end console would cost less than a Switch 2, and the Canis handheld may also offer better value than Nintendo's latest system. The higher-end Orion device would still demand more from your wallet. Considering the current success of the Switch 2, reportedly selling 2 million units in the U.S. since launch, according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, a PlayStation 6 handheld could prove more popular than any standard console occupying precious space on your TV stand.

Do you like playing around with AI? And are you a fan of overthrowing democratically elected governments to advance Trump-style fascism around the world? Well, we just heard about a job you might like.

The CIA posted a tweet Thursday morning calling for any fans of artificial intelligence tools to look at a career with the Central Intelligence Agency. Well, maybe “any” isn't the right word, given the Trump regime's desire to elevate white men in positions of authority.

“If you have expertise in using AI to gain insights from data, a CIA career might be right for you,” CIA tweeted with a link explaining what they're looking for.

While there's no doubt that AI is rapidly changing the world, large language models (LLMs) are still struggling to deliver on their lofty promises. Generative AI is being sold as something akin to a god, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman insisting it's like having PhD experts to answer any question.

“It would have been unimaginable at any previous time in history,” Altman said during the release of GPT-5. “You get access to an entire team of PhD-level experts in your pocket, helping you with whatever you want to do. And anyone pretty soon will be able to do more than anyone in history could.”

But these things are not infallible. And that makes us a little nervous whenever a truly powerful entity like the CIA signals they're all-in on the extremely flawed tech.

Large language models still trip up while attempting some very basic things. For example, we recently asked ChatGPT which states had the letter R in their name. It listed states like Minnesota, Illinois, and Massachusetts, which obviously don't have an R. And then we successfully bullied it into believing Vermont didn't have an R. Sure, LLMs can be useful for some tasks, but they're being marketed as being capable of things that are far beyond their capabilities.

The job listing at the CIA's website is careful to note that taking a data scientist role at the agency will require any applicants to “ensure models are accurate, reliable, and explainable.” Which is important, of course, when you're talking about life and death issues. These are the folks who have spread U.S.-style democracy around the world through campaigns of torture, coup d'états, and morally repugnant studies on unwitting test subjects.

And with President Donald Trump at the helm, you can bet the CIA's mission in 2025 is as seedy as it's ever been. Our only saving grace may be that Trump's goons are both incompetent and working against each other in underhanded ways.

Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, is supposed to be working in her role as the liaison between the White House and all of America's intelligence agencies. But you've been forgiven for thinking that she looks like she's working on destroying the country's intelligence community from the inside. She recently surprised the CIA when she publicly announced the name of an undercover officer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gabbard also just flatly lies sometimes, like when she claims that Russia had no preference for Trump to win the 2016 election.

There's no evidence Gabbard is using AI to determine who should lose their security clearance, but it wouldn't surprise us if that's the kind of thing that's happening regularly now at agencies like the CIA. Back in June, Gabbard let it slip that she asked AI about which files to declassify related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Even when it comes to image generation, AI has become the aesthetic of fascism.

Generative AI is a tool that some people find very useful. But it's most useful for questions that have already been asked and answered. If you try to throw something new at it, that's when it's most likely to fail, as Gizmodo has demonstrated with our own tests. And even basic math questions are difficult for AI because it's designed to mimic human speech patterns, not perform basic grade-school tasks like counting.

Here's hoping the CIA doesn't need to know how many Rs are in “strawberry.” Or in waterboarding, for that matter.

Some CPUs will now no longer have a bundled cooler


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


 




Ever since the introduction of the Ryzen line-up, AMD has supplied a stock cooler in the box with most of its CPUs. These range from the basic Wraith Stealth units to the RGB-laden Wraith Prism, and the Wraith Spire which sits in between. While the Wraith line-up has existed prior to modern Ryzen processors, the Prism debuted with the Ryzen 2000 series in 2018, it is now retiring after seven years.

Spotted by @momomo_us, AMD has updated the OPN codes for some of its boxed Ryzen CPUs, with a new message highlighting the end-of-life status for Wraith Prism and Wraith Spire. Starting August, 2025, the cooler has been completely retired and will no longer come with processors such as the Ryzen 9 7900. There's no substitute either; there will simply be no stock cooler bundled with some AMD CPUs.

 




Alongside the Prism, even the Wraith Spire is being discontinued, with select units shifting to the lower-tier Wraith Stealth. AMD already moved away from including boxed coolers entirely with the Ryzen 9000 series, arguing that higher-end CPUs are paired with aftermarket solutions anyways. The only exception to this is the Ryzen 5 9600, which fittingly ships with a Wraith Stealth — so that's safe.

Of the Ryzen 9000 series, only the Ryzen 5 9600 gets a Wraith Stealth cooler, but the Ryzen 7000 series fairs better with a handful of CPUs coming with in-box cooling. These are the Ryzen 9 7900 (Prism), 7 7700, 5 7600, , 5 7500F and the 5 7400F which all come with Wraith Stealth coolers. The older Ryzen 5 series CPUs fair much better with 11 of the 26 CPUs coming with cooling.

The Wraith Prism itself is an upgraded version of the original Wraith Max coolers that AMD shipped with its FX CPUs. It's the most capable of the bunch (or was), rated for 140W TDP which means it should be able to cool even flagship 16-core SKUs from the Red Team. On the other hand, the Wraith Stealth launched with the original 1000-series Ryzen chips and they're essentially the same cooler, just with different sized heatsinks.

While these coolers are technically nothing special, they still lowered the barrier to entry to a new platform. People previously using Intel processors, or building their first-ever PCs wouldn't have to worry about yet another component, avoiding the compatibility checks often needed before buying and pairing PC parts with each other. Nowadays, both AMD and Intel seem to have largely moved away from this model, forcing people to exclusively rely on a separate purchase.

Adults with undiagnosed respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibited more severe cough than those with normal spirometry or preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm). A higher severity of cough was associated with poorer quality of life (QOL) and worse sleep quality.

“Spirometry-based assessment of individuals in the community with cough and no previously established pulmonary disease may result in earlier diagnoses of obstructive lung disease and may ultimately have positive impacts on patients' health status and healthcare utilization,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sheojung Shin, MD, University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on August 11, 2025, in Annals of the American Thoracic Society.

The cough score used in this study was not externally validated, and no minimum clinically important difference was determined. The UCAP study predated the widespread adoption of Global Lung Function Initiative equations and instead used prediction equations developed specifically for the Canadian population. 

This study was funded by The Ottawa Hospital Foundation and a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research Foundation. Several authors reported receiving financial aid from and having other ties with multiple pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Valeo, Takeda, and Sanofi.

Let's talk about what people call failing in residency. 

It is so easy to internalize every misstep — missing a diagnosis, forgetting a task, or getting tough feedback, using all of these things as proof that you're not good enough. 

The truth is, residency is hard. It's where you're going to learn how to think, how to recover, and how to grow under pressure. These low momentsdon't mean you're failing. They mean you are going through and are in the middle of a very difficult process. 

Although it might not feel like it right now, every single one of those experiences is shaping you into a thoughtful, resilient physician. This is really important. Give yourself room to be human.You're learning, not failing.

Current US heart failure guidelines that use a single cut point for natriuretic peptides (NPs) can underestimate the risk for the disease for people with obesity, according to a study published recently in Circulation: Heart Failure.

The 2022 joint guidelines from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Failure Society of America added NP as a biomarker for higher risk, with a threshold of 125 pg/mL to up-classify individuals from stage A (at-risk) to stage B (pre-heart failure).

But concentrations of the proteins typically are lower in people with obesity, said Jennifer Ho, MD, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, so she wondered whether clinicians who follow the recommendations might be underestimating the risk for heart failure in their patients with obesity.

Using the pooled data from more than 32,000 people without heart failure enrolled in community-based cohorts, Ho and her colleagues classified their risk for heart failure using both the 2013 guidelines, which did not include NP levels, and the 2022 guidelines, taking into account their obesity status.

They found the single cut point resulted in fewer individuals with obesity being up-classified to stage B heart failure than normal-weight individuals. The proportion up-classified to stage B using the NP levels was 62% among those with normal weight, 51% among those who were overweight, 47% among individuals with obesity class 1, and 42% among those with obesity class 2/3.

“The majority of the discrepancy is because of the reclassification on the basis of NP levels,” Ho said. “This suggests patients with obesity need a lower threshold to capture their risk.”

The optimal cut point to assess the risk for future heart failure was lower in people with obesity (80 pg/mL) than in people of normal weight (109 pg/mL), the study found.

Paul Heidenreich, MD, a cardiologist at Stanford University in Stanford, California, and a coauthor of the 2022 guidelines, said the guideline committee was aware of this issue and mentioned it in the document. But without solid data on how thresholds should differ, they felt they should include a general number, with the caveat that some people would likely have different thresholds.

“Whenever you give a number, some people will latch on to it too strongly, but it is better to have something than nothing, even if it is not perfect for everyone,” said Heidenreich, who was not involved in the new research.

Ho's study is helpful, he added, because it provides a starting point for developing new thresholds that could be incorporated into the next set of guidelines. He said he expects future guidelines will include a matrix of NP thresholds, adjusted not just for obesity but for kidney disease and other conditions that can change levels of the protein.

In the meantime, Heidenreich urged clinicians to keep in mind that NPs are far from the only things that affect the risk for heart failure. “You need to think about all the other characteristics that might influence that threshold,” he said.

Ho and Heidenreich reported having no financial conflicts of interest.

Researchers at McGill University and the Douglas Institute have identified two specific types of brain cells that are altered in people with depression.

The study, published in Nature Genetics, opens the door to developing new treatments that target these cells and deepens our understanding of depression, a leading cause of disability worldwide that affects more than 264 million people.

This is the first time we've been able to identify what specific brain cell types are affected in depression by mapping gene activity together with mechanisms that regulate the DNA code. It gives us a much clearer picture of where disruptions are happening, and which cells are involved.""

Dr. Gustavo Turecki, senior author, professor at McGill, clinician-scientist at the Douglas Institute and Canada Research Chair in Major Depressive Disorder and Suicide

The researchers used post-mortem brain tissue from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank, one of the few collections in the world with donated tissue from people who had psychiatric conditions.

They used single-cell genomic techniques to analyze RNA and DNA from thousands of brain cells, identifying which cells worked differently in depression and what DNA sequences could explain those differences. They studied samples from 59 people who had depression and 41 people without it.

The results revealed altered gene activity in a certain type of excitatory neuron involved in mood and stress regulation, and in a subtype of microglia cells, which help manage inflammation. In both cell types, many genes were functioning differently in people with depression, suggesting potential disruptions in these key brain systems.

By pinpointing brain cells affected in depression, the study adds new insight into its biological basis and, more broadly, challenges lingering misconceptions about the disorder.

""This research reinforces what neuroscience has been telling us for years,"" Turecki said. ""Depression isn't just emotional, it reflects real, measurable changes in the brain.""

As a next step, the researchers plan to study how these cellular changes affect brain function and whether targeting them could lead to better therapies.

""Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling identifies cell types and functional variants contributing to major depression"" by Anjali Chawla and Gustavo Turecki et al., was published in Nature Genetics.

The study was funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Brain Canada Foundation, Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé and Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives initiative at McGill University.

Researchers at Wayne State University are pursuing new therapies for treating chemical injuries to the eyes with the help of a two-year, $400,400 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, a research scientist in the laboratory of Dr. Ashok Kumar, professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences at Wayne State University's School of Medicine, has been awarded the grant, ""Harnessing Immunometabolism to Ameliorate the Pathology of Ocular Chemical Injuries,"" to support innovative studies into developing novel therapies to enhance corneal nerve repair and promote wound healing after ocular chemical injury - a pressing issue among military personnel exposed to harmful substances in combat and training environments.

Ocular chemical injuries can lead to chronic inflammation, corneal nerve damage, persistent pain, dry eye and even permanent vision loss. Unfortunately, current treatment options are often inadequate, offering only partial relief and sometimes leading to undesirable side effects.""

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, research scientist

Singh's research aims to overcome these challenges by investigating the therapeutic potential of host-derived metabolites to reduce inflammation, promote corneal nerve regeneration and enhance wound healing.

""This project will serve as a proof of concept for leveraging endogenous metabolites to modulate immune responses and lessen disease severity following chemical injury,"" Singh explained. ""By reprogramming immune cells and enhancing tissue repair, we aim to develop effective strategies to preserve vision and improve patient outcomes.""

The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating immunometabolism, cell biology and advanced drug delivery technologies. One of its central innovations is the use of hydrogel-based platforms for delivering therapeutic metabolites. Compared to conventional eye drops, hydrogels provide sustained release, improved bioavailability and reduced dosing frequency - crucial advantages in field conditions with limited access to medical care.

""In the long term, this work has the potential to yield clinically translatable treatments that not only preserve vision but also lessen the emotional and economic burden on service members, their families and the broader health care system,"" said Kumar, who serves as the project's co-investigator.

""Department of Defense funding for health-related research is critical to ensure the health and welfare of our country's service members,"" said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. ""I look forward to seeing the results of this important research by Drs. Singh and Kumar, which aims to create novel treatment options that will be useful not only to those in the military, but others facing similar ocular injuries.""

The award number for this grant from the U.S. Department of Defense is HT94252510634.

A new diagnostic method would confirm sepsis infections earlier, cutting critical hours in the ""race against time"" to save patients' lives.

Publishing in Nature Publishing Journal Digital Medicine, the team from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University say their diagnostic process offers a speedier alternative to the bacteria culturing process hospitals routinely use to identify suspected bloodstream infections.

The process uses a centrifuge to separate bacteria from blood cells, and automatic microscopy for detection, enabling a clinic to confirm bacterial infection in as little as two hours using software trained by artificial intelligence, says Henar Marino Miguelez, a doctoral student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. She and doctoral student Mohammad Osaid were the study's lead authors.

By contrast, hospital labs generally need at least a day of incubation before the growth of infectious bacteria begins to reveal itself in blood cultures.

Diagnosing sepsis is a race against time. With every hour of delayed treatment of patients in septic shock, survival rates drop by 8 percent.""

Henar Marino Miguelez, doctoral student, KTH Royal Institute of Technology

By enabling prompt identification of pathogens, the appropriate antibiotic treatment can be started sooner, says Wouter van der Wijngaart, a professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology who leads research in microfluidic and biomedical systems.

Typically a clinic will put a patient on a broad-spectrum antibiotic when sepsis is suspected, at least until they identify the pathogen. But that precaution carries its own risks, due to the inherent drug toxicity, attacking beneficial gut bacteria and promoting the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains.

""It takes a hospital two to four days before they are sure which antibiotic to treat a bloodstream infection with,"" van der Wijngaart says. ""We're trying to do this in four to six hours.""

In tests using blood samples spiked with bacteria, the system successfully detected E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis at clinically relevant levels, as low as 7 to 32 bacterial colony-forming units per milliliter of blood.

While the method proved to work well with these bacteria, it did not for staphylococcus aureus, which hides in blood clots. Miguelez says the researchers are working on ways to fix that.

The technique employs a ""smart centrifugation"", which spins blood samples on top of an agent that causes bacteria to float upwards while blood cells sediment downwards, leading to a clear, liquid layer containing bacteria but no blood cells. This liquid is then injected into a chip with microscale channels, where it flows easily.

Miniscule traps in the chip capture the separated bacteria, and any bacteria growth quickly becomes visible in automated time-lapse microscopy images analyzed by the machine learning software.

The work was a collaboration between the teams of van der Wijngaart at KTH, and Johan Elf and Carolina Wählby at Uppsala University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","It's time for Mauricio Pochettino to stop tinkering and build a World Cup team","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6582219/2025/08/28/davies-pochettino-world-cup-squad-tinkering/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 19:04:12 GMT","

I spent the earlier part of this week living under the stars, in a tent deep inside Yellowstone National Park, with only a patchy cellphone signal, no internet or television. It wasn't quite an Aaron Rodgers retreat but it was an amazing experience.

Anyone who has ever ‘disconnected' in that manner, understands the value that it brings. You have time to break free from the constant demands of everyday life, to refocus and renew before re-emerging with fresh energy.

But when I came out of the retreat and saw Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the upcoming games against South Korea and Japan, I wondered for half a second if I wasn't now living in an alternative reality.

Almost half of Pochettino's 23-man squad is made up of players from Major League Soccer ,as he continues to experiment with new players while the likes of Weston McKennie at Juventus, Johnny Cardoso of Atlético Madrid, Yunus Musah at AC Milan and Tanner Tessmann at Lyon have been left out.

We are nine months away from the start of the World Cup on home soil and the coach is still experimenting, still familiarizing himself with the player pool and still ‘sending messages' to players? Really?

At this stage, I would expect the national team coach to be focused on his core starting team and supporting cast, getting players familiar with their roles, the partnerships that are so vital across the field and the group dynamics that need to be fine tuned before competing with the world's elite.

Of course, there is always room for bringing in a form player or two or trying out alternative options and testing the depth of his roster. And there is some validity in Pochettino's likely goals here – broadening the pool, lighting a fire under those excluded and perhaps giving European-based players the chance to focus on their club situations for now.

But the benefits of a player being allowed to stay with a European club are limited when you remember that during the international break, large numbers of the first-team squad at clubs like Milan, Juve and Atlético, are away with their national teams anyway, weakening the significance of those training sessions, which are mainly for reserves and other non-internationals.

Two things really concern me about this roster.

Firstly, the U.S. is playing against Japan and South Korea, two teams with quality players and top-tier experience, who are exactly the kind of opponents that might be waiting in the World Cup itself, especially in the knockout phase.

With no qualifying games, these friendlies should be treated as seriously as possible, to get the squad truly competitive encounters – to test them and help them grow. As we saw with the debacle of June's 4-0 crushing by Switzerland in Nashville, if the opposition is high-level and comes in motivated, the outcome for an experimental team can be ugly.

There is already a worrying lack of enthusiasm bordering on apathy in the USMNT's fan base at a time when positivity and optimism should be growing in anticipation of this huge moment in American soccer. I don't even want to think about what the impact would be of another heavy loss at home.

Secondly, while the time for ‘sending messages' should be over by now, I also worry about exactly what kind of message Pochettino is sending by his selection of MLS players who few people, if any, were clamoring for.

When I played for the national team under Bob Bradley, there was an unwritten rule for emerging American MLS talent. If you want to be a national team player, you earn yourself a move abroad, you fight for your place at your club, you perform week-in, week-out and then you get your chance.

It was highly motivating. It led people like me to turn down, after college, a Generation Adidas contract with MLS and head to Europe. It was why I battled for a starting place at Hammarby in Sweden, moved to Sochaux in France and played for Randers in Denmark.

Jurgen Klinsmann was another national team coach who was keen to see Americans move to Europe, pushing players to get as close to the highest level as possible. It's why so many of our players over the last 25 years improved, became more professional and more steeled. It's not easy as an American walking into a European locker-room, proving yourself, earning a starting place and keeping it. It's a grind every single day. It meant the national team coach got players who had been forged by that experience, hardened and sharpened.

It also gave players in MLS something to aim for. You might be performing well enough for your club, but were you playing well enough to attract the attention of European scouts?

So what is the message the players receive when they see Pochettino's roster?

With all due respect, have the likes of Roman Celentano, Tristan Blackmon, Nathan Harriel and Sean Zawadzki really been performing at such a consistently high-level in MLS that they simply could not be ignored? Have they really thrust themselves into contention for World Cup places?

Even if you were looking to MLS-based players, it is surprising that some of these new faces are being picked ahead of the likes of Djordje Mihailovic (11 caps), DeJuan Jones (10 caps) and Chicago's exciting talent Brian Gutierrez (two caps).

But the message sent is even worse. When I see a player like Paxton Aaronson, who after trying to make it at Eintracht Frankfurt took on the challenge of a loan spell at Utrecht and earned a starting place at a top-four club in the Dutch league, take a move back to MLS, it leaves me thinking the players have understood that under Pochettino you'd actually be better off in MLS.

That is a crazy situation. But what other conclusion could we draw from the fact that a promising player like Aidan Morris, who was rightly called up due to his excellent form with the Columbus Crew, is now ignored despite being a regular in the highly competitive Championship with Middlesbrough?

Morris won two MLS Cups with the Crew before, at the age of 22, going to play for then-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick, a great coach to learn from, given he played in Morris's midfield role. That's the kind of initiative that I would lean towards rewarding.

Morris could now be forgiven for thinking that he would have been better off, from a national team perspective, staying with the Crew, never having to worry about losing his place, never having to push himself, under pressure, every week in the grind of that league. He'd probably be in this roster if he was playing in MLS – which is absurd.

There are contradictions in Pochettino's approach, too. If the aim is to give players in new club environments space to settle, then why call up Tim Weah? He is in his first season with Marseille, adapting to a new system under Roberto De Zerbi and new teammates, and yet he is (deservedly) included in the roster.

And he should be, because Weah is a vital piece of the U.S. puzzle. His speed, quickness, timing, 1-v-1 ability, two-way commitment and World Cup experience (including scoring against Wales in Qatar) make him unique in this group.

The reality is that outside of him, the USMNT simply doesn't have another wide player with that blend of qualities. His inclusion underscores just how inconsistent the logic is when other Europe-based players in similar or even stronger club situations are left behind.

At least Pochettino says this is the last window before the experimenting stops in October. That is a relief, but I think not going with a full-strength squad for these games is another missed opportunity for the coach and the team.

Hopefully the approach to the games will be less experimental than the roster call-ups suggests. If the U.S. wants to inspire belief heading into the home World Cup, now is the time to sharpen, not experiment.

Thankfully, Christian Pulisic is on the roster, and I really hope that he and everyone else can now put this summer's unpleasant conflict behind them. The whole saga was the result of poor communication. No one blinked an eye when it was announced that Musah was missing the Gold Cup for ‘personal reasons,' and few would have objected if Christian's absence was put down to muscle fatigue or a minor injury.

I'll never understand why it was instead described by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker as the player asking to “step back” this summer due to the volume of games. The whole thing could have been avoided with different language.

Christian had a new coach coming in at AC Milan and it was important for him to be at the Milanello training ground fresh and ready to go on day one of preseason and not coming in late or tired from the Gold Cup and playing catch-up ahead of the new season.

The U.S. needs Pulisic to have a great season with Milan and to return in style to the national team. He's central to World Cup hopes, and whatever people think of his decision this summer, it is time to put it behind us and get behind our best player. Just as it's time for Pochettino to get behind his best players, period.

The application window for the FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Programme has officially opened, marking the launch of what is set to become the largest volunteer initiative in FIFA's history. With an estimated 65,000 volunteers to be recruited, this programme represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to support the delivery of the biggest FIFA World Cup™ to date.

FIFA has announced that these volunteers will form the core of the FIFA Volunteer Community, a group now surpassing one million members worldwide. Their collective energy and commitment will be essential to the success of this expanded global event, which features a 48-team format and spans 16 Host Cities across Canada, Mexico, and the United States over six weeks.

Volunteers will play a vital role in more than 23 functional areas, including but not limited to stadium operations, training venues, airports, hotels, fan engagement spaces, and city-wide activations. This includes support in logistics, accreditation, media, hospitality, transport, and language services. Their responsibilities will ensure that the fan experience, team coordination, and overall tournament operations run smoothly at every touchpoint.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino emphasised the importance of volunteers in his official statement:

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments. They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

This call for volunteers is not just a logistical need—it's an open invitation to participate in a moment of global unity, celebration, and legacy-building. With millions of fans expected to travel across the three host nations, volunteers will serve as ambassadors for their cities, providing a warm welcome to international guests and contributing to an unforgettable experience for all involved.

Craig Collins, a long-time supporter and previous volunteer at the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA™ and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ in Atlanta, officially became the one-millionth member of the FIFA Volunteer Community in April 2025. Reflecting on the impact of the programme, Collins remarked:

“I'm so proud to be part of this moment – not just for FIFA, but for my city. I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer programme and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

FIFA is actively encouraging individuals from all walks of life to apply. Whether applicants are students, retirees, first-time volunteers, or experienced event staff, the programme is open to all who share a passion for football, a spirit of service, and a desire to be part of something bigger. Diversity and inclusion are central to the recruitment process, with an emphasis on welcoming volunteers of different backgrounds, ages, abilities, and languages.

Eligibility criteria are simple:

Crucially, no prior volunteering experience is required. FIFA provides comprehensive training, with selected applicants first participating in Volunteer Team Tryouts, set to begin in October 2025. Those accepted will then undergo training in March 2026, just ahead of the official opening of the tournament on 11 June 2026, with the inaugural match hosted in Mexico City.

The volunteer programme offers a unique opportunity for personal growth, cultural exchange, and meaningful contribution to a global sporting event. It also provides unparalleled access to behind-the-scenes operations, networking opportunities, and a front-row seat to history in the making.

 Shintaro Mochizuki is standing tall heading into the second round at the US Open. 

 The No. 112 in the PIF ATP Rankings has raced into the second round as a qualifier for the second consecutive major with a series of commanding performances in New York. Having notched his maiden Grand Slam main-draw win at Wimbledon in late June, Mochizuki on Tuesday raced past Hugo Gaston in straight sets at Flushing Meadows to book a showdown with eighth seed Alex de Minaur. 

 De Minaur is arguably the perfect role model for Mochizuki as he aims to push further up the PIF ATP Rankings. In an era where tall players with big serves seem to be thriving, the Australian has cracked the Top 10 without the natural advantages that many of his rivals enjoy. Relatively short for a tennis player at 6 feet, De Minaur relies on his lightning movement, elite fitness levels and competitive will to power his successes. 

 “He's amazing,” the 5-foot-9 Mochizuki told ATPTour.com when asked what he thought of his second-round opponent. “I think he moves the best on Tour. But I see a lot of not-so-tall guys have also had success on the Tour. Kei [Nishikori], [Diego] Schwartzman — I saw him here this week. They've had amazing careers and that also makes me feel like I can also do it, but at the same time I feel it's super tough to be at the top on this Tour. 

 “Especially now, when everybody hits so hard and everybody serves big. But I'm getting better and better, even against tall guys. For example, at Wimbledon against [Karen] Khachanov, where I almost won. I just do my best, that's all I can do, and I want to keep doing it my whole career.” 



 The 22-year-old Mochizuki rallied from two sets down to defeat Giulio Zeppieri at Wimbledon and earn his first main-draw win at a major. The nature of his New York triumph against Gaston could hardly have been more different, and Mochizuki reflected it on a business-like manner in his post-match press conference. 

 “At Wimbledon I was very nervous because I didn't have any wins at Grand Slams, so I wanted it so badly and I was very tight at the beginning,” he said. “Even if I see the score now, two sets down and I won 7-5 in the fifth, I'm still surprised. Today, I did well from the beginning so I'm happy, but a win is a win.”

 Mochizuki is a former Wimbledon boys' singles champion, but he also holds plenty of affection for New York through his passion for baseball. Although a keen New York Yankees fan, his love for the sport means he would have no qualms also dropping into Citi Field, home of the Yankees rival the New York Mets, which sits right next to Flushing Meadows. 

 “I went to Yankees Stadium two days ago. It was against the Red Sox, who have a Japanese guy in the team. I enjoy it a lot,” said Mochizuki. “I really want to go to a Mets game this week. They just came back yesterday to playing at home. Hopefully I can get to watch after the tournament. 

 “I used to play when I was very young, but now I just like watching. I want to drink a beer while watching baseball, but not right now!”

Former champion Emma Raducanu dropped just three games against Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen to return to the US Open third round.

Emma Raducanu returned to the third round of the US Open for the first time since winning the 2021 title with a 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Indonesia's Janice Tjen.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of play

It was Raducanu's second straight win over a tricky qualifier. Having dropped just three games against former doubles No. 4 Ena Shibahara in the first round, she found herself taking on the surging Tjen, who had compiled a 101-13 record since graduating from Pepperdine University last May. That included a first-round upset of No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova in Tjen's first career meeting with a Top 50 player.

Her second was a marked contrast. Raducanu needed just an hour to end No. 149-ranked Tjen's run and advance to the third round of a major for the third time in 2025. There, she will face No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina, who edged 18-year-old qualifier Tereza Valentova, in a bid to reach the second week of a major for the fourth time.

""Super dangerous opponent,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview. ""She was playing extremely well, and I thought any ball that I put mid-court that was not necessarily good enough, she just put away easy. So I was really pleased with how I performed today.""

Keys to the match: Raducanu's serve has been a formidable weapon for the 22-year-old this summer, and it once again anchored her game as she sent down eight aces and several more unreturnable deliveries. She faced just three break points, all in the third game of the match, and saved them all. In total, Raducanu conceded 13 points on serve.

""I thought that I served very well, and yeah, I put quite a few aces on the board today,"" Raducanu said. ""It always helps me when I'm serving well. It just kind of seeps into the rest of my game.""

She was also able to take apart Tjen's preferred patterns of play, centered around running around her heavy forehand. Raducanu attacked the Tjen backhand relentlessly, unbothered by the Indonesian's slice, invariably either drawing an error or opening the court for one for of her 16 winners. Tjen once again impressed at net, winning all six of those points -- but for the most part, Raducanu's impeccable depth prevented her from getting there in the first place.

""Of course I was on full alert playing today,"" she said. ""I'm very pleased with how I kept dictating the points, I kept dictating the play, and didn't let her too often get her front foot on the court.""

Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach.

NEW YORK -- There have been times this year when Naomi Osaka expressed frustration at her lack of progress after returning to tennis as a mother. But as the North American summer hard-court season sweeps to a conclusion, it's clear she again has that championship gleam in her eye.

Thursday's 6-3, 6-1 win over Hailey Baptiste was a study in controlled aggression. Despite the swirling wind, the four-time Grand Slam champion was a composed, serene presence in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Osaka, who needed only 70 minutes to win, busted out the big strokes only when necessary.

On Saturday, the No. 23-seeded Osaka will play the winner of the later match between No. 15 Daria Kasatkina and Kamilla Rakhimova.

It's probably not a coincidence that since coach Tomasz Wiktorowski joined her team in Montreal, Osaka has won eight of nine matches.

Asked on court what he's bringing to her game, Osaka dodged the question.

“I can't give up my secrets,” she said, laughing. “But he definitely makes me see tennis in a different way -- and you can see it in the way I'm playing recently.”

Osaka's signature strokes -- a powerful serve and a forehand to go with it -- still get most of the attention. She had seven aces (and no double faults) in her first-round victory over Greet Minnen.

But it's her new-and-improved return game that suggests she might soon return to Top 10 form. It's been a point of emphasis for Wiktorowski.

“I feel like with Tomasz we've been working a lot on my returns,” Osaka told reporters, “and I feel more confident. So I think that's a really big point for me, because I feel like I was able to focus and kind of break back immediately when I needed to.”

Her return position appears to be slightly deeper -- she was about five feet off the baseline against Baptiste -- and “it's made me a lot more comfortable returning.”

In her two matches, Osaka is 11-for-14 in break-point conversions.

In perhaps the most telling statistic in tennis, she has won an extraordinary 41 of 54 (.759) second-serve return points.

Osaka, who turned heads with her red-sparkle ensemble in the opening round, came out for her second match awash in purple from head to toe. After playing the first several games with her hair down, she quickly fashioned it into a bun -- and her game picked up noticeably.

The No. 47-ranked Baptiste and Osaka had played two previous matches, earlier this year on hard courts in Auckland and Miami, and both went the three-set distance before Osaka prevailed. This time, Osaka asserted herself early and often, with service breaks in the second and sixth games.

The second set was much the same, with breaks coming from Osaka in the first, fifth and seventh games. Baptiste reached the second round at the US Open for the first time, following best-ever results at Roland Garros (fourth round) and Wimbledon (third round).

NEW YORK—“This is the type of day you all live for,” Taylor Townsend told the media as she sat down for her post-match press conference at the 2025 US Open.Townsend had just clinched a 7-5, 6-1 win over Jelena Ostapenko that devolved into near-bedlam as the No. 25 seeded-Ostapenko lashed out at her victorious opponent at net, accusing her of having “no class and no education,” drawing boos from the Court 11 crowd.“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

I chalk it up to being upset and, you know, she pulled out all the stops to try and break the momentum. Sometimes people do that, but it is what it is. Still, there's no beef. But again, like you guys saw, I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter. Taylor Townsend

“I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect,” she added in press. “If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter.“I think that that's tennis, right? You know no matter what's going on, it's me versus you, but at the end of the day we have to respect each other and respect what happens out on the court. It's competition.“So, you know, it was unfortunate, but…it's something I can put on my TikTok!”

Ostapenko wrote a statement after the match on her Instagram stories, later posting an update to deny allegations that her outburst had racist undertones. (IG/@jelena.ostapenko).

By the time Townsend had taken the podium for her press conference Ostapenko, who had not been requested by the media in the event that she lost her second round, posted a statement to social media accusing Townsend of being “very disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding moment and didn't say sorry.“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was the first time ever that this happened to me on tour.”Ostapenko, who later denied the outburst had racist understones on her Instagram stories, further accused Townsend of breaking a rule by to start their pre-match warm-up at the net, something Townsend said she does before every match.

“You know, this isn't the first, second, third, fourth time I've played Jelena, so if she's complaining about how I warm up, that's fine,” said Townsend. “You can go back to the time that I played my first-ever pro tennis match, and I've been doing this since even juniors. It wasn't anything targeted towards her to try and take her off of her game or her rhythm. You know, I just was doing my thing.“Honestly, laugh at it. I think it's comical. I think that it's kind of funny, because to then go online and have to justify what you said, you obviously feel some type of way and feel like you have to give an explanation for how you acted. I don't feel like I have to explain how I acted. I think it was very self-explanatory. I'm standing in what I said.”Though she called this behavior part of Ostapenko's “MO,” Townsend said she bore no ill will against the former French Open champion after the match, the top-ranked doubles player dismissing the suggestion that Ostapenko be barred from competing in the doubles event as a result of the incident.

The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk.

NEW YORK—Aryna Sabalenka revealed she spoke with Jelena Ostapenko in the immediate aftermath of the No. 25 seed's dramatic second-round crash out to Taylor Townsend at the 2025 US Open.“During our conversation, I didn't know what happened,” the world No. 1 said in answer to a question from *Bounces* following her second-round victory over Polina Kudermetova.What happened: Ostapenko castigated a victorious Townsend for failing to acknowledge a lucky netcord in the first set of the latter's 7-5, 6-1 victory, accusing Townsend of having “no class and no education” before getting booed off a packed Court 11 on Wednesday.“Well, I have to say that she's nice,” said Sabalenka. “You know, she just sometimes can lose control. She has some things in life to face and some struggles. I was just trying to help her to…face it more in mature way, but I was just trying to help her to settle down and kind of, like…just was someone she could speak to and just let it go.”

NEW YORK—It only took two games for the first sign of trouble to appear.Mattia Bellucci was serving at 0-1, 15-40 versus Carlos Alcaraz. That the 65th-ranked player in the world would go down an immediate break against a five-time Grand Slam champ was hardly a shock, or a disaster in a best-of-five-set match. This was the first time the 24-year-old Italian had played under the bright lights in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Alcaraz, of course, knows that super-charged atmosphere well. You might say he embodies it.So it wasn't the fact that Bellucci ended up losing his serve in the second game of the match that seemed so ominous, it was the way he lost it. At 15-40, he fired a serve and followed it with a forehand winner. One break point down. At 30-40, he fired another serve, drew a short reply from Alcaraz, and moved in for the kill. It looked for a split second that he would get himself out of the jam, and get on the board early—always a plus for an Ashe rookie.But instead of knocking off that short forehand at the peak of its bounce, Bellucci waited for the ball to come down a bit. And then, possibly because he wanted to see which way Alcaraz was going, he waited some more. When Bellucci finally swung, he could no longer pound it straight down. He had to use topspin to get it over the net and back down in the court. He didn't use enough, the ball went long, and he was broken.

Sorry, I gotta do my job. Carlos Alcaraz, to the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd

Bellucci was clearly tight and hesitant. Typically, a player in his position will lose the first set quickly, and then loosen up somewhere in the second, once he gets a couple holds under his belt. Bellucci did the first thing—he lost the opening set 6-1. But he never loosened up in the second, and lost it 6-0.Playing on Ashe at night is one thing. Doing it against an in-form and not-nervous Alcaraz, who has been spotted an early lead, is another, much worse proposition. An opponent of his can normally count on him dropping his level, donating you a few wild errors, and maybe helping you to a break of serve. But that wasn't the Alcaraz we saw on Wednesday. He was clean and in command. He won 86 percent of his first-serve points, had 17 break points on Bellucci's serve, was 14 of 18 at net, and hit 32 winners while holding his opponent to 11.“I played great, to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” Alcaraz said after his 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 win. “I tried to make the most of his mistakes, getting a good good rhythm.”

That said, the most important stat of the night was Bellucci's winner-to-error ratio: He hit 11 of the former, and made 35 of the latter. Even in the third set, when he had finally relaxed and Alcaraz had lost a little focus, Bellucci couldn't keep the ball in long enough to create any scoreboard pressure.“I know Mattia's level, and today wasn't his day,” Alcaraz said, while apologizing to the crowd for not making the match last longer.“Sorry, I gotta do my job.”

When I saw the draw, I won't say I circled this match, but I did think it would be interesting and potentially entertaining for a night crowd. When he's feeling good, Bellucci has a wide repertoire of shots and superb touch. His run to the semis in Rotterdam earlier this year, where he beat Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, was memorable. He killed them with his jumping backhand drop shot.But I can only remember Bellucci daring to hit that shot once against Alcaraz on Wednesday. It won him the point with a brilliantly angled short backhand, but it was a one-off, a glimpse of what could have been. Bellucci lost to Alcaraz, but he lost first to Ashe.As for the winner, he moves on to the third round, and a date with another, higher-ranked Italian, Luciano Darderi.

NEW YORK—Martin Damm is tall. NBA tall. Players of his size typically have a jackhammer serve, and he's lefty to boot. The 21-year-old American piles up aces with nasty angles short in the box, or firing missiles down the center line. It's the type of serve that forces opponents to make serious adjustments in order to return with any measure of consistency.Frances Tiafoe managed to crack the code in their encounter Wednesday afternoon on the Grandstand. It was a struggle, but by mixing court positioning, shortening his strokes and taking care of his own serve, the veteran managed just enough pressure on his return games to scratch out three breaks and take the match in four sets.

Even if you don't face servers of Damm's caliber, here are some tips you can use to handle an opponent with a dominant delivery:Accept Your LumpsWhen facing a huge server, it helps to have a short memory. They're going to pump some aces—Damm struck 27—and hit a slew of unreturned serves. Don't let it discourage you. Try to treat it like any other lost point. Take your medicine, shake it off, and get ready for the next point. If you let it turn you sour, it can bring your whole game down.Adjust Your PositioningDepending on where you typically stand to return serve, you may need to take at least a step or two back. This gives a split-second more time to react. If your opponent exploits the extra space to burn you with wide serves, move up to close that gap. That's what Tiafoe did from time to time, especially on the ad side. He also mixed his return stances to give Damm different looks, which can throw off the server's rhythm.

Forget about big swings. Get the racquet face in front of the ball to block or chip it back. Use the pace of the serve as your power source. Against really big servers, there may not even be time to adjust your grip between forehand and backhand. That's why at the pro level, players like Tiafoe often use their volley grip and use volley technique to return the ball. Just like when they're at net, they have little time to react, and need a universal grip and short swing to get the job done.Aim For Big Targets“Hit returns down the middle to limit errors and get into the rallies,” says Mark Kovacs, a high-performance coach who has worked with numerous touring pros.

Tiafoe's first serve of the match was a 98 MPH slider out wide that drew a return error. It's not unusual for him to top 130 on his serve, but he looked to beat Damm with placement over pace. He knew once the ball was in play, he had the advantage.If your opponent is dropping bombs, there's a temptation to match their serving power. That often leads to inconsistency and too many second serves. Tiafoe took care of what he could control and was never broken. The more you hold, the more you put pressure on your opponent's serve, eventually causing it to crack.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Veteran racers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez have been charged with leading Cadillac into their first Formula 1 season in 2026 – but how are the pair preparing for their respective F1 comebacks amid a “mountain of work”?

Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas were understandably buzzing when they faced the world's media following the announcement they would both be making sensational returns to the Formula 1 grid after sitting out this campaign.

The veteran duo, both 35, will line up for newcomers Cadillac next season, with 527 Grands Prix, 106 podiums and 16 Grand Prix victories between them. They will need every ounce of that experience as they battle to bring the new American squad up the grid.

Perez, who has spent time out with his family during his sabbatical, and Bottas, who has been at every race as part of his duties as Mercedes reserve, are aware of the mammoth task ahead of them, given Cadillac are kicking off from a standing start against 10 rival teams who have a wealth of experience competing in Formula 1. But that isn't fazing them.

For Perez, his focus is to find his love again for a sport that engulfed 14 years of his life, after a difficult last chapter that saw him end his time with Red Bull two years earlier than planned.

The Mexican, who is believed to have passed on an approach from Alpine and potential opportunities at other teams from 2027, believes having the opportunity to work with an aspiring team with significant resources from the ground up can help him do just that.

""My main target is to enjoy being back,"" said Perez, who has previously raced for Sauber, Mclaren, Force India/Racing Point and Red Bull. ""I had a very difficult year, especially my final year with Red Bull. This is a sport I love, and I want to get back to enjoyment.

""This project just brings me that excitement back because I'm able to put all my years of experience, the different teams I've worked with, to try to help this team move forward.

""We want to move forward as quickly as possible. We know we don't have time on our side, but we also can be a big surprise, because you see with the drivers, we're bringing as much experience as possible, but also commitment – and this is the same for all the areas in the team.

""It's a new team, but there is plenty of experience in the team, in the engineering departments, mechanics – everyone has a lot of experience in the sport. So, definitely, I believe in the project [and] that we can move quickly forwards.”

Perez was unhappy with the way his time in F1 ended – and thus he sees this as an opportunity to close out his career on his terms.

""I don't think I have anything to prove,"" he said. ""I want to enjoy he sport, the sport that I love, the sport that has given me so much.

""I couldn't afford to leave the way I left the sport, you know, and this is why I'm coming back with this new project. And yeah, I hope it's a very successful one. But amongst that, other than anything, I want to enjoy, to enjoy this comeback.""

Bottas – who spent five years with World Champions Mercedes as Lewis Hamilton's team mate from 2017-2021 – has been itching to get back behind the wheel, having missed out on a renewal at Sauber, which will become the Audi works project next year.

He's thrown himself headfirst into a reserve role for Mercedes, immersing himself in every element of the team, including simulator work and engineering meetings that included discussions on development for 2026, when new chassis and power unit regulations will be introduced.

Like Perez, he knows the challenge is huge – but the desire to succeed and confidence in himself, his team mate and the team means he is certain they can make progress.

""The first talks we had with Graeme [Lowdon, Team Principal] about this opportunity were about two years ago from now, and he's always kept me in touch on how things are going and progressing,"" said Bottas.

""And then, early on this year, it was clear for me that this is what I want. I want to be part of this great brand, this, let's say, start-up Formula 1 team, but with great structure and big goals.

""I'm here to give everything I have to the team. With Checo, we can definitely guide to the right direction. Of course, we're realistic. It's going to be a mountain of work to do, and it's going to probably be a difficult start, because it is Formula 1 – but we're not there to stay at the back.

""We don't want to finish last. And I believe with this structure, with this group, these people, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get relatively quickly up to the pace, and that way enjoy some success.

""We still have quite a few years left in the tank, with Checo I think, so the goal is to enjoy the success together eventually when we get there.”

Bottas, who began his career at Williams, added that his experience switching from World Champions Mercedes to midfield runners Sauber has helped him reset his targets for what is initially achievable with Cadillac.

""It's a bit like when I moved from Mercedes to Alfa [Sauber] – I kind of had to reset goals,"" said Bottas, who has twice finished second in the Drivers' standings. ""I've done that process already in my head for this one.

""Always mentally, if you prepare for the worst, it's better, because then whatever you achieve, that's going to be really positive and rewarding. So for me, just being involved, getting my hands dirty with the team. Once that progress and success will come, that's the trigger for me. That's going to do the thing for me and give me that reward.""

Perez echoed that mindset.

""It's important to reset my targets from the past,"" said Perez, who helped Red Bull win the teams' championship in 2023 while finishing a career-best second in the Drivers' standings. ""I'm here to progress together with the team.

""It's not where we start, it's how quickly we manage to progress. That's the main thing. I know racing drivers can get desperate. It's very easy to say it, but once you are on the grid for 24 races and you're fighting at the back, desperation can come.

""But to me, the main thing I'm here for is to make progress together with the team and to enjoy the ride, because at this point of my career, let's say that one trophy more, one less, it's irrelevant.

""I want to be able to enjoy the ride, but also just give my very best every single weekend. And if I'm able to do that for 24 weekends, then I'll be really happy.""

With all this in mind, Bottas and Perez's focus is on working together as a unit, rather than seeing each other as competitors, to give Cadillac the best chance to climb the pecking order.

""Being each other's enemies, this couldn't be more the opposite than the situation we're in now,"" said Bottas. ""We're here to work together. We don't need to prove anything to each other.

""I have respect for Checo. I know he's got respect for me. We are here in this together and really trying to guide the team forward and give everything to the team.

""We don't need to prove anything to anyone. We've got to put the team first. That's what we're here for and that's probably one of the biggest reasons why we were the chosen ones!

""We want to help the team. Of course, at the same time, we are competitors. We're going to drive as fast as we can. We want to perform the best we can but we have very clear priorities on this project.""

Perez added: ""I think having a reference like Valtteri, it's great because you know that Valtteri straight away will be on it and it's definitely a great reference.

""For Valtteri, myself, it's how fast we are able to move as a team forward. This is down to Valtteri and myself, to the whole team, how quickly we can integrate to each other and move this team forward.""

Bottas has had some limited running in old-spec F1 machinery as part of his Mercedes role, but Perez has been away from the wheel entirely since leaving Red Bull at the end of last season.

With that in mind, Cadillac are working to get them some mileage to get the cobwebs off ahead of pre-season testing, where there will be three tests (one in Barcelona and two in Bahrain) rather than just one to account for the brand-new cars to meet the new regulations.

As the team don't have any of their own cars to run, given they don't have an ""old"" car and their new car won't be ready until next year in line with their rivals, they will have to borrow one from another team.

As they will run Ferrari power units next season, it's likely that the laps will be in old-spec Ferraris.

""We'll be introducing car testing as well this year,"" said Lowdon. ""Obviously, we have to work with others to be able to do that, but that's perfectly allowable under the regulations.

""We just have a plan to steadily build up so that when we get to Melbourne, we hit the ground running.""

Perez added: ""Obviously, I haven't driven anything for a while other than karting with my son. But there are some plans with the team to test a Formula 1 car before the end of the year.

""Next year, with so much testing that we're going to have, it's going to make that dust go away extremely quickly. I know what Formula 1 is about and I will be ready to deliver from the first race onwards.”

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

It might take some luck for Max Verstappen to win at the Zandvoort track that he says still gives him “goosebumps” – but the reigning World Champion isn't ruling out the possibility.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen has made his home track of Zandvoort his fortress since the Dutch venue returned to the Formula 1 calendar in 2021, winning three times and finishing second once. But can he continue that run this weekend?

The reigning World Champion has won two Grands Prix this year but those were outstanding drives that very much went against the form book, with McLaren stretching their legs this year and emerging as the class leaders.

Verstappen sits 97 points (which is nearly four Grand Prix wins' worth of points) behind championship leader Oscar Piastri with 10 races to go, and he knows adding to his victory tally in Zandvoort and the chances of making it five titles on the bounce will be a challenge.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Lewis Hamilton is feeling ready for the second half of the 2025 season as he aims to go ""from strength to strength"" with the Ferrari team.

Lewis Hamilton is looking forward to a “restart” for the second half of the 2025 season, with the Ferrari driver admitting that he is focused on “getting back to enjoying my job” following the sport's summer break.

Hamilton faced some ups and downs during the opening half of the campaign as he began the process of adjusting to his new team – and the SF-25 car – following his switch from Mercedes.

While there were highlights – including his memorable Sprint victory at Round 2 in China – Hamilton also experienced some tough moments, with the seven-time World Champion being particularly critical of himself following a tricky weekend last time out in Hungary.

However, as the paddock reconvened in Zandvoort for the Dutch Grand Prix, Hamilton admitted that he was “excited to be back” and keen to “get going” again, having spent time with loved ones including his pet dog Roscoe during the break.

Reflecting back on the comments he made at the Hungaroring, where the 40-year-old had called himself “useless”, Hamilton said: “Firstly, in the heat of the moment, that can happen to anyone. It's obviously not truly how I feel.

“[In the break] I've just been with family – with my niece and nephew, with Roscoe, and it's been great. I've enjoyed being away and to unplug, then just bring myself back to my core. That's how I've always done it.

“Lots of meditation, finding gratitude in every single day and just realigning yourself to your core beliefs. They've always been there, and I will use those moving forwards.”

Pushed on how he is approaching the final 10 races of the year, Hamilton responded: “I think right now, it's just about calming some things down and focusing on getting back to enjoying my job. I love this sport, I always have.

“That's why I got into it, and I'm going to drown out all of the noise and just get back to… this is a great restart moment for us.”

The Briton went on to reflect on the steps that he and Ferrari have already taken during the season so far as he reiterated his belief in that upward trajectory continuing.

“For the second half of the season, I'm really excited to see the Tifosi next week [at Monza],” Hamilton explained. “That's the thing I'm probably most looking forward to, and then just going from strength to strength with the team.

“Everyone is working so hard back at the factory. As an athlete, I have very high standards for myself, and I know the team does too.

""It's difficult with all the work that we put in, when we don't get the results that we've worked for and probably deserve. But that's part of the process, and I believe we will get there. We are making progress, so we just have to keep going.”

While he expects the remainder of the campaign to pose its challenges, Hamilton added: “The break came at the perfect time. During that time was enough for me to reset, and we go into the second half which is going to be tough, but I've got the whole team behind me, which I'm confident that we'll make progress with in the second half of the season. Just stay positive, keep your head up.”

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Stichting HandicapNL will receive a €100,000 donation in recognition for their commitment to supporting those with physical, intellectual, or multiple disabilities.

Formula 1, together with multi-national lottery-led entertainment company and Official Partner Allwyn, are proud to name a leading Dutch accessibility charity as the first-ever winner of the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award.

Stichting HandicapNL will receive a €100,000 donation from Allwyn in recognition for their commitment to supporting those with physical, intellectual, or multiple disabilities through a range of programmes.

At the Dutch Grand Prix, they work with the promoter to provide special care amenities including accessible showers, toilets, medical rooms, sensory-friendly zones and an accessible viewing platform on the main straight.

The charity was awarded the accolade at this year's event in Zandvoort by an expert panel of judges from Formula 1, Allwyn, and the Dutch promoter, for its outstanding contribution in producing a positive impact in the local community.

The €100,000 donation from Allwyn will enable the organisation to take its operations to the next level and expand the reach of its work. With the prize fund, Stichting HandicapNL will make an additional four events accessible and provide support to a further six events.

The learnings from the existing programme will also serve to help the two million people living with disabilities in the Netherlands.

Established as part of Allwyn's multi-year partnership with Formula 1, the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award aims to recognise the outstanding contributions to society that F1-linked initiatives are making in their country. The award reflects a shared commitment in driving positive change and giving back to the communities in which they operate.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1 said: ""The F1 Allwyn Global Community Award is a perfect example of how Formula 1 can use partnerships to enact real change in the communities where it races.

""This unique collaboration has created a global platform to celebrate the fantastic local initiatives that go above and beyond to make a real difference. Stichting HandicapNL has helped transform experiences for many people living in the Netherlands, and the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award will help them to continue to expand their vital works and help people across the country.""

Jan Karas, CEO of OPAP, part of Allwyn, and F1 Allwyn Global Community Award judge, added: ""Stichting HandicapNL's impact here in the Netherlands is truly inspiring. At Allwyn, we want to bring fun and entertainment to as many people as possible – no one should have to face a physical barrier in doing so.

""Stichting HandicapNL's work is not just improving accessibility for F1 fans but is providing learnings that can be applied to different types and scales of events outside of the F1 environment.""

Jan Willem Koopman from Stichting HandicapNL, said: ""Our ultimate goal is that it becomes commonplace for people with disabilities to access and inclusively attend a whole festival or event, from start to finish. It has been fantastic working with Formula 1 at Zandvoort to make this track as accessible as possible and, thanks to this award, we can expand our operations.

""The donation from Allwyn will mean we can make four additional events more accessible, support a further six events with advice and assistance and develop new partnerships with like-minded organisations.

""It will also have a lasting impact in the long term, empowering even more people to attend events, challenging negative perceptions and creating a more inclusive society.""

In 2025, three more F1 Allwyn Global Community Award winners will be crowned and receive donations at the United States, Mexico City, and Las Vegas Grands Prix. The winners will be selected based on the impact they make across the four pillars of education, culture, wellbeing, and sustainability.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Dutch Grand Prix, from the pole position favourite to who might claim victory.

Formula 1 returns to action following the summer break with the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. But who are the favourites to get back up and running the quickest? Here are what the odds tell us...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri enters the Dutch Grand Prix weekend as the favourite for success. With six wins this term, the Australian tops the win charts and has missed out on a podium only twice in 14 starts.

On the other side of the McLaren garage, however, Lando Norris was the victorious driver at Zandvoort in 2024, and is the in-form driver with three wins from the last four events to close the points gap.

With three previous wins at the coastal venue, home hero Max Verstappen should not be written off. But with only two wins this season and a Red Bull that has struggled to match McLaren's pace on Sundays, this could be an uphill battle.

With the McLaren drivers each failing to feature on the podium just twice this season, the pair are heavy favourites to feature in the top three on Sunday afternoon.

Just behind Verstappen is Charles Leclerc, who has finished third twice in the last three years at Zandvoort, and has recently found form, with podiums in Austria and Belgium.

George Russell will look to go back-to-back following a top-three result last time out in Hungary, while Lewis Hamilton continues his search for a first Grand Prix podium for Ferrari.

Hamilton will be keen to return to the top six after two races outside of this bracket, most recently finishing in 12th. Before this, he had been a regular in the higher end of the points, finishing in the top six in six consecutive races from Imola to Silverstone.

Fernando Alonso was able to make the most of a strong weekend for Aston Martin in Hungary to reach the top six for the first time this term, but questions remain as to whether the team can repeat this level of performance.

Gabriel Bortoleto has shown consistent improvement across his rookie season, and achieved a career-best sixth place at the Hungaroring. He has also scored points in three of the last four races for Sauber.

Nico Hulkenberg and Isack Hadjar have taken the chequered flag in the top 10 places on five occasions this year. While Sauber driver Hulkenberg has scored in four of the last six races, Hadjar last scored at the Spanish Grand Prix for Racing Bulls.

In the other Racing Bulls entry, Liam Lawson has found recent form, with points in Austria followed by back-to-back eighth-place finishes in Belgium and Hungary.

Finishing seventh in two of the last three weekends, Lance Stroll could add to his Aston Martin points total.

Piastri and Norris remain the favourites to take pole position for McLaren, but the margins have been fine in Qualifying this term.

Leclerc claimed his first pole position of the season in Hungary, while Verstappen is tied with the McLaren pair on four for the campaign. Russell is the only other pole-sitter so far in 2025.

McLaren have only once failed to take pole position at consecutive races this year – this coming when Verstappen headed the grid in Saudi Arabia and Miami.

After 14 rounds, McLaren have been victorious 11 times, with Piastri contributing six to the cause, and Norris five. This total includes six of the last seven rounds. The team is dominating the Teams' Championship, with 559 points to Ferrari's 260.

Through Verstappen, Red Bull has topped the podium twice, while Mercedes has a single victory, courtesy of Russell.

	The Ye documentary In Whose Name? has released an explosive trailer, featuring appearances from Drake, Kim Kardashian and Elon Musk.


	Directed by Nico Ballesteros, the doc follows Ye (formerly Kanye West) from about 2018 until 2024 and is completely shot on an iPhone. The trailer jumps around from West's deteriorating relationship with then-wife Kim Kardashian — who filed for divorce in 2021 — to his failed 2020 presidential run and Sunday Service performances.


	“The best thing about being an artist who's bipolar is anything you do and say is an art piece,” Ye says in the clip.

	The doc pulls the curtain back on Ye to give fans an authentic look at the method to his madness in recent years and what makes him one of the most polarizing artists of the 21st century.

	There are plenty of celebrity cameos, including studio sessions with Drake, Pharrell and Swizz Beatz. West is also shown walking out with Playboi Carti and Marilyn Manson at the Donda 2 listening party in Miami and delves into his relationship with his children.

	“Should I have blown up the Gap sh–? Should I have blown up the Adidas sh–? But the answer is yes,” he says, referencing his split with the companies following his antisemitic remarks in 2022. 


In Whose Name? will be released in about 1,000 theaters across the U.S. on Sept. 19 for a limited time. Tickets can be purchased on the doc's website. “A documentary six years in the making,” a press release for the film reads. “3,000 hours of footage refined to one story about the world's most polarizing living artist.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: How I Met Your Father star Hilary Duff is returning to Hulu and reuniting with 20th Television for Pretty Ugly, a drama series she is attached to star in and executive produce. The Disney streamer is developing the project, from writer Kirker Butler, director Silver Tree and Aaron Kaplan's Kapital Entertainment.


	Butler is writing Pretty Ugly based on his 2015 novel of the same name. Miranda Miller's (Duff) mission in life is to make her ten-year-old daughter Bailey the most successful child pageant contestant in the United States. A former teenage pageant queen herself, Miranda dreams of endorsement deals, beauty brands, maybe even a TV show. Bailey, however, wants none of it. She's been doing pageants since she was three months old and is burned out.

	But Miranda can't imagine slowing down. In fact, she's seven months pregnant and already mapping out her unborn daughter's future pageant career. While Miranda is busy building her empire, her husband Ray, a nurse with a hobby of taking random pills, has knocked up the eighteen-year-old granddaughter of one of his hospice patients; and her mother Joan, a widowed shut-in, is plotting a murder with Jesus. It's all pretty ugly.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Duff, Butler and Silver Tree executive produce alongside Kaplan. 20th TV and Kapital are the co-studios.


	Former Lizzie McGuire star Duff most recently headlined Hulu's How I Met Your Mother offshoot How I Met Your Father, produced by 20th TV. She also starred in the TV Land comedy Younger, which found new popularity on Netflix this year. Duff is repped by CAA, Linden Entertainment and Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks.

	











	This marks the latest collaboration between Butler and Kaplan. He previously worked on Kapital's series The Neighbors for ABC, Life In Pieces for CBS and HouseBroken for Fox, as well as the HBO Max pilot Delilah. Butler's series credits also include Only Murders in the Building, Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. He is repped by WME and Jackoway Austen.


	Silver Tree recently wrapped the pilot of Prime Video's YA series Off Campus as director and executive producer. She will next film a block of Netflix's limited series The Altruists. Silver Tree previously served as director and executive producer on the Netflix dark comedy series No Good Deed. She worked in the same capacity on Paramount+'s Fatal Attraction, HBO Max's The Flight Attendant Season 2, Netflix's You Season 3, and Showtime's Shameless.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Star Trek: Strange New Worlds gets goofy with Patton Oswalt","https://www.avclub.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-recap-season-3-episode-8","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

One of the things that's quickly becoming clear about my critical relationship to Strange New Worlds is that I'm way more likely to handwave away concerns for a comedic episode than a dramatic one. And I don't think that's about lowering my standards for one tone over the other. It's more to do with the fact that—rightly or wrongly—I think of both '60s and '90s Star Trek as cheerily buoyant shows that occasionally broke things up with heavier episodes rather than the other way around. So when Strange New Worlds goes goofy, it feels “right” to me in a way that zombies or war documentaries don't. 

Indeed, part of what made the first two seasons of Strange New Worlds so enchanting is that they returned to the “comfort food” vibe that other Alex Kurtzman-era shows like Discovery and Picard didn't necessarily prioritize. That's on display in “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans,” which echoes those lighthearted '90s Trek episodes I used to love as a kid. (Think “Deja Q” or “Civil Defense.”) This season has brought back Trelane, revived the holodeck, and reunited (pre-united?) the Original Series crew, and yet this is the first episode of the season that's actually made me feel nostalgic for a past era of Star Trek, even if it doesn't manage to find a payoff as satisfying as its setup. 

I'd go so far as to say that “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans” all but falls apart in its final act, to the point where I almost wonder if something came up in Patton Oswalt's schedule that only allowed him to spend a day filming his role as Doug, the Vulcan who wants to be human. While this whole madcap adventure about four humans getting turned into Vulcans feels like it's building to a climax anchored in a Vulcan who yearns to understand humanity, the finale skips over that thread almost as soon as it's introduced.  

Thankfully, “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans” still brushes up against one of my favorite topics: how different actors play Vulcans. This week, Pike, La'An, Chapel, and Uhura find themselves turned into pointy eared logic fiends after a temporary transformation refuses to wear off. It's hilarious how the episode takes the time to set up a complicated, compelling reason for the away team to change their species (the Vulcans aided a pre-warp planet before founding the Federation/creating the Prime Directive, and now that planet needs technical assistance) only to have the group finish their actual mission in an instant and get stuck as Vulcans while the Enterprise is on shore leave. 

That means the episode is really juggling these questions: What makes a Vulcan a Vulcan? And who are Pike, La'An, Chapel, and Uhura at their cores? What of their essence remains even as they get Vulcan anatomy (and hairstyles) and a souped-up dose of Spock's socialized logic? 

While a stronger episode would've taken those questions a little more seriously, “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans” is mostly just interested in letting Anson Mount, Christina Chong, Jess Bush, and Celia Rose Gooding cut loose. I've always maintained that playing a Vulcan is one of the greatest acting challenges there is and only a small handful of actors have actually done it successfully. And here we get to see the full gamut of how Vulcans have been portrayed over the years: Pike is blunt and anal retentive, Chapel is obsessed with science and efficiency, Uhura goes all in on self-betterment, and La'An is (hilariously) just a Romulan. (Serious kudos to whichever writer realized that Pike's alt universe experience in “A Quality Of Mercy” and La'An's time travel trip in “Tomorrow And Tomorrow And Tomorrow” means they both have knowledge about that Vulcan/Romulan connection that the rest of Starfleet won't learn about until Kirk's time.) 

Gooding comes closest to nailing the true Vulcan essence, with Bush and Chong putting in a solid effort too. Mount, meanwhile, is just doing his own wacky thing per usual. In fact, everything with Pike is as over-the-top as his hair, and this episode certainly isn't above going hacky with its comedy. But there's also a pleasant hangout vibe to the whole thing, which makes it different than past Vulcan comedy episodes like “Wedding Bell Blues” or “Charades.” There's no high-stakes “big event” this is all leading up to, just a lot of small everyday incidents, like Uhura bending Beto to her new Vulcan way of life or Chapel becoming a monastic workaholic. 

While you could argue this whole exercise is a bit insulting to Vulcans, the fact that our heroes are weird, scientifically altered hybrids with human katras sort of handwaves that concern for me. (As Spock puts it, Vulcans feel things deeply and it takes a lot of learned effort to keep that in check.) And some of the funniest parts of this episode are just the non-altered crew dealing with the madness of their new Vulcan co-workers. Kirk and Scotty get to develop a bro-y little friendship as they try to stop La'An from taking over the ship. And I love the scene in Pelia's quarters where the crew begin “lightly plotting” how to convince their friends to switch back instead of choosing to live as Vulcans permanently.

Carol Kane gets some killer line deliveries this week. (I'm still laughing about the joke about LSD.) And it's fun to see Marie as one of the gang, especially since this episode finally remembers she has an actual Starfleet career of her own too. (She's not fit to return to captain's duties yet, but she does get a promotion at the Starfleet Judicial Department after yelling at her Vulcan boss.) It's also quite sweet that Spock finally gets to commiserate with his human pals about how judgmental and cold Vulcans can be and that he gets to meet a Vulcan who looks up to his unique Vulcan-human experience rather than treating him as “not enough.” 

While not all the jokes land, the overall comedic rhythm of the first half feels right, which only makes it more frustrating that the episode drops the ball in the second. Though I was excited for a more Una-focused story, the episode unfortunately just falls back on the lazy sight gag of a hot woman fawning over an average-looking guy, without adding any specificity or nuance to her actual relationship with Doug and what draws them together. (Rebecca Romijn has some good comedic impulses, but there's just nothing lived-in for her to play.)

And I'm still not sure what to make of the fact that this whole thing ultimately resolves with Spock and La'An doing a sexy fight-dance in her mind palace. (Love the Beluga whales in the windows though.) If this is all meant to be a Spock/La'An story, the episode really doesn't do a good job of centering their dynamic. We end with La'An still freaking out that Spock left a pair of socks in a drawer in her quarters, even though it felt like the dance was meant to prove their compatibility. If anything, it would've been far more interesting to give her a sexy dance with Kirk to emphasize the love-triangle aspect this episode leans into. 

It was during Spock and La'An's So You Think You Can Dance entry that I really started to wonder if they couldn't get Oswalt for as long as they wanted and had to rewrite the episode at the last minute or something. Apparently they were a day away from filming the first episode of the season when the writers' strike began in May 2023. They didn't resume production until the strike ended, so maybe there really were logistical problems or scheduling issues they didn't anticipate when they originally crafted their slate of scripts.  

In fact, I'm starting to wonder if the strike explains why so many of this season's episodes have felt underbaked in various ways. Perhaps the delay impacted the flow of production or how many passes the writers were able to do on scripts. At the very least, it's one more piece of the puzzle to consider as we near the end of this uneven season. 

Still, for all its flaws, there's something about “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans” I found heartening too. When Strange New Worlds began, it used the charisma and chemistry of its ensemble to paper over some of its storytelling weaknesses. And I really felt that charisma and chemistry return in full force this week. Little moments like Ortegas yelling about her “chaos family” or Kirk and Scotty celebrating over a glass of Scotch or everybody chilling on Pelia's curved sofa (I love that set!) recapture a vibe that feels distinct to this show—all while evoking a long legacy of Star Trek comedy episodes in the process. “Four-And-A-Half Vulcans” may not be the most logical episode of Strange New Worlds, but its heart is in the right place.

Disappointed and distressed that their superiors can't see their minor geniuses—dehydrated blueberries and cascading garden balconies, respectively—they bond over a distrust of the old guard and an immediate hope in one another, one that blooms with the swift surreality of a time-lapsed flower reaching maturation in a minute flat. Before they leave the kitchen, they're in love. But unbeknownst to them, the war of The Roses has begun.

Calling it a meet-cute wouldn't be accurate. They don't do “cute.” When it comes to Ivy and Theo, unapologetic audacity is the only road traveled, which makes for a beginning as explosive as the ending. “But we haven't even had sex yet,” Ivy says suggestively, the two having only just exchanged names. “Well, that's only minutes away,” returns Theo. The seemingly pre-programmed words tumble out of their mouths as if they were suddenly out of control, on existential autopilot, as surprised by what they're saying as we are.

Soon after they meet, they leave the U.K. for California, where they take root and raise a couple kids. In the first phase of their life together, Theo rises through the ranks of the architecture world and Ivy shapes the children, as well as the family's every meal, much to her pleasure. Opinionated, irreverent, and secure, even in the face of each other, the Roses possess an ebullience and resilience that slowly erodes (albeit, in hilarious fashion) under the rushing river of marriage management and child-rearing that comes to dominate their busying lives.

The cultural significance of Warren Adler's The War Of The Roses bookended the 1980s with the release of his novel in '81 and the Danny DeVito-directed film in '89. In 2025, the book and movie might as well be historical artifacts, but the ghost of the story has stuck around. The tale of two embittered lovers going straight for the jugular carries across generations—it's unfortunately supremely relatable. Modernized remake The Roses sits under the glass ceiling of the rom-com genre and walks on well-tread narrative territory. But, under Jay Roach's measured direction, that's not a problem. He gives the timeless story an original edge, never allowing a dull frame to slow the sharp film. 

One can't imagine Ivy and Theo together after the opening scene, a disastrous marriage counseling session that ends with the therapist swearing them off in the name of incurable resentment, self-righteousness, and defensiveness as the crumbling couple gangs up on the innocent clinician in a fit of delirious enablement. (In the therapist's defense, the nicest thing either of them had to say about each other was, “He has arms.”) A dark, organ-reeling jazz jam propels the sequence, a tonal harbinger of the passion and ferocity to come and a bellwether for the film's terrific taste in music, both in Severance composer Theodore Shapiro's score and the inspired indie-folk soundtrack.

However, it's also almost impossible to imagine the pair apart after the first hour of inimitable chemistry and pitch-black comedy charm. Things finally go awry when Theo's attempt at a masterpiece—a maritime museum in the shape of a large sailing vessel—opens on the same night an unparalleled storm hits the bay. But the storm also gives way to a new opportunity for Ivy. In the second act, the couple's dynamic flips, and she's the globetrotting careerist to Theo's stay-at-home dad.  Eventually, they each get the opportunity to fund the others' dreams, and they do. But it's still not enough. The tides turn practically overnight, and the sudden desperation for divorce begets an avalanche of life-ruining sabotage.

Supporting them are Kate McKinnon and Andy Samberg (American friends, met at a gun range) in career-best bit parts: A bizarro, kinky-sad, nothing-to-lose, overfamiliar type for the former—an equal blend of Sheila Sovage, Debette Goldry, and Kathryn Hahn in Step Brothers—and an obliviously overconfident dude-bro for the latter. But, instead of an unhinged couple in their 20s or 30s, they've adapted their mode to the disillusionment of 40-somethings sunk up to the eyes in suburban suppression. Allison Janney takes a terse turn as an unbearable divorce lawyer, while Ncuti Gatwa and Sunita Mani stand out among the rest of the stacked cast.

Roach—the wunderkind studio comedy director (the Austin Powers trilogy, Meet The Parents and Fockers) turned historical dramatist (Trumbo, Bombshell)—hasn't delivered much of note in the last nine years. But he's back with a bang in The Roses. There's a rejuvenated spirit to his pace and craft that stems from a now-veteran wisdom and the fresh collaboration with screenwriter Tony McNamara, who's had enormous success in film, alongside Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite, Poor Things, Cruella), and TV (The Great), since 2018.

Having written a much looser and sharper-tongued Colman character in The Favourite—which is saying a lot, considering Ivy names her dainty seafood shack “We've Got Crabs!”—McNamara precisely pens her role, while Colman winks, flirts, punches, swings, and sings right in her comfort zone. To make the rich richer, it turns out Cumberbatch is McNamara's male Colman. The wit and restraint behind his interpretation of the driven-husband-turned-superdad is grounded in this same script-star chemistry. As a result, the leads are magnets, whether they're surgically picking each other apart with the cruelty of Caligula or steaming up a seductive romance. Their remarkable rapport makes The Roses essential viewing, a must-watch rom-com.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Dr. Phil's former broadcasting partners accuse him of conspiring to screw them over","https://www.avclub.com/dr-phil-accused-conspiracy-bankrupt-merit-street","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 19:01:53 GMT","

Dr. Phil's contentious legal battle over the bankruptcy of his media venture, Merit Street Media, has taken a juicy turn. Merit's former broadcasting partners Trinity Broadcasting and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) have joined forces to accuse Phil McGraw of all sorts of shady shit, most notably that he swindled both organizations for millions and then used the bankruptcy to launch a new media venture, Envoy. This week, Trinity complained in court that McGraw has been going to “extraordinary lengths” to avoid deposition (per Deadline). 

One of his deposition-dodging tactics is allegedly refusing to hand over relevant materials for discovery in Trinity's breach of contract lawsuit. But the materials PBR has managed to acquire are pretty damning. Text messages from Merit Street's chief operating officer Joel Cheatwood suggest a bankruptcy conspiracy, evidenced by the fact that he instructed employees to keep all communications off of their work emails. The texts (via The Independent) lay out a scheme to wind down operations at Merit Street while shifting staffers over to Envoy. “The way this will probably work is once MSM is wound down there will be an auction of assets and newco will bid to buy the MSM program library,” he explained in one text. He also texted that he and Merit's Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon needed to “be very careful with our public activities associated with Envoy since we are still full and active employees” of Merit, adding that any “[a]ctivities that would indicate we are more focused on Envoy could be problematic if called into question.”

“The Debtor and its executives knew the Envoy scheme was problematic and tried to conceal it by using only personal emails and texts. On June 30 (two days before the bankruptcy), Mr. Cheatwood instructed a colleague that ‘any communication involving timing of events, strategies, etc. we need to not use the merit street e-mail system. Use text instead,'” PBR's filing reads. (PBR hasn't outright sued Merit Street, but accused the company of failing to pay millions in owed payments.) “The documents produced to date demonstrate that this bankruptcy was conceived as a scheme to divert the Debtor's employees and intellectual property to Envoy, a competing business Dr. Phil founded the day before this case was filed, and leave the Debtor's business as a shell with nothing more than a repeated loop of re-runs.”

“By its own admission in a meet-and-confer between counsel on August 26, 2025, Peteski still has not produced all of Phillip C. McGraw's emails and text messages (despite his deposition being scheduled to begin in less than 48 hours from the time of such conference), nor has it produced all of the documents concerning Envoy,” Trinity stated in its own filing (via Deadline). “Peteski's same delay tactics persist. The pattern is so striking that it is more than mere déjà vu; it is a deliberate rerun, scripted by parties who have decided that the Court's orders are optional guidance rather than binding directives.”

Bridget Moynahan is cherishing traditions and milestones with her son, Jack Brady. The “Blue Bloods” star and iconic “Sex & the City” alum, 54, shared a rare selfie with the 18-year-old, her son with Tom Brady, during a sweet outing at the US Open on August 27.

“Traditions at the @usopen,” Moynahan captioned the Instagram photo, thanking Emirates for hosting “an incredible night of tennis.”

A post shared by Bridget Moynahan (@bridgetmoynahan)

In the snap, Moynahan looked chic in oversized glasses and a cream-colored sweater, while Jack, smiling beside her, bore a striking resemblance to his famous father in a navy polo.

A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)

The outing came just days after Jack celebrated his 18th birthday, a milestone both parents marked with emotional tributes. Brady shared a heartfelt message on Instagram on August 22.

“From little steps to big dreams, happy birthday Jack,” the former New England Patriots quarterback wrote. “You've always shown grace, courage, love and kindness since God blessed us with your arrival. I'm so proud of the man you are! Welcome to adulthood, it comes with higher credit card limits, bigger bills, and no curfew… OK, maybe not all at once!”

A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)

Since stepping away from the NFL, Brady has been candid about how much he treasures fatherhood. He shares Jack with Moynahan, as well as Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen.

When Jack once shared his dream of becoming a basketball player, Brady said he was instantly supportive. “Unfortunately, he jumps as high as I do,” he joked at the Fortune Global Forum, as per TMZ. “But I tell him, ‘Dude, you're gonna be a stud. Wait till you hit your growth spurt, you're gonna be dunkin'.' Whether he does or not, who cares? I want him to know his dad's got his back.”

Brady also reflected on the deeper meaning of parenthood in a sweet birthday message to Jack. “There is a saying that a dad's heart soars with his children's happiness, not with his own… truer words could not be spoken,” he wrote. “We love you so much and I know this will be your best year yet.”

With Moynahan's sweet US Open outing and Brady's moving birthday tribute, it's clear both parents are proud of the young man their son has become as he steps into adulthood.

Brady and Moynahan dated from around 2004 to late 2006. Jack was born in August 2007. By then, Brady was already in a relationship with Gisele Bündchen (whom he later married in 2009).

Cynthia Bailey has got to be one of the busiest Bravo stars around. Aside from returning to the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” as a friend, she has also been busy with a new film project. Now comes the news that Bailey has teamed up with Jovani to launch a collection of high-end womenswear.

Bailey shared the news herself in an Instagram post on August 23, 2025.

She first teased her Jovani collaboration on Instagram, in a photo with RHOA's Phaedra Parks and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Adrienne Maloof. The ladies reunited at a Tequila Comisario promotional event, where Cynthia was spotted wearing one of her new pieces.

In a separate post from the same event, the reality star officially introduced her new collaboration with Jovani. She captioned her Instagram post, “Cynthia Bailey Suit Collection X JOVANI coming soon! This is one of my samples. What do you guys think?”

A post shared by Cynthia Bailey (@cynthiabailey)

So far, Cynthia hasn't provided any further details on the availability of the collaboration or when the products are expected to be released.

Bailey also recently wrapped up filming a new short film, “Diamond.” She took to Instagram to share some behind-the-scenes snaps and shared her thoughts on the project as well. 

She captioned her post, “So excited to share some behind-the-scenes photos from the upcoming short film DIAMOND written & directed by @dhardy99 that I just finished working on. I prayed for an acting role where I can go dark, deep & be vulnerable. My role as LaTonya has so many layers as a mother, wife & heroin addict. I am actually the only female casted alongside 3 talented male actors & I have to give them there flowers for being such kind & generous actors. @jemarcus_kilgore plays my teenage son & he made me feel safe to implode emotionally. He is a superstar.

@noah.thetalent plays my youngest son & is INCREDIBLE. Such a sweetheart & made me cry watching his scenes. @vernondavis85, who needs no introduction, plays my husband.We don't have many scenes together, but be ready for his powerful performance!!!Thank you to the entire production team. You guys work so hard. And always THANK YOU, you God, for always keeping me humble, in the light & focused on living my dreams.”

Cynthia Bailey enjoys keeping herself busy with multiple projects at a time. Would you like to see her return to RHOA full-time, or do you prefer her in a supporting role as a friend to the cast?

A major star for the majority of his adult life, Jay Kelly has so thoroughly subsumed himself into his classic screen persona — smirking, debonair, heroic — that he no longer seems to know who he is off set. More troublingly, the world-famous actor has come to like it that way. As Sylvia Plath once wrote: “It's a hell of a responsibility to be yourself. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.” 

That quote serves as an almost oppressively fitting epigraph for the misty-eyed Netflix movie that Noah Baumbach has made about one of the last true Hollywood stars — or two of them, I should say, as Jay Kelly is so transparent a stand-in for the actor who plays him that he and George Clooney share the same body of work. (No complaint here: “Funny People” is one of my favorite genres). Plath's words help to frame “Jay Kelly” as the story of a dashing sexagenerian who's known by everyone and no one in equal measure, but Baumbach's uncharacteristically precious screenplay, co-written with thee Emily Mortimer, has little trouble articulating that dilemma on its own terms.

Related Stories That ‘Star Wars: Starfighter' First Look Is Our Line in the Sand: No More Black and White First Look Images! Emma Stone Brings Yorgos Lanthimos' ‘Funny and F**ked-Up' ‘Bugonia' to Venice — and If It's an Oscar Movie, She Should Go Lead 

One catchy line that claws at the same idea: “All my memories are movies.” Jay delivers it towards the start of the film, so soon after he's wrapped production on a new crime picture — “8 Men from Now,” which ends with the actor dying for the umpteenth time — that he might as well still be reading from a script. There's an immediately perceptible twinge of regret in Clooney's voice, like the kind of shooting pain that can't mean anything serious so long as you choose to ignore it, but the real wound of that double-bladed dialogue won't be felt until much later. 

 










The problem for Jay isn't that his movies are memories, and that he's gone from one part to another for so long that he's forgotten how to act without the cameras rolling; that's a problem, but also one that has always managed to solve itself. No, the problem for Jay is that his memories are movies: They're frozen in time, shared by everyone who's seen them, and practically impossible to change once they've been cemented in the public imagination. On set, Jay has the power to go again. To do another take. To get one more just for safety. In life, however, he has to live with the choices he's made. And as Jay reaches a certain age and starts being threatened with career tributes, he suddenly finds himself forced to watch those choices back in a veritable supercut of great success and profound misgiving. 

Which is to say that yes, “Jay Kelly” is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves. Baumbach lacks Sofia Coppola's singular ability to leverage a character's wealth for the wanting it reveals of them, but he, Mortimer, and Clooney share a vivid understanding of the resentments that can form in the space between who we are and how we're seen — and of how stardom can widen that space to the point that friendships and families are liable to fall into it unnoticed. 

 










It's a space that Baumbach explores here with an unusually gentle touch. On the one hand, the “Meyerowitz Stories” director has never been as allergic to sentimentality as his prickliest work might suggest, and I find it hard to begrudge any of the great filmmakers for going soft as they get older — we should all be so lucky to reach the back half of our lives and feel as if the world was a kinder, more loving place than we once thought. On the other hand, watching a director as scabrous as Noah Baumbach make a movie as tenderly indrawn as “Jay Kelly” can feel like watching a ginsu knife get dulled into a loofah. 

Here, Baumbach compensates for that sometimes clumsily overdrawn emotionality by rooting his film in a cragged bedrock of sadness — one that adds a serrated edge to the constant refrain of “I was too busy having sex with movie stars to spend time with my daughters” melancholy. That sadness is baked into the story from the start, as “Jay Kelly” begins with the death of a mentor figure named Peter (Jim Broadbent, seen in flashback), who directed Jay's breakout success 30 years earlier. Peter was desperately fending off irrelevance the last time they spoke, and had begged Jay to help him get his comeback project off the ground. Jay felt the project was too raw and vulnerable for his brand, and was unmoved by Peter's appeal to his filial duty. In the end, Peter failed to get the movie financed, and Jay can't help but suspect that it literally killed him.

 










That suspicion furrows something deep behind Jay's eyes; it's a serious wrinkle on the face of someone whose job requires him to be a dimple-cheeked blank slate at all times, pliable enough to play a variety of parts but always recognizably “himself.” A whole team of people have devoted the best years of their lives to ensuring that Jay never has to feel anything worse than mild discomfort, his sweet if self-annihilating manager Ron Sukenick (Adam Sandler) chief among them, but they don't pick up on the aftershocks of Peter's death until after it's too late. They don't know what's going to happen when Jay is lured to a bar for a post-funeral drink with his old acting school friend Timothy (Billy Crudup), who's aged into a pediatrician with a serious chip on his shoulder.

The next thing Ron knows, Jay has a black eye, he's pulling out of the big new movie he's due to start in a few days, and he's loading his entire team onto a plane to France as part of a wildly ill-advised plan to crash his teenage daughter's European vacation and spend some quality time with her before she goes to college in the fall. It's the perfect setup for a Sturgian misadventure across the continent, but “Jay Kelly” — more frantic than funny, and increasingly trending towards wistful revelation — is less interested in pursuing madcap laughs than it is in exploring the life of the mind. And so an overnight train ride that puts Jay among the common folk becomes the venue for a head trip down memory lane, complete with Trafalmadorian flashbacks that taunt the movie star by denying him another take. 

 










By design, “Jay Kelly” strikes an uneasy balance between moving forward and being stuck in the past. The long and emotionally imprecise flashbacks — which find Jay revisiting the critical audition where he upstaged Timothy, a set romance he had with one of his co-stars, and a more recent therapy session that he attended with his semi-estranged adult daughter (Riley Keough) — are meant to act as headwinds for a story about a man careening out of control, but none of them crackle with Baumbach's usual wit, and all of them suffer from a slightly elevated tone that only serves the “unreality” of Jay's life by making every part of it even harder to believe. 

That Clooney is just playing a sadder, more blinkered version of himself — one who never found a lasting love, nor started a family he was interested in keeping — would seem to solve any issues of verisimilitude, and there are a number of sequences in “Jay Kelly” where his real-life fame adds credence to the chaos we're seeing on-screen (most of them having to do with a starstruck member of the public). There are also several moments in which the self-reflexiveness of Clooney's casting effectively baits us into believing that the Cary Grant of his day is baring his soul for our edification. That he's waving us backstage and confessing the awful truth that some part of ourselves always looked for behind every red carpet smile and Golden Globes acceptance speech. That he's not that happy. That his life isn't perfect. That money, looks, and an unimpeachable run across the six greatest seasons of any network drama ever made don't make him better than us, even though that third thing objectively does. 

 










The last of those moments is heartstoppingly transcendent, as Baumbach brings the full weight of Clooney's iconography to bear on Jay's most private misgivings. The problem is that the rest of them rely on Clooney's persona to get the job done, and — in stark contrast to the unsparing honesty of “Funny People” — they aren't mean enough to sell us on the idea that Jay could be such a dithering cocker spaniel in his private life (there's a reason why Ron always addresses him as “puppy,” besides the fact that Ron addresses all of his clients that way). 

There's no use in faulting Clooney for his performance, as no one does Clooney better, and his leading man appeal — somehow wide-eyed and “aw shucks” at the same time — has seldom been used more acutely than it is here. Alas, his ineffable Clooney-ness also has the perverse effect of making “Jay Kelly” less convincing at the same time, at least so far as its lead character is being played by a man who makes all of his foibles that much harder to believe. I'm sure George Clooney has problems of his own, but no one would have a harder time inhabiting the problems that Corge Glooney is meant to have in this movie. That Jay Kelly's flaws clash against George Clooney's charms is precisely the point, of course — one is simply no match for the other. 

 










It's up to the rest of the cast to help level the playing field, but the only thing “Jay Kelly” does with its traveling circus is to winnow them down one by one as they get tired of Jay's antics. He's the overgrown child who takes them away from their actual children, blithely indifferent to the fact that he means more to them than they do to him in return. 

Some employees, like his publicist (Laura Dern), bail at the first sign of real trouble. Others, like Ron, are suffering from too great a sunk-cost fallacy to quit on him now. Sandler wears the shit out of a puffy Polo vest, and it's fun to see him lead with quiet resignation instead of unchecked rage, but I don't know if he's ever starred in a movie that's given him less to do. While Baumbach uses Ron to gesture at the specifically Hollywood complications of mixing business with pleasure, and to address the sheer number of people who are subsumed into the personal identity of a single brand-name star (“You're Jay Kelly,” Ron moans, “but I'm Jay Kelly too”), the character never develops beyond the tender embodiment of all the things his boss has forfeited along the way, including self-awareness, a cohesive family, and a wife played by Greta Gerwig. 

Getting close to other people was something that Jay always planned to do later, and the prospect of receiving a tribute from a Tuscan film festival is an unavoidable sign that he's running out of time. But other people were always going to be incidental to what really matters about “Jay Kelly,” a gorgeously bittersweet shortfaller that hits hardest as a cautionary tale about the perils of trying to avoid oneself in a world that only allows us to act like there's anyone else for us to be. Being a movie star just makes it that much easier to pass on the roles you were born to play. 

 










“Jay Kelly” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Netflix will release it in select theaters on Friday, November 14, and on Netflix on Friday, December 5.

Shouldn't a first look, you know, actually give you a first look at a movie? Especially when it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” set we've seen in over six years?

 It's been that long since “The Rise of Skywalker” came out, that long that Lucasfilm has been figuring what the future of “Star Wars” would be on the big screen. And now we have heard that the upcoming “Star Wars: Starfighter,” set in the years after “Rise of Skywalker,” has set much of the rest of its cast — Amy Adams, Aaron Pierre, Flynn Gray, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, and Daniel Ings join the already announced Ryan Gosling, Matt Smith, and Mia Goth — is going into production, and is giving us a first look.

If you can even call it a first look. What's the opposite of a first look? A blank stare. That's kinda what Gosling and Gray are doing above. 

Look, a posed photo of the actors just being themselves isn't always terrible — the epochal 2014 “Force Awakens” cast photo was incredible, just to see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford occupy the same space once again, but that involved a level of interest that simply is not yet there for “Starfighter.”

 










Three IndieWire staffers had strong thoughts about this “Star Wars: Starfighter” first look, and we're going to vent them like superheated plasma.

Over the course of a normal workday — especially one in the thick of fall film festival season — one can probably imagine the glut of emails that arrive with tick-tock regularity in the ol' IndieWire inboxes, so the unexpected ones? Those require a higher level of interest to get me clicking. A “first look” image of the next “Star Wars” movie? That fits the bill — but, alas. There's no question that plenty of words and phrases have lost their meaning in recent years, and “first look” seems to be one of them, at least in the entertainment space.

What should a true “first look” be? Well, for my money, it should be an actual production still, an initial peek not quite behind the curtain, but adjacent to it. I want to get a sense of what the final film will look like and feel like, a little action, a little movement. A black and white still — not, it seems clear, a photo taken during the filming of a real scene — with our stars (or is it their characters? that's always unclear) simply resting on a landspeeder, everything so dark and muddled that it's impossible to see much else? There are, uh, big pipes? Sure. Star Ryan Gosling might be wearing a cape? Fine. 

 










It's fine enough to mark the start of production with some glamour shots, but a “first look” this does not make, because it doesn't speak to the primary function of these kinds of photos: it doesn't tell me about the film itself. It doesn't even tell me about the making of this film (think about that recent first look for Richard Linkater's “Nouvelle Vague,” which captured the impish creative charm that runs through the final film). And don't even get me started on the use of black and white. “Star Wars” films used to have some pop and pizzazz, but this first look? Doesn't tell me anything.

It's not just funny, it's fitting, that the very first reply on Discussing Film's tweet with the photo is “It is time for ‘Drive' in space.” Because there's almost nothing that actually connotes “Star Wars” here other than the vaguest outline of a landspeeder. Why is this in black and white other than because of some idea that black and white signifies importance? If this is really a set from the movie, it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” movie set in over six years — we deserve to see that in color. You know, the way the movie itself will be presented? Gosling doesn't look like he's in a flight suit, and Flynn Gray looks like he's just Ezra from “Star Wars: Rebels” come to life, even though we know this movie will be set in a time when Ezra is a middle-aged man. What is there here to be really excited about? You couldn't even have a glimpse of an actual “Star Wars” starfighter in this first look at “Star Wars: Starfighter”? Maybe give us an A-Wing, to think outside the box a bit. Hell, throw Expanded Universe fans a bone and make it an E-Wing. I'm not saying that there needs to be some Easter Egg to suggest Gosling is playing Corran Horn (though, let's face it, any diehard “Star Wars” fan will tell you they could do a lot worse than adapting Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston's peerlessly great “X-Wing” books), but something to suggest, you know, intrigue. “Who's that guy?” People loved asking that when Vanity Fair would run their (color!) first looks at “Star Wars” movies back in the day. No one is going to ask “Who's that guy?” about this image.

 










Sometimes, a traumatic experience burns itself so deeply into your psyche that your worldview is irreparably altered. For me, one such memory was the first look photo for “Tulsa King” Season 1 dropping. The year was 2022, we hadn't seen a trailer for the Sylvester Stallone-led gangster series, and the world was hopelessly naive to the crime comedy delights that awaited us. But, one day, our first breadcrumb arrived… and it was just a picture of Stallone standing in a suit, looking exactly like I imagine he looks when he goes out for coffee on a random Tuesday. 

Perhaps it was just a formative memory because it came early in my media career, but I remember being dumbfounded by the notion that a show whose entire appeal rested on a single star would announce itself with such a regular-ass picture of said star. (To give some reluctant credit, he was standing in Tulsa, but I feel that's a detail we could have inferred from the title.) Close friends of mine know not to bring up the “Tulsa King” first look around me anymore because it often devolves into a rant that has real potential to ruin a night. 

“Tulsa King” has since become one of my favorite shows, so all's well that ends well. But that was the day I decided I was done with first look photos. I'm not even sure that the difference between black-and-white or color matters. I simply have no desire to see A-list stars looking exactly like themselves in a movie before I have the chance to see a second of them in action. I don't think there's a single person who looks at these things who isn't already following movies closely enough to be aware of what's coming out. These photos aren't swaying anybody, no matter how devilishly handsome Ryan Gosling looks. 

 










Nobody on this planet is lacking for opportunities to see pictures of celebrities anymore. We can Google or stream anything at any time, and algorithms go out of their way to shove our favorite beautiful people in our faces at all hours of the day. Yet we're still just uploading more pixels of the same people to data servers simply because we can! Somebody has to stand up to this madness, and I'm willing to risk everything to do it. I know attention spans are getting shorter, but I truly believe the human race is capable of waiting for a trailer. We need less stimulation and more patience, and these disingenuously named “first looks” are not helping us in either department.

With “The Favourite” and “Poor Things,” Yorgos Lanthimos went from the Greek arthouse curiosity behind films like “Dogtooth” and “The Lobster” to a major Oscar player. His tart-tongued Queen Anne period piece “The Favourite” earned 10 Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress Olivia Colman. With “Poor Things,” he again solidified a Best Actress winner with Emma Stone as a brain-transplant patient turned feminist, with three crafts wins in tow. The writing was on the walls for future success when Lanthimos and his screenwriting collaborator Efthimis Filippou earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for “The Lobster” in 2016.

“The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and his nihilistic triptych “Kinds of Kindness” (which he shot as a diversion from the post-production rigors of “Poor Things”) were all set up at Searchlight; with “Bugonia,” he joins Focus Features for the first time. 

His latest film and tenth feature, “Bugonia” premieres Thursday night in competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos' stomping grounds for “The Favourite” and 2023 Golden Lion winner “Poor Things,” though press caught the first screenings on the Lido this morning. Lanthimos and his cast and crew (including cinematographer Robbie Ryan) took questions from the Venice press corps afterward.

 










A hostage thriller with a timely political bent, “Bugonia” is a remake of the 2003 Korean sci-fi film “Save the Green Planet!” “Kinds of Kindness” Cannes 2024 Best Actor winner Jesse Plemons plays a mentally disturbed vigilante who kidnaps Emma Stone‘s big pharma CEO, believing she is an alien sent to Earth to take over the human race. 

While early footage suggested Stone might factor as a supporting actor in “Bugonia,” she's indeed the co-lead of the film alongside Plemons (Aidan Delbis plays the cousin Plemons forces into his conspiracist scheme). “Bugonia” doesn't necessarily feel like an Oscar movie up front, though Focus' October release date and festival play this weekend at Telluride suggest awards hopes for the violent, darkly funny sci-fi allegory.

The script comes from Emmy-winning “Succession” and “The Menu” writer/director Will Tracy, rather than Lanthimos' Oscar-nominated writing collaborators Tony McNamara (“Poor Things,” “The Favourite”) or Filippou.

“With the exception of Will, we have all worked with Yorgos multiple times,” Stone said at the press conference, also noting that the “idea that we are alone” in the universe, given the movie's extraterrestrial narrative, is “pretty narcissistic to think.” She added, “It ends up feeling like … a really comforting and safe environment to explore and feel as free as possible. I know everybody says it's ‘like we're a family,' but it does really feel like that when you've made so many things together and you've sort of been in those trenches together.”

 










She also said the film, in which Plemons is a would-be foot soldier for the human resistance against corporate greed, is “reflective of this point in time in our world,” and a “really fascinating and moving, funny and fucked-up, and alive” story. 

Both Plemons and Stone revealed they did not watch Jang Joon-hwan's “Save the Green Planet!” before making “Bugonia,” which shot on 35mm and VistaVision cameras in England last summer. DP Robbie Ryan's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos after “The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and “Kinds of Kindness” should gain notices of awards crafts voters for its ambitious visuals despite the pressure-cooker, home-invasion chamber drama setup.

“Not much of the dystopia in this film is very fictional,” said Lanthimos, who recognized the film became even more time-sensitive during production and post-production with lone wolf assassins bent on taking down corporate bigwigs dominating news headlines. “A lot of it is very reflective of the real world. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a dystopic film, which, in my mind, is presenting an image of the future and what happened to civilization.”

“I don't know how much time we have with everything that's happening in the world, with technology, AI, wars, climate change, and the denial of all these things,” he added.

 










“Bugonia” might be too weird and too violent for the Academy, but with a roomy Best Actress field (no certain entrant stands out just yet), two-time winner Stone (“La La Land” as well) could break into the race. Calling her performance as CEO Michelle Fuller — which the actress literally shaved her head for — a supporting actress role would be blatant category fraud, as she's in most scenes of the movie going toe-to-toe with co-lead Plemons. And the physical rigors of her portrayal (the movie appears to show her getting a buzzcut live on camera) have already earned the sort of attention that makes her a Best Actress contender to watch for.

Plemons too, all gaunt and disheveled and mentally harried, makes the case for an overdue lead actor nomination after earning a supporting nod for “The Power of the Dog.” It's a busy Best Actor race, though, with George Clooney also debuting in Venice as a Hollywood actor at the end of his tether in Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.” In terms of Best Picture chances, the edgy and dark “Bugonia” doesn't feel so tailor-made for the top category as the high-concept crowd-pleaser “Poor Things” or the period lushness and spicy dialogue of “The Favourite.”

I'd keep a closer eye on the cinematography and craft of “Bugonia” in terms of an awards traction, though Tracy's pedigree from “Succession” and as an EP on the Emmy-nominated HBO movie “Mountainhead” gives him an awards season edge. Plus, the 2025 Academy loves an underdog-championing, eat-the-rich story, as we of course saw with the more accessible but still original indie “Anora.”

 










Focus Features will release “Bugonia” in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

Before releasing his great new album, Live Laugh Love, Earl Sweatshirt played it for fans at a Los Angeles listening party. The thing was, the rapper was not there, instead sending an imposter the way that the late MF Doom used to do. Earl Sweatshirt is now giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the whole imposter process, via his new video for “Crisco.”

The new video, from director, producer, and editor Jimmy Regular, begins with a simple message: “earl was not looking forward to performing at his album listening party. instead, he decided to cast someone to embody his overall essence on stage.” From there, we see that Sweatshirt, his mother, and Zack Fox auditioned four men to fill in for the rapper. The obvious candidate was Gary Murakami, who spent some time with Sweatshirt to see what living life as the Californian is really like. The visual ends with Murakami's stand-in performance for Sweatshirt at the party. Watch the “Crisco” video below.

“Crisco” is the second Live Laugh Love track to get a music video, following “Tourmaline.” The album follows 2022's Sick! and the Alchemist collaboration Voir Dire.

Hayley Williams of Paramore has released a new solo album comprised of the 17 tracks shared earlier this summer and the new bonus song “Parachute.” Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party is out now on streaming services, with physical releases arriving on November 7 via Post Atlantic—Williams' own label, started after her 20-year contract with Atlantic ended—and distributed by Secretly Distribution. Listen to the new album below.

Since granting the title track with a music video, Williams has also shared a visual for “Glum,” directed by AJ Gibboney and Zac Farro, which you can watch below. Williams and Daniel James wrote, played, and recorded most instruments on Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, with additional help longtime collaborators Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard. Jim-E Stack also contributed to “True Believer.”

Back in 2020, Williams made her solo debut with the full-length album Petals for Armor. She followed it up with the three-track Petals for Armor: Self-Serenades EP that same year and Flowers for Vases / Descansos in 2021. She described the latter LP as “a prequel, or some sort of detour between parts 1 and 2 of Petals.” Afterward, Paramore wrote and released their fifth studio album as a band, This Is Why, in 2023.

Hayley Williams has always been bold — from her brightly-hued hair dye to her kickass attitude as the lead singer of Paramore. When it comes to music, the singer is equally unafraid. She belts her heart out and spits brutally honest lyrics across the band's discography and her own solo albums, 2020's Petals for Armor and 2021's Flowers for Vases/Descansos. But never has Williams sounded as brave as she does on her third album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. “I'll be the biggest star at this fucking karaoke bar,” she declares on the moody title track. The song's chorus repeats one line over and over again (“Can only go up from here”) as Williams gives up on shooting for the moon and settles for a more modest version of fame. It's ironic that a song about a literal ego death should be a highlight of Williams' strongest solo work to date. On Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, she's headed well beyond the stars — and she knows it.


	“Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party” and 16 other songs were surprise-released at the beginning of August after the singer initially uploaded the collection of songs on her website via an old-school web player. Despite being long enough for a full LP, the collection wasn't marketed as an album. (Even though it totally was). But now, after Williams gave Ego Death a properly long name true to her emo roots, and an official track list, the project finally feels complete.

	











	The track list was a major piece of this puzzle. Once Williams uploaded the 17 singles to streaming platforms just a few days after the web player, fans immediately created their own track lists through playlists. An overzealous Haleyhead even compiled all of the fan-made trackl ists into a website. Just like the web player, the experience felt plucked from the early-aughts days of Limewire downloads and the detailed labor of CD and cassette mixtapes. Williams said she wanted to shirk the weighty responsibility onto fans and gain inspiration from the way they received the music. But one listen to Ego Death and it's apparent the unconventional rollout was by design. Every heartfelt lyric and song transition details how Williams has clawed her way out of major loss and grief to uncover a new version of herself.

	Not only did Williams finally select a track list and provide an album title, she also shared a new song, “Parachute.” It's cacophonous and raging with regret, packing its deepest blows in the second verse. “You were at my wedding … You could've told me not to do it,” she shouts. That kind of romantic trauma is a theme throughout the record. Her rough vocal take is filled with hurt; Williams strains her voice as each word turns into a yell. It makes the wail she uncorked on Paramore's “All I Wanted” pale in comparison. There are plenty of other lovesick melodies on Ego Death, from the Lost in Translation-inspired “Dream Girl in Shibuya” to the Weezer-esque “Disappearing Man.” But “Parachute” sums up the scope of the heartbreak that defines much of the album best, especially as it closes out the LP. It follows the tender “I Won't Quit on You,” a hopeful moment where Williams promises she won't give up on her relationship. On “Parachute,” that hope is lost. But even so, with tracks like “Whim” and “Love Me Different,” the singer shows she's not afraid to open the metal cages to her black-tar heart and show all its boundless love.


	Throughout the album, there are similar hints of desired optimism. The sun peaks through the blinds and Williams is desperate to feel its warmth once more as she struggles with her loss. The cover alone is a perfect example of this dichotomy: it's a black-and-white close-up image of Williams with a yellow square around her face, echoing the aesthetic of the 17 singles. Even on some of the most depressing tracks, like the meditative “Glum” or antidepressant ode “Mirtzapine,” lyrics like “In the wake of your sunshine, I've never felt more glum” are pushed up against vibrant beats and clashes of powerful guitar.

	At 17 songs, Ego Death might seem bloated. But this album marks the first time Williams has ever owned her work outright, and who can blame her for wanting to make the most of that? (In 2024, the musician's decades-plus, controversial record contract with Atlantic ended.) This newfound freedom is a revelation for Williams, who calls out the “dumb motherfuckers that I made rich” on the trip-hop-tinged “Ice in My OJ.” Even with the lengthy track list, every song feels purposeful, each its own reflection of the musician's unique sonic landscape. Williams reaches for all of her influences and sprinkles samples of them onto Ego Death songs. From French alt-rock band Phoenix on “Love Me Different” to post-Weezer jokers the Bloodhound Gang for the chorus of “Discovery Channel,” and even a nod to TLC's “Waterfalls” in the lyrics of the title track, the album is a kaleidoscope of the music taste Williams has cultivated over the years.

Ego Death is also notably more percussive and louder than the rest of the singer's solo work. Producer Daniel James worked on Flowers for Vases and returned for Williams' third LP. With help from Paramore touring musicians Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard, as well as Lorde producer Jim-E Stack, who has a hand in “True Believer,” every track is propulsive no matter if it's diving into synth-pop or alt-rock. Gone is the sparse production of Petals or the quiet dissonance of Flowers. Here, the music is alive and banger-ready.


	If Williams' first two LPs saw her dipping her toe into solo work, Ego Death is a full plunge. Never has she sounded more certain or free. There is a kind of death here, one where the musician leaves behind bits of her past self, but more than anything, the album feels like a baptism. Williams emerges from the depths of her focused creation ready for a new life, where the possibilities are endless.

Sabrina Carpenter warned that the provocative lyrics on her upcoming album Man's Best Friend might not be for prude-minded people in a preview from the singer's interview with CBS Mornings.


	“The album is not for any pearl clutchers,” Carpenter told Gayle King in a clip shared Thursday, one day before Man's Best Friend's arrival. “But I also think that even pearl clutchers can listen to an album like that in their own solitude and find something that makes them smirk and chuckle to themselves.”

“This is just fun”: In an exclusive interview tomorrow, pop superstar @SabrinaAnnLynn tells @GayleKing how she embraces the provocative lyrics in her highly-anticipated next album, “Man's Best Friend.” pic.twitter.com/DBWlGjXu2K


	While previous hits like “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” were more subtle with the innuendo, Man's Best Friend's previous singles and controversial album art suggest a bolder, more sexual LP, one that might make casual fans uncomfortable.


	“Sometimes people hear the lyrics that are really bold, and they go, ‘I don't want to sing this in front of other people.' It's like it's almost too TMI,” Carpenter added.

	“But I think about being at a concert with, you know, however many young women I see in the front row that are screaming at the top of their lungs with their best friends, and you can go like, ‘Oh, we can all sigh of relief, like, ‘This is just fun.' And that's all it has to be.”


	In her recent Rolling Stone cover story, Carpenter said of the people bemoaning her sultry stage shows, in particular her “Juno” positions, “It's always so funny to me when people complain. They're like, ‘All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. Clearly you love sex. You're obsessed with it. It's in my show. There's so many more moments than the ‘Juno' positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I can't control that. If you come to the show, you'll [also] hear the ballads, you'll hear the more introspective numbers. I find irony and humor in all of that, because it seems to be a recurring theme. I'm not upset about it, other than I feel mad pressure to be funny sometimes.”

BARBERTON, Ohio – Community members are invited to a paranormal investigation of Barberton's historic West Theatre on Aug. 30 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Experienced investigators from Haunted Havens, a paranormal investigation company, will lead the tour. Attendees will explore the mysteries and supernatural occurrences rumored to have taken place at the iconic venue - -from the boiler room to the creepy attic -- according to Haunted Havens founder Stephanie Pitz.

A Portage Lakes resident and Wadsworth High School graduate, Pitz founded Haunted Havens last year. During her childhood, she felt a connection to the supernatural world, but her parents didn't want to hear about it, she told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. A ghost tour of Savannah, Georgia, that Pitz went on about 10 years ago rekindled her interest. After taking additional tours in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and other places in the South, she decided to open her own company to lead paranormal tours at various locations in Ohio.

“I take people who want to go on ghost tours but don't know where to start, or people who don't know where to go, or don't have friends to go with them, because their friends aren't into that sort of thing. I teach the equipment, and the cost of the tours includes the use of all of the equipment,” Pitz said. 

Tour equipment includes dowsing rods (an ancient tool used to detect water), and REM rods and K2 EMF readers, which detect electrical activity, according to Pitz.

“I just want more people to understand that if you are curious about paranormal activity, you don't just have to watch shows on TV, you can get hands-on, too. I'm trying to make that link between those types of people, because I was that person,” Pitz said.

Tickets are $45 for individuals ages 12 and older. The tour is open to novice and experienced investigators. Basic paranormal equipment is provided, but attendees can also bring their own equipment and a flashlight.

West Theatre opened in August of 1947 at 1017 Wooster Road, according to the Barberton Historical Society. It showed second-run movies until its closure in 2008. The theatre briefly served as a concert venue and a church until it reopened as a theatre in January of 2017, according to Ohio.com reports.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","He Swore Aliens Experimented On Him—But an Altered State of Consciousness Could Be to Blame, Scientists Say","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65923360/alien-abduction-medical-explanation/","Thu, 28 Aug 2025 20:04:00 GMT","

The truth about extraterrestrial encounters may lie on the operating table, according to doctors and skeptics. 

One night in 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas was plowing his field in rural Brazil when he saw mysterious red lights flying through the sky. What he presumed was a spacecraft landed in a nearby field. According to the farmer's account, he was approached by short humanoid creatures and taken back to their ship despite his attempts to escape. There, Boas claimed his captors experimented on him by taking samples of his body tissue and exposing him to noxious gas.   

Nearly 70 years later, Boas' extraterrestrial encounter is still one of the most famous abduction reports in history, along with other storied accounts from Barney and Betty Hill in 1961 and Travis Walton in 1975; in each case, the alleged victims recalled details similar to Boas' story, like bright lights and probing. Since that fateful night in 1957, several thousand more alien encounters have been reported, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, a research foundation based in Washington state. But are aliens actually abducting hundreds of humans each year, or even at all? Experts suggest there might be a simpler explanation—one that lies on the operating table. 

Accidental awareness is a complication where anesthesia patients wake up while they're really supposed to be unconscious. Most patients don't experience pain during accidental awareness, but may retain memories of the operating theater, according to the Royal College of Anesthetists, a UK-based professional organization. If a patient became aware during surgery, they would likely see bright lights, figures standing over them, and experience feelings of being out of control. Some scholars suggest this visual closely resembles classic abduction accounts, and that these memories may play a role in alien abduction claims. One paper in particular highlights an “altered state of consciousness” and feelings of “nakedness, pain, and a loss of control” as intraoperative experiences that could be confused with an extraterrestrial encounter.  

So why doesn't everyone who experiences accidental awareness believe they were abducted by aliens? According to Daniel J. Cole, M.D., former president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the timeline of patients remembering accidental awareness varies greatly. Memories can be instant or delayed, and sometimes they're even triggered by life events not related to the surgery itself. Cole also says there's a chance the trauma from accidental awareness could manifest as delusions. 

“This area is not well understood,” Cole says in an email. “But it is possible that intraoperative awareness could result in dissociative phenomena and false memories.”

Another expert, Benjamin Radford—paranormal investigator, author, and research fellow—says that, in some cases, remembering medical procedures could “absolutely” lead someone to believe they were abducted by aliens. However, he points out that the theory fails to explain why some people who have never undergone surgery may still believe they were abducted. Radford suggests a much more obvious culprit—one that is affecting most of our lives everyday, whether or not we even realize it. 

“I think that the more likely explanation, at least for many of these, is drawing on pop culture experiences and pop culture depictions,” says Radford, who is also deputy editor at the Skeptical Inquirer, a publication that uses reason to examine controversial and extraordinary claims. 

He points to medical dramas as possible fodder for false memories of alien abductions because the genre is popular and something most people have seen at some point or another. Radford explains that, while viewers may not be consciously memorizing technical medical terms, after watching enough of the shows, they'll eventually get a general sense of what a medical procedure could look like. With this in mind, he says “it's not surprising” that alleged abduction victims would elicit similar details when recounting their experiences. 

Professional skeptic and contributor at the Skeptical Inquirer, Daniel Reed, explains that perception is key. When it comes to our brains, perception is variable and difficult to measure, especially weeks or months after an event occurs. He uses an example of a pink elephant. While most are able to imagine a pink animal with large ears, the picture that appears in your mind is ultimately unique to you; the same goes for our perception of events. With the right level of priming, people may come to understand something fictitious to be true and then become deeply attached to those beliefs, according to Reed. 

Whether someone experiences an alien encounter because of extraterrestrial creatures or as a manifestation of medical trauma, the event deeply impacts their lives. Peter Davenport—director of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and manager of the Center's reporting hotline—says emotional impact is one of the criteria NUFORC uses when evaluating the validity of a report. He also says the strong feelings witnesses confess align with his own experiences, as he's allegedly seen several unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in his lifetime. 

“People are profoundly moved by their sightings, oftentimes,” Davenport says. “And you can hear it in their voice, even when they describe a sighting that occurred 50 years ago. You can tell they're sincere and reporting accurately just by the emotion they're exhibiting as they tell their story. […] Those emotions are hard to fake for most people.”

Christian Stepien, chief technology officer for NUFORC, emphasized in an email that the Center does not believe alien encounters are a manifestation of medical trauma, but rather true anomalous experiences. 

While the jury is still out on the relationship between alien encounters and experiences on the operating table, at least one thing's for certain in Boas' case way back in 1957: the Brazilian farmer read an article about alien invasions just one day before making his own report. 

So, was the extraterrestrial encounter a matter of mere coincidence? Or did the alien encounter story inspire Boas? And in that case, was the story that spurred his account in fact derived from another person's experience on the operating table?  

It seems only Boas—and the aliens who supposedly abducted him—will ever know.

            The Democratic Socialists of America held their national convention this summer in the afterglow of arguably their biggest electoral victory to date: Zohran Mamdani's triumph in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor.
    


            They then passed a series of resolutions that Mamdani critics are now trying to make a political liability ahead of November's election.
    


            Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, is calling attention to democratic socialist policies and argues Mamdani isn't being challenged enough on them.
    


            The DSA now bans its individual chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement, opposes measures that would fund border control and calls for a carbon-free economy and the returning of land to indigenous communities. Cuomo has pointed to DSA's calls to end criminal penalties for misdemeanor crimes and close prisons as well as its strident criticism of Israel.
    


            “People have a right to know before they vote,” said Cuomo at a news conference Wednesday.
    


            Mamdani lists himself as a democratic socialist in his social media profiles and has close ties to DSA officials in New York City and nationally. The 33-year-old state assemblyman gave a keynote address at their national conference in 2023 but has only been endorsed by the New York City chapter of the DSA for his mayoral bid.
    


            Mamdani reiterated to reporters that he does not support decriminalizing misdemeanors or defunding the police, despite his past tweets criticizing the New York Police Department.
    


            “My specific policy proposals are the ones that I talk about, the ones that I share on my platform, on my website,” Mamdani said Thursday when asked about the DSA's resolutions. “Those are the ones that I want New Yorkers to hold me accountable to.”
    


            Officials with the national organization say they do not endorse a candidate unless the local chapter files a formal request, which the New York City chapter hasn't done.  But they say they are proud of Mamdani and resist the notion that his affiliation with socialism is a liability.
    


            “While sometimes, especially with older generations, there is sometimes the big scary ‘S' word, socialism, younger folks really see that capitalism is not working out for them. It is causing mass incarceration. It is causing defunding of schools and playgrounds and it's causing them to not have healthcare. And these policies really resonate with voters,” said Megan Romer, co-chair of the DSA.
    


            Another DSA co-chair, Ashik Siddique, said in a statement that the group was “proud to count Zohran as a member.”
    


            “While we are proud that Zohran works closely with NYC-DSA, we also understand his platform for mayor is not identical to the DSA National platform,” Siddique said.
    


            The DSA at its August national convention passed an exhaustive compendium of resolutions, more than 300 pages long.
    


            Here's a look at the DSA and what it laid out in its policy resolutions.
    


            Formed in the 1970s as a result of the merging of two groups, the DSA was created with the intent of promoting workers' rights but has expanded to champion an array of socialist policies.
    


            “We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear,” they explain on their website. “We want to win ‘radical' reforms like single-payer Medicare for All, defunding the police/refunding communities, the Green New Deal, and more as a transition to a freer, more just life.”
    


            The DSA explicitly prohibits chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement and candidates from receiving endorsements from police-affiliated groups. By extension, DSA members cannot be in law enforcement.
    


            Their vision for a “Democratic Socialist Republic” includes “replacing existing law enforcement agencies with a public safety force run by local communities for de-escalation and protecting democratic and social rights.” They also call for banning former officers from joining the organization and eliminating qualified immunity.
    


            When asked about these policies, Romer, the DSA national co-chair, characterized them as more of their long-term goals for society and less of the rigid checklist that it comes across as outlined in the compendium.
    


            “We are pragmatists, and we do understand that being in office right now means working with the system as it is and modifying it as we can to make it move toward where we want it to be,” she said.
    


            For his part, Mamdani is not actively campaigning on antagonizing   police despite his past support for the defund movement.
    


            “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he told reporters in July.
    


            The DSA's compendium repeatedly refers to Israel's actions in Gaza as a genocide and calls for a single-state solution “from the river to the sea” – a phrase that supporters of Israel say calls for the elimination of the Jewish state.
    


            “DSA fundamentally supports the right of resistance of Palestinians and supports the ability of the organizations involved on the ground to carry out that liberatory vision,” it reads.
    


            They also call for supporting “the student intifada,” demonstrations of Palestinian solidarity on college campuses.
    


            Supporters of Israel see calls for an “intifada” as glorifying violence against Jews.
    


            Mamdani during the primary was criticized for declining to disavow the phrase “globalize the intifada”    in a media interview. After winning the primary, he told business leaders that he would discourage use of the phrase.

Financial services giant Desjardins Group is paying $1.67-billion in cash to acquire money manager Guardian Capital Group Ltd. GCG-T with plans to invest more in private market assets.

Montreal-based Desjardins is offering $68 per share for Guardian in a transaction that, subject to court, shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close in early 2026. Desjardins Global Asset Management currently manages about $112-billion in assets, focused primarily in Quebec, while Guardian's approximately $168-billion in assets under management is held mostly in the United States.

“It is one thing to have a lot of assets under management, but this transaction will allow us to present a deeper and broader roster of strategies and solutions and products to our clients around the world,” Desjardins GAM president Nicolas Richard, who will join the executive committee of the combined firm, said in an interview. “We have big plans for the private markets platform.”

George Mavroudis, who has been Guardian's chief executive officer since 2011 and will become CEO of the combined firm, said once the transaction closes, the new company will have more than $10-billion in private assets held in sectors such as infrastructure and real estate.

“That is a growing field and we are looking at how we can expand that,” Mr. Mavroudis said in an interview.

The deal marks the conclusion of a nearly three-year-long process that began in 2022, when Desjardins paid $750-million to acquire Guardian's insurance and wealth management operations. Guardian used some of that money to dramatically expand its U.S. presence, most recently by acquiring North Carolina-based Sterling Capital Management LLC from Truist Financial Corp. in early 2024 for US$70-million.

Today, Guardian manages more than $100-billion in U.S-based assets and has close to 300 U.S.-based employees. Mr. Mavroudis said part of the rationale behind selling to Desjardins was gaining access to a long-term financial partner that was willing to fund a continued global expansion.

“When you look at some of the in-roads that we have made, managing money on behalf of institutional, corporate and pension plans in the US, family offices in Europe, wealth platforms in Europe, pension plans in Asia, we have really gone out there and expanded our footprint,” Mr. Mavroudis said. 

“And we are just getting started. You cannot be a competitive asset manager unless you think globally and I think that is the attraction for Desjardins to join forces with Guardian.”

Guardian is the second large publicly-traded Canadian asset manager to be taken private over the past year amid ongoing consolidation in the sector. In late 2024, an arm of Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company paid $4.7-billion to acquire CI Financial Corp.

Before that deal closed earlier this month, Mubadala said it planned to double down on CI's acquisition-driven growth strategy of snapping up rival fund managers and financial advisory businesses in Canada and the United States.

Rising regulatory and operating costs have led many independent wealth managers to consider selling themselves in recent years in order to remain competitive. According to Investment Industry Association of Canada, the number of independent brokerage firms in the country has fallen from roughly 200 in 2019 to less than 160 today.

Mr. Mavroudis said the combination of Guardian and Desjardins GAM would “have the willingness, capability and experience to selectively look at opportunities to add by acquisition” but that “overall the preference is for strong organic growth, that is always the best type of growth.”

“We do want to be a top 100 global asset manager over the next five years,” Mr. Mavroudis said. “We are inching glober to that.”

NEWBERN, Ala. (AP) — The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after white residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve.

Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent's 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government that drew national attention.

“The people came out and spoke and voted. Now, there ain't no doubt what they want for this town,” Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night.

The election Tuesday was the town's first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's “hand-me-down governance” and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.

Newbern's residents number just 133 people. A library, the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Selma. 

What the town had been without is elections. 

Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held “hand-me-down” positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others. The result was an overwhelmingly white government in a town where Black residents outnumber white residents 2-1.

Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the non-partisan position of mayor, and since was the only candidate, he became the mayor-elect without an election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. 




But the locks were changed at the town hall and Braxton was denied access to the town's financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and “fraudulently re-appointed themselves as the town council.”

“I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,” said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle. 

Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was “invalid.” 

The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025. 

Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, credited “Mayor Braxton's refusal to allow his constituents to be disenfranchised.” The group endorsed Braxton in the race.

Braxton had one challenger this time — a white auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole. 

The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any “doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.”

“It feels good the second time,” Braxton said.

Hollywood stars, employees accused talk show host of having a toxic work environment. Fox News' Carley Shimkus reports on the accusations against Ellen DeGeneres.

Ellen DeGeneres faces renewed criticism after fresh accusations surfaced this week about her alleged toxic behavior on her long-running daytime talk show.

A former cameraman on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" accused the television host of fostering a hostile workplace where staffers lived in fear and sometimes had to give up family commitments.

According to staffers, DeGeneres, 67, disliked male employees and allegedly turned cold when they interacted with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, 52. Crew members also recalled what insiders called the infamous ""Ellen gaze.""

One former staffer described the look as ""a queen searching for her next execution,"" adding, ""She was terrifying.""

De Rossi was described as ""nice"" and approachable with the crew, but employees said their jobs felt at risk if DeGeneres saw them chatting with her spouse.

""You just hoped and prayed you weren't seated by her wife, so you didn't get her attention,"" the ex-staffer told the Daily Mail Tuesday. 

""We went through a lot of male employees,"" the former staffer continued, alleging that DeGeneres once burned through nine stage managers in a single season.

""We had a feeling she really didn't like guys.""

Celebrity guests also faced difficulties on the set of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" according to former employees.

The insider claimed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment in which he embarrassed DeGeneres by saying she used rancid meat during a demo.

""He gave her some quip. They were doing a food test together, and Ellen offered him a sample first,"" the former employee recalled. ""As soon as he bit in, he said, ‘This is rubbish. This is disgusting.' She didn't like the reaction. It was about eight seasons before he came back.""

Comedian Greg Fitzsimmons, a former ""Ellen"" writer, reinforced the claims, labeling his ex-boss a ""control freak"" who oversaw a toxic environment.

""A lot of crying in the hallways,"" he alleged during a podcast appearance.

The latest allegations revive the backlash that hit DeGeneres in 2020, when several ex-employees accused the show of racism, intimidation and retaliation.

DeGeneres apologized on-air at the time, saying she had been unaware of the environment.

Warner Bros. told Fox News at the time it ""takes the recent allegations around the show's workplace culture very seriously"" and conducted interviews with staff to assess conditions.

In 2022, ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" ended after 19 seasons. 

She referenced the allegations in her 2024 comedy special, ""Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval."" There, she said, ""I got kicked out of show business for being mean. Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown.

""I used to say, ‘I don't care what people say about me.' Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity. I am many things, but I am not mean.""

By 2025, DeGeneres had moved to the U.K. countryside, claiming she was the victim of ""misogynistic"" backlash after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election.

Reps for DeGeneres did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

My company had an exit, I did well financially. This is not a secret. I'm extremely privileged and thankful for it. But as a result of this, I've used a private bank (or mix) for a number of years to store the vast majority of my financial assets (over 99.99% of all assets, I just did the math). An unfortunate property of private banks is they make it hard to do retail-like banking behaviors: depositing a quick check, pulling cash from an ATM, but ironically most importantly Zelle.As such, I've kept my Chase personal accounts and use them as my retail bank: there are Chase branches everywhere, its easy to get to an ATM, and they give me easy access to Zelle! I didn't choose Chase specifically, I've just always used Chase for personal banking since I was in high school so I just kept using them for this.Anyways, I tend to use my Chase account to pay a bunch of bills, just because it's more convenient (Zelle!). I have 3 active home construction projects, plus pay my CC, plus pretty much all other typical expenses (utilities, car payments, insurance, etc.). But I float the money in/out of the account as necessary to cover these. We do accounting of all these expenses at the private bank side, so its all tracked, but it settles via Chase.Otherwise, I keep my Chase balance no more than a few thousand dollars.This really wigs out automated systems at Chase. I get phone calls all the time (like, literally multiple times per week) saying ""we noticed a large transfer into your account, we can help!"" And I cheekily respond ""refresh, it's back to zero!"" And they're just confused. To be fair, I've explained the situation in detail to multiple people multiple times but it isn't clicking, so they keep calling me.I now ignore the phone calls. Hope I don't regret that later lol.

Anyways, I tend to use my Chase account to pay a bunch of bills, just because it's more convenient (Zelle!). I have 3 active home construction projects, plus pay my CC, plus pretty much all other typical expenses (utilities, car payments, insurance, etc.).

You create a startup -> Do you need to do anything special with regard to the bank you chose?

My California based credit union doesn't even offer business accounts. And using the co-op network to do in-branch business at other credit unions is not as easy as the marketing lead me to believe, so I had to get a local credit union account where I moved as well. My Washington credit union does do business accounts, so that's a nice option if I need one. Plus, it's fun being a member of two aerospace/defense employee credit unions when I only worked in tech :P

Here's a better idea, guys.  Tell me your value proposition.  How can I get access to your luxury box?  Will you lend me money at ultra-low rates?  How about a free toaster?  Anything?

Spend the day with me as a psychiatry resident doctor. 

Before I step into the hospital, I try to carve out time for myself with a 6:00 AM workout. It's usually my reset time and a space to clear my mind before holding space for others. Prioritizing wellness in residency is not easy, but it's absolutely essential.

Once I'm in, my day usually starts with inpatient psychiatry, where I care for patients, navigating everything from psychosis to suicidal thoughts. Psychiatry is incredibly diverse. We rotate through units like medical detox, where we manage withdrawal and begin recovery planning; child and adolescent psychiatry; and even forensic psychiatry, where mental health intersects with the legal system.

Each rotation teaches a different lens and focuses on understanding the person in front of you.

Lambeth  Hochwald

 August 28, 2025  

While physicians are generally thought to be more science-leaning than humanities driven, narrative medicine is an intriguing field of study that bridges that gap, all with the goal of encouraging humility and compassion both for the self and for others.

Interestingly, the two disciplines have more in common than one might think. To best understand the goal of narrative medicine, it's described as existing at the “intersection of humanities, the arts, clinical practice, and healthcare justice” to equip doctors to better understand their patients' experiences and perspectives.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape Physician Job Satisfaction Index 2025 found that

Amanda Caleb, PhD, MPH, professor of medical humanities at Geisinger University in Scranton, Pennsylvania, said narrative medicine has been integrated throughout the medical school's clinical education track since 2021. The required courses focus on reflective writing, listening to patient stories, and cultivating empathy.

“We incorporate narrative medicine during the preclinical phase up through the transition to residency,” Caleb told Medscape Medical News. “The vast majority of our students enjoy the classes and this makes sense: Narrative medicine is a lot about slowing down, which is antithetical to so much of medicine. It gives our students the space to process the patient stories they're hearing — as well as their own emotional responses.”

For example, during a neurology clinical rotation this past year, Geisinger students were tasked with completing what's known in narrative medicine as a ‘parallel chart.'

“The way this works is that each student thinks about one patient and takes a few minutes to write about their hopes and fears for that patient — essentially stuff that can't go in a patient's chart,” she said. “We picked neurology because there is usually very complex health issues associated with it and it's a hard space for students.”

Now an Internist at Allina Health in Minneapolis, Dominic Decker, MD, said what he learned during the Master of Science program in narrative medicine at Columbia University permeates every aspect of his clinical practice.

Decker initially enrolled in the course to continue developing his interest in the humanities — and make sure his communication skills were top notch.

“I realized early on that doctors need to be able to effectively and efficiently convey information to their patients and I knew that communication skills would help me just as much as if I had majored in biology and chemistry,” said Decker, who was a premed and English literature major during his undergraduate years.

“I'm tasked with meeting new patients on a regular basis and having to synthesize a complex set of symptoms, lab results, or imaging studies, but that's only a small part of the job,” Decker said. “The other part is being able to relate that to a patient or a patient's life and make it so that what I'm talking to them about is understandable and actionable to them.”

Again, Decker said narrative medicine training was an invaluable skill-builder.

“As a formal training, narrative medicine taught us to engage with the humanities as a way to help better understand the type of information we are being presented within a medical context,” he said. “I think the strength of the program is that it hones your skills of observation, analysis, and critical thinking in ways that my medical training didn't necessarily address because medical training isn't set up to address those types of things.”

That takeaway mirrors the experiences Rachel Sturley had as a Columbia master's student. Sturley said that studying narrative medicine helped her identify her motivations within the field, her connection to acts of service and, ultimately, what it means to be a doctor.

“Identifying these motivations and being able to describe them to myself and others has been so important,” said Sturley, who has just begun her coursework at Harvard Medical School, Boston. “The program also gave me a concrete understanding of health equity, compassionate care, disability justice, anti-racism, and how those things intersect in the clinic space.” 

Ask Natalia Romano Spica, MD, MSc, a second-year psychiatry resident at UCLA, and she'd tell you that she pursued a career in medicine because of her interest in the sciences as well as the fact that medicine is rooted in people and their stories.

“Narrative medicine has helped me be a better doctor and has helped me pay attention to the story of the patient in front of me,” said Romano Spica, who attended Columbia's program from 2017 to 2019. “I see a lot of parallels between the techniques of paying attention to a poem or piece of prose and the granular attention that you should pay attention to when learning a patient's story.”

While some may be skeptical about the power of narrative medicine, Sturley said it's worth looking into, no matter what phase of your medical career you're in.

“For example, it includes thinking about how to teach compassion, how to engage students on issues of equity early on, how to energize doctors after burnout and what skills are needed to tackle these problems. Narrative medicine is a powerful solution at a time when we're looking for some concrete ways to answer these questions.”

For physicians who might want to consider a narrative medicine workshop, which are held both in-person and virtually, the gains can be impactful. Another option: Go online and search for a narrative medicine prompt, of which there are plenty, Caleb said.

Then read the poem that goes with the prompt and write down your reflection, she added. “See what happens — and how it changes your entire perspective.”

In the end, narrative medicine is an important tool that can make all the difference in how you relate to your colleagues and patients.

“When you meet with a patient, you're already five steps down the road trying to assess this person's situation,” Caleb said. “It's hard to be present and listen well, but everyone can learn to be a better listener, and this makes all the difference when you're interacting with patients.”

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Lionel Messi has not yet announced when he plans to retire, but he knows that next week's match against Venezuela could be his last one playing at home in a World Cup qualifier with Argentina's national team.

“It's going to be a very, very special match for me because it's the last qualifying match,” the 38-year-old Messi said Wednesday night after Inter Miami progressed to the Leagues Cup final by beating Orlando City.

Argentina, with a spot already secured in next year's World Cup, will host Venezuela next Thursday at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires for the penultimate round of South American qualifiers. Its last match will be at Ecuador on Sept. 9.

Messi has hinted that he will retire from the national team after next year's World Cup, where Argentina is going to defend the title they won in Qatar 2022.

The qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when the soccer star will be 40 years old.

“I don't know if there will be friendlies or more matches after (Venezuela), but it is a very special match, so my family will be there with me: my wife, my children, my parents, my siblings,"" Messi said. ""We're going to live it like that. I don't know what will happen next.”

Following Messi's statements, CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, wrote on social media that “the last dance is coming,” with a picture of Messi in an Argentina shirt.

Meanwhile, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) is trying to capitalize on Messi's last home match by raising ticket prices, with the cheapest going for $100 and the most expensive costing around $500.

Defending US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Polina Kudermetova on Wednesday. Earlier in the night, Jasmine Paolini overcame 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, winning 6-3, 6-3 to advance herself to the third round as well.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was broken in the opening game Wednesday night and tested throughout by Polina Kudermetova, but ultimately showed the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd why she's the defending US Open champion.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Sabalenka prevailed 7-6 (4), 6-2 in 1 hour and 36 minutes to reach the third round and keep her title defense on track.

The win marks her 30th career main-draw victory at the US Open.

“In the first set, I was super tight and super aggressive,” Sabalenka said after the match. “It felt like there were almost no points. It was more about the serve and first shot and it was super quick. I'm glad that I was able to handle that pressure and put it back on her and get that first set.

“Then in the second set, I felt much better on the return game and my serve was much better. So, I'm really glad that in the first set I stayed really strong.”

Wednesday's second-round match was their second meeting of 2025, after Sabalenka defeated Kudermetova in January to win the Brisbane International title.

As she did in Australia, Kudermetova gave the World No. 1 everything she could handle in the first set this time around.

After Sabalenka saved four break points in the first game, Kudermetova finally converted the fifth chance to go up an early break. Sabalenka responded immediately, breaking back in the next game, but Kudermetova's barrage of forehand winners kept the pressure on, forcing a tiebreak

That's when “Tiebreakalenka” lived up to her nickname, winning her 19th tiebreak of the season in 20 attempts.

“I don't know,” Sabalenka said. “I'm just trying to stay aggressive. I'm trying to fight for every point, and I know that every point can be a key moment of the set, so I'm just trying to stay strong and I'm just trying to play aggressive.”

After trading holds early in the second set, Sabalenka struck first, breaking for a 2-1 lead. Following a medical timeout for Kudermetova's right knee during the ensuing changeover, the defending champion pulled away, securing a second break to close out the match.

She's onto the next ➡️@SabalenkaA advances with a 7-6(4), 6-2 victory over P. Kudermetova.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/DOdQhxjTM8

Sabalenka will face 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the third round.

The two have faced each other just once in their careers, having last met in the semifinals of the aforementioned 2021 US Open, when Fernandez won in three sets.

Jasmine Paolini advanced to the third round of the US Open for the second consecutive year, defeating 17-year-old American Iva Jovic 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday night.

Paolini power 👊@JasminePaolini advances on as she defeats Jovic 6-3, 6-3.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/e5qIwopA7G

Paolini broke Jovic's serve five times in the 1-hour, 26-minute match.

Despite the scoreline, the contest was competitive, with Paolini saving her best stuff for the biggest moments, saving nine break points out of the 11 she faced.

The Italian now holds a 2-0 record against Jovic in head-to-head matchups.

Next, Paolini will face former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round. It will be their first meeting in a WTA Tour main draw.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue.

A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery.

A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1.

Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid.

Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

See which driver's got the smarts in the final episode of Grill the Grid for 2025.

We like to think our Grill the Grids are pretty fiendish – but our producers really had it in for the F1 drivers with the final round of the series for 2025.

The current field were asked to guess the Grand Prix and the year in which it took place from some pretty opaque descriptions – with each question involving three separate clues, and points on offer from three down to one depending on how many of those clues the drivers required.

It was tricky enough to make Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg plead “help me” to his press officer waiting in the wings – as the drivers' efforts set the final scores for the 2025 Grill the Grid championship.

Hit play on the video above to see who aced the final round of Grill the Grid – and find out which driver was crowned the series champion for 2025.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: When NBC's Chicago Med returns this fall for its eleventh season, it will be without one of its three remaining original cast members. Marlyne Barrett, who has played doting yet no-nonsense ER nurse Maggie Lockwood since the show's 2015 launch, is stepping back from the medical drama for personal reasons, sources tell Deadline. 


	This is envisioned as a temporary leave, and the hope is for her to return at some point, I hear. 


	As Deadline reported in June, the other two Chicago Med original cast members, series stars S. Epatha Merkerson (Sharon Goodwin) and Oliver Platt (Daniel Charles), are set to come back after their options for the 2025-26 season were picked up. And just this week, Deadline broke the news that fellow OG Nick Gehlfuss, who left after eight seasons, will make a return this season as a guest-star, reprising his role as Dr. Will Halstead.

	Over the years, Barrett's Charge Nurse Maggie has become the eyes, ears and heart of Gaffney Medical's Emergency Department, endlessly dedicated to her position and loyal to all the physicians around her. Maggie's major Season 10 storyline involved the tense nursing union negotiations at the hospital, which culminated in a sick-out.


	In Season 5, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and eventually went into remission. Barrett announced her real-life diagnosis of uterine and ovarian cancer in July 2022. In September 2024, the actress revealed that she was in full remission. 

	











Chicago Med, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Allen MacDonald, Stephen Hootstein and Peter Jankowski.


	The three One Chicago dramas kick off their new seasons Oct. 1, with Chicago Med leading the charge at 8 p.m.

Neon and Waypoint Entertainment's Cweature Features have come on board Hokum, starring Adam Scott. Damian McCarthy is writing and directing. Neon will release the film theatrically in the U.S. in 2026. Neon International will represent the foreign sales rights and introduce the film next week at TIFF.


	Cweature Features board as co-producers on the project joining Image Nation and Spooky Pictures, as well as Team Thrives, who co-financed the project. The film is currently in post production. Peter Coonan and David Wilmot join Scott along with Florence Ordesh, Will O'Connell, and Michael Patric. Siox C, Brendan Conroy, Austin Amelio and Ezra Carlisle round out the cast.

	











	The film follows reclusive novelist Ohm Bauman (Scott), who retreats to a remote Irish inn to scatter his parents' ashes, but the staff's tales of an ancient witch haunting the honeymoon suite take hold of his mind. Soon, disturbing visions and a shocking disappearance draw him into a nightmarish confrontation with the darkest corners of his past.

	McCarthy recently directed Oddity, which premiered at SXSW and won the Audience Award in the Midnighter Section.


	As previously announced, Hokum is the latest collaboration between Image Nation and Spooky Pictures following Charlie Polinger's lauded feature The Plague which debuted in Cannes, last year's hit Late Night With the Devil and the critically acclaimed thriller Watcher, directed by Chloe Okuno and starring Maika Monroe. The project is the sixth in the current Image Nation/Spooky Pictures slate following the announcement of Bryan Edward Hills' Archangel starring Connor Leslie and Randall Okita's Menace starring Isabel May, which was acquired by IFC/Shudder at Cannes last year.
