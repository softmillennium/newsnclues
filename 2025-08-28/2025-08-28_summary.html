Jake Sullivan claims his stance has changed because Israel's “war” is different now than it was under Biden.

Top Biden administration officials have begun rewriting their ironclad support of Israel throughout the end of President Joe Biden's term, now claiming to oppose Israel's starvation policy in Gaza as it's officially tipped into famine — a famine that they fully laid the groundwork for over the first 16 months of the genocide.

In an interview with “The Bulwark” published Wednesday, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that he now supposedly supports withholding weapons from Israel because, he claims, the situation in Gaza is different than it was last year.

“I have in fact told a number of members [of Congress] who were thinking about the votes on these resolutions that the situation as it stands today, following the breakdown of the ceasefire in March, means that a vote to withhold weapons from Israel is a totally credible position. That is a position that I would support,” Sullivan said, likely in reference to resolutions introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) to block the sale of certain weapons to Israel.

He claims that, throughout 2024, Israel was facing threats from other countries that it doesn't face today, and that a hallmark moment was when Israel showed its obstinance in unilaterally ending the ceasefire deal in March. He also points to the UN-backed declaration of famine in Gaza last week as a sign of conditions being worse. These changes mean that current pro-Israel policies are less legitimate than the Biden administration's stance, he said.

“My view is that people who, you know, thought this was wrong from the start didn't stare squarely at October 7th. And people who think it's just and righteous today are not staring squarely at what is happening in Gaza right now, you know, with the killing and the starving of innocent people,” Sullivan said. He ignores the fact that Israel was killing and starving innocent Palestinians immediately after the October 7, 2023, attack — with the stated intention of doing so.

Sullivan's claims are dubious for numerous reasons. For instance, he touts the Biden administration's supposed success in holding off a famine declaration in Gaza due to pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid. 

But the famine declaration last week has been forewarned for over a year, with Israel having used starvation as a weapon of war from the beginning of the genocide with little to no pushback from the Biden administration.

In fact, reports found in December of last year that the Biden administration had pressured the U.S.-backed Famine Early Warning System Network to retract a report warning of imminent famine in northern Gaza. Far from pressuring Israel to ease its humanitarian catastrophe, officials in the Biden administration would often say in public statements that they opposed the starvation campaign, but would do nothing in practice to stop it. Other times, they would outright lie about Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid.

For instance, in October of 2024, Biden officials sent Israel an ultimatum demanding that it increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, or else the U.S. may end its military support. Israel, in turn, actually decreased the aid flow to record lows — and the administration said that it has not assessed that Israel was in violation of its ultimatum.

Sullivan's argument that military aid to Israel was legitimate last year is also completely undercut by the International Court of Justice's opinion in January of 2024 that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide and ordered it to end the siege and lift the humanitarian blockade.

Other former Biden officials have attempted to backtrack in recent weeks. In an interview with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner published Tuesday, Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, said that the situation now is “very, very different” from what it was under Biden with regards to starvation in Gaza — even as experts had warned countless times that there were potentially thousands of deaths to starvation and other causes not being counted in the official death toll.

Like Sullivan, Lew also defended the genocide as it was conducted under Biden. In comments that garnered outrage, he said that Israel's pattern of killing children in Gaza was justified and legitimate. When pressed, he said that the children killed in strikes on schools and shelters were acceptable collateral damage because they were often found to be family members of Hamas fighters.

“We could almost never get answers that explained what happened before the story was fully framed in international media, and then when the facts were fully developed, it turned out that the casualties were much lower, the number of civilians was much lower, and, in many cases, the children were children of Hamas fighters, not children taking cover in places,” Lew said.

“​​It is not the simple question that it originally appears to be when the initial report makes it sound like the target was just an empty school that families took cover in,” he went on.

At a court hearing on Wednesday, the judge didn't rule on Mario Guevara's petition to be released.

Award-winning journalist Mario Guevara, who had begun documenting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, has been detained since his arrest at a protest on June 14 in DeKalb County, Georgia. 

Guevara has spent almost all of his detention in ICE custody, although he is authorized to live and work in the United States. He immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. Guevara settled in Georgia and continued to work as a journalist, first for Mundo Hispánico, and then, in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MG News, which had recently begun filming ICE abductions.

In a phone interview from an ICE jail in South Georgia, Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution that the agency is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” Some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

On August 20, Guevara's legal team, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Georgia, filed a habeas corpus petition requesting that the court allow Guevara to pay the $7,500 bond set by an immigration judge on July 1. Federal prosecutors had appealed the bond order to the Board of Immigration Appeals and were granted a stay, or pause, of the order, thereby preventing Guevara's release.

At a hearing on Wednesday, the judge did not rule on Guevara's petition and requested briefs from both sides.

Guevara's saga began more than two months ago when he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest, which was part of a nationwide day of action to protest President Donald Trump. According to the petition, body camera footage from the protest shows an officer instructing other officers to, “Keep an eye on the guy in the red shirt. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. . . . He's been warned multiple times.” Another officer asked, “Press?” The first officer replied, “Yep.”

About a minute later, Guevara stepped off the sidewalk as he moved out of the way of police officers coming through the area, and was promptly arrested. Video of his arrest shows that Guevara is wearing a red shirt underneath a vest clearly marked with PRESS on the front and back.

After his arrest, ICE placed a detainer on Guevara. Although all criminal charges related to the protest have been dropped, federal prosecutors have fought to keep him locked up in ICE custody. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that ICE arrested Guevara because he is a journalist. In an email to Truthout, DHS claimed that he “is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004,” which is false. 

The immigration judge who granted Guevara bond wrote that the journalist “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.” 

The habeas petition quotes extensively from the government's filings to demonstrate that ICE is targeting Guevara because he is a journalist. 

“In the Notice of Appeal, the Government states that Mr. Guevara is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed' law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,'” it reads. “The Government further states that ‘[l]ocal law enforcement reviewed the respondent's public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.'”

Guevara is currently held in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day at the Folkston ICE Processing Center, according to the petition. For two hours a day, he's confined to a larger cell where he can “see the sky and breathe fresh air.” During his detention, he has lost approximately 20 pounds. “The freedom of press is only for U.S. citizens,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on a call from Folkston. “If I'm outside again, I don't think I will be on ICE anymore because everything is different now.”

MOSCOW, August 27. /TASS/. Russia will take tit-for-tat measures against Norwegian fishing vessels if Norway does not reconsider its position within one month, head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries Ilya Shestakov said.

"In case the Norwegian side does not reconsider its position within one month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone for Norwegian fishing vessels. Furthermore, fisheries and distribution of catch quotas in open waters of Barents and Norwegian Seas will be carried out on the basis of Russian national interests," Shestakov said, cited by the agency's press service.

In July 2025, Norway introduced the fishing ban in its exclusive economic zone for two Russian companies. This is a gross violation of effective agreements on joint management of reserves of aquatic bioresources, the press service told TASS.

            The Democratic Socialists of America held their national convention this summer in the afterglow of arguably their biggest electoral victory to date: Zohran Mamdani's triumph in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor.
    


            They then passed a series of resolutions that Mamdani critics are now trying to make a political liability ahead of November's election.
    


            Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, is calling attention to democratic socialist policies and argues Mamdani isn't being challenged enough on them.
    


            The DSA now bans its individual chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement, opposes measures that would fund border control and calls for a carbon-free economy and the returning of land to indigenous communities. Cuomo has pointed to DSA's calls to end criminal penalties for misdemeanor crimes and close prisons as well as its strident criticism of Israel.
    


            “People have a right to know before they vote,” said Cuomo at a news conference Wednesday.
    


            Mamdani lists himself as a democratic socialist in his social media profiles and has close ties to DSA officials in New York City and nationally. The 33-year-old state assemblyman gave a keynote address at their national conference in 2023 but has only been endorsed by the New York City chapter of the DSA for his mayoral bid.
    


            Mamdani reiterated to reporters that he does not support decriminalizing misdemeanors or defunding the police, despite his past tweets criticizing the New York Police Department.
    


            “My specific policy proposals are the ones that I talk about, the ones that I share on my platform, on my website,” Mamdani said Thursday when asked about the DSA's resolutions. “Those are the ones that I want New Yorkers to hold me accountable to.”
    


            Officials with the national organization say they do not endorse a candidate unless the local chapter files a formal request, which the New York City chapter hasn't done.  But they say they are proud of Mamdani and resist the notion that his affiliation with socialism is a liability.
    


            “While sometimes, especially with older generations, there is sometimes the big scary ‘S' word, socialism, younger folks really see that capitalism is not working out for them. It is causing mass incarceration. It is causing defunding of schools and playgrounds and it's causing them to not have healthcare. And these policies really resonate with voters,” said Megan Romer, co-chair of the DSA.
    


            Another DSA co-chair, Ashik Siddique, said in a statement that the group was “proud to count Zohran as a member.”
    


            “While we are proud that Zohran works closely with NYC-DSA, we also understand his platform for mayor is not identical to the DSA National platform,” Siddique said.
    


            The DSA at its August national convention passed an exhaustive compendium of resolutions, more than 300 pages long.
    


            Here's a look at the DSA and what it laid out in its policy resolutions.
    


            Formed in the 1970s as a result of the merging of two groups, the DSA was created with the intent of promoting workers' rights but has expanded to champion an array of socialist policies.
    


            “We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear,” they explain on their website. “We want to win ‘radical' reforms like single-payer Medicare for All, defunding the police/refunding communities, the Green New Deal, and more as a transition to a freer, more just life.”
    


            The DSA explicitly prohibits chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement and candidates from receiving endorsements from police-affiliated groups. By extension, DSA members cannot be in law enforcement.
    


            Their vision for a “Democratic Socialist Republic” includes “replacing existing law enforcement agencies with a public safety force run by local communities for de-escalation and protecting democratic and social rights.” They also call for banning former officers from joining the organization and eliminating qualified immunity.
    


            When asked about these policies, Romer, the DSA national co-chair, characterized them as more of their long-term goals for society and less of the rigid checklist that it comes across as outlined in the compendium.
    


            “We are pragmatists, and we do understand that being in office right now means working with the system as it is and modifying it as we can to make it move toward where we want it to be,” she said.
    


            For his part, Mamdani is not actively campaigning on antagonizing   police despite his past support for the defund movement.
    


            “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he told reporters in July.
    


            The DSA's compendium repeatedly refers to Israel's actions in Gaza as a genocide and calls for a single-state solution “from the river to the sea” – a phrase that supporters of Israel say calls for the elimination of the Jewish state.
    


            “DSA fundamentally supports the right of resistance of Palestinians and supports the ability of the organizations involved on the ground to carry out that liberatory vision,” it reads.
    


            They also call for supporting “the student intifada,” demonstrations of Palestinian solidarity on college campuses.
    


            Supporters of Israel see calls for an “intifada” as glorifying violence against Jews.
    


            Mamdani during the primary was criticized for declining to disavow the phrase “globalize the intifada”    in a media interview. After winning the primary, he told business leaders that he would discourage use of the phrase.

Alejandro ‘Alito' Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña grabbed and shouted at each other over the presence of foreign troops

Mexico's senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country's top politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion over the presence of foreign troops.

Alejandro “Alito” Moreno, head of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary party (Pri), grabbed at Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the senate president from the ruling Morena party, after lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to mark the end of the day's session on Wednesday.

“I'm asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly in the livestreamed video.

“Don't touch me,” Fernández Noroña responds.

When Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. When an aide to Fernández Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor.

As Fernández Noroña tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at the senate leader.

“[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I'm going to beat the shit out of you, I'm going to kill you.'”

Moreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.”

The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied.

Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”.

The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries.

The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.

In a statement on X, Moreno accused the governing party of changing the order of the day at the last minute in order to silence the opposition.

A whopping 77 percent of Democrats say Israel is committing genocide, Quinnipiac found.

New polling finds that opposition to sending more military aid to Israel has hit another record high among U.S. voters, further widening the gap between U.S. policy and American opinion as Israel's genocide continues without an end in sight.

In a poll released Wednesday, Quinnipiac found that 60 percent of voters now say they oppose sending more military assistance to Israel to aid in its siege of Gaza. This is the highest level of opposition since Quinnipiac asked this question in November 2023, when only 39 percent of Americans were against sending aid.

Now, only 32 percent of Americans support sending more aid, the polling found. This includes only 18 percent of Democrats, with 75 percent saying they oppose sending more aid.

This may be because a growing number of Americans say that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Half of those polled said that Israel is committing genocide, while 35 percent said Israel was not, and 15 percent said they didn't know. 

A whopping 77 percent of Democrats said that they believe Israel is committing genocide. 

The findings underscore the wide gaps between public opinion and the actions of political officials. President Donald Trump has been a major backer of Israel's genocide, giving Israeli officials independence to operate as they wish even as they have openly embarked on a plot to illegally annex Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

Just on Tuesday, members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rejected a resolution that would have called on Democrats across the country to back an arms embargo to Israel. 

The DNC resolutions panel instead backed a competing resolution that only called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the “unconditional” release of all Israeli captives. The resolution did not include language to exert leverage over Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal, even though Israel has been openly sabotaging ceasefire negotiations for over a year at least.

Democrats “will continue to lose” due to their policies of rejecting any action in favor of Palestinian rights, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) said in response to the poll.

“The DNC voted down a resolution this week in support of an arms embargo. Enabling genocide is alienating the majority of Democrats who want the funding of war crimes to stop. Wake the fuck up!” Tlaib wrote on social media Wednesday.

The polling further suggests that support for Israel has cratered overall, not just in context of the Gaza genocide.

Sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis hit an all-time high in the latest survey since Quinnipiac began polling that question in 2001. Now, 37 percent of voters say they sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis, compared to 36 percent saying they favor Israelis. This includes 63 percent of Democrats who say they have more sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis, compared to only 13 percent who say the opposite.

Canada is not making it easy for asylum seekers from the US to find safe harbor.

For several hours, the woman and her children lay in the mud, hoping not to be found by Canadian authorities. She was in the middle of her 14 days — the amount of time that a person who entered via the United States has to be in Canada before making an asylum claim. During those 14 days, asylum seekers cannot be caught. They have to live underground. And even harder, they have to be able to prove that they were in Canada for 14 days when they go to make their asylum claims. If they're found or caught, or if they can't prove Day 1 or Day 14, their claim will be denied, and they will be deported.

On July 13, a U.S. citizen driving an SUV allegedly drunk in southern Quebec crashed into a van carrying 12 people who had entered Canada from the United States. Another van following behind, also carrying migrants, veered away to not be caught by authorities. The first van rolled over, and four people were injured and brought to a hospital. Frantz André, coordinator of the Comité d'Action des Personnes Sans Statut (a committee that supports people without legal status in Canada), is helping some people from both vans, and he says that the remaining eight fled into the woods, as did the passengers in the other van to avoid being caught. The mother who hid in the mud with her children was among this group. After the crash, they lay in the mud for four hours, until another van came to get them.

Experts insist that these kinds of events will continue to increase.

“It's inhumane” says Jean-Pierre, a Haitian refugee who crossed into Canada from the United States with his wife and child and made his request for refugee status in 2021. Sharing his story in an interview with Truthout, he asked to be identified by a pseudonym to avoid repercussions to his refugee claim. He and his family had been living in Indiana and are now in Western Canada. Jean-Pierre cannot work as he's been waiting for a work permit since April.

Haitians in the United States have had a Temporary Protected Status since 2010, and the status has been canceled, appealed, and renewed many times since then. After U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem declared that Haiti no longer meets the program requirements for Temporary Protected Status, the status was set to expire on September 2, 2025. A judge has temporarily blocked this order, extending the Temporary Protected Status designation again until February 3, 2026, but the Trump administration says it “vehemently disagrees” with the judge's ruling and “is working to determine next steps.”

All of this uncertainty has driven many Haitians, like Jean-Pierre, to cross into Canada, usually at Quebec. But now, people are even more afraid, and Canada has made it even harder than before for Haitians and anyone else fleeing the United States to be given asylum.

Already, the largest group of migrants ever tried to enter Canada in the back of an unventilated cube van, just a few weeks ago. The Canadian Press reports that 44 people, mostly Haitians, crossed into Canada on foot on August 3, and were picked up by the cube van. Once the van was intercepted, the migrants were sent to be processed. If they don't have a first-degree relative living in Canada, it is likely that they will be sent back to the United States.

That's because the primary way for someone who is Haitian to stay in Canada is to have a first-degree relative, rather than simply claiming asylum, and Canada has no plans to make it easier for anyone coming from the United States to claim asylum in Canada. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada spokesperson Matthew Krupovich told Truthout that the government of Canada has extended to November 19, 2025, a temporary measure in place to allow people who have a first-degree relative in Canada to enter through a special program. “These measures help keep families together and give Haitian nationals in Canada a safe place to work and study,” he said.

André is critical of the program, which he describes as being a family reunification program rather than a true asylum program. André argues that by allowing Haitians who have first-degree relatives to stay in Canada while not accepting people who are claiming asylum from the United States, Canada is not upholding its responsibilities under international law to accept refugees. Moreover, he says he has seen situations where families are broken up because one person has a direct relative in Canada but the other person in a couple does not.

There are 80,000 Haitians who live in Montreal, and 47,550 of them were born in Haiti, and 140,000 people of Haitian descent who live in Quebec. The vast majority chose Quebec because it is North America's only majority French-speaking jurisdiction.

But the passage into Canada has been made particularly perilous due to the “Safe Third Country Agreement” — a policy that says immigrants who are crossing into Canada from the U.S. cannot immediately seek refugee status in Canada because they are coming from a country deemed to be “safe”; once they have been in Canada for at least 14 days, however, they are then allowed to seek refugee status in Canada.

While the Supreme Court of Canada found parts of the Safe Third Country Agreement to be constitutional in 2023, it bounced the question of rights violations back to a lower court. In February, the Canadian Council of Refugees and Amnesty International renewed their call for the agreement to be scrapped. They wrote, “Canada's assertion that the United States remains a safe country for refugees under the Trump administration is a cruel irony to those fleeing persecution today. It must be urgently rescinded, and tariff threats must not blur the plight of those at immediate risk.”

“Canada's assertion that the United States remains a safe country for refugees under the Trump administration is a cruel irony to those fleeing persecution today.”

Canada has no plans to eliminate the agreement, though. In fact, rather than preparing for more people to come to Canada as a result of the end of the American Temporary Protected Status, Canada's new Liberal government's second bill would make it even more difficult for people to seek asylum from the United States. If passed, Bill C-2 will eliminate the 14-day period that people are currently waiting before they make a refugee claim and instead make it impossible for someone to make a claim at all if they cross into Canada from the United States, whether via an official port of entry or not. The bill was presented on June 3, 2025.

André says Canada's confusing asylum rules aren't enforced evenly and can change depending on which agent someone deals with, and the stakes are considerably higher now that Trump's administration has stepped up deportations. He tells the story of a man living in the United States who had both a Canadian and American visa, and who had applied for Temporary Protected Status. He planned to visit Canada for a few weeks. Upon trying to enter Canada, he was told that he couldn't bring a scooter he had with him to give to a family member, as it didn't meet certain standards. The man was given two choices: either leave the scooter at the border or go back. The man decided to go back into the United States with the scooter and within days, he was captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sent to an immigration jail where he currently awaits deportation.

What's worse is that while the Canadian government is squeezing migrants at the border, the government of Quebec has doubled down on ethnic nationalism as a political strategy, demonizing immigrants and refugees in general and Haitians in particular. While the federal government controls Canada's asylum system, Quebec is the only province that manages its own immigration levels. The province is currently in a process to determine its immigration levels for the next four years, though the governing Coalition Avenir Québec has made it clear that it does not support making it easier for people to claim asylum from the United States.

In a statement given to Truthout in French, Xavier Daffe-Bordeleau, a representative of Quebec's Ministry of Immigration, Francisation and Integration, explained, “Quebec remains committed to offering a dignified and secure welcome to asylum seekers, with help from … community groups, who have already done a lot over the years to welcome asylum seekers. The cumulative effect over the past many years has placed pressure on the Quebec public and we have largely surpassed our capacity.”

Quebec's government has formally requested that the Canadian government reduce the number of work permits and refugee status granted from 416,000 in 2024 to 200,000 by 2029, especially in the greater Montreal region, even though cutting immigration levels has already placed Quebec into population decline.

Neither the Canadian nor the Quebec governments have demonstrated meaningful regard for the humanity of asylum seekers, and neither have any plans for the inevitable wave of people who will request asylum in Canada when the Temporary Protected Status ends. The situation in Haiti continues to deteriorate, with the UN-coordinated police force from Kenya having largely been a failure. And with Erik Prince's Vectus Global about to deploy mercenaries in Haiti, most Haitians in North America are left with only one option: asylum in either the U.S. or Canada.

Despite the crisis, Canada knowingly sends people back to the U.S. where they can face deportation, a kind of deportation by proxy, says André, when really, all they want is the safety and security that every person wants.

“What they need and are looking for is a safe place to rebuild, to build a life and to eventually have their family reunite with them,” André told Truthout. “That was the perception of Canada years ago, which is no longer what's happening.”

The Yomiuri Shimbun

2:00 JST, August 29, 2025

The following is the full written response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to questions from The Yomiuri Shimbun.

The Yomiuri Shimbun: Mr. Prime Minister, you are visiting Japan after two years. While your visit in 2023 had a multilateral context, your current visit is seen as an important one for India-Japan relations. What should we look forward to during your two days in Japan?

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I am delighted to be in Tokyo once again, this time for the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit. I warmly thank Prime Minister Ishiba for his gracious invitation.

India and Japan are not just two close partners. We are ancient civilizations, vibrant democracies and leading economies. We share a common strategic outlook. Over the past decade, our ties have scaled new heights since they were elevated to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. The annual Summit itself is testament to the maturity and vibrancy of our ties.

During my meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, I look forward to charting the next phase of our partnership. Our focus will be to strengthen security, enhance resilience, drive innovation and deliver prosperity for our peoples.

I also look forward to visiting Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a region that symbolizes both resilience and innovation.

I am confident that my visit, though short, will be long in impact. India and Japan will continue to be a force for peace, progress and stability in Asia and the world.

Yomiuri: What concrete steps are being taken under the India-Japan partnership to improve cooperation on semiconductors, and how will this collaboration help address supply chain challenges, boost domestic manufacturing in India and support the technological ambitions of both countries?

Modi: The India-Japan partnership is unique. It spans millennia of cultural bonds, and is now shaping the contours of the 21st century. We are working together on new and emerging technologies, with semiconductor being one of them.

India's semiconductor sector is on the cusp of transformation. We have put in place a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework, backed by incentives, to build a strong semiconductor and display ecosystem. Already, six semiconductor units are taking root in India, with four more on the way.

By the end of this very year, “Made in India” chips will be in the market, a clear demonstration of India's design and manufacturing capabilities.

Japanese companies, with their technological strengths and global leadership, can play a pivotal role in this journey. A strong beginning has already been made. By combining India's scale and capabilities with Japan's advanced technologies, we can build a resilient and trusted semiconductor value chain.

This collaboration will support the technological ambitions of both our countries, and enhance global supply chain security.

I see semiconductor cooperation emerging as a major pillar of the India–Japan partnership.

After all, in this digital century, chips are not just about computers, they are about competitiveness, credibility and confidence in the future.

Yomiuri: India has an expansive vision for space exploration, and we understand that your government has recently approved the Chandrayaan 5 Mission, and that this will be done in collaboration with Japan. How do you envision the future of space exploration with Japan as the key partner?

Modi: India's space journey is a story of determination, hard work and innovation of our scientists.

From Chandrayaan-3's historic landing on the moon's south pole to our advances in interplanetary missions, India has consistently demonstrated that space is not the final frontier, it is the next frontier.

I am glad that India and Japan are joining hands for the next edition of the Chandrayaan series or the LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration) mission. This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole.

Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between ISRO and JAXA, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launch pads, and from research to real-world applications.

The impact of space science is linked to progress in our daily lives, from agriculture, disaster management, to communications and beyond.

I am confident that our scientific teams will be working together to push the boundaries of space science. And, our partnership in space will not only expand horizons above us, but also improve lives around us.

Yomiuri: During the India-Japan Defense Ministers' meeting in May 2025 in New Delhi, both sides focused on deepening defense cooperation in pursuing military modernization. In this regard, how has the India-Japan defense partnership evolved in recent years, and what opportunities and challenges lie ahead for both countries in improving defense cooperation?

Modi: Collaboration in the defense sector has been a strong success story for India and Japan. Both countries have a shared interest in peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

Today, our partnership spans across all three services. We conduct regular bilateral and multilateral exercises. We are building a robust Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation, and working on codevelopment and coproduction of UNICORN masts for our Navy.

In recent years, Indian defense products are rapidly expanding their global footprint. Japan also has a proven record in the field of defense technology. Together, with political trust and natural complementarities, we can design and produce next generation defense platforms not just for ourselves, but also for the world.

The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to be adopted during my visit will further military modernization and defense industry collaboration, and advance our ambition for shaping a secure and stable Indo-Pacific for generations to come.

Yomiuri: How do you evaluate the economic partnership between India and Japan?

Modi: Economic partnership is one of the key pillars of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. As the world's leading economies, we have been contributing to each other's growth, competitiveness and dynamism.

Japan has been a trusted partner in India's infrastructure development across generations. Japan has also been a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment for India in key sectors including automobiles, electronics, telecom, chemicals, finance and pharmaceuticals.

The number of Japanese firms in India has grown steadily to around 1,500, while more than 400 Indian companies operate in Japan. Clearly, this is only the beginning — the real potential is much higher.

We must aim bigger and remain ambitious. The synergies across governments, businesses and people can create scale and speed in our economic partnership.

We maintain important trade relations, but it has not yet reached the levels envisaged under our CEPA [Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement]. I am confident that with renewed efforts, we can diversify our trade basket, make it more balanced and open up new frontiers as well.

The 20th century saw Japan emerge as a major partner in India's infrastructure development. I am confident that the 21st century will see Japan as a major partner in India's innovation, manufacturing, and global value chains.

Yomiuri: Some Japanese companies are positioning their production bases in India as hubs for third-country markets such as Africa. How would India support the efforts of such companies?

Modi: India has seen multi-faceted reforms which make manufacturing in India easier than ever before. We have removed compliance burdens, rolled out incentives and ensured a large skilled work force for companies to set base in India.

Many global companies, including from Japan, are setting up their production in India not only to cater to our domestic market, but also for the world.

Just a couple of days back, I was at the Suzuki plant in India where we flagged off electric vehicles to be exported to a hundred countries, including Japan.

India enjoys a historically close and multifaceted relationship with Africa and various countries of the Global South.

Steps like “Japan-India Cooperation Initiative for Sustainable Economic Development in Africa” combining Japan's technological and financial expertise with India's developmental partnership and long-standing goodwill in Africa are good efforts in the right direction.

India is well placed to play the role of a bridge connecting Japan's capabilities with Africa's growth and development priorities.

Yomiuri: One of the main items on your agenda for your visit will be India's bullet train project. What are your expectations for Japan, with its Shinkansen technology, in terms of future vehicle production in India?

Modi: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is a flagship project between India and Japan. We are aiming to have the passenger services start in a few years' time.

While the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is on its way, we have unveiled a bigger ambition: to have a 7,000-kilometer-long network of high-speed rail in our country.

Much of it will have to be through Make in India, so that the program is sustainable and viable. I welcome active participation by Japanese companies in this endeavour.

There is also potential to expand our cooperation beyond high-speed rail to cover other areas of mobility including sectors such as ports, aviation, shipbuilding, road transport, railways and logistics where India has launched ambitious initiatives.

Clearly, Japan's technological edge in many of these areas, together with India's scale, manufacturing and innovation power, can create enormous value for both sides.

Yomiuri: People-to-People exchanges between India and Japan have become an important area of cooperation. Can you tell us more about how India and Japan plan to take this forward?

Modi: Immense mutual goodwill and friendship between the people of India and Japan is at the heart of our ties with Japan. There is great receptivity toward our cultures and cuisines in both countries.

Professionals from Japan are well respected in India and have built a niche for themselves.

Similarly, Indian diaspora across the world are contributing significantly in the growth of various countries. Whether it is Indian IT professionals or Indian scientific manpower, greater presence of the Indian diaspora in Japan can help stimulate new industries and new fields of knowledge where our two countries have so much at stake.

We have also etched important agreements under Japan's Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) program and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to enhance the advanced manufacturing skills of our workers.

This will help our manufacturing industry grow and contribute to our vision for a developed India. Our focus has also been in promoting language education in India which would also allow our people to connect better with each other and to tap into the complementarities. I look forward to discussing this aspect of our relations at the Summit.

Yomiuri: What can Japan and India do to help establish international rules for the reliable use of AI? What are your thoughts on data sovereignty?

Modi: We live in the digital age. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our lives, with AI being in the forefront. India sees AI as a medium to enhance human progress.

But we are equally conscious of the risk it poses. We believe that resolving concerns and encouraging innovation should be given equal importance in AI Governance so that we only promote Responsible AI. There is a need to evolve a consensus on global governance and norms for Responsible AI.

AI Governance must go beyond mitigating risks; it should also encourage fair access and foster inclusive progress for all, especially in the Global South.

India's Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) has democratized digital commerce and addressed key data protection issues through techno-legal solutions.

Similarly, Japan's “Data Free Flow with Trust” (DFFT) initiative focuses on privacy, security and trustworthy cross-border data flows.

In a data-driven world, international collaboration is crucial for effective AI governance and secure and transparent cross-border data exchange.

India and Japan should seize this opportunity to deepen our partnership, promote interoperability while respecting sovereignty, harmonize standards through techno-legal solutions and identify convergence between regulatory approaches.

India will be hosting the AI Impact Summit in 2026. It will be an opportunity for India and Japan to collaborate and take these issues forward.

Yomiuri: What are your views on the Japanese government's concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific? How will India and Japan cooperate and enhance their relationship to realize this concept?

Modi: There is a strong convergence between Japan's vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and India's own approach encapsulated in our Indo-Pacific vision, in the Vision MAHASAGAR and the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative. India and Japan are committed to an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful, prosperous, stable and where the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations are respected.

Both our countries have strong and extensive linkages with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and we both engage with some of them in plurilateral formats to give expression to our shared objectives.

Yomiuri: You are visiting China after your visit to Japan. What is the importance of improving relations with China at this time?

Modi: At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, I would be traveling to Tianjin from here to take part in the SCO Summit. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, steady and positive progress has been made in our bilateral ties.

Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity.

This is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.

Given the current volatility in world economy, it is also important for India and China, as two major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. India is ready to advance bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.

Yomiuri: You recently held consecutive phone conversations with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. What role does India envision playing in the peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two countries?

Modi: India has maintained a principled and humanitarian stance on the conflict which is equally appreciated by both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. In line with this, both the leaders spoke to me to share their perspectives on the developments related to the conflict. I reiterated India's principled and consistent stand and encouraged dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.

I have already indicated India's willingness to support meaningful efforts aimed at achieving peaceful resolution of the conflict. I believe, by virtue of our good relations with both sides, including key stakeholders, we can strengthen efforts dedicated to the restoration of an early and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Yomiuri: As a member of BRICS, how do you view the importance of the Global South? Should Japan see India as a bridge between the Global South and other countries such as Quad members?

Modi: The global community has made a commitment to create a more equitable world through achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. If we have to live up to this commitment, then the Global South must be given priority. In a highly interconnected world, we have seen the debilitating impact of the pandemic, conflicts and supply chain disruptions on the Global South. They continue to face myriad challenges involving global governance, climate change, food and energy security, debt and financial stress, all having significant impact on their development priorities.

As members of the Global South, we clearly understand these concerns and their effects on people's lives. We have made strenuous efforts to bring these to the forefront of the global agenda.

All our global initiatives, like Mission LiFE, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, International Solar Alliance, Global Biofuels Alliance, focus on promoting the interests of the Global South. Our G20 Presidency saw the inclusion of the African Union and gave voice to the aspirations of the Global South.

Similarly, in BRICS, we are actively engaged in working toward the benefit of the Global South. India attaches importance to its engagement with BRICS, which has emerged as a valuable forum for consultation, and cooperation and has helped promote mutual understanding, on a specific set of issues of common interest to emerging economies.

Under the rubric of the Quad, we have worked for the development and progress of the countries in the Indo-Pacific.

India has also consistently called for urgent and comprehensive reforms of the global multilateral institutions to make them more effective and reflective of the current geopolitical and economic realities.

India's motto is “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — the world is one family. We believe in building bridges of cooperation and friendship among nations.

Yomiuri: When it comes to the Quad, what is the significance of the Indian prime minister visiting Japan? What areas of cooperation with Japan would you like to see confirmed ahead of the group's autumn summit? How will you develop the Quad framework in the future?

Modi: In the last twenty years since its inception in 2004, the Quad has emerged as a force of global good delivering positive outcomes for the people of the Indo-Pacific region. Quad's practical agenda ranges from maritime safety and security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, cyber security, critical and emerging technologies and connectivity to education, health and even space cooperation.

The role of the Quad in the delivery of public goods can also be very significant. We greatly value Japan's role in strengthening the Quad's agenda and believe that together we can continue to deliver practical solutions and tangible outcomes that benefit not only our region but the wider world.

An immigrants rights group is demanding that California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and Attorney General Rob Bonta launch an investigation into the death of Carlos Montoya, a Guatemalan father who was fatally struck by a car on August 14 as he allegedly ran from federal agents who were abducting people outside a Home Depot in Monrovia, California.

“The people of California have a right to know what happened on that day,” the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) said in a press release on August 26. “We demand the state to release its own report — one that tells the truth, names the victim, holds federal agents accountable, and honors the dignity of all people, regardless of their perceived immigration status.”

Newsom and Bonta did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The group issued its call the day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) posted an announcement about Montoya's death, almost two weeks after it occurred. The agency stated that an “unknown pedestrian” was “struck by a vehicle on Interstate 210” at about 9:50 am on the morning of August 14, “approximately 250 feet north of the Home Depot parking lot where the USBP [U.S. Border Patrol] enforcement action had taken place earlier that morning.” 

CBP goes on to claim that it learned of Montoya's death from media reports and that the agency subsequently interviewed “USBP personnel involved in the enforcement action.” An agent, who is not named in the announcement, said that “he pursued a man on foot north out of the Home Depot parking lot but abandoned his foot pursuit when he observed the man run up an I-210 exit ramp toward the eastbound lanes of the freeway.” 

“The BPA reported that he climbed the retaining wall which runs parallel to the exit ramp and shouted a warning to the suspect about the dangerous freeway traffic,” the announcement continues. “The BPA stated he then turned around and returned to the Home Depot parking lot to assist in the enforcement action and did not witness the man being struck by a vehicle.”In the announcement, CBP only identifies Montoya as an “unnamed pedestrian,” despite widespread coverage of his death. NDLON called CBP's statement “dehumanizing, dishonest, and disgraceful.”

“Carlos Montoya was not an ‘unknown pedestrian,'” the group said in a press release. “He was a beloved father and grandfather, and a member of our community. He died while fleeing a reckless, unnecessary immigration raid conducted by Border Patrol agents who descended on a Home Depot parking lot — where day laborers, like Carlos, gather every morning in search of work, not trouble.” 

At the time of his death, Montoya had been living in the United States for about three years, earning money to support his family in Guatemala. His eldest daughter, Ana Victoria, told Democracy Now! that her father hoped to own his own business so he could support his family. 

“The last call I had with my dad was Wednesday at 11:00 at night, the day before he died,” she said. “And he told me, ‘Things are rough here. It is getting harder here. I just need to make a little bit more money so that I can go back to Guatemala.'” 

On the same day that CBP posted an announcement on Montoya's death, the agency released statements about five additional deaths — four that occurred in June and one that occurred in August. Of those, two involved people fleeing federal agents, one by car and one by foot. The woman who fled on foot was hit by a car and killed three days after Montoya, in El Paso, Texas.

The woman, only identified as an “adult female citizen of Ecuador,” exited a canal near the Rio Grande River and ran toward a chain link fence by the Cesar E. Chavez Border Highway, according to CBP. The agency claims a Supervisory Border Patrol Agent (SBPA) ordered the woman to stop in Spanish, “but she ignored him and climbed over the fence.”

“The SBPA observed her run across the eastbound lanes of the highway,” CBP says. 

As she attempted to cross the highway, she was hit by a car and then a second vehicle ran over her body, according to CBP. She has not been identified by name by CBP.

The European Commission has contacted Kiev over Ukrainian missile strikes on the Druzhba pipeline that transmits oil from Eurasia into Western Europe, calling it vital to the continent's energy security. Ukrainian forces have hit the route three times in August alone.

One of the world's longest energy networks, Druzhba spans roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), carrying oil from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Passing through Ukraine, it remains the primary route for deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia.

“The EC is in contact with the Ukrainian side and calls on all parties of the conflict to ensure the security of critical infrastructure,” spokeswoman Eva Hrncirova said, responding to whether the Commission had urged Kiev to refrain from striking the pipeline.

She added that the pipeline is “an important asset for EU energy security,” but emphasized that according to the Commission's assessment, the latest strikes have not affected the bloc's energy security.

Kiev's most recent attack nearly a week ago effectively halted Russian oil deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary, prompting the two EU countries to demand action from the Commission.

On Wednesday, Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the pipeline was back online after a week-long disruption caused by Ukrainian strikes. Hungarian oil group MOL, which operates refineries in Hungary and Slovakia, confirmed that oil supplies had been restored.

The attacks have been condemned by both the Hungarian and Slovak governments, which have often criticized EU support for Kiev. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said earlier this week that the attacks jeopardize Hungary's energy security and called it “outrageous that the EC keeps on claiming there is ‘no supply risk'.”

Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said the strikes not only directly undermined his country's national interests but also harmed Ukraine, noting that Kiev relies on diesel fuel supplies from Slovakia.

According to a letter shared by Hungarian officials, US President Donald Trump also expressed frustration over the attacks, saying he was “very angry” about them.

Moscow has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.

BERLIN, August 28. /TASS/. The German government has no "final opinion" regarding the possibility of expropriating frozen Russian assets, Foreign Minister of Germany Johann Wadephul said at a press conference.

The possibility of using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine will be discussed at the forthcoming informal meetings of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen on August 29-30. "This will be one of the items for discussion at the informal ministerial meeting in Copenhagen. There is a need to shed the light on difficult legal issues and implications for the financial market stability," Wadephul said.

The EU is already expropriating revenues from refinancing of illegally frozen Russian assets, the minister noted. "We will continue discussions," he added.

The greater portion of immobilized Russian assets, slightly more than 200 bln euro, is blocked with the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The depository repeated spoke against the expropriation of assets, cautioning that it may entail the seizure of European or Belgian assets by Russia through courts in other parts of the globe.

            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing to keep her job on the board, which helps set interest rates, after President Donald Trump said he was removing her from her role earlier this week.
    


            Cook's lawsuit, filed Thursday morning in federal court in Washington, DC, asks for a judge to rule that Trump's attempt to remove her is unlawful and that she remains an active member of the Federal Reserve.
    


            A hearing on her request for a temporary restraining order has been scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Friday in front of Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden.
    


            Cook's lawsuit sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes legal battle with major implications for the Fed and the power of the presidency, even as Trump moves to consolidate his hold over parts of the government once considered sacrosanct and free from political influence.
    


            “Without emergency relief, defendants are now likely to allow an unexpired vacancy to occur for which President Trump has indicated he is ready to fill,” Cook's lawyers wrote in their request.
    


            The White House, however, said that Trump's firing of cook was lawful.
    


            “The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Thursday. “The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.”
    


Trump's firing of Fed's Lisa Cook tests Supreme Court's limits on presidential power



            Cook is claiming in her lawsuit that Trump's abrupt firing of her violated her due process rights under both the Constitution and federal law, which she says include receiving proper notice of her alleged wrongdoing and a hearing through which she can respond to the allegations.
    


            “Governor Cook received neither notice nor a hearing before her purported firing,” her attorneys wrote in the suit. “This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook's Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven.”
    


            She also argues that Trump is attempting to redefine the meaning of “cause” in a way that would allow him to fire any board member “with whom he disagrees about policy based on chalked up allegations.”
    


            “President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally redefine ‘cause' – completely unmoored to caselaw, history, and tradition – and conclude, without evidence, that he has found it,” her attorneys wrote.
    


            On Monday, Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire the central bank official. The letter cited accusations of mortgage fraud first raised by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.
    


            Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence. The Trump administration has said it is investigating other perceived political opponents of the president for alleged mortgage fraud, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff of California.
    


            The Justice Department has said it plans to investigate Pulte's allegations. Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
    


            Cook is also asking the court to declare that “an unsubstantiated allegation of mortgage fraud prior to a Governor's confirmation is not cause for removal” under federal law.
    


            Cook's situation may be legally complicated around her dismissal, given Trump's belief he can fire her for cause even if allegations are unproven and an investigation isn't complete.
    


            The 24-page complaint, filed at a federal court in Washington, DC, accuses Trump of using fraud allegations in an attempt to end-run federal law intended to protect her from such interference by the president.
    


‘It's a genie you can't put back in the bottle': Economist on Trump targeting Federal Reserve's independence



            “It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,” Cook's attorneys wrote in the lawsuit.
    


            “This is a big case,” said Jane Manners, an associate professor at Fordham School of Law who researches presidential power. “If we're going to allow politics to determine the membership of the Fed, what does that mean for the future of our economy?”
    


            Several other quasi-independent federal government officials have been unsuccessful in holding on to their positions, despite their emergency lawsuits.
    


            The majority conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly allowed Trump to fire leadership of independent government agencies this year. However, the court has drawn a line in the past around the Fed. In May, the court called the Federal Reserve a “uniquely structured” agency with a long history of insulation from political interference from the White House that shouldn't be changed.
    


            A court would have the power to say whether Cook can continue serving in her role now or must step aside until the legal proceedings are resolved in a fuller way later.
    


            The Fed said in a statement on Tuesday it will abide by a court's decision in Cook's challenge of her attempted firing.
    


            “Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,” the Fed said.
    


            The president has the power to fire any Fed governor for cause, but it's unclear whether unproven allegations meet that threshold.



            The president has blamed the Fed's leadership for moving too slowly, in his view, to lower interest rates.
    


            If Cook is allowed to remain a Fed governor, without any restrictions, she'll be able to vote at the Fed's upcoming September 16-17 meeting. Fed policymakers are widely expected to deliver the first interest rate cut since December, according to futures.
    


            Cook hasn't publicly spoken about the economy since Pulte raised accusations of mortgage fraud against her. Her latest comment on the economy was after the release of the July jobs report on August 6 during a moderated discussion hosted by the Boston Fed.
    


            She said that the weak streak of job growth in recent months was “concerning” and that the labor market could be at a turning point.

Russia attacked a Ukrainian Navy vessel, killing one crew member and injuring several others, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 28.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Other details of the attack, including the time and location, have not yet been disclosed.

Earlier in the day, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that a Russian naval drone hit the Ukrainian medium reconnaissance ship Simferopol near the mouth of the Danube River, alleging that the ship had sunk.

Simferopol is a Ukrainian Navy reconnaissance ship of the Laguna-class. It was launched in 2019 and officially joined the fleet two years later.

The vessel is designed for radio, electronic, radar, and optical reconnaissance, and was armed with a 30 mm AK-306 artillery system.

While Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, reports of Ukrainian naval losses are extremely rare.

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has targeted multiple civilian vessels in the Black Sea, including foreign ones.

The Aug. 28 call came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial strike on Ukrainian cities overnight.

At least 18 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

This marks the first time a vessel carrying fuel from the blacklisted facility has entered a Chinese import terminal.

The attack on the junction station occurred around 5 a.m. in Tver, a Russian city northwest of Moscow.



Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles.

Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker.



"This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."



"No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles, among them two Kh-47 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T reported a higher third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates but also booked restructuring charges as the bank works to shore up deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls and adjust to a cap on U.S. retail assets imposed by regulators. 

TD earned profit of $3.34-billion, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31. That compared with a quarterly loss in the same quarter last year after U.S. regulators hit the bank with a US$3-billion fine over serious lapses in its programs to prevent money laundering. 

Adjusted to exclude that one-time charge, TD said it earned $2.20 per share, which was higher than the $2.05 consensus estimate among analysts. 

The quarterly earnings were affected by $262-million incurred from TD's moves to restructure its U.S. balance sheet, which has included selling loans to stay under the regulatory asset cap. 

TD now has US$386-billion of assets in its U.S. business, which is below the US$434-billion limit. TD also took a $333-million restructuring charge in the quarter as part of a previously announced plan to spend $600-million to $700-million over several quarters to reduce its overall staffing by 2 per cent and eventually save $550-million to $650-million annually, before tax. 

A bright spot in TD's third-quarter results was its Canadian retail banking division, which reported profit of $1.95-billion, up 4 per cent from last year. The division has lagged rival banks in recent quarters, but has emerged as a key point of emphasis as the bank's ambitions to grow in the U.S. have been curbed for the time being.

Profit from U.S. retail banking was $760-million, compared with a loss in the same quarter last year. Loans were down 7 per cent because of asset sales, and the division had higher governance and control costs.

Wealth management and insurance profit was $703-million, up 63 per cent from a year ago. And profit from wholesale banking was $398-million, up 26 per cent year over year. 

“We are well positioned to build on this momentum as we compete, grow and build our bank for the future,” chief executive officer Ray Chun said in a statement. 

TD set aside $971-million in provisions for credit losses, or money earmarked to cover loans that may default. That was lower than the second quarter and well below the $1.2-billion analysts anticipated, according to LSEG.

TD's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its resilience in times of stress, is 14.8 per cent. 

TD plans to hold an investor day presentation on September 29 to unveil its updated strategy under Mr. Chun to analysts and shareholders.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that TD earned profit of $3.37-billion in the third quarter. The bank earned profit of $3.34-billion. This version has been corrected.

Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional comments from Ukrainian and Hungarian officials.

Hungary has decided to ban the commander of a Ukrainian military unit responsible for the latest attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline from entering the country and the Schengen Area, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Aug. 28.

In recent weeks, Ukraine carried out at least three attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily disrupting operations. 

Though Szijjarto did not name the commander hit by the ban, Balazs Orban, the Hungarian prime minister's political director, confirmed for Hungarian news outlet 444 that the measure targets Robert Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces.

Brovdi, who is of Hungarian descent and known by the call sign "Madyar," has confirmed that his branch was responsible for the drone strikes against Druzhba, including the latest one carried out on Aug. 21, which targeted the Unecha pumping station in Bryansk Oblast.

The Hungarian foreign minister described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."

"Ukraine knows very well that the Druzhba pipeline is vital for Hungary's and Slovakia's energy supply, and that such strikes harm us far more than Russia," Szijjarto said on X.

Brovdi dismissed Budapest's decision and said the Hungarian leadership shares responsibility for Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities by "filling their own dirty pockets with sanctioned cheap raw materials."

"I am Ukrainian, and I will arrive in my father's homeland after you," the commander said on his Telegram channel. "There are enough true Hungarians in Hungary, and one day, they will be sick to death of you."

In his statement, Szijjarto made no mention of the Russian overnight mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv on Aug. 28, which killed at least 18 people, including four children, and injured almost 40 others. 

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Budapest "is on the wrong side of history."

"Peter, if the Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed by Russia this morning, this is moral decay," he wrote on X.

"If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to clarify the issue and "respond accordingly."

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest, carries Russian oil directly to Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still buying Russian crude through the system. In July, they imported $232 million and $196 million worth of oil, respectively.

Hungary, widely seen as the most Russia-friendly government in the EU, has repeatedly opposed Brussels' attempts to fully halt Russian energy imports and threatened to block Ukraine's path to EU membership.

Kyiv regularly carries out attacks on military and industrial facilities in Russia, targeting Russian oil infrastructure to undermine Moscow's revenue streams and weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine.

The chief of America's top public health agency is refusing to quit after she reportedly clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr over vaccine policy.

Lawyers for Dr Susan Monarez have said she can only be fired directly by Donald Trump himself, even though the White House on Wednesday said she had been kicked out.

The stand-off comes less than a month after she was confirmed by the senate to lead the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and days after Mr Kennedy Jr reportedly tried to push her out.

Four other senior scientists also quit the agency, reportedly in apparent frustration at Mr Kennedy's leadership and sceptical stance on vaccines.

Sources told CNN that Dr Monarez had clashed with Mr Kennedy over vaccine policies, including an upcoming announcement that could draw links between immunisations and autism.

Another source also told The New York Times that the pair had been at odds over vaccine policy.

Mr Kennedy Jr's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Dr Monarez was “no longer” director, less than a month after her senate confirmation.

Hours later, her lawyers responded that she had “neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired”.

A statement warned of the “the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts and the dangerous politicisation of science”.

“The attack on Dr Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” it said.

The White House late on Wednesday announced that she had been fired.

Kush Desai, the White House's deputy press secretary, said Dr Monarez was not “aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again”.

Because she had “refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC”, he added.

Dr Monarez refused to back down however, with her lawyer, Mark Zaid, saying: “As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her.

He went on: “For this reason, we reject notification Dr Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House counsel of our position.”

Mr Kennedy Jr, widely known as RFK, has a long track record of questioning the efficacy and safety of vaccines. He has denied that he wants to take vaccines away, but has pushed discredited claims that vaccines cause autism.

Dr Monarez said during her confirmation hearing that she had not seen evidence of such a link.

In June, Mr Kennedy Jr dismissed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations.

The CDC has also been targeted for hefty budget cuts as part of Donald Trump's campaign to cut back federal spending.

Earlier this month a man opened fire on the agency's Atlanta headquarters, killing a policeman.

Detectives later said the shooter had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal.

The union representing CDC workers said the incident “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect and vilification that CDC staff have endured”.

Dr Debra Houry, the CDC chief medical officer, and Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, also resigned.

Dr Houry wrote in her resignation: “Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.”

Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say

As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside.

Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspected, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.

The shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but failed as the doors had been locked when mass began, Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara told NBC's Today show on Thursday morning. As a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn't get into the church “likely saved countless lives”, O'Hara said.

Online posts indicate that Westman's mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021. O'Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation.

“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.

“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noem said.

He said the incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets were fired through the windows.

“Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a gymnasium.

The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school.

Many knew each other well in a community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a suburb better described as a small town.

“I'm just asking [God]: ‘Why right now?' It's little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon.

Pope Leo XIV, who is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured in the “terrible tragedy”.

Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian. That request was granted in January 2020.

A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O'Hara said, adding it was believed they acted alone.

He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging from Donald Trump to antisemitic statements to gun rights.

As police continue to search for a potential motive, O'Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter's devices. “Everything that we've seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC's Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O'Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing.

At a briefing, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”

Later, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. This is about them.”

One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.

The GoFundMe notes that Forchas's younger brother was also inside the school during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically injured.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Design for Impact is a series spotlighting innovative solutions for communities affected by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.



            Before sunrise in Dien Phuong, Vietnam, clay artists set up their workbenches beneath swaying bamboo by the Thu Bon River, shaping ceramic works to the sound of birdsong. Each October, when the river swells with rainwater, workers pause, move their tools and wares away, and only return once the waters recede.
    


            Inspired by the rhythm of the rainy season, Vietnamese architecture firm Tropical Space opened a flood-resistant studio for local artist Le Huc Da, dubbed Terra Cotta Studio, in 2016. Each year, the monsoon waters consume the lower reaches of the striking cube-shaped structure — but rather than sweeping it away, the rising tide flows gently through its perforated brick walls. The studio's lattice-brick design also harnesses airflow and shade to withstand central Vietnam's unforgiving climate.
    


            In 2023, the architects expanded the project with Terra Cotta Workshop, a neighboring facility featuring studio space for other local artists, as well as a large kiln and visitor center. Inside, artisans store their work on 6.5-foot‑high platforms, above the highest flood levels seen in the village this century. The workshops' electric wiring was installed three feet above the ground, and equipment can be moved safely to high shelves during monsoons.
    


            “We did not design the structure to resist or oppose the water,” Tropical Space's co-founder, Nguyen Hai Long, said of the original studio building in an email interview. “Instead, it stands there and quietly observes the rise and fall of the river.”
    


            Nguyen is part of a new generation of architects in the country, turning to local materials and time-honored building techniques — not only the distinctive brickwork but also stilted foundations and floating bamboo platforms — as enduring tools of climate resilience. He said the designs of Terra Cotta Studio and Workshop were influenced by the region's traditional merchants' houses, which often survived seasonal floods thanks to their perforated walls.
    


            “If we live in harmony with the natural order, we recognize both its limits and its gifts,” Nguyen said. Floods, he added, bring not just destruction but also more fertile land and raw materials. “Without a deep connection to the land, we might miss nature's anger, its joy or its subtle changes.”
    


            With over 2,000 miles of coastline and low‑lying river deltas, Vietnam is consistently ranked among the world's most climate‑vulnerable nations.
    


            The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery says that more than 70% of the country's population faces regular exposure to “natural hazards” including typhoons, floods and salt‑water intrusion. In 2020 alone, the effects of the climate crisis — ranging from rising sea‑levels to intensified storms — cost Vietnam an estimated $10 billion, or 3.2% of its GDP, according to the World Bank Group.
    


            The United Nations Development Programme estimates 40% of the Mekong Delta, home to some 18 million people, will be submerged by 2100. 



            Amid these mounting threats, Hanoi-based H&P Architects is reimagining buildings as living, breathing entities that rise and fall with the water — anchored structures, secured to the riverbed with stakes and ropes.
    


            The firm's Floating Bamboo House prototype offers a modular solution for the Mekong Delta's flood-prone communities. Solid-core bamboo poles form a lightweight yet sturdy triangular frame, buoyed by repurposed plastic barrels. A generous overhanging roof collects rainwater and supports solar panels, providing energy and water reserves if nearby roads temporarily disappear underwater.
    


            A system of flexible doors, which can be easily opened or closed depending on the conditions, keep the home well-ventilated in dry weather and securely sealed during storms. They also give the house a distinctive character — like “bright flowers standing resiliently amid seasonal floods,” said H&P Architects' founder and principal architect, Doan Thanh Ha, by email.
    


            The concept was initially sketched in 2015 and realized as a full-scale prototype in 2022. Efforts to roll out the homes have thus far been constrained by Vietnam's construction laws, which do not recognize bamboo as a permanent construction material and offer no clear path for permitting homes built on water, according to Ha.
    


            Despite these challenges, Ha believes the design “addresses the scenario” of a 1-meter (3.3-foot) sea-level rise. Built in just six weeks, by Ha and three young architects, the prototype also offers a model for rapid deployment; the low-cost materials, including pressed bamboo sheets and recycled oil barrels, totaled just $5,000.
    


            Ha described his floating house as “a practical alternative for millions of low-income households, enabling them to quickly build safe, stable shelter themselves — and to better prepare for even the worst effects of climate change.” With skilled labor, they could be constructed in as little as two weeks, he added.
    


            Tropical storms are another growing threat in Vietnam, which can experience several in a single year. Climate data suggests the storms are getting stronger, and the country's architects are increasingly looking to mitigate the risk posed by powerful winds.
    


            In Cam Thanh village, near the tourist hotspot of Hoi An, the Casamia Community House rises on a concrete plinth above a tidal river. Designed by VTN Architects, a firm founded by one of Vietnam's most celebrated contemporary architects, Vo Trong Nghia, the community hub was made from 22 bamboo arch trusses that form a 29-foot-high vaulted canopy able to deflect strong winds.
    


            Bamboo is known for its flexibility, allowing the structure's frame to bend and sway in high winds. The building's thatched roof is meanwhile reinforced with a layer of wire netting, providing extra protection by shielding the interior from harsh natural elements. The structure withstood the devastating 2020 typhoon season, during which more than a dozen storms hit the country. Among them was Typhoon Molave, which Vietnamese officials at the time described as one of the worst typhoons to strike the country in two decades.
    


            “Bamboo really harmonizes with the weather, especially in hot, humid climates like Vietnam's,” said Nghia, who founded VTN Architects in 2006, in a phone interview. “For restaurants near the ocean or community spaces, bamboo should be used more often. It works well, and it's culturally familiar.”
    


            Around 350 miles away at HippoFarm, an eco-tourism resort near Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based T3 Architects took a different approach: using rice-husk insulation and recycled steel horse boxes to raise the main dormitory building above flood lines. The rice husk, which is mixed with diatomaceous earth — a porous material consisting of fossilised diatoms — provides thermal insulation, repels pests and resists humidity.
    


            The design draws on various traditional Vietnamese building principles, such as wide roof overhangs that protect facades from sun and rain, and cross-ventilation with openings on opposing walls to enhance airflow. The architects also looked to local materials, like regionally sourced bricks, sand, lime and bamboo.
    


            “Reusing existing materials is part of our frugal approach to do more with less,” said Charles Gallavardin, co-founder and general director of T3 Architects, over email. “By addressing escalating climate challenges — including frequent heatwaves, sudden storms and worsening floods — HippoFarm offers a resilient, low-carbon response to Vietnam's warming climate.”
    


            These architectural solutions, rooted in centuries of climate adaptation, may eventually have an impact beyond Vietnam. H&P Architects says it has fielded queries for its floating bamboo houses from disaster-prone communities across Asia and beyond. When Ha originally envisaged the flood-resilient homes, he was only thinking “about local needs,” the architect said, adding: “But after the project was completed, queries came in from places like Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, the Philippines, India, China and even the United States.”
    


            For now, the project remains a prototype — the houses are not yet being manufactured for sale. But should he ever deploy them overseas, Ha emphasizes the importance of local context. “It's essential to understand the specific natural and socio-cultural conditions of a community before applying any model.” While some European countries, like the Netherlands and Denmark, have already developed floating housing strategies, Ha believes his prototype could be easily adapted in places that haven't. Where bamboo isn't available, local timber or even repurposed steel scaffolding can be used, he said.
    


            VTN's Nghia has meanwhile been commissioned to design several major bamboo projects outside Vietnam, including a large-scale restaurant in Xiamen, China. The bamboo poles were soaked in water and smoked before use, a traditional Vietnamese treatment that increases the material's durability and can last up to half a century, the architect said. The treatment seemingly proved effective: “It was hit by strong weather, but it's still OK,” Nghia said of the restaurant.
    


            Nghia has completed several other bamboo projects in China, as well as a serene bamboo pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2018. He said he is also exploring projects in Myanmar and India.
    


How these round homes survive hurricanes



            But while bamboo is suited to many global contexts, regulatory barriers are often prohibitive — especially in the West. The UK's Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) describes bamboo as a “compelling alternative to carbon-intensive materials,” but attributes its slow adoption in Western construction to its status as a non-traditional material, scarcity in local markets and skepticism within the industry (for one, there are concerns that bamboo is naturally flammable, though this risk can be controlled through flame retardants and other treatments.)
    


            To date, only eight countries have established national building codes for bamboo, with the United States being the sole Western nation on that list, according to ICE.
    


            “Anywhere in the world could use bamboo — the big issue is building permission,” Nghia said. “We can combine bamboo with timber or steel to meet building codes, but keep bamboo as the main material.”

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) damaged a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.

According to the agency, during the operation, fighters from HUR's special unit "Prymary" damaged the ship's radar system using a drone strike, while special forces launched an attack directly on the missile carrier.

The missile ship, stationed in Temryuk Bay and ready to launch Kalibr missiles, was forced to retreat from its patrol zone after the attack, HUR said.

The agency published purported drone footage of the attack against the vessel.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Buyan-M-class ship, also designated Project 21631, is a small but heavily armed corvette capable of operating in shallow waters. The vessel was among the first Russian surface ships used to launch Kalibr missiles.

Repeated Ukrainian attacks using naval drones, missiles, and long-range drones have forced the Kremlin to reduce its naval presence in occupied Crimea.

Ukraine has destroyed several Russian vessels, including the Caesar Kunikov landing ship, the Sergei Kotov patrol ship, the Ivanovets missile corvette, and multiple high-speed landing crafts.

HUR also claimed on Aug. 21 that it had struck a Russian patrol boat in the Black Sea near the occupied town of Zaliznyi Port in Kherson Oblast, killing five crew members.

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.



At least 18 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles.

Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker.



"This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."



"No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles, among them two Kh-47 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

European and U.S. military officials have been increasingly concerned over the flights in the German state of Thuringia, even as Russian sabotage operations in Europe declined in 2025, the New York Times reported.

Among the 26 foreign heads of state and government expected to attend the parade in Beijing, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be the only leader of an EU country present.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) hit a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.

Ukrainian forces hit the Kuibyshev refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai overnight on Aug. 28, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

MOSCOW, August 28. /TASS/. Air defenses intercepted and destroyed 102 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

Drone fragments fell on the roof of a house in a village in the Rostov Region, and 89 people were evacuated from neighboring private houses due to the threat of detonation, Acting Governor Yury Slyusar said.

A fire covering an area of 200 square meters broke out in a forest after debris from a drone fell in Gelendzhik, the Krasnodar Region's operational headquarters said.

TASS has compiled the main information on the consequences of the attacks.

- Between 11:00 p.m. Moscow time on August 27 and 7:00 a.m. Moscow time on August 28 (between 8:00 p.m. GMT on August 27 and 4:00 a.m. GMT on August 28), air defenses intercepted and destroyed 102 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

- Twenty-two drones were intercepted and destroyed over the Black Sea, 21 over the Rostov and Samara Regions, 18 over the Krasnodar Region, 11 over Crimea, three over the Voronezh and Saratov Regions, two over the Volgograd Region, and one over the Azov Sea, the statement said.

- Drone fragments fell on the roof of a house in the village of Mankovo-Kalitvenskoye in the Rostov Region, Slyusar said.

- The fallen drone fragments damaged the electrical wiring, leaving the two-family house without power.

- Due to the threat of detonation of the warhead stuck in the roof, the residents of this house and 50 neighboring private houses were evacuated: a total of 89 people, including children, Slyusar specified.

- Most of the residents have temporarily moved in with relatives and friends, the acting governor noted, adding that 12 others are in a temporary shelter.

- Ten trains, including six passenger trains and four suburban trains, are delayed in the Samara Region, the Kuibyshev Railway said.

- Another three suburban trains have been canceled due to a drone crash near the Kryazh station, the statement noted.

- Fires broke out in a forest in the village of Krinitsa in Gelendzhik, the Krasnodar Region's operational headquarters said.

- Three fires covering a total area of 200 square meters were detected.

- Fourteen people and four pieces of equipment were involved in extinguishing the fires, the statement said.

- The headquarters also specified that the consequences of the drone attack are being eliminated in the Seversky district.

- In both cases, there were no casualties, and emergency and special services are working on site.

- At the Petrov Val station, debris from a drone caused a fire in a building unrelated to passenger infrastructure, the Volga Railway's Telegram channel said.

- According to preliminary information, there were no casualties.

- Several passenger trains were delayed.

- Train traffic through the Petrov Val station in the Volgograd region has now resume.

Activists and supporters of publisher Jimmy Lai gather for the national security trial in Taipei, Taiwan, on Aug. 24.ChiangYing-ying/The Associated Press

The case against Hong Kong newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai is “detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis” and rife with “Orwellian Doublespeak,” his lawyers said in their closing submission, as Mr. Lai's marathon national security trial wrapped up this week. 

Mr. Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 amid a crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, after months of often-violent protests the year before prompted Beijing to impose a draconian national security law on the semi-autonomous territory. 

Since then, he has spent more than 1,600 days in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, and almost two months testifying on the stand, as prosecutors sought to paint him as a key instigator of the 2019 protests and a nefarious agent of the West. 

Facing charges of sedition and colluding with foreign forces, Mr. Lai's final act as a journalist has been to “speak truth to power” in his own defence, his lawyers wrote in a more than 380-page submission to the court. 

“It is not wrong to support freedom of expression. It is not wrong to support human rights,” said barrister Robert Pang. “Nor is it wrong to hope that the government would change its policies, whether through its own internal review or through suggestion or even pressure, whether from inside Hong Kong or out.” 

Opinion: As the democratic world lines up behind Jimmy Lai, Canadian leadership is badly needed

The national security law under which Mr. Lai has been charged has a more than 90-per-cent conviction rate, and most observers have long predicted the publisher of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper will be found guilty, with many alleging the case against him is predetermined – something the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly rebutted. 

Founded in 1995, two years before Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, Apple Daily was by far the territory's most-popular tabloid before it was closed down in 2021. 

At its best a muckraking investigative outlet that pulled few punches, at its worst a celebrity and scandal-focused pioneer of paparazzi snooping, Apple Daily was always a strident advocate for greater democracy in Hong Kong, cheering on multiple protest movements and holding China's government to account for promises it made in assuming control over the former British colony. This stand made both the newspaper and Mr. Lai a bête noir for Chinese officials and state media.

Hong Kong pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai was provided with medication and a heart monitor for the start of his final submissions in a landmark national security trial, following health concerns over heart palpitations.

Mr. Lai's son Sebastien has said he fully expects his father to be found guilty, and his focus is on securing some kind of compassionate release after conviction. The younger Mr. Lai has been lobbying Western governments to take up Jimmy Lai's case, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who this month promised Washington would “do everything we can” to help, even potentially raising his case with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. 

And yet, going on court proceedings alone, Mr. Lai's conviction could feel like less than a done deal. The national security law is not retroactive, and prosecutors have struggled to make their case that an alleged conspiracy by Mr. Lai and others to lobby for international sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials – a crime now but not before July, 2020 – continued beyond the legislation being enacted. 

“In August, 2019, it was not possible to have a ‘conspiracy' in the relevant sense,” Mr. Lai's lawyers wrote in their submission to the court. “An agreement to carry out a lawful act is not a criminal conspiracy.” 

Indeed, they said, the “sheer quantity of evidence” relied upon by the prosecution from before passage of the national security law “serves only to highlight the paucity of evidence” from when the legislation was in force. 

“Faced with the discrepancy between the evidence and the prosecution case, the prosecution has dug its heels deep in its closing,” Mr. Lai's lawyers said. 

“Its allegations keep getting wilder, detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis. Bold conclusions are asserted without any attempt to justify them. ... Mr. Lai's last act as a journalist is to speak truth to power against this Orwellian Doublespeak.”

Prosecutor Anthony Chau argued last week that Mr. Lai had an “unwavering intent” to solicit sanctions through collaborations with foreign officials that were “long-term and persistent,” and extended beyond the passage of the national security law. 

The panel of three judges overseeing the case, all hand-picked by Hong Kong leader John Lee to handle national security trials, have at times seemed skeptical of the prosecution's case, though they have also forcefully challenged Mr. Pang on several occasions. 

Last Friday, Justice Esther Toh pointed to recent arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States and Britain to dismiss Mr. Pang's assertion that Mr. Lai's criticisms of China were legally protected speech, arguing all countries had limits on what could be said. 

“So it's good to say, la di da, freedom of expression, it's not illegal,” Justice Toh said. “Well, that's true, but it's not absolute.”

As well as the national security charges, which carry a potential life sentence, Mr. Lai is also accused of breaching a colonial-era sedition law – in force since 1938 – which has been resurrected and widely used by prosecutors since the 2019 protests. His maximum conviction under that law is three years. 

During a lengthy back-and-forth with Mr. Pang on Tuesday about the crime of sedition, Justice Toh blamed the media for seeking to “whip the common people into a frenzy” in 2019. Her fellow judge, Alex Lee, also suggested criticisms of the government by Apple Daily from that time could be crimes under the sedition law, the scope of which has been greatly expanded by several recent cases. 

Serious questions have been raised about Mr. Lai's health after his long incarceration, and proceedings were delayed earlier this month so he could be fitted with a heart monitor. Waving and smiling at supporters in court this week however, he seemed healthy and energized. 

Final procedural matters are due to wrap up by Thursday, but a verdict may not come for weeks, if not months.

Redistricting based on race is unconstitutional, Louisiana's attorney general told the Supreme Court on Aug. 27 in a preview of arguments that the state will make in an important upcoming election law case.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her state has long argued that the Supreme Court's “redistricting jurisprudence needs to be drastically changed or overruled.”

Weston Halsne was sitting next to the windows of the Church of Annunciation when a volley of bullets suddenly shattered the stained-glass panes.

As gunfire continued to tear through the Minneapolis church, the ten-year-old ran and hid under one of the wooden pews facing the altar and covered his head.

As he cowered in terror away from the gunfire, his friend Victor lay across him. He credits him with saving his life.

“He laid on top of me, but he got hit,” he said. “He was really brave”.

Moments before gunfire sprayed the hall, Annunciation Catholic School pupils had been filing into the church, filled with the excitement of the first morning Mass of the school year.

Monday had been the first day back at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy neighbourhood about 5 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.

But as the children took their seats, just before 8.30am (2.30pm UK) on Wednesday, transgender shooter Robin Westman was stalking the building outside.

Dressed in black and camouflage and armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun, Westman barricaded church doors with wooden planks before firing his rifle at the children through the side of the building, their heads bent in prayer.

Within seconds of the first bullets piercing the glass, staff desperately tried to move the pupils under the pews in an effort to shield them from the onslaught.

Two children, aged eight and ten, were struck and killed by the torrent of gunfire.

Another 14 children aged six to 15 were injured, two critically. Three parishioners in their eighties were also hurt, although all the injured victims were expected to survive.

Among those rushed to hospital, where medics frantically moved patients out of rooms to make way for the victims, was Victor, who Weston says he thinks is “okay”.

While officers had still not confirmed the number of bullets fired during Westman's rampage, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the number of rounds was “in the dozens”.

“The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Mr O'Hara said.

“Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “These kids were literally praying.”

Ellie Mertens, a youth pastor at Annunciation Catholic School, had also been sitting in a pew next to a window when Westman opened fire.

“It was an automatic gun and I was near kids and we all got down,” Ms Mertens told NBC News.

One parent who was inside the church during the attack said a police officer tried to run after the gunman as bullets were being fired.

Shea McAdaragh told CNN the officer came into the church during the shooting and then ran off to try and find the shooter.

“He was just a normal, every day beat cop. No special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,” Mr McAdaragh said.

After carrying out his twisted attack, Westman shot himself dead in the car park, according to the Minneapolis police chief.

Officers found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. Fox News reported the device was scrawled with the words “Jew gas”.

Before going on his killing spree, Westman had posted a series of YouTube videos showcasing his manifesto and large arsenal of weapons.

Westman's mother Mary is believed to be a retired employee of the school.

In one video, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun, and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over Westman's bed.

A notebook shown in one of the clips, which have now been removed, included a drawing that appears to be a map of the Annunciation Catholic Church.

As the shooting unfolded, dozens of officers descended on the church to provide first aid and rescue children who had been hiding throughout the building.

Many of the first responders were “deeply traumatised by what they saw”, Mr O'Hara said.

Hours later, terrified parents stood outside the reunification area, waiting for information about their children.

Amid a crowd of heavy law enforcement later that morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school.

Tearful students from neighbouring high schools that had been on lockdown began arriving in search of news about their friends and siblings who had been inside the church.

Those who were reunited with their loved ones embraced their children before rushing them away from the scene.

Others were not so lucky.

Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senator, said one of her staff members' children had to tell her friend's father his daughter had been struck.

“These kids are doing an all-school Mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot — one in the back, one in the neck,” Ms Klobuchar told MSNBC.

“And they all got down under the pews and she, her daughter, of course, was not shot, but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.”

Lisa Elm, a resident in the area for more than 20 years, told The Telegraph the area is a “quiet, sweet community”.

“It's a neighbourhood where people come together”, she said.

Outside Westman's home, a quiet apartment complex just a 20-minute walk from the school, neighbours described being shocked a killer had been living next door.

Aicha Kallo, a mother who lives in a neighbouring building to Westman, told The Telegraph: “It's just so scary, you know, to have a shooter next door to you, and you have a kid. And those innocent children, they don't deserve to die like that”, she said.

She added: “Living in a neighbourhood you think you're safe and the next thing you have something like this. My heart goes out to the parents and those innocent kids.”

As the community continued to grapple with the tragedy, Weston's grandfather, Michael Simpson, said the violence left him questioning why God had not been watching over the dozens of children.

“I don't know where He is,” Mr Simpson said.

An Israeli official accused of trying to meet a 15-year-old girl for sex outside Las Vegas has been ordered to appear via video link next week after he missed his arraignment hearing on Wednesday, local media reported.

Tom Alexandrovich, a senior cybersecurity official with the Israeli government, was one of eight people arrested as part of a multi-week operation by Nevada and federal authorities targeting “child sex predators,” according to an August 15 statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

He was due to be at a court in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, on Wednesday for a felony arraignment hearing, according to court records.

Local media, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal and local news station KLAS-TV, said he skipped the hearing. The Review-Journal quoted his lawyers as saying they had agreed with the district attorney's office that Alexandrovich did not have to appear in person.

The judge was quoted by the newspaper as saying the district attorney's office had no authority to make that agreement and ordered his appearance next week. The outlets said Alexandrovich's lawyers arranged for him to appear remotely via Zoom.

Messages left by Reuters with the district attorney's office were not returned. The court docket showed that a new arraignment hearing had been set for September 3. Alexandrovich's lawyers said in an e-mail that their client “will appear by Zoom as permitted by the Court.” Attempts to reach Alexandrovich have been unsuccessful.

Alexandrovich was arrested in Henderson after arranging to meet a decoy posing as a teenage girl, according to a police report cited by local media. He quickly posted bail and returned to Israel, drawing international scrutiny and raising questions over whether the U.S. or Israeli governments had exerted any pressure to speed his release.

In comments to the local media, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, whose office has jurisdiction over Las Vegas and Henderson, called the bail conditions “standard” and said there had been no special treatment. The U.S. State Department has said the American government had no involvement in the case.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida taxpayers could be on the hook for $218 million the state spent to convert a remote training airport in the Everglades into an immigration detention center dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz.”

The center may soon be completely empty as a judge upheld her decision late Wednesday ordering operations to wind down indefinitely.

Shutting down the facility for the time being would cost the state $15 million to $20 million immediately, and it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if Florida is allowed to reopen it, according to court filings by the state.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the airport suitable for a detention center, a state official said in court papers.

Built in just a few days, the facility consists of chain-link cages surrounding large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. 

An Associated Press analysis of publicly available state spending data showed that Florida has signed at least $405 million in vendor contracts to build and operate the facility, which officials had initially estimated would cost $450 million a year to run. A previous AP review found that as of late July, the state had already allocated at least $245 million to run the site, which opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

The center has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system. 




It's also facing several legal challenges, including one that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled on late Wednesday. She denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations, after agreeing last week with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe that the state and federal defendants didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

The Miami judge said the number of detainees was already dwindling and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.” That's despite Department of Homeland Security lawyers saying the judge's order would disrupt that enforcement.

When asked, the Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say how many detainees remained and how many had been moved out since the judge's temporary injunction last week.

“DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities,” the department said Thursday in an emailed statement.

Environmental activist Jessica Namath, who has kept a nearly constant watch outside the facility's gates, said Thursday that fellow observers had seen metal framing for tents hauled out but no signs of the removal of FEMA trailers or portable bathrooms. 

“It definitely seems like they have been winding down operations,” Namath said.

Based on publicly available contract data, The Associated Press estimated the state allocated $50 million for the bathrooms. Detainees and advocates have described toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, although officials dispute such descriptions.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees as of last week, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to a rabbi about chaplaincy services.

Funding is central to the federal government's arguments that Williams' order should be overturned by an appellate court. 

Homeland Security attorneys said in a court filing this week that federal environmental law doesn't apply to a state like Florida, and the federal government isn't responsible for the detention center since it hasn't spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of the detention center.

“No final federal funding decisions have been made,” the attorneys said.

Almost two dozen Republican-led states also urged the appellate court to overturn the order. The 22 states argued in another court filing that the judge overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system.

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.”

Hollywood stars, employees accused talk show host of having a toxic work environment. Fox News' Carley Shimkus reports on the accusations against Ellen DeGeneres.

Ellen DeGeneres faces renewed criticism after fresh accusations surfaced this week about her alleged toxic behavior on her long-running daytime talk show.

A former cameraman on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" accused the television host of fostering a hostile workplace where staffers lived in fear and sometimes had to give up family commitments.

According to staffers, DeGeneres, 67, disliked male employees and allegedly turned cold when they interacted with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, 52. Crew members also recalled what insiders called the infamous "Ellen gaze."

One former staffer described the look as "a queen searching for her next execution," adding, "She was terrifying."

De Rossi was described as "nice" and approachable with the crew, but employees said their jobs felt at risk if DeGeneres saw them chatting with her spouse.

"You just hoped and prayed you weren't seated by her wife, so you didn't get her attention," the ex-staffer told the Daily Mail Tuesday. 

"We went through a lot of male employees," the former staffer continued, alleging that DeGeneres once burned through nine stage managers in a single season.

"We had a feeling she really didn't like guys."

Celebrity guests also faced difficulties on the set of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," according to former employees.

The insider claimed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment in which he embarrassed DeGeneres by saying she used rancid meat during a demo.

"He gave her some quip. They were doing a food test together, and Ellen offered him a sample first," the former employee recalled. "As soon as he bit in, he said, ‘This is rubbish. This is disgusting.' She didn't like the reaction. It was about eight seasons before he came back."

Comedian Greg Fitzsimmons, a former "Ellen" writer, reinforced the claims, labeling his ex-boss a "control freak" who oversaw a toxic environment.

"A lot of crying in the hallways," he alleged during a podcast appearance.

The latest allegations revive the backlash that hit DeGeneres in 2020, when several ex-employees accused the show of racism, intimidation and retaliation.

DeGeneres apologized on-air at the time, saying she had been unaware of the environment.

The uproar led to an internal investigation. In July 2020, BuzzFeed News reported that current and former employees blamed three producers for creating a culture of fear.

Warner Bros. told Fox News at the time it "takes the recent allegations around the show's workplace culture very seriously" and conducted interviews with staff to assess conditions.

In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. 

She referenced the allegations in her 2024 comedy special, "Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval." There, she said, "I got kicked out of show business for being mean. Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown.

"I used to say, ‘I don't care what people say about me.' Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity. I am many things, but I am not mean."

By 2025, DeGeneres had moved to the U.K. countryside, claiming she was the victim of "misogynistic" backlash after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election.

Reps for DeGeneres did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

President Donald Trump has fired one of two Democratic members of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to break a 2-2 tie before the body considers the largest railroad merger ever proposed.

Board member Robert E. Primus said on LinkedIn that he received an email from the White House Wednesday night terminating the position he has held since he was appointed by Trump in his first term. The vacancy would allow Trump to appoint two additional Republicans to the board before its decision on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger though the Senate would have to confirm them.

Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific's acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition. He was named Board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Board member Patrick Fuchs to Chairman.

This follows Trump's previous firings of board members at the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Reserve, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are all supposed to be independent agencies.

“Robert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.”

Primus said he doesn't think the firing is valid because the White House didn't offer any cause for it, and he plans to fight. He also rejected their explanation for the move because he has long tried to encourage railroads to serve every industry better and help them grow, but he has already been removed from the STB website.




“I've been pro growth across the board in terms of encouraging growth in the freight rail network, which in turn will grow our national economy. So if that's not being in line with America first, then I don't know what America he's saying is first,” Primus said to The Associated Press.

He said the firings at all these agencies threaten their independence and credibility. Primus said in his tenure the STB always strove to be impartial and apolitical. 

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who serves on the Commerce Committee, said it's clear that “Donald Trump is trying to stack the deck so the federal government rubberstamps the merger as a huge favor for Wall Street and wealthy railroad owners.” She said Primus has been a fair regulator who worked hard to make sure railroads delivered for their customers and focused on safety.

Every rail worker union and the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association also quickly condemned the firing.

“The explanation provided for this decision — that his position has been “eliminated” — is nothing short of outrageous. Appointed bodies established through federal code are not designed to be erased at the whim of powerful corporate interests,” said the SMART-TD union that represents concductors. “This action is unprecedented, unlawful in spirit, and reeks of direct interference from hedge funds and the nation's largest rail carriers.”

The board is set to consider Union Pacific's $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern in the next two years before deciding whether to approve the nation's first transcontinental railroad and reduce the number of major freight railroads in the U.S. to five.

Primus said the biggest problems in the industry are the lack of growth and poor service after all the deep cuts railroads have made over the last decade in the interest of efficiency and improving profitability. He hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal, but he doesn't think mergers will necessarily improve competition.

“We don't need to merge to increase competition. We need to understand that we have to grow,” he said.

NEWBERN, Ala. (AP) — The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after white residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve.

Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent's 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government that drew national attention.

“The people came out and spoke and voted. Now, there ain't no doubt what they want for this town,” Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night.

The election Tuesday was the town's first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's “hand-me-down governance” and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.

Newbern's residents number just 133 people. A library, the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Selma. 

What the town had been without is elections. 

Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held “hand-me-down” positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others. The result was an overwhelmingly white government in a town where Black residents outnumber white residents 2-1.

Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the non-partisan position of mayor, and since was the only candidate, he became the mayor-elect without an election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. 




But the locks were changed at the town hall and Braxton was denied access to the town's financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and “fraudulently re-appointed themselves as the town council.”

“I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,” said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle. 

Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was “invalid.” 

The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025. 

Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, credited “Mayor Braxton's refusal to allow his constituents to be disenfranchised.” The group endorsed Braxton in the race.

Braxton had one challenger this time — a white auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole. 

The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any “doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.”

“It feels good the second time,” Braxton said.

NEW YORK (AP) — About 780,000 pressure washers sold at retailers like Home Depot are being recalled across the U.S. and Canada, due to a projectile hazard that has resulted in fractures and other injuries among some consumers.

According to a Thursday recall notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is recalling certain models of its Ryobi-branded electric pressure washers because the products' capacitor can overheat and burst, “causing parts to be forcefully ejected.”

That poses serious impact risks to users or bystanders. To date, the CPSC notes, the power tool and equipment company has received 135 reports of capacitors overheating in the U.S. — including 41 reports of explosions that resulted in 32 injuries and/or fractures to consumers' fingers, hands, face and eyes. A corresponding notice from Health Canada noted that no additional incidents were reported in Canada.

Consumers in possession of the now-recalled pressure washers are urged to stop using them immediately and visit Ryobi's recall website to learn about how to receive a free repair kit, which includes a replacement capacitor.

The Ryobi washers under recall have model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM. About 764,000 were sold in the U.S., in addition to 16,000 in Canada.

In the U.S. these products were sold at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024, the CPSC notes, for about $300 to $400 in stores and online.




TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is a subsidary of Techtronic Industries (TTI). The Associated Press reached out to the company for further comments on Thursday.

Beyond Thursday's pressure washer recall, TTI also recalled Ryobi-branded mowers and hedge trimmers earlier this year — due to fire and laceration hazards, respectively.

President Donald Trump has threatened to dispatch the National Guard to Chicago and other big cities. But data shows most U.S. violent crime has been in a steady decline in recent years (AP video: Mike Householder)

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

CHICAGO (AP) — The Trump administration asked a military base outside of Chicago for support on immigration operations this week, offering a clue of what an expanded law enforcement crackdown might look like in the nation's third-largest city. 

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles. 

Although details of the administration's plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don't want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don't want to create any speculation around what's going on.” 




City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn't contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn't received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization. 

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago's homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we're not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don't have people running scared and it doesn't create chaos on our streets, we're willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he's trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump. 

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago's long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration. 

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren't capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network. 

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday's White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics. 

“This is JB Pritzker's legacy, by the way,” she said. 

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities -- St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia -- had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor's blessing, the armories aren't available for use.

Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on the reaction to the Minneapolis school shooting that left two children dead and several other injured. Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham also weighs in on the aftermath during 'America's Newsroom.'

Vice President JD Vance slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Thursday after she criticized prayer in the aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota. 

In an X post, Vance defended prayer in the wake of the tragedy and demanded to know why the former White House press secretary would attack the practice when the children who were killed the day before were praying.

"We pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know God listens. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action," Vance said, adding, "Why do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?"

In a follow-up post, Vance wrote, "Of all the weird left wing culture wars in the last few years, this is by far the most bizarre. ‘How dare you pray for innocent people in the midst of tragedy?!' What are you even talking about?"

Police have identified the shooter responsible for opening fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, when they said two children were killed and 17 others were injured during morning Mass.

Vance's remarks came in direct response to Psaki's Wednesday post slamming people for offering thoughts and prayers in response to the tragedy.

She wrote, "Prayer is not freaking enough.  Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school.  Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers."

In a separate post, Psaki also used the tragedy to criticize the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. 

"When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy."

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley said she would have taken the New York Knicks head coaching job if it had been offered.

Staley, 55, interviewed for the position before the Knicks hired Mike Brown in July.

"I would have had to do it. Not just for me. For women. To break (that door) open," Staley said on the "Post Moves" podcast. "I would have had to. It's the New York Knicks. I'm from Philly. But it's the freaking New York Knicks."

Staley was one of many candidates the Knicks interviewed for their head coaching vacancy. The Knicks also interviewed former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, former Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori.

Staley said she thought she did well in the interview but questioned whether she hurt her chances by asking the Knicks how they would handle the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach.

"How, if you hired me as the first female head coach in the NBA, would it impact your daily job? Because it would," Staley said. "You're going to be asked questions that you don't have to answer if you're a male coach. There's going to be the media and all this other stuff that you have to deal with that you didn't have to deal with and don't have to deal with when you hire a male. That got them to thinking, ‘Maybe she's right.'"

She said she felt the energy change after her questions.

"So, I shot myself in the foot by being inquisitive and asking all those darn questions," Staley said.

Authorities are working to learn the motive of the shooter who fired into a Minneapolis Catholic school's church during Mass, killing two children and injuring 17 worshippers.

Officials identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23, and said Thursday that Westman was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School.

Westman was found dead in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot.

“Everything we've seen so far is a classic pathway to an active shooter,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on NBC's “Today” show Thursday morning. But “nothing that we have seen specific to trigger the amount of hate that occurred yesterday.”

Officials have recovered hundreds of pieces of evidence from the church and three associated residences in the area, O'Hara said, and are seeking search warrants to search electronic devices.

Authorities also were scouring content Westman allegedly scheduled to be released on YouTube and has since been removed from the platform.

The FBI is investigating Wednesday's shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, officials said.

The shooter — armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol — approached the side of the church at Annunciation Catholic School and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews during Mass just before 8:30 a.m.

O'Hara said Westman used all three weapons, fired dozens of rounds and tried to barricade the doors on one side of the church.

Westman legally purchased the weapons, had no known criminal history and acted alone, the chief said.

O'Hara said Thursday that authorities did not find additional firearms.

An August 2021 post on the Facebook page for the Church of the Annunciation celebrated the retirement of Mary Grace Westman after five years working there. A church newsletter from 2016 announced her hiring as a new administrative assistant in the business office and said she was a member of Saint Agnes Church in St. Paul.

A phone call and text message to a cellphone number listed as belonging to Mary Grace Westman was not answered Wednesday afternoon.

Associated Press reporters attempted to reach the shooter's father at an address listed as his residence, but nobody answered the door Wednesday afternoon. Phone calls and text messages to numbers associated with Robin Westman's siblings also were not answered.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese declined to answer questions when approached at the church Wednesday.

Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned anyone who would use the shooting to villainize the transgender community.

In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman's mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”

Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, told The Associated Press he barely knew Robin Westman but was watching coverage of Wednesday's tragedy.

When reached by phone, after a long pause, Heleringer initially said, “I don't know what to say.”

“I wish he had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer added.

Heleringer said Westman is the youngest child of one of his sisters. He said he last saw Westman at a family wedding several years ago but has not had contact with Westman since then.

Police said they were aware of time-released video and writings that may have come from the shooter. On a YouTube channel titled “Robin W” there were at least two videos posted before the channel was taken down by site administrators. The videos never show the face of the person speaking.

In one video that was about 10 minutes long, a cellphone camera pans to show a cache of weapons, ammunition and loaded magazines with sayings written on them including “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” Some were written in Cyrillic.

During the video, the person filming sings the word “tomorrow” and says, “I'm sorry to my family... that's the only people I'm sorry to.” Also, “I regret everything. I didn't ask for life. You didn't ask for death.”

At one point, the person holds up a smaller firearm from the cache and says, “This one is for me. In case I need it.”

The video also shows a letter written to the person's family, apologizing for what the shooting will mean for them, expressing love for them and saying to change their name and “move on.”

A second, almost 20-minute-long video shows two different journals. The first is more than 150 pages, all written in what appears to be the Cyrillic alphabet. The second journal had a last entry dated 8-21-25 and was more than 60 pages and also written entirely in Cyrillic.

The second notebook had a sticker on the inside cover depicting a semiautomatic AK-style rifle on top of a trans equality pride flag. Next to it was a sticker for the band KMFDM. One of the shooters in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting posted the band's lyrics on his website prior to the rampage.

The German industrial band has issued statements repeatedly condemning violence and school shootings. But in several high profile shootings since Columbine, shooters have had shirts, stickers or other references to the band as a reference to the Columbine shooting.

During the video, the person can be heard mumbling and breathing heavily. “I'll probably just upload a video on the day,” the person says before flipping to what appears to be a drawing of the layout of a church, pointing to two outside windows and then stabbing the illustration with a long knife.

O'Hara said Thursday that more of Westman's writings have been found.

ROME (AP) — An internet site which showed photos of thousands of Italian women without their consent and attracted obscene and explicit comments was forced to shut down on Thursday after a backlash.

The site, which featured prominent women, including Premier Giorgia Meloni and European Parliament member Alessandra Moretti, also included posts which idealized violence against women.

The online forum, which took its name from slang for female genitalia, has been around for at least two decades but it only drew national attention after Moretti formally lodged a complaint with police after finding her photo displayed without her permission.

It displayed unauthorized photos and videos of hundreds of public figures, along with unsuspecting actresses, influencers and ordinary women. The images were often lifted from TV or social media profiles. It counted 200,000 users and displayed pictures identified by names or certain themes. 

“They have been stealing photos and clips from TV shows I've appeared on for years, then altering them and feeding them to thousands of users,” Moretti said.

She said the site was among many that operate “with impunity” even though previous complaints have been filed against them.

“This type of site, which incites rape and violence, must be shut down and banned,″ she said.

Following the comments by Moretti, and complaints by dozens of other women, the site's administrators posted an online statement on Thursday saying “with great regret” it was being shut down.




They attributed the “toxic behaviors” to a “wrong use of the platform, which damaged its original spirit.”

Italian women, from ordinary workers and housewives to top politicians, are fighting back against a proliferation of websites displaying their photos without their consent, often accompanied by obscene language. 

Their efforts gained national prominence when activists earlier this summer denounced a Facebook page dubbed “Mia Moglie” (“My Wife”), where men posted unauthorized photos of their spouses and succeeded in getting it taken down.

Some men said their wives had agreed to their images being posted, but no female comments were visible on the site. 

Experts said websites that display images of women without their consent were “the other face” of physical and sexual violence.

“Digital tools became not only a way for men to exercise control over women, but are increasingly used to offend, humiliate and attack them,” Sabrina Frasca, activist with anti-violence group Differenza Donna, told The Associated Press. 

“Mia Moglie,” had around 32,000 members before it was shut down last week by Facebook -owner Meta, which said it acted against the site “for violating our adult sexual exploitation policies.”

Italy has been struggling with how to prevent and address gender-based violence, as femicides — the killing of women because of their gender — has emerged as a systemic problem deeply rooted in Italy's patriarchal culture. A series of violent incidents has reignited national debate over how to confront these crimes. 

“Women have always been the arena on which men challenge each other and measure their virility,” said feminist author and activist Carolina Capria. “It's a game in which women are merely a commodity that adds value to the man who possesses them.”

Italy's government approved a draft law in March that for the first time introduces the legal definition of femicide into the country's criminal law and punishes it with life imprisonment. The bill still needs final approval in the lower house to become law.

While the center-left opposition welcomed the move, it stressed that the new law only tackles the criminal aspect of the problem, while leaving economic, educational and cultural sources of misogyny unaddressed.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — An immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz ” must keep moving toward shutting down operations by late October, a judge has ruled, even as the state and federal governments fight that decision.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams late Wednesday denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations at the facility, which has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman about chaplaincy services at the facility, implying there would soon be no need.

The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a little-used training airport, where chain-link cages now surround large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that Williams' order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws. 




But the judge in Wednesday night's order noted that the detainee population already was dwindling at the facility, and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.”

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Williams said in last week's order that she expected the population of “Alligator Alcatraz” to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring any new detainees onto the property. 

State officials said shutting down the facility for the time being would cost them $15 million to $20 million and that it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if they ultimately are allowed to reopen the facility. They also said that the Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the training airport suitable for a detention center.

“Alligator Alcatraz” has been targeted by several lawsuits, ranging from its impact on the Everglades to civil rights concerns. 

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit and moved the suit to another court district for procedural reasons. 

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.” The suit alleges detainees were being held for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from ICE's online detainee locator, and no one at the facility was making initial custody or bond determinations.

The groups want a federal court in Fort Myers to issue a restraining order and a temporary injunction that would bar Florida agencies and their contractors from holding detainees there. 

Since immigration is a federal issue, the rights groups say Florida agencies and the state's private contractors have no authority to operate the facility. The rights groups want their lawsuit to be certified as a class action.

Meanwhile, almost two dozen Republican-led states urged the appellate court reviewing Williams' order to overturn it. The 22 states argued in a court filing that she overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

George and Amal Clooney joked "one day" their twins would care that their dad is a star.

Hollywood star George Clooney, 64, skipped a string of major appearances at the Venice Film Festival, as he battles a sinus infection, his rep confirmed with Fox News Digital. 

"George has been diagnosed with a sinus infection and is under doctor's orders to cut back all activities today," Clooney's rep said Thursday. 

Clooney was a no-show at a press junket for "Jay Kelly," his latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, and missed a high-profile dinner with co-stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern.

The "Ocean's Eleven" actor was reportedly seen boarding a water taxi at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday as he quietly left the Hotel Excelsior to rest up — skipping nearly every major press obligation for the day.

His absence extended into the next day, as Clooney also missed the official press conference for the Netflix release.

At the event, the press conference moderator addressed his absence.

"As you may know, George Clooney is not going to be here because he has a bad sinus infection. We really hope, and I think he should be on the red carpet tonight. But he is very sorry he cannot be with us."

Director Baumbach lightened the mood, and quipped, "Even movie stars get sick." 

Clooney arrived in Venice on Tuesday with his wife, Amal.

The couple arrived by boat in elegantly coordinated Italian Riviera–inspired ensembles.

Amal stunned in a chic light-yellow dress, with a halter top and gold belt cinched at the waist. She accessorized with gold earrings and a white mini-purse, as the Hollywood couple walked hand in hand through the Venice streets. 

The Oscar winner stepped out in a fitted black polo, beige slim-fit pants and brown suede loafers, completing the look with a matching belt and sunglasses.

The Hollywood actor had briefly gone dark, ditching his silver fox look and dyeing his hair for his role in Broadway's "Good Night, and Good Luck."

"It's bad. It's still dark on top, but it's gray at the bottom," he said during an appearance on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" where he wore a hat to "hide" the growth. Clooney admitted he hadn't dyed his hair in two months, since the beginning of the production.

"So you get that really nice-looking grow-out of gray," he said.

Clooney proposed to Amal in April 2014, and the couple married five months later in Venice, Italy. Three years later, in 2017, they welcomed twins Alexander and Ella.

President Donald Trump has the "upper hand" over Democrats on crime politically, Politico's Rachel Bade said during an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump is considering holding a Republican National Convention ahead of the midterm elections, he announced Thursday.

Trump did not offer any details about where the convention would take place, or what would happen there, but he touted various statistics that have been beneficial for the Republican Party this year. The GOP is fighting to maintain control of both the House and Senate in 2026.

"The Republican Party is doing really well. Millions of people have joined us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA, GREAT AGAIN. We won every aspect of the Presidential Election and, based on the great success we are having, are poised to WIN BIG IN THE MIDTERMS," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"We have raised far more money than the Democrats, and are having a great time fixing all of the Country Destroying mistakes made by the Biden Administration, and watching the USA heal and prosper. The results are incredible, a record pace!!! In that light, I am thinking of recommending a National Convention to the Republican Party, just prior to the Midterms. It has never been done before. STAY TUNED!" he added.

4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY

Historically, midterms have been tough elections for the party controlling the White House, typically losing roughly 25 seats in the House. Trump and the Republicans lost 41 House seats in the 2018 midterms.

POLITICAL ANALYST SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE 'BIG PROBLEM' OF WINNING BACK VOTERS FOR 2028

Trump's talk of a national convention comes amid a war over redistricting across the country.

Texas passed a new congressional map eliminating five Democratic seats earlier this month. Blue states exploded in response, however, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom is working to adopt a map that eliminates five Republican seats in his state.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and other Democratic state leaders have also vowed to pick up the redistricting war, further confusing predictions for where 2026 could land.

Trump has also argued that crime will be a major focus in the midterm cycle, a theme he has hit heavily in recent days to drum up support for his controversial "federalization" push in Washington, D.C.

"The Republicans are the party that wants to stop crime," Trump said. "We're against crime."

"The Democrats like crime," he continued.

The president touted the success of his efforts in the nation's capital on Tuesday, telling reporters, "If I were a Democrat — governor or mayor or anybody — I'd call up President Trump and say, 'President Trump, we need your help. We saw what you've done in D.C. in a period of 12 days.'"

"This is 12 days. We haven't even started. This is going to be so safe. It'll be the safest place on Earth," he added.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Open opponents Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko got into a face-to-face argument on the Court 11 sideline right after Townsend won their second-round match 7-5, 6-1 on Wednesday. 

Townsend, an American who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said Ostapenko, a Latvian, who won the 2017 French Open, told her she has “no class” and “no education.” 

A reporter asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to those comments.

“I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded. 

“So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on,” Townsend said. “The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”

Ostapenko later posted on social media about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”

“I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she wrote.

After the two players met at the net for a postmatch handshake, they stayed near each other instead of going their separate ways, as usually happens. The 25th-seeded Ostapenko wagged a finger at Townsend as they spoke.

“It's competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”




When they finally stopped talking, Townsend went over to the stands and egged on the partisan crowd, waving her arm overhead and the noise from spectators only grew louder.

She and Ostapenko have faced each other before in both singles and doubles.

“There's never been any history. I don't know how she feels about me, but there's no beef on my side,” Townsend said. “She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the U.S. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.”

Ostapenko went on social media to post what she called, “Just a small update about the match.”

She wrote that Townsend was “disrespectful” for not saying “sorry” after being helped by a net cord during a point.

“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”

Ostapenko also complained that Townsend began warming up before the match up at the net, instead of back at the baseline. While most players do begin at the baseline, Townsend noted that she has started with volleying for years.

Ostapenko has gotten into kerfuffles with opponents during matches before, including in 2021 when she lost to Alja Tomljanovic at Wimbledon. Tomljanovic accused Ostapenko of lying about needing to leave the court for a medical timeout to address an abdominal issue.

Townsend recently moved to the top of the WTA doubles rankings. But this is her first time reaching the third round in singles at a Grand Slam tournament since 2023.

In singles, Townsend is No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past Grand Slam champion in singles at a major since Kristie Ahn defeated — guess who? — Ostapenko at the 2019 U.S. Open.

“The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important,” Townsend said Wednesday. “She's packed up and she's gone.”

A man accused of killing his wife in California and fleeing to Peru with their three young children is in custody.

Peru's National Police said on Wednesday that Jossimar Cabrera Cornejo surrendered at Interpol's Lima headquarters. He was the subject of an active Interpol "red notice," according to Peruvian authorities, which alerts law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a suspect pending extradition.

Police released video showing Cornejo in handcuffs and wearing an Interpol vest.

CALIFORNIA WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN NATIONAL FOREST, HUSBAND SEEN DRAGGING SOMETHING IN LARGE TARP

Cornejo is accused of killing his wife, Sheylla Lisbet Cabrera, whose body was found in the Angeles National Forest on Aug. 16, just days after she was reported missing, according to Fox 11. The outlet also noted that Cabrera's friends said she was in an abusive relationship and allegedly asked Cornejo for a divorce, causing him to snap.

The Montrose Search and Rescue Team reported discovering an object over the side of an embankment in the Angeles National Forest, Fox 11 reported. Investigators later determined it contained Cabrera's body. She died from multiple stab wounds.

PARENTS OF 7-MONTH-OLD BOY MISSING FOR NEARLY 2 WEEKS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER

The search and rescue team recognized the object as being similar to one that Cornejo was seen carrying out of the couple's Lancaster apartment complex.

Cornejo has been charged with one count of murder with allegations of using a knife as a deadly weapon. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a press release announcing an extradition warrant for Cornejo. If convicted, Cornejo could be sentenced to 26 years to life if convicted of the charge.

"The allegations against this man are horrific, and we will do everything possible to bring him back under our jurisdiction to be held accountable," District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. "Domestic violence creates chaos in our communities and shatters families. My office is committed to bringing stability back into the lives of those who have been victimized."

Cornejo and Cabrera's three children were found safe in Peru and taken into protective custody.

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

Vox editor-in-chief & publisher Swati Sharma and executive editor Elbert Ventura announced today that Elias Isquith will be joining the publication as a senior editor for policy, politics, and ideas.

“In our conversations with him, it was clear that Elias is passionately interested in the same questions that drive our work,” said Libby Nelson, Vox's editorial director for policy, politics, and ideas. “What are the roots of our current political moment? What is happening today that will still matter in a week, a month, or a decade — and how do we convey those stakes? What is the best way to give readers the context, nuance, and understanding they need on complex topics?”

Isquith, who will start at Vox on September 22, is currently a producer and researcher on The Ezra Klein Show at the New York Times. There, he focused on politics (especially the ascendant American right) and foreign policy, producing episodes with Nancy Pelosi, Rahm Emanuel, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Vivek Ramaswamy, and more.

Before the Times, Elias was the editorial director of the NAACP Legal Education & Defense Fund; the editor in chief of Voices, the blog of the Open Society Foundations; an editor and writer at Salon; and the executive editor of the digital media startup Cafe.com.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez's lawyers rejected her firing by the Trump administration, arguing that only President Donald Trump himself could fire her.

Monarez surprised many earlier on Wednesday when her lawyers rebuffed reports that she had resigned, saying she would not do so. Later that evening, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that Monarez was “no longer” head of the CDC after a protracted disagreement with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. The move came after days of pressure from Kennedy and other administration officials over whether she would support rescinding certain approvals for COVID-19 vaccines, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post.

In a statement early Thursday morning, Monarez's lawyers once again rebuffed the White House after it said she had been “terminated.”

“Our client was notified tonight by White House staff in the personnel office that she was fired. As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her,” her lawyer Mark Zaid said in a statement on Bluesky.

“For this reason, we reject notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our position,” he added.

Zaid is a longtime critic of Trump, representing many disaffected staffers suing the administration during his second term.

Trump nominated Monarez to lead the CDC, and she was confirmed to the position in July. She feuded behind the scenes with Kennedy for some time, but their disagreements came out into the open over her attempted ousting. Her lawyers argued she was being targeted for refusing “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives.”

Monarez had sent a note to CDC employees on Aug. 12, shortly after a shooting targeting CDC headquarters, warning that the “dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.”

The Trump administration sought her resignation on Wednesday, though she refused to do so. Her attorneys said Wednesday night that she “has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”

White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner roughly an hour later that Monarez had been terminated.

TRUMP CDC DIRECTOR OUSTED LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER TAKING OFFICE

“As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,” he said. “Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position.”

Kennedy's unorthodox approach to public health has led to a slew of resignations at the CDC, including Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's chief medical officer; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology.

"Special Report" with Bret Baier dives into Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser admitting President Donald Trump's crackdown has significantly decreased crime in the nation's capital.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser initially expressed fear of President Donald Trump's plan to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, but its clear success made her change her mind.

After Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops and assume oversight of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to tackle rising crime in Washington, D.C., Bowser warned such a crackdown would be "unsettling and unprecedented."

However, the mayor admitted at a press conference on Wednesday that the federal surge has made a noticeable impact on one of America's most famously dangerous cities.

At the briefing, Bowser displayed a chart crediting the influx of FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Park Police and Capitol Police with bolstering MPD's efforts and declared, "We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD has been able to do in this city."

She pointed to one dramatic example, saying, "For carjackings, the difference between this period, this 20-day period of this federal surge and last year represents an 87% reduction in carjackings in Washington, D.C. We know that when carjackings go down, when use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason."

Bowser offered further examples of Trump's new surge driving results.

"This is what we think in just a couple of weeks of experience has worked," she said. "Having more federal law enforcement officers on the street — we think having more stops that got to illegal guns has helped. We think that there is more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior. We know that we have had fewer gun crimes, fewer homicides, and we have experienced an extreme reduction in carjackings."

Bowser also cautioned that not every tactic has been successful, citing "a break in trust between police and community, especially with new federal partners in our community."

She criticized the use of masked ICE agents in neighborhoods and said relying on out-of-state National Guard troops was inefficient. The mayor added the city still needs more local police officers, prosecutors, judges and prevention programs while maintaining local control.

When later prompted by a reporter, Bowser argued that Trump seizing greater control of Union Station would be a "good thing."

"The Union Station is owned by the Department of Transportation and it will be a good thing because that station has suffered from needing, some say $12 billion, but let's call it at least $8 billion worth of investment in the renovation. And that is not something that the district will be able to support," she said. "It is an important regional asset, it is an important asset for the Eastern Seaboard. It's an important asset for the nation. So, it is appropriate, in my view, for the federal government to make the necessary investments in the transformation of Union Station."

Brandishing his loyalty to President Donald Trump and keeping retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) at arm's length has proven to be an early, lucrative campaign fundraising tactic for Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) in his quest to replace the former Senate GOP leader.

“I don't just talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr, serving his seventh term, told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “I'm doing it every day.”

But despite his close relationship with the president and backing from a string of MAGA allies in Congress, Barr remains in pursuit of the coveted Trump endorsement.

So too are the two men with whom he's locked in a bitter primary challenge for Kentucky's open Senate seat next year, being vacated by McConnell: former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and wealthy businessman Nate Morris.

Discussions with Trump or those in his orbit are to remain “private conversations,” Barr said. But in between rattling off Trump's policy wins over the years that he's played a hand in, the Senate hopeful projected confidence that he'd be the obvious choice for an endorsement. That is, should the president choose to weigh in.

“There's politicians who like to talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr said. “There's politicians who like to talk about the One Big, Beautiful Bill. I have to write it. I have to pass it. And I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative.”

Although limited independent polling on one of the nastier Republican Senate primaries of the 2026 midterm elections, surveys earlier this year suggested Cameron had a commanding double-digit lead. Barr's campaign said an internal poll taken earlier this month and provided to the Washington Examiner shows positive momentum for Barr after months of crisscrossing the state with nearly 60 events, despite being outspent by Morris on the airwaves.

Among 600 likely Kentucky GOP primary voters and a margin of error of plus or minus four points, Barr had a net positive image rating of 16 percentage points from respondents compared to Morris's net negative rating of four percentage points.

Still, Cameron appeared to be leading the pack, thanks to his broader name recognition from holding statewide office. His net positive rating was 40 percentage points.

In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Morris condemned Barr as a phony MAGA loyalist, citing episodes like donating through his leadership PAC to now-former House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and accused him of flip-flopping on issues now that he's running for higher office. 

“Andy Barr blamed Donald Trump for January 6th. He backed the members of Congress who tried to throw Trump out of office. Barr tried for years to sabotage President Trump's tariff agenda. He spent millions of taxpayer dollars on DEI nonsense,” Morris said. “Barr even called people who want to deport illegals ‘nativists' and funded Congress's latest attempt at mass amnesty. If Andy Barr is MAGA, then so is Hillary Clinton.” 

Opponents have criticized Morris for a 2021 campaign donation to former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, who went on to run for president against Trump, and his past promotions of DEI as a former CEO.

Similar to Morris, the Cameron campaign accused Barr of realigning himself with conservatism for the primary and referred to him as “McConnell's handpicked candidate,” though McConnell has declined to get involved in a contest where its participants are all clambering to be the least associated. Cameron was once considered his protege, and Barr previously referred to him as a “mentor.”

“He's a creature of D.C. who spent decades shaking down Big Banks and Big Pharma for checks to fund his re-brand from moderate RINO to whatever this is now,” Cameron Campaign Manager Taylor Zanazzi said in a statement.

Analysis by Govtrack.us, an independent Congress tracker, rates Barr as skewed the farthest politically right among his House colleagues from Kentucky. There is no direct comparison available for Cameron and Morris. 

The Republican trio has sought to tap into their most conservative ideologies while keeping a safe distance from McConnell, who has a prior relationship with all three from his decades atop Kentucky GOP politics. 

Morris has went a step further in seeking to keep distance from McConnell. A former McConnell intern who held a fundraiser for him a decade ago, Morris now refers to him as “the nastiest politician in the history of America.”

An establishment figure with an icy relationship toward Trump, McConnell has proven to be a political liability in a modern-day Republican primary, even if that race is for the very seat he's vacating.

“I've been asked for 13 years, as a member of Congress from Kentucky, are you a Rand Paul Republican or a Mitch McConnell Republican? I'm neither,” Barr said. “I'm an Andy Barr Republican, and I'm proud to have supported President Trump in both his first four years, and I'm the strongest supporter in the House.”

The ability to raise funds may not tell the whole story, as polling has shown Cameron, despite his campaign coffers, vastly trailing Barr. But it offers a window into where supporters and potential voters are most eager to put their money, and it could play a role in who other influential Republicans choose to back.

Fundraising data available through June showed that Barr raised a hefty $6.1 million, compared to Cameron's roughly $530,000.

Morris presents a wildcard factor in the fundraising fight. Since entering the race, he's yet to face a filing deadline, and he has the financial ability to self-fund his campaign. He launched a seven-figure ad buy just days after declaring his candidacy in July.

BARR LEADS CAMERON IN FUNDRAISING IN KENTUCKY GOP SENATE PRIMARY

McConnell has shown no desire to get involved in the chaotic three-way contest. But his establishment donors apparently feel otherwise. Wealthy party donors linked to McConnell and other GOP leaders have already put millions of dollars into kneecapping Morris's candidacy.

“I don't know about McConnell donors. What I do know about are my donors,” Barr said. “I know about people who are supporting me, and they're supporting me because they know, No. 1, that I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative who believes in limited government, free enterprises, strong national defense.”

At an Oval Office signing ceremony on Aug. 8 with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, President Trump was asked about recognizing Somaliland.

President Donald Trump is reportedly working on a move that would give the U.S. a new military and economic foothold in Africa, counter China and Russia, and strike a blow against Islamist terrorists in the region. And now a leading senator has told Fox News Digital this goal can be realized by recognizing the breakaway Somaliland as an independent state.

Somaliland, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991. Its government is said to be offering the U.S. a new air and sea base close to the entrance of the Red Sea, and directly across from Yemen and the Houthis, if the U.S. formally recognizes it. Thirty percent of the world's container ship traffic is reported to pass through its waters en route to or from the Suez Canal.

In the Oval Office on Aug. 8, Trump told reporters, "We're looking into that right now," when asked about the recognition of Somaliland and the possible resettlement of Gazans there, adding, "We're working on that right now, Somaliland."

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., told Fox News Digital, "There is a very real opportunity that President Trump will recognize Somaliland during this administration."

Cruz added, "President Trump is bringing a new era of clarity in American national security, after four years of the Biden administration rewarding our enemies and punishing our allies, and recognizing Somaliland should be part of this new era.

"Somaliland has been a reliable ally to the United States, is integrating itself with us and our allies globally, and is committed to helping us counter efforts by China to undermine the safety and prosperity of Americans," he said.

The White House did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

But Somaliland, 99% Muslim, has allegedly eliminated radicalism and has aligned itself with the U.S. and Israel, leading Cruz to tell Fox News Digital, "They're a Muslim country, in a very dangerous part of Africa, showing real courage. I will continue to push for deepening the U.S.-Somaliland partnership, including through the Africa Subcommittee in the Senate, and I expect that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will be receptive to doing so."

Earlier this month, Cruz wrote to President Trump about Somaliland, stating, "it requires the status of a state. I urge you to grant it that recognition."

Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, is optimistic, telling the British Guardian newspaper on May 30, "Recognition is on the horizon." He added, "It's a matter of time. Not if, but when."

Somaliland's port at Berbera is the jewel in any Washington deal. Analysts say it is in such a strategic position that both Russia and China have tried to acquire it. Right next door to it is one of Africa's five longest runways, offering the U.S. the possibility of both a sea and air base that can strike Houthi rebels to the north and Al Shabaab terrorists to the east.

In his letter to the White House, Cruz wrote, "Somaliland has emerged as a critical security and diplomatic partner for the United States, helping America advance our national security interests in the Horn of Africa and beyond. It is strategically located along the Gulf of Aden, putting it near one of the world's busiest maritime corridors. It possesses capable armed forces and contributes to regional counterterrorism and piracy operations. It has proposed hosting a U.S. military presence near the Red Sea along the Gulf of Aden."

The U.S.'s largest military base in Africa is just up the coast in Djibouti. But there are security and surveillance issues at the Camp Lemonnier U.S. base where the Chinese and other nations have opened their own bases and monitoring stations nearby.

Somaliland is also offering the White House access to rare earth minerals essential for high-tech industries, such as lithium and silicon quartz.

The U.S. has described Somalia, with large numbers of both ISIS and al-Qaida-linked operatives, as a terrorist safe haven. Now the increasing presence of China and military forces from countries such as Turkey is reportedly leading some in Washington to be increasingly unhappy with its "one Somalia" policy, where Somaliland continues to be recognized only as a part of Somalia.

For now, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital the official position: "The United States recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, which includes the territory of Somaliland. The State Department is not in active discussions with Somaliland's representatives about a deal to recognize Somaliland as a state."

But, Somaliland's foreign minister worked Washington's corridors and politicians in April, and several African sources, including the influential Horn Observer news outlet, have reported that President Abdullahi is expected to come to D.C. "soon". U.S. officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Somalia, Richard Riley, are said to have been to Somaliland to meet with the president at least three times this year.

The weird lie animating the right-wing womanosphere.

Earlier this month, Katie Miller launched her new podcast with a specific origin myth. Miller, a former Trump administration official and wife of Stephen Miller, declared that by creating a lifestyle podcast for conservative women, she was filling a hole in the media ecosystem.

“For years, I've seen that there isn't a place for conservative women to gather online,” Miller said in a video posted to X. Her caption added, “As a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn't a podcast for women like myself.”

This claim happens to be deeply untrue. Conservative women have arguably never had more places to gather online and talk about their lifestyle concerns — especially when it comes to motherhood and wellness. This media ecosystem has recently been dubbed the “womanosphere,” and it is booming.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Conservatives can go to Evie, the right-wing answer to Cosmopolitan, which has attracted plentiful mainstream media attention. They can get their celebrity gossip with a healthy strain of reactionary conspiracy theories from Candace Owens. They can get anti-feminist cultural commentary from YouTubers like Brett Cooper. They can get MAHA-inflected health care advice from Alex Clark's Culture Apothecary talk show. They can hear anti-trans sports commentary on Riley Gaines's Gaines for Girls. They can watch the agrarian fantasies of tradwives like Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman. And they can listen to conservative women's lifestyle podcasts, like Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey's Relatable. Many of these women, by dint of their jobs as full-time content creators and podcasters, are also working moms, as they are happy to discuss at length in their content.

Still, the sense that Miller is operating from a defensive crouch, grabbing for access to a feminine frivolity she feels she has been denied, suffuses her new show, The Katie Miller Podcast. “We're gonna do something for all the girls out there,” Miller tells her guest, conservative sportscaster Sage Steele, on the second episode before the beauty segment of their interview. “Conservative women never get asked these questions,” Miller adds. It's hard to know what exclusion Miller is referring to exactly (what is Ivanka Trump's brand if not being a conservative woman with beauty secrets?), but the idea that it might be true seems necessary to Miller's conception of her project.

In the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow.

She's not alone in that. A transgressive posture is one of the characteristics of the womanosphere: an implication that they are saying hard truths and asking tough questions about things the liberal elites don't want women to know, that they are reclaiming their due from the cultural gatekeepers who didn't want them to have it. All conservative media these days tends to operate under similar assumptions, but in the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow. (Sage Steele is a fan.)

As the womanosphere booms, it's taken on an odd, fraught position. Republicans claim that they are the party free from liberal scolds, that will let hot girls be hot, but also that elites have gatekept them away from all that is frivolous and fun about girlishness. Listening to (or watching) Miller's podcast isn't interesting because of the beauty secrets divulged; it's revealing because of the glimpse it gives us into Republicans' current vexed relationship with femininity.

To give Miller her due, it's true that there are few spaces these days for conservative women in traditional media, like old-school glossy magazines. Lifestyle media for women has long been inherently conservative-leaning, with its focus on dieting and man-catching and home-building, but the post-Jezebel generation of women's media took on an explicitly feminist lens. The 2010s saw an explosion of progressive so-called ladyblogs, like The Hairpin, The Cut, and Slate's Double X, while magazines like Teen Vogue took on a left-wing activist perspective. Even the flagship Vogue, which generally dedicates a cover to the sitting first lady, declined to feature Melania Trump during Donald Trump's first term and, so far, his second as well.

The emergent conservative womanosphere, like its manosphere counterpart, has been largely coming up outside the boundaries of traditional media, among podcasters and YouTubers and lifestyle influencers, where the money for high-performing contributors is better and the editorial oversight is lower. Miller's podcast fits neatly into the flourishing new ecosystem.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression.

Part of the worldbuilding of this universe is to claim that the rest of the universe does not exist: There is no womanosphere, according to these influencers. There is no feasible way to build a lucrative career out of being an anti-woke woman, and failing to land a feature in Vogue is censorship at its finest.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression. The tendency has been so widespread among Trump Republicans in his second term that in February, the pseudonymous blogger Scarlet gave it a name: the “soy right.”

“The Soy Right is being oppressed and they want you to know it,” she wrote. “They're scared to take the subway, they're offended that you called them white or cis, they're upset that you didn't think they were cool in high school, they want to call the manager because there's less boobies in video games. … While the right is winning cultural and political victories nonstop lately, that's not enough. They also need you to like them. Why don't you like them?!”

These grievances power the worldview of Miller and her ilk, and gives them a reason to create their podcasts and YouTube channels and magazines. They're calling the manager because they don't think they personally have gotten enough credit for being conventionally hot, raising kids, and having high-powered careers. Creating a new podcast is a way for Miller to give herself that credit. Meanwhile, harping on the false idea that there's a hole in the marketplace allows her podcast to take on a sense of heightened importance. If the world were fair, Miller implies, someone else would have asked her to describe her beauty routine a long time ago.

This idea that Republican women are never given credit for their beauty stands uneasily next to recent Republican attempts to claim the existence of beautiful women as a win for their own side. Over the past two years, the right has variously claimed Sydney Sweeney, Hawk Tuah Girl, and sorority rush videos as cultural phenomena that are by their nature Republican-coded and surely infuriate the left. (The left shows no sign of being infuriated, but that doesn't stop the narrative.) The story goes that the left is too woke, too PC, too ideologically hamstrung to celebrate the existence of conventionally attractive white women, so the right must step in.

In the manosphere, the obsession with hot girls shades into raunch culture, a performative, overwhelming ocean of sleaze in which the supposed celebration of hot girls also runs right alongside an attitude of degradation. The nascent womanosphere, however, tends towards purity culture, an obsession with Christian virtue and righteousness that is the mirror image of raunch culture.

Miller makes much of her status as a wife and mother. Her fellow womanosphere podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey calls out listeners for watching movies about “hot and heavy sinful romance” rather than focusing on “the Biblical marriage that God has called you into.” Brittany Martinez, the founder of Evie magazine, says she started her publication after watching the traditional glossies “encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications.”

As I've discussed extensively before, while purity culture and raunch culture might appear to oppose one another, they're two sides of the same coin, united by a shared premise that women's sexuality should always exist in service to men. They are also a trap: The raunchy cool girls get called sluts. The respected pure women get called prudes. The only way to play the game and win is to somehow be both raunchy and pure at the same time, an impossible status that was only ever held, very briefly, by a young Britney Spears before the world crashed down around her.

The womanosphere is animated by a sense of a broken promise: that these women were told they would receive attention and credit that never came. The Katie Miller Podcast says it's an attempt to rectify that broken promise. In reality, however, it's just one more entry into a crowded conservative media landscape, powered by the same old warped sense of victimization.

            Just when Manchester United fans thought it couldn't get any worse, up steps fourth-division side Grimsby Town to plunge the once-great club even further in the mire.
    


            The League Two minnow – sitting three divisions below Manchester United – was well worthy of its League Cup win on Wednesday, beating Ruben Amorim's team 2-2 (12-11) in a marathon penalty shootout that came after a rollercoaster game at Grimsby's Blundell Park.
    


            The host, by far the better team in the first half, led its Premier League opponent 2-0 heading into the final 15 minutes of the match. Two late goals from the Red Devils, though, looked to have denied Grimsby a historic victory, but the underdog bit back in an astonishing shootout which United manager Amorim couldn't bring himself to watch.
    


            And while the night should be remembered for the Grimsby Town celebrations at full-time – it is arguably the greatest result in the club's history – it's hard not to question what on earth is going on at United.
    


            The scene looked all the more bleak after a mammoth thunderstorm drenched the ground in the second half, with the image of a soaking-wet Amorim frantically consulting his tactics board serving as the perfect metaphor for the club's current state.
    


            “I just want to apologize to our fans,” a furious Amorim told ITV Sport after the humiliating defeat.
    


            “You can feel it. Something has to change. I don't know what to say anymore to our fans. It's hard to face.”
    


            He later added to reporters: “We were completely lost and it's hard to explain and that's why I think they spoke really loud.
    


            “I know the best team won today. The best players lost – because when you are a team you can win any game. It was really fair the football today.”
    


            The Portuguese manager has now been at Manchester United for nine months and pressure to get results is looming larger than ever – he has so far overseen just 16 wins in 44 games.
    


            Given he arrived part-way through last season and told fans he would need time to implement his style of play, many gave him some leeway for the team's disastrous 15th-place finish in the league.
    


            But after an entire preseason schedule and backing in the transfer market – the club has signed an entirely new frontline in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Šeško and Matheus Cunha – there is very little credit left in the bank.
    


            To put it simply, there is still so much wrong with the team which has picked up just one point from its first two Premier League games of the new season.
    


            The goalkeeper situation, for one, has become untenable. Both André Onana and Altay Bayındır have been used in the three games this season and both have made blunders that have led to conceded goals.
    


            The defense, certainly against Grimsby, looked incredibly unsure of itself and the attackers are struggling to convert the very few chances they are creating.
    


            Both new signings, Cunha and Mbeumo, missed vital penalties in Wednesday's defeat. New star striker Šeško also opted to be the last outfield player to take a spotkick.
    


            “It was obviously not good enough today,” United defender Diogo Dalot told ITV Sport. “We cannot give up, whatever the situation but, like I said, it's not good enough and I think its something we need to look deeply into ourselves.
    


            “Tomorrow is a new day, we need to fight back and show to ourselves that, to be at this club, we need to do more much.”
    


            There is also the sticky situation about the team's formation.
    


            Amorim was praised on his arrival at the club for having a distinct style of play. The 3-4-3 formation had worked so well at his former club, Sporting CP, and many felt a strong identity was exactly what a rudderless Manchester United needed.
    


            But Amorim's dedication to his system, which was once deemed a strength, is now turning into a weakness. Even if it's not working, or if the players are struggling to adapt, the manager is seemingly not changing his mind.
    


            Last season, the Portuguese boss said things would get worse before they got better. United fans, though, are running out of patience, despite some brief signs of improvement during spells of matches this season.
    


            “It's not about the formation,” Amorim insisted again on Wednesday. “The system is not important. We can play with three defenders, four defenders, five defenders, that doesn't matter.
    


            “What matters is that we need to be different, and that's the job of the coach, and you can see that nothing has changed.”
    


            There is still a week left in this summer's transfer window and Manchester United will likely be busy – perhaps more so with outgoings.
    


            There are still several players, including Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, who are seemingly surplus to requirements at United, as Amorim looks to freshen up a team which has been thrown from one disaster to the next in recent years.
    


            The clear out, which has seen the likes of Marcus Rashford leave the club on loan, was supposed to usher in a new era of positivity at the 20-time top-flight champion.
    


            The club's new minority owner, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has backed the need for change, investing in a renovated training center and promising to build a new world-class stadium.
    


            Already, though, this ‘new' Manchester United has lurched into its latest calamitous chapter.
    


            Next up for the team is a Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Nothing but a comfortable win will ease the growing pressure on Amorim and his job as manager of the Red Devils.

Taylor Townsend let out a roar after upsetting No. 25-ranked Jelena Ostapenko, 7-5, 6-1, in her second-round match at the U.S. Open on Wednesday. 

But a face-to-face confrontation between the two competitors at center court was the biggest story coming out of Court 11. 

Townsend said that Ostapenko, a Latvian native who has a French Open title under her belt from 2017, said she has "no class" and "no education."

Townsend, who is Black, was asked by a reporter if Ostapenko's comments at the net had racial undertones. 

"I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth," Townsend replied. 

"So, whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on. The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament."

Ostapenko wasn't asked by reporters, but she posted on Instagram about the confrontation, specifically talking about "how many messages I received that I am a racist."

"I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world," Ostapenko posted. "For me, it doesn't matter where you come from."

During the verbal altercation at the net, Ostapenko said something inaudible to Townsend as she went to shake the chair umpire's hand. It clearly irked Townsend, who had an exasperated expression on her face before things got a bit more heated. 

Ostapenko was seen waving her finger at Townsend while they jawed back and forth. 

"It's competition. People get upset when they lose," Townsend, who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said after the match.

Townsend added that in past matches against Ostapenko there was never any issues. 

"There's no beef on my side," she said. "She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the U.S. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that."

Townsend's social media post began by saying she felt Townsend was "disrespectful" after not apologizing for the net cord helping her secure a point in the match. 

"There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour," Ostapenko said. "If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants."

Ostapenko also didn't like that Townsend warmed up before the match at the net instead of at the baseline. Townsend said she's been doing the routine for years and it has never been an issue.

Townsend is a star in WTA doubles, but in singles, she is ranked No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past Grand Slam champion at a major since Kristie Ahn, who just so happened to beat Ostapenko at the 2019 U.S. Open. 

Townsend has a tough third-round matchup against, as she will face No. 5-ranked Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old phenom, on Friday.

            The ongoing National Guard mission in Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in the city, is costing roughly $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN.
    


            Kate Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that rough calculations show the mission is likely costing more than $1 million a day, when taking into account the pay for more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed, housing, travel, food, fuel, and other logistical needs. That estimate is drawn from costs from the 2020 mobilization of roughly 5,000 National Guardsmen to DC, which was estimated to cost more than $2 million a day.
    


            Retired Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously served as the chief of force structure and investment division at the Office of Management and Budget, also told CNN the estimated cost comes to roughly $1 million a day. Those estimates don't include the costs from other federal law enforcement agencies involved in the mission.
    


            The Pentagon and National Guard did not provide cost estimates for the mission, despite having been able to do so for a similar mission just two months ago.
    


            “We won't know the total cost until the mission concludes,” a defense official told CNN on Wednesday. The official referred CNN to the White House after follow-up questions about the daily $1 million estimate. Questions to the National Guard about the cost of the mission were referred to the Pentagon.
    


            The Intercept was first to report the level of estimate on the cost of the National Guard mission.
    


            It's not unusual to not have a firm idea of the final price tag for a mission like the one ongoing in DC, as logistical needs can adjust over time, and it remains unclear if service members' orders will be extended or not. But multiple US officials who spoke to CNN said the reluctance to provide a number is also due to the involvement of senior levels of the Pentagon and the White House in the mission, and a tight grasp on the flow of information about it.
    


            Two US officials told CNN there was likely a rough estimate available for the DC mission, or one being calculated, but that only the most senior levels had permission to speak about it due to the political nature of the mission and the White House's involvement. Communication about the cost, one of the officials said, is typically approved at much lower levels than the current mission. Because the mission is being funded federally, one of the officials said, the money is coming from the departments of the Army and the Air Force.
    


            “We know that funding is made available, we just don't know the estimate or who's approving it or how much is available,” the second US official said, adding that “everybody wants to have their hands in” communication surrounding the mission due to the White House's interest in it.
    


            A third US official said it's likely a mixture of both — that a cost estimate is generally still being calculated, but that until senior levels of the Pentagon or White House determine they want to release that information, it won't be shared.
    


            Still, the Pentagon was able to give a cost estimate for the LA mission in June just three days after roughly 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized to assist law enforcement.
    


            “The current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,” Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense and official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense, told Congress on June 10. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing the first batch of 2,000 Guardsmen on June 7.
    


            As of Tuesday morning, there were 2,254 National Guard troops in DC — more than 1,300 of them from the six states who sent personnel to support the DC National Guard. While some troops are stationed through the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, soldiers and airmen have also begun helping with “beautification projects,” doing things like picking up trash, replanting grass, and spreading mulch.
    


            In addition to the service members' pay during the mission while they are on orders, the total cost of the mission also includes basic logistical needs like hotel rooms for out-of-state troops, food and water, fuel for vehicles, laundry service, and more.

The president's tacky aesthetic is a window into his quest to become the single most enduring symbol of America.

In 1990, Playboy published an interview with Donald Trump in which the future president offered his thoughts on foreign affairs, the death penalty, and why he puts his name on everything. He also reflected on the meaning — or, perhaps, meaninglessness — of life. “Life is what you do while you're waiting to die. You know, it is all a rather sad situation,” he said. “We're here and we live our 60, 70, or 80 years and we're gone. You win, you win, and in the end, it doesn't mean a hell of a lot.”

It's no secret that every president cares about how they'll be remembered. But that pithy, 35-year-old quote explains a whole lot about Trump, his rise to power, and how he governs today. He doesn't only want a legacy, be it good or bad. Even winning the presidency twice doesn't suffice. What Trump really wants is to — in some way or another — live forever, and he's only just getting started.

By now, Trump's imprint on the world is indelible. His ability to wiggle out of legal consequences for his corruption and lawlessness has ushered in a new era of presidential immunity. His inability to admit defeat in 2020 nearly resulted in a coup d'etat and seriously undermined voters' faith in American elections. And his harsh immigration crackdowns, his fixation on birthright citizenship, and his censorship of speech have challenged the very ideals of what it means to be an American.

But to fully understand Trump's broader political project and how he has successfully transformed America, you have to recognize that he isn't only a political figure, but something much bigger: a cultural icon in the crudest sense.

It's that side of Trump that begins to explain one of the weirdest aspects of his presidency: his focus on aesthetics and how aggressively he is forcing his particular style and taste onto America. Whether it's making the White House look more like his private residences or turning the arts into his own pet project, Trump is trying to fundamentally change how America's government is perceived. Put another way, when we look at the government's buildings and institutions, Trump wants us to see only him — even after he's gone.

It's not entirely accurate to say that Trump has always sought fame. Because what Trump has really been chasing his entire adult life has been omnipresence. Celebrity status, untold fortune, and television success were never going to be enough; he wants to be everywhere. For a big chunk of his New York business years, Trump was completely obsessed with the idea of having the biggest and tallest buildings in the world. He injected himself into the American zeitgeist decades ago, giving tabloids enough gossip to fill their pages with scandal after scandal since the 1970s. His real estate career, his offensively lavish lifestyle, and his eventual rise as a reality TV star made him, in many ways, a caricature of American capitalism's excesses.

That never-ending pursuit of omnipresence has shaped Trump's political career and presidencies, perhaps more than anything else. After all, from a political standpoint, Trump has been all over the place: He has been a Democrat, independent, and a Republican. He sought to befriend Hillary Clinton — donating to her Senate campaigns and the Clinton Foundation — before eventually running against her in 2016. And while there are some policies and ideas that Trump has long been committed to, like tariffs or racist conspiracy theories, he has always been more devoted to himself than any policy agenda.

His true desire, it seems, wasn't to simply become the president of the United States, but to become the single most enduring representation of America itself.

Trump's political project, in other words, is to rebrand America. He's seemingly not so desperate to eke out wins for the Republican Party so much as he is trying to remake America in his own image. Gone are the days where America is promoted as an idea — a nation of immigrants or an unfinished project that every generation of Americans strives to improve — because in his eyes, America is Trump.

To understand Trump's aesthetics, you have to go back to the 1980s lifestyles of the rich and famous in New York, the time and place that defined Trump's rise in American culture. A lot of what Trump values today — real estate, television ratings, Time magazine covers — can be traced back to that era, when all of those things, at least to Trump and those running in his circles, were markers of clout.

That period was defined by greed and ostentatious displays of wealth. And Trump relished that environment. In the Playboy interview, Trump was specifically asked about why he feels so comfortable showing off his riches, especially given how much poverty could be seen on the streets. “There has always been a display of wealth and always will be,” he said. “And let me tell you, a display is a good thing. It shows people that you can be successful. It can show you a way of life. Dynasty did it on TV. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

Trump's quest to own the famed Plaza Hotel in New York City, which he bought for $400 million in 1988, ended in spectacular failure, with the hotel filing for bankruptcy just a few years after the purchase. But for Trump, acquiring the Plaza Hotel wasn't merely about making money; it was about achieving status. “To me the Plaza was like a great painting,” he said, recalling the whole ordeal in an interview in 2015. “It wasn't purely about the bottom line. I have many assets like that and the end result is that they are always much more valuable than what you paid for them.”

Just like that venture, Trump's vision for America today is remarkably shallow. It doesn't matter how functional America's institutions or even economy actually are. The only thing that matters is what America looks like on the outside. And a shiny veneer that flaunts wealth and military might — be it through a gilded White House or a B-2 stealth bomber flyover — is perfectly adequate, even if it's entirely hollow or bankrupt on the inside.

So naturally, Trump has dedicated a decent chunk of his presidency to imposing his style and aesthetic onto America.

In both terms, he has issued executive orders to change the look of federal buildings, discarding new architectural styles and instead promoting grand neoclassical buildings that mimic ancient empires. He has been in a long-simmering feud with Boeing since his first term over the new Air Force One — the iconic aircraft that carries the president across the country and around the world — and has been deeply involved in the design of the plane, which looks suspiciously similar to his own private jet. And he has completely redecorated the White House, decking out the Oval Office in gold, turning the Rose Garden into a patio that resembles his Mar-a-Lago club, and announcing plans to build a $200 million ballroom extension to the East Wing.

But Trump's fixation on rebranding America's image goes deeper than giving the Office of the President a makeover. Upon returning to the White House earlier this year, Trump purged the board of the Kennedy Center and appointed a new board that elected him to be the chair — an unusual role for the president of the United States to take on. The move showed how invested Trump personally is in the culture wars, so much so that he wants to be directly involved in decisions about what kind of art Americans should enjoy.

Trump is now even planning on hosting the Kennedy Center Honors this year, saying he was “very involved” in selecting the honorees. He also said that he vetoed “a couple of wokesters” who were in the running. And, according to the New York Times, Trump has considered giving posthumous awards to Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth.

He is also targeting the nation's museums and historical displays in an attempt to recast America's history in a much more favorable light that sweeps all the bad parts under the rug. For instance, he issued an executive order that discourages the Smithsonian Institution from putting up displays that portray America and its past negatively. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said in a recent social media post. “We have the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.”

To be sure, the United States has always been deeply invested in how it is perceived, both domestically and abroad, and has always projected itself as the “shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan often liked to say. And while there's no shortage of big egos among presidents, they often, at the very least, tried to gesture that America was bigger than just them.

What is different about Trump is that he is not so interested in the idealistic vision of America — or in presenting America as an idea, a neverending endeavor of creating a more perfect union. He's only interested in grandeur and the authoritarian tendency to so thoroughly intertwine himself with his country that the two can't be separated. And whether it's the Oval Office redesign, the Kennedy Center takeover, or — in quintessential dictatorship fashion — banners of Trump's portrait cropping up around the nation's capital, the message Trump is sending is clear: We are changing how America is perceived, we will aggressively flaunt our power and wealth, and we will iconize Trump so that he becomes just as much of a symbol of the United States as its own flag.

On the one hand, Trump's fixation on aesthetics can seem inconsequential — moves that can be easily undone by a future administration. On the other hand, they're a window into Trump's broader political project. After all, the way Trump is imposing his style and taste onto the American public is a projection of his ideals, and an attempt to change not just America's politics but its culture, too.

There are two major components of Trump's attempt to rebrand America. The first is to establish new American norms — changing the perception of what the average American way of life looks like.

Take Trump's desire to reinforce gender norms and project a certain type of hypermasculinity, all of which permeate his entire aesthetic. Some parts are less subtle than others: Kicking off his Kennedy Center takeover, for example, Trump announced on social media in February that he would “immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” That vision, apparently, had a lot to do with drag shows. “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” the president wrote. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” he added in another post.

Trump also likes to promote traditional images of strength as a representation of both himself and America. His now-famous photo after he was almost assassinated last year — with his fist pumped in the air and blood dripping down his face as he yelled, “Fight, fight, fight” — was turned into a painting that replaced a portrait of Barack Obama in Trump's White House. And his social media channels often promote photoshopped images of Trump as a superhero or with a muscular build.

The Department of Homeland Security in particular has been fond of sharing nostalgic paintings — like John Gast's “American Progress,” representing the imperialist manifest destiny doctrine, or Thomas Kinkade's “Morning Pledge,” depicting American schoolchildren gathered around the US flag in an idyllic suburb — with not-so-subtle captions like “Protect the Homeland” or “Remember your Homeland's Heritage.” (In a recruitment ad for Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS also posted on X, “Defend your culture!”)

All of this imagery, from the gaudy Oval Office overhaul to the kitsch paintings being shared on social media, tries to hark back to an old-fashioned idea of what America is supposed to look like. What Trump is really selling is the notion that the America that elected Barack Obama — the multiracial and cross-class coalition that formed a decisive majority in 2008 and 2012 — never really existed. And there seems to be an everlasting nostalgia for a whiter America in Trump's White House, even in rhetoric articulated by top officials like Stephen Miller. “Why is it that Democrats are so insistent that unlimited numbers of illegals from countries that are incapable of managing their own affairs come here?” Miller said earlier this summer. “Countries like Somalia, countries like Haiti, countries that have no history of successful self-government, and they want unlimited numbers of illegals from those countries and refugees from those countries to come here.”

Ultimately, this is all reflected in Trump's policy agenda. His mass deportation campaign, his executive order on birthright citizenship, and his attack on fundamental rights of immigrants, including free speech, underscore how one of his principal goals as president is to redefine what it really means to be American.

This is the kind of America that, as noted above, Miller and DHS are trying to promote. It's also the America that Trump feels comfortable being associated with. After all, this is the same Donald Trump who, along with his father, was sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for keeping Black tenants out of their buildings.

The second and final component of the rebrand is for Trump to personally embody that America — to transform himself into the ultimate figure to aspire to. And that part has to do with reviving the old American ideal of individualism and self-reliance, the false notion that the most successful Americans are somehow self-made, and that there is no collective ideal worth pursuing more than one's own individual success. Trump's whole aesthetic, and the way he's specifically projecting his style onto American government, is a celebration of that philosophy. It's all an ode to himself, not the American people or the generations before him that made his own fortunes possible in the first place.

That individualistic philosophy is why Trump is so invested in remodeling the White House, the Kennedy Center, and even museums in his own style — to exhibit his image as the greatest marker of success. It's why, on the right, there's such an overwhelming cult following around a single individual. There's an obsession with personifying America, and Trump desperately wants to be that personification.

The America Trump wants to project, in other words, is not the Statue of Liberty welcoming “huddled masses yearning to breathe free” or a country of shared collective interests, but one that adheres to the concept of the survival of the fittest. And Trump seems to believe — or at the very least wants to convey — that he's the fittest of us all.

Much of what has informed Trump's whole philosophy is his simplistic idea of success: that his many failures aren't necessarily a reflection on him, but that his success and wealth were achieved solely because of him. So the aesthetic Trump is trying his very best to push onto Americans — displays of sheer rugged strength, of vast wealth, of supposed success — points to a picture of an individualistic society that doesn't really care about its past sins. Because in Trump's world, so long as you amass an enormous amount of wealth and power (as both he and America have), then it's all worth showing off.

It's like he told Playboy back in 1990: “Let me tell you, a display is a good thing…It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

That's why Trump doesn't just want to be a political or historical figure, but a cultural icon that can represent American greatness long after he's gone. He wants the whole world to forever look at him.

• A shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis Wednesday, killing two children. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            • The shooter, now dead, was identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman. Westman shared a “manifesto” on social media that is being investigated, police said. The shooter graduated from the school in 2017.
    


            • The attack is the latest in a string of deadly shootings in Minnesota. It is also the 44th school shooting in the US this year, according to a CNN analysis. It has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control.
    


Our live coverage of the Minneapolis school shooting is now here.



            The attack at a Catholic school in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning was the fourth deadly shooting the city had seen in roughly 24 hours, according to CNN affiliates KARE and WCCO.
    


            Speaking before the attack on Annunciation Catholic School, police chief Brian O'Hara called the level of gun violence in the city over the last day “deeply unsettling,” according to KARE.
    


            The first was at about 2 p.m. on Tuesday in south Minneapolis, when a shooter killed one person and wounded six others, KARE reported, citing police.
    


            At around 8 p.m. in another location, a shooter killed one man and injured another.
    


            Then at around 2 a.m. Wednesday, a shooter approached a group on a sidewalk and started shooting, killing one and wounding another, WCCO reported.
    


            Minneapolis Police said Wednesday they did not know if the three shootings were connected.
    


            The Democratic National Committee abruptly ended the final day of its summer meeting in Minneapolis on Wednesday after getting word of the deadly school shooting at the nearby Annunciation Church.
    


            DNC chair Ken Martin announced the shooting had occurred “no more than 10 minutes from where we are now” and urged anyone with medical training to help if they could.
    


            The DNC meeting's closing session, which was scheduled to last three hours, ended after less than 12 minutes. Martin, a native of Minnesota, began the shortened session by saying, “We are heartbroken.”
    


                    “This is the first week of school for students at Annunciation. These families woke up this morning to celebrate milestones in their children's lives,” Martin said.
                





            After a short prayer, the committee voted to unanimously approve all committee reports and adjourn early.
    


            The DNC leader told attendees that Wednesday's shooting came “on the heels of a tragic year where we already lost our dear friends Melissa and Mark Hortman,” referring to the former Democratic speaker of the Minnesota state House, who was assassinated along with her husband at their home in June.
    


            Democratic leaders opened this week's summer meeting by honoring Hortman's legacy. Many Democrats are renewing calls for new gun control measures in the wake of Wednesday's shooting.
    


            Em Paulson, a paraprofessional at a Minneapolis-area elementary school, told CNN Wednesday's shooting at Annunciation Catholic School hits close to home.
    


            “It's so riveting hearing about any school shooting no matter what profession you're in, but when you work in a school, it hurts just a little bit more,” they said.
    


                    “My teaching community is constantly reminded about how, one day, we may need to stand in between these children and violence,” Paulson added.
                





            Paulson shared video from one of several vigils were held across the Twin Cities Wednesday evening. The video, from Minneapolis' Lynnhurst Park, shows residents standing in silence and holding candles while music plays over loudspeakers.
    


            Vincent Francoual, a prominent Minneapolis chef, told CNN's Laura Coates his daughter, who was in Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, is traumatized after surviving the deadly shooting.
    


            There have been 44 US school shootings this year, according to a CNN analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.
    


            That number is one higher than the number of school shootings, 43, that had happened at this point in the year in 2024.
    


            The years since the pandemic have seen a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008, when CNN began tracking such events across public and private K-12 schools and colleges/universities across the United States.
    


            Of the 44 shootings in 2025, 22 shootings have been reported on K-12 campuses and 22 on university and college campuses.
    


            An uncle of the Minneapolis shooter has called today's attack at a Catholic school Mass “an unspeakable tragedy,” according to the Associated Press.
    


            Bob Heleringer, who is a former Kentucky lawmaker, told the AP the shooter was one of his sister's children. He said he did not know the shooter, Robin Westman, well and last saw his relative at a family wedding several years ago.
    


            “I wish (Westman) had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer said.
    


This post has been updated with more information from AP.



            The family of former Democratic Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, who were killed in June during a series of attacks, said today's shooting was a “senseless act of violence” and called on elected officials to act on “common-sense measures.”
    


                    “Mark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that families should be safe in their homes,” the statement says.
                





            “We hope this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common-sense measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.”
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said locked doors during Mass may have helped prevent an already “unthinkable” tragedy at Annunciation Catholic Church from becoming even worse.
    


            “A number of the doors had been locked once Mass began, which is part of their normal procedure,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. “We believe that this step also played a part in ensuring this tragedy did not become that much worse.”
    


            Children also described getting down,  taking cover and helping others take cover, as they had practiced before during training drills, O'Hara said. The Annunciation Catholic School handbook notes it conducts three lockdown drills during the school year.
    


            The police chief described law enforcement responding to a difficult scene, with the first officer running in “not wearing a helmet, not with any rifle or SWAT gear” and quickly heading in the shooter's direction.
    


                    “First responders that came here this morning just walked into this unthinkable, unthinkable act of violence,” the police chief said. “This is one of those scenes that's just deeply, deeply traumatizing.”
                





            In a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump highlighted “the need for pre-emptive intervention in identifying potential school shooters.”
    


            Trump wrote that early warning signs “are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions.”
    


                    “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society — beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer,” Trump wrote in her post.
                





            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara gave an update on the status of the injured children tonight.
    


            Two children died in the shooting. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins the remaining victims are expected to survive and that some of the children have been released. “A number” of them still remain at the hospital, the police chief said.
    


            “They had a range of injuries. One, I believe, was like a graze wound from a gunshot,” O'Hara said. “All the way to some very, very serious and life-threatening injuries that thankfully they are expected to survive from.”
    


            Three firearms recovered from the scene of the Minneapolis shooting had been legally purchased by the shooter, who had recently been issued a permit to purchase firearms, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.
    


            “I don't have information about where specifically those weapons were purchased, but they were purchased lawfully,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


Context: In Minnesota, a permit is needed to purchase firearms and also to carry the firearms in public. The state doesn't differentiate between open and concealed carry.
    


            Local and federal investigators searching for a motive in the deadly Minneapolis shooting have conducted four search warrants at several locations, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.
    


            “One is the church, and then there are three residences in the Twin Cities metro that are associated with the shooter,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins tonight, adding that at least one scene is still being processed.
    


            The FBI is helping the Minneapolis Police Department sort through documents that have been retrieved from the scene.
    


                    “What we've seen so far is just a variety of hate,” said O'Hara. “Right now, we don't have a clear motive to establish why (the shooter) did this at the church today, we're obviously open to every possibility, and we're hopeful that once we are able to go through the scene and all of the evidence that's collected, that we'll be able to be able to better provide answers for our community.”
                





            Earlier Wednesday, O'Hara said the shooter, Robin Westman, released a “manifesto” on YouTube that “included some disturbing writings.”
    


            The 23-year-old had a personal connection to the church and school, O'Hara told CNN.
    


            “We believe that the suspect, at some point, was a student here, or a member of the parish, and that a family member here also worked for the church,” O'Hara said.
    


            It was just before 8:30 a.m. when young children were attending Mass at a beloved Catholic school in Minneapolis to mark the first week of classes. Moments later, those students and their families' lives were forever changed after a shooter killed two praying children and injured more than a dozen other people.
    


Here's what you should know:



CNN's Tori B. Powell, Aditi Sangal, Chris Boyette, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Chelsea Bailey, Andi Babineau, Morgan Rimmer, Jill Martin, Samantha Waldenberg, John Miller, Mark Morales, Holmes Lybrand, Barbie Latza Nadeau, Michael Rios, Emma Tucker, Matt Lait, Taylor Romine contributed reporting.



            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett about the mass shooting that killed two Catholic school children attending mass in Minneapolis, calling for love rather than hatred in the wake of this tragedy.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed gratitude for Annunciation Catholic School staff, who he said “threw their bodies on top of children” to protect them as a shooter opened fire this morning.
    


            “They did the right thing to protect what could have been so many more children dead,” Frey said of school faculty tonight at a vigil in the community.
    


            He went on to thank law enforcement and first responders across the state “who ran towards danger when so many of the rest of us could have ran in the opposite direction.”
    


            Attendees of the vigil held this evening in Richfield for the victims of the shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis spoke with CNN about the impact of the tragedy on the small and connected community.
    


            Annunciation Catholic School alumni Kailee Poling, 27, said she was attending the vigil with her husband and daughter. Poling, who attended the school from first through eighth grades, spoke through tears as she said, “you never think it's going to happen in your community.”
    


                    “Being a parent, I just can't imagine what those kids went through this morning,” she said. “Annunciation is such a tight knit community that when I heard the news, I was just really impacted knowing it's so close to home and knowing it's a community I've been a part of for so long.”
                





            Paul Hartzheim, 48, said he attended the vigil to be connected to his community in Minneapolis where he's lived his entire adult life. “This hit me different today… When it's in your own backyard, it's different,” he said.
    


            Vigil attendee Rhonda Miska, 45, serves at another Catholic parish said she came to support her fellow Catholics after the tragedy.
    


            Miska said the line into the vigil was wrapping around the building when she arrived, adding: “Clearly this is a testament to the need that we have as human beings to not face challenges alone and to be in community.”
    


            Laura Pueringer, 31, from Richfield, went to Annunciation's sister school and said she was reflecting on the moments she learned about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and 9/11 after today's shooting, which propelled her to attend the vigil to call for change.
    


            “We are demanding change. Enough is enough at this point,” she said.
    


            US Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN tonight that a former staffer's daughter witnessed two of her friends get shot — one in the neck and the other in the stomach — during the shooting this morning at Annunciation Catholic Church.
    


            The senator said the girl was at the church with her siblings when the shooting took place.
    


                    “The kids were crawling under the pews and then she ran out,” Klobuchar said. “She was the one that told the dad of one of the kids that his child had been shot.” 
                





            While describing the horrific scene, Klobuchar said there was also incredible bravery and kindness in the moment as older kids made sure to protect the younger children, she said.
    


            Klobuchar said this is a crucial moment for change, saying that children praying during a new school year shows how desperately it's needed.
    


            “These kids praying in a church, packed into the pews, joyful about their first week in school, their new teacher, and then getting shot through church windows. If that isn't enough to move people that we have to make some changes in this country, I don't know what is,” she said.
    


            A vigil for the victims of the Minneapolis school shooting is underway in Richfield, Minnesota, with a line of people spilling out onto the sidewalk wrapping around the building.
    


            The vigil is taking place at the gymnasium of Academy of Holy Angels High School, which was seen packed with people in attendance.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar are present at the vigil.
    


            One mother, whose two kids survived the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School today, expressed relief that her children were not hurt, but anger at the long trend of gun violence in schools.
    


                    “I have such mixed feelings right now, so many of them. But I am just incredibly grateful that this school did and had been preparing and also just incredibly sad and angry that this has to be a thing in any school,” Carla Maldonado told CNN, getting emotional.
                





            The school has active shooter drills “very often,” her husband, Pedro Maldonado, said. About two years ago, Carla Maldonado said she was volunteering and was there when the school had a “lockdown drill.”
    


            Carla Maldonado said when they arrived to the church earlier today, her husband began yelling for their two children.
    


            They were able to reunite with their 7-year-old daughter in the parking lot and later found out their 11-year-old son was sheltering in the basement of the building.
    


            Carla Maldonado said school shootings and gun violence in classrooms is starting to feel like a “broken record.” The mother pointed out that she's not the first parent to have these kinds of feelings and fears.
    


            “The lives that were lost is too much. One is too much,” Maldonado said. “It's not OK.”

            The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it is planning to reclaim management over Washington's Union Station, a move that comes after President Donald Trump's escalated deployment of troops in the nation's capital.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the train station “has fallen into disrepair,” in a statement. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.”
    


            The transportation department is renegotiating an agreement with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation – the nonprofit organization that oversees the station – and Amtrak, and expects “a formal action” confirming its renewed control by September.
    


            The announcement comes after an executive order signed in March titled, “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,” directed “coordinated beautification plan” for facilities, monuments and parks in DC, the removal of graffiti, and to “ensure the cleanliness of public spaces.”
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN that the transportation department wants to “restore (Union Station) has a transportation hub that benefits our nation's capital.”
    


            He added: “President Trump pledged to Make DC Safe & Beautiful Again, and under Secretary Duffy's leadership, the Department of Transportation is taking historic action to reinvest in Union Station.”
    


            It's the latest move by a Trump administration to exert more control over DC, including a federal takeover of the city's police department and deploying the National Guard. Trump said last Friday he will also be asking Congress for $2 billion to make DC “beautiful.”
    


            Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was supportive of the president's efforts to improve infrastructure in the district, adding that if it takes on a larger role in Union Station, it could “be a very significant and good investment for the region.”
    


            “If it's about what Union Station needs for its total transformation, that would be an amazing initiative for the federal government to take on,” the Democrat said at a separate news conference. “It has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation.”
    


            The department of transportation has owned Union Station since the early 1980s but its control has been gradually reduced under various agreements and leases. The Union Station Redevelopment Corporation has controlled the parking structure but received little revenue, according to the transport department.
    


National Guard troops in Washington, DC, begin carrying weapons



            Last year, Amtrak took over management and operations of the station under a sublease from the nonprofit. The company is a federally chartered corporation, which means the federal government is its majority stockholder. Its board of directors, which includes the US Transportation secretary, is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
    


            The announcement Wednesday comes partnered with the debut of Amtrak's new Acela trains that will travel along the Northeast Corridor, cutting down time for passengers.
    


            In recent weeks, members of the National Guard have been seen deployed around Union Station as part of the president's anti-crime agenda in the capital. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week authorized members of the National Guard deployed to the capital to begin carrying weapons, marking a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon that previously indicated National Guard members could be armed if circumstances warranted.
    


            National Guard troops on the DC mission are also expected to begin assisting more with the “beautification” piece of the mission. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites specifically they'll be assisting with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.

            Kyiv was bombarded overnight by Russia's second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with at least 21 people killed, including four children, according to officials.
    


            Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
    


            Among those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.
    


            Ukraine's air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
    


            Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”

            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow is still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia's way of describing the war, “continues.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in a post on X.
    


            “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
    


            Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine.
    


            The mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
    


            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
    


            “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
    


            The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in a post on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
    


            The bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.
    


            Trump is “not happy” but “not surprised” by the strikes, the White House said Thursday, adding that he was watching the developments “intently.”
    


            Trump, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, wants the war to end, but both Putin and Zelensky “must want it to end as well.” She said the president would
    


            A British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Putin is “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
    


            London has summoned the Russian ambassador, British foreign secretary David Lammy said in a post on social media, adding: “the killing and destruction must stop.”
    


            Later Thursday, the Spanish foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy's charge d'affaires in protest of the “unacceptable attack.”
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
    


            The White House's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes, writing on X that “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
    


            Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
    


            The couple were getting ready to go to their building's bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
    


            “I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
    


            “As of now, my wife hasn't been found. Her phone doesn't respond. She's not listed anywhere. I don't know… we're still searching,” Protsiuk added.
    


            Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
    


            Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
    


            The major attack on Ukraine's capital comes just over two weeks after Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
    


            But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
    


            On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia's defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
    


            A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
    


            Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
    


            Ukraine's outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
    


            “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
    


            In his analysis of Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
    


            Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
    


            Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
    


            Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

US Open opponents Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko got into a face-to-face argument on the Court 11 sideline right after Townsend won their second-round match 7-5, 6-1 on Wednesday.
    


            Townsend, an American who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said Ostapenko, a Latvian, who won the 2017 French Open, told her she has “no class” and “no education.”
    


            A reporter asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to those comments.
    


            “I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded.

            “So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on,” Townsend said. “The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”
    


            Ostapenko later posted on social media about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”
    


            “I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she wrote.
    


            After the two players met at the net for a postmatch handshake, they stayed near each other instead of going their separate ways, as usually happens. The 25th-seeded Ostapenko wagged a finger at Townsend as they spoke.
    


            “It's competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”
    


            When they finally stopped talking, Townsend went over to the stands and egged on the partisan crowd, waving her arm overhead and the noise from spectators only grew louder.

            She and Ostapenko have faced each other before in both singles and doubles.
    


            “There's never been any history. I don't know how she feels about me, but there's no beef on my side,” Townsend said. “She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.”
    


            Ostapenko went on social media to post what she called, “Just a small update about the match.”
    


            She wrote that Townsend was “disrespectful” for not saying “sorry” after being helped by a net cord during a point.
    


            “There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”

            Ostapenko also complained that Townsend began warming up before the match up at the net, instead of back at the baseline. While most players do begin at the baseline, Townsend noted that she has started with volleying for years.
    


            Ostapenko has gotten into kerfuffles with opponents during matches before, including in 2021 when she lost to Alja Tomljanovic at Wimbledon. Tomljanovic accused Ostapenko of lying about needing to leave the court for a medical timeout to address an abdominal issue.
    


            Townsend recently moved to the top of the WTA doubles rankings. But this is her first time reaching the third round in singles at a grand slam tournament since 2023.
    


            In singles, Townsend is No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past grand slam champion in singles at a major since Kristie Ahn defeated – guess who? – Ostapenko at the 2019 US Open.
    


            “The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important,” Townsend said Wednesday. “She's packed up and she's gone.”

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a new order from a Utah judge, who ruled that the state's congressional map must be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections, was “absolutely unconstitutional.”

“How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress, and we want to keep it that way,” he added. “The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED, and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!”

Utah's congressional delegation, comprising Reps. Blake Moore (R-UT), Celeste Maloy (R-UT), Mike Kennedy (R-UT), and Burgess Owens (R-UT), is entirely Republican.

United States District Judge Dianna Gibson took issue with Utah's all-Republican House delegation, saying the Republican-controlled state legislature illegally overruled a 2018 ballot measure designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering.

“Redistricting is not a mere exercise in political line-drawing; it strikes at the very heart of our democracy,” Gibson wrote in Monday's order.

“The way district boundaries are drawn determines whether the right to vote is meaningful, whether equal protection is honored, and whether the fundamental promises of our state and federal constitutions are upheld,” she continued. “How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices, and weaken the rule of law.”

The judge ordered Utah state lawmakers to revise the congressional map within 30 days using guidelines approved by voters in the 2018 ballot measure.

UTAH CONGRESSIONAL MAP MUST BE REDRAWN FOR 2026 ELECTIONS, JUDGE RULES

Utah, a predominantly Republican state, backed Trump by more than 20 points in the last presidential election. However, Salt Lake County remains a Democratic stronghold that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last November. Adopted in 2021, the current congressional map divides the county among the state's four GOP-leaning districts.

Redistricting has triggered an intense battle between Republicans and Democrats over who can constitute the House majority. Texas started aggressively redistricting to strip Democrats of five seats, followed by California's efforts to raise the issue for a popular vote this fall. Other states, such as Maryland and New York, are considering similar plans.

Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's artificial intelligence models to power AI features in its key products. It's trying to lessen that dependence.

The software company said Thursday that it's begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. The MAI-1-preview model is being tested on LMArena, a website where people can conduct evaluations.

"We will be rolling MAI-1-preview out for certain text use cases within Copilot over the coming weeks to learn and improve from user feedback," Microsoft said in a blog post. The company has published a form where developers can request early access.

Meanwhile, Microsoft remains a key backer of OpenAI and strategic partner to the AI startup that's now valued at about $500 billion. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, which in turn relies on cloud infrastructure from Microsoft to run its models.

Microsoft draws on models from OpenAI to power features in Bing, the Windows 11 operating system and other products. 

But the companies are clearly moving into competition in various ways. Last year, Microsoft added OpenAI to the list of competitors in its annual report. It's a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta.

And in recent months, OpenAI has turned to other cloud providers, such as CoreWeave, Google and Oracle, to meet heavy demand. The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week.

On LMArena, Microsoft's new model was ranked 13th for text workloads on Thursday, below models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, Mistral, OpenAI and xAI.

Microsoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips.

"We have big ambitions for where we go next — model advancements, an exciting roadmap of compute, and the chance to reach billions of people through Microsoft's products," said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft's AI unit, in a post on X.

Microsoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi.

MAI-1-preview represents "our first foundation model trained end to end in house," Suleyman wrote on X. 

Suleyman used to compete with OpenAI at startup Inflection. Last year, Microsoft hired him and many of his Inflection colleagues. Before that, Suleyman was a co-founder of DeepMind, an AI research startup that Google bought in 2014.

Suleyman's group inside Microsoft has been expanding, with about two dozen people coming from Google's DeepMind AI lab in recent months.

Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill's efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. 

The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike's corporate staff. It's unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike's EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. 

"As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we're making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE," the company told CNBC in a statement. "This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can."

Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill's efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. 

Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women's, men's and kid's as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. 

Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike's innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. 

Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a "small number" of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.

In a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.

Staff will learn if they're impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.

"To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader," the memo said.

Since taking the helm of the world's largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. 

When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that's now starting to materialize. 

"Instead of a men's, women's and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve," said Hill.

Hill said the company would organize into "sport-obsessed teams" which would "drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands."

The European Union formally proposed Thursday to remove tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key element of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement and ensuring that lower automobile tariffs will be retroactive to the beginning of August.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement that the removal of duties on industrial goods, along with providing "preferential market access" for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, would "ensure tariff relief by the US for the vital EU automotive sector starting retroactively from 1st of August."

"These steps contribute to restoring stability and predictability in EU-US trade and investment relations, to the benefit of business, workers and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic," it added.

The proposal, which now needs to be approved by the European Parliament and Council, was first outlined last week in a joint statement from the two trade partners. In it, they said the United States "expects the European Union's legislative proposals will be ... enacted by the necessary legislatures."

It said tariffs on autos would be reduced from the first day of the month when the EU's legislative proposal were introduced — which means the duties should be cut from Aug. 1.

The U.S. and EU announced they had reached a trade deal — after weeks of tense negotiations — at the end of July. U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal would see a 15% tariff imposed on most European goods to the U.S., including cars.

The rate came as a relief to the United States' largest trading partner after Trump previously threatened it with duties of 30%. Under the deal, the EU also committed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest at least an additional $600 billion in the U.S.

The traditional approach to investing in the energy sector going back decades has often come down to making sure a portfolio has exposure to the "majors" — integrated oil and gas stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have also paid reliable dividends.

There are times when it hasn't worked well in recent history — such as during the peak existential fears over the past decade about an oil industry on the way out as a global source of power — but it has done reasonably well since that panic ended. Over the past five years, whether it's the market performance of Exxon Mobil, or the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), returns have been strong after bottoming out.

But this year, even as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and energy stocks as a category have produced positive returns, they have not been the big winners for investors playing the energy theme of the future, according to Paul Baiocchi, head of fund sales and strategy at SS&C ALPS Advisors.

He pointed to year-to-date outflows among investors in XLE of roughly $7 billion, the largest and most liquid energy market ETF. Some of that may be related to fears that the global economy will slump as a result of President Trump's trade war, and as oil prices remain under pressure, the shares of oil and gas stocks will face greater headwinds.

But it's also a sign of a broader change in how investors think about ways to gain energy exposure.

"It speaks to the fact that advisors and investors are starting to think about energy more in terms of power than just crude oil and natural gas," Baiocchi said on this week's CNBC "ETF Edge."

"The conversation about energy is evolving beyond simply, 'I have to own the large majors,'" he said.

His firm has long offered a way to play a more concentrated bet within the broader energy sector, led by its 15 year-old Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and has seen net inflows this year. 

But the story behind the flight from XLE has a lot to do with the expectations for big changes in the power generation sector in the U.S., and decades of transformation ahead for the electric grid as demand surges, spurred by factors such as AI data centers. Some of Trump's policy priorities play into this trend as well, including support for U.S. artificial intelligence development in a new tech arms race against China, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and the promotion of nuclear power.

"We're talking about incorporating nuclear in a way we haven't in decades," Baiocchi said. "The mix of what generates electricity is evolving and the way investors play energy is evolving."

Jack Clark, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, said at a recent summit where big tech companies met with energy leaders that it estimates 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors.

While XLE has seen outflows this year, its utilities sector comp the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has seen inflows near $3 billion and has tripled the performance of XLE, up roughly 12% this year versus 4% for the broader energy sector.

According to Malcolm Dorson of Global X ETFs, who appeared alongside Baiocchi on "ETF Edge," the investor thinking on energy is changing as power generation becomes central to "all the technologies of tomorrow" and a huge surge in demand begins.

"Not only AI, but electric vehicles and large factories, and the big picture is that the U.S. is sort of not ready for all of this," Dorson said. Global X has launched an ETF focused on the theme, the Global X U.S. Electrification ETF (ZAP). "The U.S. needs to produce about 45% more electricity than it produces today by 2040, after almost two decades of stagnant demand," he said.

And that demand will also mean higher prices paid by electricity consumers, which are expected to continue to outpace general inflation in the years ahead, as they have since 2022. Electricity prices have nearly doubled the inflation rate for all goods and services in 2025, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026.

The ETF experts also weighed in on the impressive performance run for international stocks in 2025, sleeper markets like Argentina and Greece, whether it's time to take some profits, and where to place overseas bets next. You can review that debate in this week's full ETF Edge show.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't.

Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05.

Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company.

Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region.

Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added.

"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said.

Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion.

Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country.

"We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

"It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market."

Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong.

"Everything's sold out," he said.

Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close.

Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play.

In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid.

"Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out."

Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note.

"The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote.

On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up.

"This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote.

David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable."

"I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said.

In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed."

Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI.

Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024.

Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips.

He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals.

Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026.

"Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference.

"We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market.

Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China.

Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of.

"It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market."

CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI.

"Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools."

Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year.

"And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly."

Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving.

"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.)

Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says.

While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell.

Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion.

CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks.

She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues.

A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter.

Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks.

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030.

"The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says.

CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts.

"Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat."

"And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added.

In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year.

It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024.

Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D.

Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business.

For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance.

It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter.

"In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter."

CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call.

The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high.

The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia.

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs.

All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants.

Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending.

William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion.

Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China.

Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology.

Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings.

Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further.

Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth.

During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned.

Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology.

— Brent D. Griffiths

In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports.

The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers.

CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access.

Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips.

The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported.

President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region.

Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though.

Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said.

Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions.

Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner.

Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips.

"They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel."

Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline.

Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call.

Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note.

Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September.

"The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday.

Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside.

In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference.

The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress.

Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter.

The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack.

"We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday.

Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock.

Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million.

Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions.

— Ana Altchek

Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips.

"The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote.

They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name."

Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside.

Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises."

Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models.

"NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index.

Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Walgreens on Thursday named retail veteran Mike Motz as its chief executive officer after the U.S. pharmacy chain was taken private by Sycamore Partners, marking a fresh chapter for the company that has been struggling to keep pace with rivals.

The management shake-up came on the heels of Sycamore's roughly $10 billion acquisition of Walgreens Boots Alliance, completed earlier in the day.

Motz, previously the CEO of office supplies chain Staples' U.S. retail business, will succeed Tim Wentworth and steer the ailing pharmacy operator as it shifts its focus back on core retail and pharmacy operations. He had also worked as the president of Canadian pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart.

Walgreens has struggled to expand beyond its pharmacy business and diversify into broader healthcare services, even as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turned to lower-cost options from Amazon and Walmart for their prescriptions and toiletries.

Wentworth, who took the helm in 2023, spearheaded a turnaround at the company through cost cuts, including the removal of multiple mid-level executives and store closures. Wentworth will continue to serve as a director, Walgreens said.

The company also appointed John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a senior adviser to Sycamore, as executive chairman.

Global popstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce are officially engaged — with a large diamond ring to prove it. But Swifties hoping to emulate the style may find it challenging to do so, experts say.

After a two-year relationship, Swift and Kelce announced their engagement through an Instagram post on their official accounts on Tuesday.

In the photos of their social media post appears a hard-to-miss diamond on Swift's finger, a style that's known as an old mine brilliant cut, Tree Paine, Swift's publicist, told The Associated Press. The ring was designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry in New York City.

"It looks to be upwards of 10 carats, and it might be a vintage stone given the cut," Paul Zimnisky, a New York-based diamond industry analyst, said via email. "Given the quality of the diamond and the size, it could easily be worth hundreds of thousands." 

Jared Jewelers told CNBC through a written statement that the ring could cost approximately $250,000 to $500,000.

However, "no one knows for sure," said Amanda Gizzi, senior vice president of corporate affairs at industry group Jewelers of America. 

It's "a lot of speculation at this point," she said.

While Swift's ring was designed for her, it wouldn't be unusual to see replicas or similar styles appear across the market, said Zimnisky. (The trend-setting Swift's engagement moved several stocks this week, including names related to jewelry and apparel, amid fan interest in her ring and engagement dress.)

A comparable diamond, meanwhile, may be harder to come by.

Old mine diamonds have a "distinct elongated shape with curved edges" and go back to the time when diamonds were cut, shaped and polished by hand, according to Sarah Hanlon, celebrity and entertainment editor of The Knot, a bridal site.

"Due to their rarity, true old mine diamonds can be harder to source," Hanlon said over email.

What's more, the larger carat weight a stone is, the rarer and more expensive it's likely to be, Gizzi said, "especially when we're talking about natural diamonds versus a lab-grown."

According to Zimnisky, lab-grown diamonds can be found for almost 90% less than the cost of a natural diamond. 

However, experts say the elongated style of the singer's ring has already been popping up among engaged couples — or as a song by Swift goes, "It's been a long time coming."

"This style is very much on trend for what we've started to see, which is elongated cuts like hers, as well as a return to natural diamonds and then also this idea of antique cuts," Gizzi said. 

According to Jared Jewelers, "this ring aligns to recent trends in bold gold looks, fancy cuts, and oversized elongated stones."

In fact, elongated shapes like marquise have been selling for a premium this year due to high demand, said Zimnisky.

Couples inspired by Swift's ring can find more affordable versions with less expensive gemstones, said Zimnisky.

While old mine diamonds are rare and can be more costly, diamond shapes like cushions, emeralds and Asschers are easier to come by, said The Knot's Hanlon.

Couples can also look into the vintage jewelry market, experts say. 

"There's no wrong way to go about it," said Gizzi. "The inspiration is definitely something that can be found in different price points."

When shopping for engagement rings, start off by defining your budget. While costs can range widely, the average couple spent $5,200 on an engagement ring, according to The Knot's 2024 Jewelry and Engagement study.

Instead of rules of thumb like spending "three months' salary," your budget should come down to what you're looking for in a ring, experts say.

When shopping for natural diamonds, the four C's – the color, carat, clarity and cut – determine the feature of the diamond as well as the price. 

Lab-grown diamonds will no longer follow the same rules. In June, the Gemological Institute of America, the organization that designed the widely used grading system, said it will instead use descriptive terms to determine the quality of lab-grown diamonds and classify the gems as either "premium" or "standard."

The new grading system will be on the market on Oct. 1, said Stephen Morisseau, a spokesperson for the GIA.

Still, when looking at either lab-grown or natural stones, you want to understand the stone's dimensions, its brilliance, the shape and the weight, said Gizzi.

The U.S. economy grew at a pace that was faster than expected in the second quarter as consumers and businesses held up against tariff volatility.

Gross domestic product rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the April-through-June period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its second estimate for the most encompassing measure of economic activity. The reading was better than an initial 3.0% estimate as well as the 3.1% Dow Jones consensus forecast.

Consumer spending, which rose by 1.6% compared with an initial 1.4% estimate, helped push the number higher.

Importantly, a measure called final sales to private domestic purchasers jumped 1.9%, up from the previous figure of 1.2%. Federal Reserve officials watch that metric closely as an indication of demand and sales that focuses on activity within U.S. borders, an especially important measure considering the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The GDP number also reflected the unusual impact of the tariffs as they related to trade numbers.

Imports, which subtract from GDP, tumbled 29.8% in the quarter after companies stockpiled ahead of Trump's April 2 "liberation day" announcement. The figure was a bit less than the previous estimate of 30.3%.

At the same time, exports, which add to GDP, fell by 1.3%, compared with the previous estimate of -1.8%. Taking the figures together, net exports added nearly 5 percentage points to the Q2 total.

For the first half of the year, GDP has grown about 2.1%, or an average of a little more than 1% per quarter. The economy contracted 0.5% in the first quarter, largely due to the impact of the import rush.

"The good news is consumption came in higher than previously thought. Americans are continuing to spend despite the tariffs and uncertainty, albeit at a slower pace than past years," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "Going forward, the economy is likely to stay in this slower speed mode with spending and growth around 1.5% as the tariffs become more visible to American consumers."

With the first months' data mostly in the books, the economy is growing at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure.

Inflation-related estimates were little changed from the initial reading. Core personal consumption expenditures prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5%, unchanged from the prior figure, while the headline PCE price index edged lower to 2%, in line with the Fed's inflation goal.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

Hello, this is Spriha Srivastava, CNBC International's Executive Editor for Digital, writing from London. This week, I take a closer look at India's tightrope walk — tariffs from Washington, oil from Moscow, and an uneasy handshake with Beijing. Let's dive in.

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Picture this: you're at a dinner party with three friends who are struggling to get along. One is picking fights with everyone, another is slipping you secret notes under the table, and the third is that old frenemy you'd rather avoid but can't ignore. Awkward, right? 

That is where India finds itself. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is keeping India's energy bills in check with cheap oil, and Beijing, despite a bruised relationship, is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week. India's juggling act on the world stage has never looked more complicated, or more consequential. 

Trade with the U.S. has become a flashpoint. Washington has imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, followed by another 25% penalty tied to India's Russian oil purchases. That leaves duties on some Indian exports as high as 50%. The U.S. is India's single largest export market, worth about $87 billion a year, nearly a fifth of its total merchandise trade. Key Indian sectors such as diamonds, garments and seafood are especially exposed.

Think of what that means on the ground. Diamond polishers in Gujarat, garment workers in Tirupur, and seafood processors in Kerala all depend on U.S. orders. Electronics and pharma are spared for now, but other sectors — which employ millions — are suddenly exposed. 

The tariff fight comes even as the two countries deepen strategic ties. On a number of fronts, the U.S. and India are cooperating; the two countries are expanding defense cooperation, for instance, working together in the Quad, and advancing semiconductor supply chain talks. 

Major U.S. firms, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, have increased their investments in India in recent years. Yet trade frictions complicate the relationship, raising the question in Delhi: does Washington view India as a true partner, or simply another trading problem to manage?

Now, let's turn to Russia. India is the world's third-largest oil consumer, burning through more than 5 million barrels a day, so cheap energy isn't a luxury — it's a necessity. In 2021, just 1% of India's crude came from Russia. Today it's more than 35%, around 1.75 million barrels a day, saving Delhi over $17 billion since early 2022, according to analyst estimates. Those discounts have kept inflation in check and given Modi breathing space at home. 

But there's a second layer here. India is walking a geopolitical tightrope, with Pakistan tensions threatening to boil over. In that context, Russia is a vital security partner and central to India's defense procurement, making it difficult for Delhi to pull away without weakening its security posture.

The catch? Washington isn't impressed. U.S. officials including Peter Navarro and Scott Bessent argue Delhi is "profiteering" by paying above the G7's $60 price cap on Russian oil and exporting refined fuels back to Europe.  

Then comes Beijing, which represents perhaps the trickiest relationship of all. Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and stand alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing says the event is a display of solidarity, tensions between India and China remain unresolved.

Border clashes in 2020 killed at least 20 Indian soldiers, prompting a freeze in high-level engagement. Since then, India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, tightened foreign investment rules, and promoted self-reliance in key sectors. Yet trade between the two countries still hit $118 billion last year, with India importing far more than it exports. This imbalance frustrates Delhi but also underscores why cutting ties is not realistic.

Analysts say Modi is unlikely to secure a major breakthrough when he visits Tianjin. But showing up is a signal in itself — that India is willing to keep lines of communication open, even while deepening defense ties with Washington and buying cheap oil from Moscow. 

Step back, and India's position looks clearer. The U.S. is its biggest customer but also its harshest critic. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore. Delhi calls its approach "strategic autonomy." It has worked for decades, but today the balancing act is under more pressure than ever.

Which brings us back to that dinner party. India wants all three guests to remain seated, however awkward the conversation may be. The real test is whether Modi can stop someone from banging the table, throwing down their fork, and storming out. 

Richard Rossow, Senior Adviser and Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that a deal between the U.S. and India is "still very much possible" as the South Asian country puts forth substantial sweeteners.

Arnab Mitra, India consumer analyst at Goldman Sachs, said there could be a mass consumption revival in India driven by rural demand and upcoming GST reforms.

Meera Shankar, former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said India will not be able to entirely open up its agricultural sector because of domestic political sensitivities.

Trade negotiations between India and the U.S. still ongoing. India's Foreign Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that India has "some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended." He added that "it is our right to make decisions in our 'national interest'."

India and Russia reaffirm plans to boost bilateral trade. The two countries have vowed to expand their trade ties in a move indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil are unlikely to impact their partnership.

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor urges India to reassess Russian oil purchases. Raghuram Rajan said that Trump's hefty tariffs send New Delhi a clear "wake-up call" to reduce its dependence on a single trading partner. He added that it is now important for India to "ask who benefits and who is hurt."

– Amala Balakrishner

People on the street are looking at China and comparing it to India. People who have been away from the Chinese markets think it's time to move back. But, I do think this is a relatively short-term thinking. India is still going to do very very well from a longer-term perspective.

— Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Markets

Indian markets fell Thursday, after a holiday the day before. It marked the first session since the additional 25% tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. kicked in on Wednesday.

The benchmark Nifty 50 was down 0.85%, while the BSE Sensex index fell 0.87%. The 50-stock Nifty 50 has risen over 3% since the start of the year, while the BSE Sensex is up 2%.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield fell to 6.58%.

Best Buy surpassed Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations for its most recent quarter on Thursday, but stuck with its full-year forecast, citing tariff uncertainty.

On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said the retailer is "increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year." She said the company is "trending toward the higher end of our sales range."

Yet she said, "given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter."

The consumer electronics retailer said it expects revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.15 to $6.30 for its full fiscal year 2026. In May, Best Buy had cut its full-year profit guidance from a prior range of $6.20 to $6.60.

The middle of Best Buy's expected full-year revenue range would be roughly flat to its revenue of $41.53 billion in the previous year. Best Buy said it expects full-year comparable sales, a metric that tracks online sales and sales at stores open at least 14 months, to range between a 1% decline and a 1% increase.

Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said the company's full-year guidance reflects that some shoppers could hold off on purchases in the third quarter. He said the retailer could see a slowdown in the business in October "as people are waiting for those holiday deals to come."

For Best Buy, back-to-school season is a crucial time as families and students come to the store for laptops, tablets and more. Barry said the company has seen "a strong customer response" to its sales events during the season.

"These results demonstrate an important aspect of our thesis: Our model really shines when there is innovation," she said.

Shares of Best Buy were down nearly 6% in midday trading.

Here's how the retailer did for the three-month period that ended August 2 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Best Buy's net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2026 fell to $186 million, or 87 cents per share, from $291 million, or $1.34 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring charges, Best Buy reported earnings per share of $1.28.

Revenue increased from $9.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Best Buy has been navigating a challenging trifecta of factors. Customers have bought fewer kitchen appliances as they put off home purchases and projects because of higher interest rates. Some have hesitated to splurge on pricier items because of tariff-related uncertainty or held out on tech replacements as they wait for new or eye-catching items. The company's annual sales have declined for the past three years.

To spur growth, Best Buy launched a third-party marketplace earlier this month to offer shoppers a wider selection of consumer electronics, accessories and more. On the marketplace, sellers who apply for the platform can list their own brands and items on Best Buy's website and app.

The company already increased prices on some items because of tariff-related higher costs, Barry said on a mid-May call with reporters. She did not specify which items now cost more and described price increases as "the very last resort."

Still, tariffs did not have a material impact on fiscal second-quarter financial results, Barry said on the company's earnings call Thursday.

Barry said that shopping patterns at Best Buy have not changed from previous quarters. She said customers are "resilient, but deal-focused" and have been attracted to the company's sales events like the one it held in July.

"In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation," she said.

Best Buy's comparable sales rose 1.6% in the fiscal second quarter compared to the year-ago period. That marked the company's highest growth in three years, Barry said on the company's earnings call.

In the U.S., comparable sales increased 1.1%, as customers bought mobile phones, video gaming equipment and items from its computing category. However, those sales trends were partially offset by weaker sales of appliances, home theaters, tablets and drones, the company said.

Investors have looked for signs that the replacement cycle is picking up about five years after consumers stocked up on laptops, kitchen appliances, computer screens and more during the Covid pandemic.

There were some indications of that rebound in Best Buy's second quarter. Barry said the retailer's computing category marked its sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth. It also recorded the highest number of second-quarter laptop unit sales in 15 years, she said.

Gaming in particular had stronger-than-expected sales in the quarter, thanks to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Barry said. The retailer capitalized on the highly anticipated launch by offering a way for customers to pre-order and opening stores at midnight when the gaming console dropped on June 5, so customers could line up and get it right away.

In the back half of the year, Barrie said Best Buy will try to rev up sales in slower categories like appliances and home theater by sharpening price points, adjusting the merchandise it sells and expanding the staffing devoted to them. The retailer has increasingly leaned on its vendor partners to staff stores, bringing in employees of Apple and Samsung for example, to support sales in different parts of its stores.

Barry said the retailer expects brands to ramp up those staffing contributions in the back half of the year.

Along with adding more dedicated brand experts to its stores, Best Buy has added new experiences to attract and engage customers. It's testing mini-showrooms with Ikea that feature kitchen and laundry room appliances and merchandise from both retailers in 10 stores in Florida and Texas. It is also rolling out new experiences with Breville and SharkNinja to show off trendy coffeemakers, beauty items and more, Barry said. And it has areas in stores where shoppers can try out Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses with Meta AI technology.

For the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, Best Buy worked with Nintendo to double the space in stores ahead of the June launch. Nintendo also brought game trucks to select stores, physical trailers where customers could play with the new system and try out the latest videogames.

Best Buy's fiscal second-quarter online sales in the U.S. rose 5.1% year over year and accounted for about a third of Best Buy's total U.S. revenue in the quarter.

There is growing evidence that the widespread adoption of generative AI is impacting the job prospects of America's workers, according to a paper released on Tuesday by three Stanford University researchers.

The study analyzed payroll records from millions of American workers, generated by ADP, the largest payroll software firm in the U.S.

The report found "early, large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the AI revolution is beginning to have a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the American labor market."

Most notably, the findings revealed that workers between the ages of 22 and 25 in jobs most exposed to AI — such as customer service, accounting and software development — have seen a 13% decline in employment since 2022.

By contrast, employment for more experienced workers in the same fields, and for workers of all ages in less-exposed occupations such as nursing aides, has stayed steady or grown. Jobs for young health aides, for example, rose faster than their older counterparts.

Front-line production and operations supervisors' roles also showed an increase in employment for young workers, though this growth was smaller than that for workers over the age of 35.

The potential impact of AI on the job market has been a concern across industries and age groups, but the Stanford study appears to show that the results will be far from uniform. 

The study sought to rule out factors that could skew the data, including education level, remote work, outsourced jobs, and broader economic shifts, which could impact hiring decisions.

According to the Stanford study, their findings may explain why national employment growth for young workers has been stagnant, while overall employment has largely remained resilient since the global pandemic, despite recent signs of softening.

Young workers were said to be especially vulnerable because AI can replace "codified knowledge," or "book-learning" that comes from formal education. On the other hand, AI may be less capable of replacing knowledge that comes from years of experience. 

The researchers also noted that not all uses of AI are associated with declines in employment. In occupations where AI complements work and is used to help with efficiency, there have been muted changes in employment rates.

The study — which hasn't been peer-reviewed — appears to show mounting evidence that AI will replace jobs, a topic that has been hotly debated. 

Earlier this month, a Goldman Sachs economist said changes to the American labor market brought on by the arrival of generative AI were already showing up in employment data, particularly in the technology sector and among younger employees. 

He also noted that most companies were yet to deploy artificial intelligence for day-to-day use, meaning that the job market impact had yet to be fully realized.

As the AI talent war sweeps across Silicon Valley, Amazon has largely sat on the sidelines. A confidential internal document, and accounts from people familiar with the matter, reveal why.

The company has flagged its unique pay structure, lagging AI reputation, and rigid return-to-office rules as major hurdles. Now, the tech giant is being pushed to rethink its recruiting strategy as it scrambles to compete for top talent.

The document, from late last year, was written by the HR team covering Amazon's non-retail businesses, including Amazon Web Services, advertising, devices, entertainment, and the newly formed artificial general intelligence team.

"GenAI hiring faces challenges like location, compensation, and Amazon's perceived lag in the space," the document noted. "Competitors often provide more comprehensive and aggressive packages." Business Insider obtained a copy of the document.

Amazon's absence from recent splashy AI hires underscores those concerns. Meta has pulled in high-profile talent from ScaleAI, Apple, and OpenAI. Google and OpenAI continue to be top destinations for AI experts, while Microsoft has even drafted a wish list of Meta AI employees it hopes to recruit.

Amazon's spokesperson initially told BI that the company continues to "adapt our approach to remain highly competitive, maintaining flexibility in both our compensation packages and work arrangements to attract and retain the best AI talent in this dynamic market."

Hours later, the spokesperson updated the statement, saying the premise of the story was "wrong," without providing any specifics.

"We continue to attract and retain some of the best people in the world and they're building and deploying GenAI applications at a rapid clip. Our compensation is competitive, but we also want missionaries who are passionate about inventing things that will make a meaningful difference for customers — for those kinds of people, there's no better place in the world to build."

Amazon is famously frugal. One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos still using door desks today.

This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation.

The internal document described compensation as one of the "hotly debated topics" among Amazon recruiters, citing the company's strict use of fixed salary bands for each role. Amazon's "egalitarian philosophy" on pay leaves its offers "below par" compared with top rivals, it added.

"The lack of salary range increases for several key job families over the past few years does not position Amazon as an employer of choice for top tech talent," the document warned.

For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is limited, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field. Indeed, Amazon has yet to find a blockbuster AI product like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, although its Bedrock AI cloud service has made progress.

Amazon's pay structure has been a long-standing source of tension.

Several people who spoke to Business Insider cited the 2020 departure of Amazon robotics VP Brad Porter as evidence of the company's frugal approach hampering talent recruitment and retention. Porter left in part after Amazon refused to raise his pay band.

Amazon's stock vesting schedule is also heavily backloaded, a structure that can be less attractive to new hires. The policy extends even to top executives, who generally receive no cash bonuses.

In addition to highlighting Amazon's "perceived lag in the AI space," the internal document said generative AI has further intensified the competition for specialized talent, particularly individuals with expertise in large language models.

An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling.

"Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave," Reyes said. "Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet."

Some investors share that view. On Amazon's earnings call last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pressed CEO Andy Jassy on Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI and fears of losing market share to rivals. Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call.

Amazon intends to tackle these concerns. According to the document, the company will refine its "compensation and location strategy" and host more events designed to highlight its generative AI capabilities. It also intends to set up dedicated recruiting teams for generative AI within business units like AWS to boost efficiency.

Another point of contention is Amazon's aggressive return-to-office mandate, which has already caused logistical issues.

The company's new "hub" policy — which requires employees to relocate to a central office or risk termination — has further limited its access to "high-demand talent like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document.

"Hubs constrain market availability," it stated.

Amazon is exploring ways to allow for more "location-flexible" roles, the document added.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company is "always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations."

Amazon hasn't been entirely on the sidelines. Last year, it brought on Adept CEO David Luan as part of a licensing deal with the AI startup. Luan now heads Amazon's AI agents lab. But the company has also seen departures, including senior AI leaders like chip designer Rami Sinno and VP Vasi Philomin, who worked on Bedrock.

One Amazon recruiter told Business Insider that a growing number of job candidates started declining offers last year because of the company's RTO policy. Even if a competitor pays less, people are open to taking the job if they can stay remote, this person said.

"We are losing out on talent," this person added.

Indeed, Bloomberg reported recently that Oracle has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past two years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier.

The internal Amazon document dates to late last year, leaving open the possibility that the company has since adjusted its compensation approach to make exceptions for top AI talent.

Still, multiple people familiar with the situation told Business Insider there haven't been any formal updates to internal pay guidelines. One current Amazon manager said it remains almost impossible for the company to enact sweeping changes, given its long track record of sticking to the existing system. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.

"Based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from changing an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades," Amazon wrote this year about executive compensation in its annual proxy statement.

Of course, the AI talent war may end up being an expensive and misguided strategy, stoked by hype and investor over-exuberance.

Some of the high-profile recruits Meta recently lured have already departed.

Rheinmetall's newly-opened factory in Northern Germany — set to become Europe's biggest ammunition production facility — is another step in the region's race to catch up with Russian output, according to the company's chief executive.

CEO Armin Papperger on Wednesday told CNBC that Russia had the capacity to put out 4 to 5 million artillery ammunition rounds a year. Comparatively, he said Europe has a yearly output of around 2 million, more than half of which is produced by Rheinmetall.

The European Union has been supporting Ukraine in its military effort to combat Russia's invasion, amid uncertainty over the U.S.' long-term plans to back Kyiv.

Europe's "biggest need is artillery ammunition and missiles," Papperger said, stressing the new plant in Unterluess will focus on both items. The plant's output is expected to reach 350,000 artillery shells a year by 2027.

"We do our utmost, we do whatever we can do to be fast. I had a chat before with [German Defense Minister Boris] Boris Pistorius about that, he said, hurry up. We have to do more," Papperger told CNBC's Annette Weisbach.

Along with other European countries and NATO members, Germany has pledged to ramp up defense spending and expand its military in the coming decade — in Berlin's case, enabled by reforms earlier this year to its debt rules. It has specifically committed to more than double its defense spending to 153 billion euros ($178 billion) by 2029. Some analysts say Germany has more fiscal headroom to deliver on those promises than do the governments of France, Italy and the U.K.

Rheinmetall has been a major beneficiary of that trend, with its share price more than doubling last year and extending another 166% in the year to date.

Papperger told CNBC on Wednesday that he expected new contracts to come in over the fourth quarter this year and throughout the first quarter of 2026, and that it had received down payments from the government enabling it to make new investments.

"The German government is very fair to us," he said.

Speaking at the plant's opening on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the factory was set up by Rheinmetall in a "staggering" timeframe of 14 months.

"This is exactly what we need to ensure the prosperity and security of our economies and societies across Europe and North America, especially at a time when we are aggressively being challenged," Rutte said.

The NATO chief added that Russia and China were "producing weapons and heavy military equipment at an incredible rate" and with "little transparency."

"Now we need to see similar efforts to increase the production of more complex capabilities, like tanks and air defense systems and missiles," Rutte said.

Sales of Tesla cars in Europe plunged in July, in the company's seventh consecutive month of declines, while Chinese rival BYD saw a monthly surge, data released on Thursday showed.

New car registrations of Tesla vehicles totaled 8,837 in July, down 40% year-on-year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA. BYD meanwhile recorded 13,503 new registrations in July, up 225% annually.

Tesla's declines took place even as overall sales of battery electric cars rose in Europe, ACEA data showed.

Elon Musk's automaker faces a number of challenges in Europe including intense ongoing competition and reputational damage to the brand from the billionaire's incendiary rhetoric and relationship with the Trump administration.

Tesla has struggled globally in recent times. The company's auto sales revenue fell in the second quarter of the year and Musk warned that the automaker "could have a few rough quarters" ahead.

One of Tesla's issues is that it has not had a major refresh of its car line-up. The company said this year that it is working on a more affordable electric car with "volume production" planned for the second half of 2025, with investors hoping this will reinvigorate sales.

Thomas Besson, head of automobile sector research at Kepler Cheuvreux, said Tesla management has been trying to "convince investors that Tesla is not really a car company" by talking about artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomy.

"They talk about almost everything else but the car they're selling at a slower pace now because effectively, the age of their vehicle is much higher than the competition and the latest products have not been as successful as hoped, notably the Cybertruck," Besson told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Thursday.

But the U.S. automaker is up against Chinese players, which are launching models aggressively and ramping up their push into Europe. BYD has led that charge, opening showrooms up across the continent and launching its cars at competitive prices over the last two years.

Chinese brands commanded a record market share rate of more than 5% in the first half of the year, which is a record high, according to data from JATO Dynamics released last month.

It's not only Tesla feeling the heat from Chinese competition. Jeep owner Stellantis, South Korea's Hyundai Group and Japan's Toyota and Suzuki, all posted year-on-year declines in European new car registrations in July.

By contrast, Volkswagen, BMW and Renault Group, were among those that logged increases in new European car registrations across the month.

Market watchers might be perplexed by the seemingly contradictory moves of Nvidia's shares in extended trading.

The company beat expectations for its second-quarter results, and its forward revenue guidance also surpassed expectations. A stock buyback was also announced, but the stock fell.

The reason? Data center revenue, which serves as a proxy for the company's AI prospects, came up short of estimates.

Nvidia's growth in recent years has been fueled by its data center business, which focuses on graphics processors, or GPUs, and related products that link and scale them for large deployments. Revenue from the division rose 56% from a year earlier to $41.1 billion, slightly below the $41.34 billion estimate from StreetAccount.

However, it is important to note that the company is not performing poorly. In fact, the chipmaker has topped earnings estimates in 11 of the past 12 quarters, but its shares fell after results on four of those occasions, according to FactSet.

Could investors then, be expecting too much from the chipmaker?

Remember, Nvidia still has other engines to rely on, such as its gaming division. In fact, before the AI boom, Nvidia's gaming division was its largest revenue driver, and the firm was more widely known among computer enthusiasts for its graphics cards, which they would install in their own rigs.

Trees, forests and the Nvidia logo might all be green, but investors shouldn't miss the Nvidia forest for the AI tree.

Nvidia posts results beat. The tech giant reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday, and said sales growth this quarter will remain above 50%. However, the stock slipped in extended trading, as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second straight period.

S&P notches fresh closing high. The broad market index gained 0.24% at the end of the session and reached a new closing high of 6,481.40 as all three major U.S. indexes climbed on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's earnings. Over in Asia, markets were mixed, but Hong Kong led losses, falling over 1%.

Japan's top negotiator drops U.S. trip. Top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa canceled a trip to the United States on Thursday over issues related to the U.S.-Japan trade deal. Tokyo said the trip would have involved discussions on U.S. tariff measures, but as "certain points required further technical discussion," the trip was cancelled.

Qantas soars to record high. Shares of Australian flag carrier Qantas rose to a record high Thursday after its full-year earnings results beat estimates, buoyed by resilient demand across its domestic and international networks. The stock posted a gain of up to 13.59% in early trade.

[PRO] Pros assess if TSMC is a "smart" buy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's said last week that investors buying TSMC stock would be "very smart." Analysts from Morningstar, Macquarie and GFM Asset Management share their thoughts with CNBC.

Taylor Swift's engagement is a big enough deal to move these stocks

Taylor Swift not only moves fans. The pop star's engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce was also enough to move stocks.

Her engagement announcement led to shifts in the share prices of Signet Jewelers, Ralph Lauren and American Eagle.

Other brands rushed to cash in the cultural cache of the Swift-Kelce engagement. Domino's Pizza and GrubHub pushed alerts to app users, with each referencing Swift's songs and including a ring emoji. Soda producer Poppi shared an Instagram photo themed to the duo's social media caption.

Japan's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa canceled a trip to the United States on Thursday over issues related to the U.S.-Japan trade deal.

In a statement, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said that his trip would have involved the discussion of U.S. tariff measures.

"However, during the coordination with the US, because it became apparent that certain points required further technical discussion, the trip was cancelled, and it was decided that discussions will continue at the administrative level," Hayashi told reporters.

Japanese media outlet Kyodo News said it has not been decided whether he will reschedule the trip, while Reuters said Akazawa could head to Washington as early next week after the outstanding issues are resolved, citing an anonymous government source.

Hayashi said Tokyo will urge the U.S. to amend its presidential order on reciprocal tariffs as soon as possible, and ask Washington to issue a presidential order to lower tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.

The White House has an executive order setting the baseline tariff rate for Japan at 15%, but there has not been a written confirmation cutting the tariff rate for automobiles to 15% from 25%.

Akazawa reportedly said in July that the U.S. had promised to amend the executive order on reciprocal tariffs on Japan to include a "no-stacking" arrangement, in which tariffs will not stack on each other beyond 15%. That would be similar to the arrangement made with the European Union.

"We have confirmed with the United States that a sincere and prompt implementation of the Japan-US agreement is vital," he said on Thursday.

Separately, Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa said on Thursday that although tariff negotiations between the two sides have resulted in an agreement, many uncertainties remain.

He warned that exports and industrial production are projected to be negatively affected in Japan "for the time being," saying that there will be a "reactionary decline" in light of front-loading from U.S. tariffs. Corporate profits are also expected to decline, mainly in the manufacturing sector, Nakagawa said, "reflecting the effects of the deterioration in export profitability due to the increase in U.S. tariffs and of the slowdown in overseas economies."

Reuters had earlier reported that also on the agenda for Akazawa's trip was a written confirmation of the details of Japan's $550 billion investment package for the U.S. in exchange for reduced tariffs on imports.

That comes after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a Fox News interview on Monday stateside that the U.S. will make an announcement regarding the package.

The $550 billion package was announced as part of Tokyo's deal with the U.S. in July, which saw so-called "reciprocal" tariffs on Japanese exports lowered to 15% from 25%. Tariffs on Japan's key automobile sector were also cut to 15%.

However, sticking points emerged over the $550 billion investment package, with Trump touting the package as "our money to invest, as we like."

"Some people are saying Japan is simply handing over $550 billion," Akazawa said after the trade deal was announced. "But such claims are completely off the mark," according a to Reuters report on July 25.

Akazawa also reportedly said that the returns would be split between Japan and the United States, according to the degree of contributions by each side, while recognizing the U.S.' willingness to contribute a larger share.

Microsoft on Thursday said that it had terminated two employees who broke into President Brad Smith's office earlier this week.

The news comes after seven current and former Microsoft employees on Tuesday held a protest in the company's building in Redmond, Washington, in opposition to the Israeli military's alleged use of the company's software as part of its invasion of Gaza.

The protesters, affiliated with the group No Azure for Apartheid, gained entry into Smith's office and had demanded that Microsoft end its direct and indirect support to Israel.

In a post on Instagram, No Azure for Apartheid said Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle had been fired by the company.

"Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct," a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, noting unlawful break-ins at the executive offices.

"These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters," the statement added.

In the aftermath of the protests, Smith claimed that the protestors had blocked people out of the office, planted listening devices in the form of phones, and refused to leave until they were removed by police. 

No Azure For Apartheid defines itself as "a movement of Microsoft workers demanding that Microsoft end its direct and indirect complicity in Israeli apartheid and genocide."

The Guardian earlier this month reported that the Israeli military had used Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure to store the phone calls of Palestinians, leading the company to authorize a third-party investigation into whether its technology has been used in surveillance.

Smith said on Tuesday that the company would "investigate and get to the truth" of how services are being used. 

According to Smith, No Azure For Apartheid also mounted protests around the company's campus last week, leading to 20 arrests in one day, with 16 having never worked at Microsoft. 

No Azure for Apartheid has held a series of actions this year, including at Microsoft's Build developer conference and at a celebration of the company's 50th anniversary. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that a Microsoft director had reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the protests.

Microsoft's actions come after tech giant Google fired 28 employees last year following a series of protests against labor conditions and the company's contract with the Israeli government and military for cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. In that case, some employees had gained access to the office of Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google's cloud unit.

Coinbase's Layer-2 network, Base, has become one of the most active blockchain ecosystems by NFT trading volume, surpassing Solana and Abstract.

DappRadar's blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a recent research report that Base has become a popular place for creators, thanks to cheap mints, creator-friendly tools, and “speculation around a potential airdrop.”

“Base NFTs hit $122M in trading volume and 6.7M sales in 2025, with June marking a breakout moment (+336% MoM volume),” Gherghelas noted.

The surge has been fueled by top collections such as DX Terminal, Onchain Gaias, Oracle Patron, Based Punks, and Get Based, blending retro-futuristic art, interactive gameplay, and, in the case of Onchain Gaias, the ability for holders to train AI-enabled agents across Web3 ecosystems.

The main driver behind Base's NFT boom is Zora, an open-source NFT protocol that lets creators launch low-cost NFTs and drops on Base for less than one U.S. dollar, while also offering an ERC-20 layer for creator tokens.

“Since July alone, Zora on Base has recorded 1.6 million tokens minted, generating $470 million in trading volume and $3.4 million in creator royalties,” Gherghelas wrote.

Data from DefiLlama shows that starting in July, Zora's revenue jumped to $4.7 million, marking a more than 312,000% increase compared to Q4 2024. On the marketplace front, OpenSea has emerged as the leader on Base, with Gherghelas attributing this to the fact that the marketplace was an early Base supporter.

Amid the recent uptick in NFT activity, OpenSea has overtaken Blur over the past 90 days, with trading volume of $389 million, compared to Blur's $312 million, according to Token Terminal.

Oops, something went wrong

This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Michael Saylor's high-stakes Bitcoin strategy is facing a sharp market backlash, as shares of Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) formerly MicroStrategy have fallen 15% this month. Once celebrated as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company's premium over its Bitcoin assets has eroded to 1.57, down from 3.4 after Donald Trump's re-election. The pullback comes despite an ongoing crypto boom, raising doubts about the sustainability of Saylor's corporate-treasury model. A key pressure point stems from tepid demand for Strategy's newly issued preferred stock, which raised only $47 million, falling short of expectations and forcing a return to common-share issuance despite earlier promises to limit dilution.

The model Saylor popularized borrowing and raising equity to accumulate Bitcoin has inspired other treasury-focused firms that now collectively hold more than $108 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, or roughly 4.7% of its supply. But as Strategy issues equity into a falling multiple, investor confidence could weaken further, potentially creating a negative feedback loop. Analysts note that the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has intensified competition by offering direct exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage, or share dilution. Nearly one-third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings, leaving smaller players especially vulnerable due to liquidity constraints and heavier reliance on convertible debt.

Investor sentiment is also shifting toward alternative digital assets, with Ether-focused treasuries committing more than $19 billion as attention diversifies. While Bitcoin prices remain supported by institutional allocations, many newer entrants have bought at levels above $100,000 and lack the business fundamentals to withstand volatility. Critics warn that if Bitcoin's price were to fall sharply, enthusiasm for treasury-style strategies could fade quickly, compressing valuations across the sector. Supporters of Strategy, however, argue that maintaining capital flexibility may still benefit the company, particularly if it secures inclusion in the S&P 500 or if Bitcoin rallies strongly again.

Aug. 28 (UPI) -- Buenos Aires has allowed certain local taxes, vehicle registrations, driver's licenses and fines to be paid with cryptocurrency for the first time as part of an effort to position the Argentine capital as a leader in using digital currency.

"The goal is for the city to be a global leader in crypto. We already have the human capital, and now we are creating the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make compliance easier for taxpayers and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here," said Jorge Macri, chief of government of Buenos Aires, at the launch of the project.
The initiative, called Buenos Aires Cripto, includes measures to modernize the tax system, promote foreign investment and position the capital as a regional benchmark in the field.
"The digital economy requires us to update and adapt with a government that is modern, agile, efficient and smart," Macri said. He added that new tax measures are being introduced to give businesses a friendlier regulatory framework, including simpler tax filings and changes in how some taxes are calculated.

The shift reflects the fact that both companies and individuals use cryptocurrencies in daily life, including to receive payments from abroad.
As of 2024, about 10,000 Argentines were receiving salaries from abroad through crypto, PayPal or Brazil's central bank payment system, PIX. Buenos Aires also has more than 10 million crypto accounts, representing 22% of those opened in Latin America.
"The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Argentina is not new," said Carlos Torres, lead partner of the Payments Practice at consulting firm EY. He explained that the trend has been growing for several years as a result of Argentina's economic troubles.
"It has been driven mainly by inflation, economic instability and currency volatility, where cryptocurrency was seen as a refuge in the national context," he said.
Exchange platforms such as Binance and Lemon are widely used in Argentina, with Bitcoin leading as the main investment alternative.
Francisco Diaz, director of the business school at Universidad Mayor in Chile, said restrictions on the foreign exchange and international capital markets pushed Argentines to seek creative solutions for using foreign currency.
"Cryptocurrencies, particularly the more stable ones -- stablecoins -- have been widely adopted in recent years as a means of payment, a tool for receiving funds from abroad, for transactions and as a way to save in assets less exposed to inflation. That has expanded awareness and acceptance and fueled the growth of an ecosystem of entrepreneurs and companies tied to the crypto world," he said.

Analysts say the outlook is favorable for Buenos Aires to become a leading city in crypto.
"Given this context, I believe Argentina has all the conditions to expand the use of crypto, especially now that it has the regulatory framework launched in 2024," Torres said.
Argentina recorded the highest number of cryptocurrency users in Latin America in 2024, receiving $91.1 billion in assets, a 6.7% increase from 2023, according to the State of the Crypto Industry 2024 report by Lemon.
Globally, India ranked first, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines, according to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.
"India stands out because of the size of its population, its widespread knowledge of technology and the broad use of the Internet and mobile devices, which create favorable conditions for developing this ecosystem," Torres said.
The use of virtual currencies brings benefits but also opens the door to crimes such as money laundering.
"The use of cryptocurrencies reduces transaction costs and makes it easier to create new financial instruments, but it also increases the risks of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering," Diaz said.
Recently, Argentina's Office of Economic Crime and Money Laundering reported a rise in the use of digital assets and virtual platforms to launder illicit funds or justify profits, mainly from drug trafficking.

The problem, Diaz warned, is that innovation is moving faster than regulation.
"It is the responsibility of governments and regulatory institutions, such as central banks, to create a framework that ensures transparency, traceability and cybersecurity. Digital technologies such as blockchain can facilitate traceability," he said.

Oops, something went wrong

Four crypto whales have scooped up over $350 million of Ethereum's native token, ETH, in the past two days, raising questions about what it means for its price. Whale is a moniker for large investors with the capacity to allocate huge sums, which can often directly influence the market's direction.

Precisely, an Arkham Intelligence analyst spotted four addresses with similar patterns and time schedules purchasing $357.24 million of ETH from FalconX, an “institutional crypto prime brokerage,” as described by the company itself.

The identified patterns suggest these addresses could belong to the same entity, or at least to entities connected with each other. Responding to these signals, the analyst questions whether these whales are “buying the bottom,” in the sense that they probably expect—and could somehow influence—Ethereum's price to go up from here.

On a similar note, inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have skyrocketed to a total of $1.83 billion during the last five trading sessions, as Coinspeaker reported earlier today. The institutional activity is not only around ETH but also on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all with significant purchases in what looks like a bottom. For example, Smarter Web Company purchased 45 BTC at around $111,000 each, and Bitplanet will deploy $40 million into Bitcoin, becoming South Korea's first institutional BTC treasury.

Regarding Ethereum , technical indicators and historical price action corroborate the idea of a potential bottom for ETH and other cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum is currently changing hands at $4,747 per token, testing a potential support level. If this price support holds, ETH could bounce back up, consolidating the thesis of a potential bottom marked by large institutional and crypto whale purchases.

Interestingly, Ethereum could have indeed formed a bottom on August 26—since Arkham spotted the four whales that started buying—at around $4,320. Before that, we saw two other likely bottom formations, pushing the ETH price up on August 20 and 21, at $4,070 and $4,215, respectively.

The current price action happens really close to the 50-period exponential moving average in the four-hour chart (4H50EMA), which is an important indicator for the cryptocurrency. Whether a bottom will form at these levels is yet to be seen, but crypto whales and institutions apparently believe this will be the case.

The crypto market is buzzing as investors notice that Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price are showing weakness while a new project called Remittix is stealing the spotlight. With over $21.6 million already raised from more than 623 million tokens sold at $0.0987, Remittix is drawing serious attention. Traders are asking the question: are SHIB and DOGE slipping because capital is rotating into what could be the next big altcoin breakout?

Shiba Inu has long been a crowd favorite, but its chart suggests hesitation. Trading around $0.00001250 currently, SHIB has developed a Cup and Handle pattern that can accelerate to $0.0000239 in case the resistance at $0.00001710 is breached. The average daily trading volume increased by 118 percent to $361 million signaling that there are still buyers out there.

However, not everything is bullish. The $0.0000103 support level is weak, and any fall below this value will negate the bullish case. According to analysts, whale wallets have been dispensing rather than hoarding tokens, which is a burden to long-term growth. While optimism remains in pockets of the community, some holders are already diversifying into Remittix, which promises more than speculative rallies.

The Dogecoin price is also facing turbulence, consolidating around $0.22 and testing the crucial $0.20 support. Technical charts show a symmetrical triangle forming, with $0.25 as the ceiling that must be broken for DOGE to rally higher. Failure to do so could push the token down to $0.19 or even $0.17.

Futures data highlights increasing risk. Open interest in DOGE contracts dropped 5 percent to $3.26 billion, while $19 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours. This sharp decline reflects weak conviction among traders. Despite Dogecoin's resilience as a top meme coin, investor capital is clearly rotating toward alternatives offering real-world utility, with Remittix emerging as the standout choice.



While Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price wobble, Remittix has become the headline story in crypto. Raising over $21.6 million already, the project is being hailed as one of the strongest ICOs of 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is building real utility, enabling cross-border payments and providing a mobile-first experience. This has positioned it as more than just hype, it's a working PayFi solution that institutions and individuals can both use.

These drivers explain why many investors believe Remittix could deliver 100x returns, similar to Shiba Inu in its early days, while also offering real-world use cases that DOGE never achieved.



The story unfolding here is about market rotation. As traders grow cautious about the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu's ability to sustain momentum, Remittix is emerging as the alternative with substance. By combining viral growth with genuine utility, it has managed to attract not just retail speculation but also early institutional curiosity. If this continues, it could set a new standard for how PayFi tokens dominate the next cycle.

Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) demonstrated resilience during the last 24 hours, staging a rally that lifted the token nearly 3% to $5.13. 

The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. This accumulation phase marked the turning point, as buying pressure mounted through the early session.

Momentum built steadily before culminating in a decisive breakout late in the period. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend.

Cryptocurrencies such as ICP appear to be drawing fresh interest as alternative asset classes gain traction. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based on Fibonacci extension levels.

As bitcoin BTC$112,543.94 bulls aim to reestablish an upward price trajectory, they may face resistance from sellers near the $113,600 level, according to on-chain data.

BTC has already bounced to $112,800 from sub-$108,800 levels hit Tuesday, CoinDesk data show. The bounce is likely fueled by a fresh all-time high in the S&P 500 and a better-than-expected earnings report by Nvidia, one of the largest publicly listed companies in the world by market value and a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence.

The path ahead may prove challenging, as investors holding at a loss may look to sell into any price rebound.

"Currently, bitcoin trades beneath the cost basis of both the 1-month ($115.6k) and 3-month ($113.6k) cohorts, leaving these investors under stress. Any relief rally is therefore likely to encounter resistance, as short-term holders seek to exit at breakeven," analytics firm Glassnode said in a report published Wednesday.

Glassnode's cost basis metric reveals the average purchase prices at which digital assets have been acquired by wallets with varying holding durations. For example, the three-month cost basis of $113,600 indicates that investors holding assets purchased within the past three months paid, on average, this price level.

As of now, the spot market flows suggest an uphill battle for the bulls ahead, while ETF and corporate activity suggest otherwise.

"Spot demand remains neutral, as perpetuals tilt bearish with CVD negative. The current funding rate of ~0.01% points to a fragile neutrality. If price breaks above $112.4K with volume, it opens the pathway to $114K – $116K," Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN.

That said, ETF inflows and corporate adoption of BTC continues to suck out significant supply from the market, offering a bullish hope, Misir explained. 

"ETF flows continue to strengthen with $81 million for Bitcoin ETFs and $307 million for Ether ETFs over the past day. ETFs, corporates, and governments are now absorbing ~3,600 BTC/day, which translates to ~4x miner issuance. Metaplanet announced a new plan to raise $881 million to buy $837 million BTC in Sep–Oct, adding to its 18,991 BTC," he noted. 

Should BTC turn lower, then $107,000 is the key support level to watch.

That's because analysis by Glassnode shows that the six-month cost basis is at that level. So, a break lower would prompt these holdings to sell, potentially causing a more profound decline.

"The 6-month cost basis sits near ~$107k. A sustained move below this level risks triggering fear, which could accelerate downside momentum," Glassnode said.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 28th, 2025, Chainwire

The ECM Blockchain has set a new milestone as the first blockchain project initiated by Bangladeshi entrepreneur Tanvirul Islam Prince with global reach. Often described as Bangladesh's 1st blockchain initiative on a global scale, ECM Blockchain is being developed as a next-generation distributed ledger network designed to deliver fast, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure for real-world applications. Unlike many pilot initiatives in the country, ECM Blockchain is preparing for a full mainnet launch in Q4 2025, supported by an ecosystem of live projects already in place.

Bangladesh's Growing Role in the Global Tech Industry

Bangladesh has steadily built a reputation as a source of dynamic digital and technological talent. Over the past decade, the country has become one of the fastest-growing IT outsourcing hubs, with thousands of skilled developers, engineers, and digital professionals contributing to projects worldwide. Its young, tech-savvy population has embraced areas such as software development, fintech solutions, mobile applications, and digital entrepreneurship, earning recognition on the global stage.

Bangladesh has also seen several blockchain-related initiatives in recent years:
		



While these reflect Bangladesh's interest in blockchain, they have largely been pilot projects, academic programs, or localized applications. None have yet positioned Bangladesh as a global player in blockchain technology.

The ECM Blockchain marks a turning point - standing as the first blockchain project from a Bangladeshi founder with true global reach, already deploying live projects and preparing to launch a full-scale blockchain network.

How ECM Blockchain Can Benefit Bangladesh

Though ECM Blockchain is designed as a global network, it also holds significant potential benefits for Bangladesh:

This positions ECM Blockchain not only as a global innovation but also as an enabler of Bangladesh's digital transformation journey.
		



An Ecosystem With Global Intent

The ECM Blockchain is represented in the global blockchain industry through the ECM Ecosystem, a suite of interconnected projects that showcase its real-world utility. This ecosystem demonstrates how a Bangladeshi-founded blockchain can scale globally by powering diverse applications across finance, commerce, and digital innovation.

The ECM Ecosystem already includes live and operational projects, which prove the project's delivery capability even before the blockchain mainnet launch:

In addition, several upcoming projects are positioned to expand ECM's global reach:

All of these projects are designed to run on or integrate with the ECM Blockchain mainnet, scheduled for launch in Q4 2025. This combination of live applications and future projects positions ECM as one of the first blockchain networks from Bangladesh to demonstrate adoption and readiness on a global stage.
		



Supporting the ecosystem's development, BlockVerse Solutions, a Bangladeshi-founded technology company headquartered in Dubai, provides the core technical support for ECM Blockchain - ensuring the network's growth is backed by both local expertise and global infrastructure.

Security and Transparency

The ECM Blockchain is being developed with a focus on transparency, scalability, and security. Independent audits, milestone-based releases, and a robust consensus mechanism will ensure trust for enterprises, developers, and users. Its architecture is designed to support high transaction throughput, low latency, and reliable performance, making it suitable for applications ranging from e-commerce to supply chain and financial services.

ECM Coin and ICO

The ECM Coin will serve as the utility token for the ECM Blockchain and its ecosystem. The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is currently live, with 48 million tokens available at $1.20 each out of a total supply of 200 million ECM.
		



Proceeds will be directed toward the development of the ECM Blockchain, ecosystem expansion, and integrations across industries.

As cryptocurrency trading and ICOs are not permitted under current Bangladeshi regulations, the ECM ICO is being conducted internationally only, targeting global investors and markets outside Bangladesh.

Full ICO details, including tokenomics and roadmap, are available at ecmcoin.com. Investors can participate directly through mycoinpoll.com.

The ECM ICO is live now.

About ECM Blockchain




The ECM Blockchain is Bangladesh's first blockchain project with global reach, developed with technical support from BlockVerse Solutions (Dubai HQ). Built as a Layer-2 (L2) based chain, it is designed to deliver low-cost and faster transactions, making it highly efficient for real-world applications. The blockchain powers an ecosystem of projects including MyCoinPoll, bCoinMart, AndroMarkets, CryptoCoinEarning, and Androverse, with a mainnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025.

Tokyo, Japan, August 28, 2025 — Pulse, the world's first 100% decentralized AA Wallet with Minimal Keystore Rollup, successfully hosted its side event at WebX Tokyo 2025, Asia's largest global conference focused on web3 technologies, blockchain, and crypto assets, on August 25th. The gathering took place at a private venue beside Tokyo Tower, where guests experienced a blend of Japanese cultural elements and Web3 innovation.

The event welcomed builders, creators, and community leaders for an evening of networking and product engagement. Its highlight was the Pulse Tag NFT Avatar campaign, which enabled attendees to generate personalized AI-powered avatars. More than 2,000 avatars were created during the campaign, many of which quickly spread across social platforms. Drawing inspiration from collectible card formats, the initiative resonated strongly with Japanese users and generated viral attention across Web3 and AI communities. Pulse also introduced community reward activities designed to deepen engagement and foster stronger connections between key opinion leaders and their audiences. Attendees described the gathering as one of the most Web3-native experiences of WebX Tokyo.

Abel Sohajda, Head of Pulse, commented:

The event underscored Pulse's commitment to delivering meaningful user experiences that combine cultural relevance with cutting-edge technology. Building on the success in Tokyo, Pulse plans to expand its presence across Asia through similar activations, deepen localization efforts in Japan, and strengthen long-term community and ecosystem partnerships.

Pulse is the world's first ZKP-based Account Abstraction wallet that implements minimal keystore rollup technology, which is designed to maximize security and privacy. By combining social interaction with advanced trading features, Pulse builds the ultimate gateway between the real world and Web3.

In-depth analysis uncovers the secrets behind market moves.

- U.S. government publishes GDP data on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, endorsing crypto technology under Trump's administration.

- The initiative adds blockchain as a data verification channel without replacing existing methods, led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

- Trump's crypto-friendly policies include dismissing BLS head over data disputes and expanding family-backed crypto ventures like World Liberty Financial.

- Global blockchain adoption grows as crypto industry becomes a political force, with $133M+ spent on pro-crypto election campaigns in 2024.

- Commerce plans to expand blockchain use across government departments, reflecting Lutnick's vision for decentralized data distribution.

The U.S. government began publishing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on public blockchains on Thursday, marking the latest move by the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry.

Officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce stated that this initiative will add a new channel for releasing economic data but will not replace existing methods.

By adopting blockchain technology to host some of its most critical and market-moving economic data, the Department of Commerce is effectively placing a "seal of approval" on the technology. Today, blockchain applications extend far beyond their origins in cryptocurrency and are increasingly used for trading various assets, including money market funds and stocks.

In its initial phase, this U.S. government initiative will cover nine blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The plan involves storing "cryptographic hashes" of the data on these blockchains—essentially a tool to verify data integrity.

Officials from the Department of Commerce mentioned that the administration, led by President Donald Trump, plans to expand the scope of this initiative in the future.

Shift in Government Policy

This policy shift comes just weeks after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that job growth in recent months was significantly lower than previously announced figures. Subsequently, Trump dismissed the head of the BLS and, without providing evidence, suggested political manipulation of the data.

Department of Commerce officials stated that the blockchain initiative is unrelated to the dismissal of the BLS director.

Officials revealed that the driving force behind pushing data onto the blockchain is Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Earlier this year, Lutnick also proposed revising the methodology for calculating GDP to exclude the impact of government spending on the figure. GDP data is published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which operates under the Department of Commerce.

Governments worldwide have been exploring blockchain applications for years: some have used public networks to test central bank digital currencies, while others have considered using the technology for issuing digital credentials.

For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has adopted the Avalanche blockchain—one of the nine blockchains included in the Department of Commerce's data release initiative—to digitize vehicle ownership credentials. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has also explored using the technology to streamline airport security screening processes.

Earlier this year, spurred by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration's "Department of Government Efficiency" also looked into using blockchain to reduce costs and increase government transparency.

The "Crypto President"

Lutnick previewed this change during a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, telling Trump that departmental statistics would begin to be released via blockchain "because you are the 'crypto president.'"

Trump, once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now become a supporter of the industry—during his 2024 campaign, he pledged to reduce regulatory burdens hindering its development.

Upon taking office, he quickly took action to fulfill some of these promises: for instance, the Trump administration has established Bitcoin reserves and accumulated cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana; appointed crypto-friendly agency heads who have terminated enforcement investigations against companies like Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange; and signed a stablecoin regulatory bill—stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value pegged to underlying fiat currencies.

The Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency has also expanded significantly, spanning businesses such as Bitcoin mining and stablecoin issuance. Next week, a cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial, a company backed by the Trump family, will begin trading on centralized exchanges.

This stands in stark contrast to the administration of former President Joe Biden, whose regulatory agencies generally maintained a skeptical stance toward the cryptocurrency industry in recent years.

Cryptocurrency as a Political Force

The U.S. government's adoption of blockchain technology also reflects the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry itself. Years ago, many commercial attempts to deploy blockchain technology failed because they focused on applications using private blockchains—operated by companies that often had policy disagreements, leading to higher costs and greater implementation challenges.

However, under Lutnick's push, the Department of Commerce chose to utilize public blockchains like Ethereum, maintained by computers around the world and updated by volunteer programmers.

Officials stated that cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are all participating in the Department of Commerce's initiative. The Department purchased cryptocurrencies (i.e., "gas fees") required to publish transactions on the blockchain through these exchanges. Kraken and Gemini are planning to go public in the coming months.

The cryptocurrency industry has become a political force to be reckoned with: investors and corporate executives exert influence through well-funded political action committees, similar to how traditional financial industries like banking wield power in Washington.

The industry has provided significant financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and has backed multiple crypto-friendly lawmakers in Congress. According to data analyzed by OpenSecrets, the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase, contributed over $133 million to three super PACs supporting "pro-crypto" candidates in the 2024 election.

Companies like Kraken and Coinbase also donated $1 million each to Trump's inauguration in January.

Lutnick hinted earlier this week that the potential applications of cryptocurrency extend far beyond publishing economic indicators.

During a meeting with Trump and other federal agency leaders on Tuesday, Lutnick said, "We will integrate GDP data into the blockchain to demonstrate its role in data distribution. Subsequently, we will open this capability to all government departments, enabling all of you to adopt this approach."

ust when whales thought they had gobbled up all the TOKEN6900 (T6900) ICO issuance in the nick of time, the team behind the latest ‘Murad coin' has announced a final chance to buy. 

The newly added final stage runs until the token claim goes live next Wednesday, 2pm UTC on 3 September. Even better, the T6900 token stays at the previously advertised presale end price of $0.007125. So far, the presale has raised an incredible $3 million.

It means there are now an additional six days of FOMO ahead before the token is claimable by presale buyers and tradable on exchanges.

If you are looking for belief-driven, community-powered value, in what crypto influencer Murad Mahmudov identifies as the meme-led supercycle for crypto, you might do well to follow the example of one whale who has just ponied up $19k in the T6900 ICO.

Earlier today a whale got in big with the T6900 token, which now has astute traders wondering aloud if famed meme coin booster Murad, credited with taking SPX6900 to escape velocity, is buying too.

Murad is not just a meme coin bull; he is a massive SPX6900 shiller, which accounts for 94.34% of his known crypto wealth. Now market watchers are asking if Murad could be rotating some of that wealth into a rival ‘index' coin, TOKEN6900?

The wallet holding his SPX has been inactive since 24 July 2024. But it is likely that he is using an as-yet-unidentified wallet to make his most recent speculative meme coin trades.

Still, whatever else he is buying, Murad is still very much a SPX6900 believer. He thinks it will eventually reach a market cap of $1 trillion to become “the biggest crypto since bitcoin”, even though he has nominally lost $1.23 million on the coin in the past seven days alone. At one point, his portfolio was valued at more than $70 million – today it is $38 million.

But if SPX6900 is struggling to keep its market cap head above $1 billion, never mind $1 trillion, it could make sense to start allocating to its best-known cousin, TOKEN6900. 

It may be only a matter of time before Murad alerts those among his 740,000 followers on X who don't already know about the ticker T6900.

After all, T6900 takes the same irreverent and satirical approach to the financial markets as SPX6900. And like SPX, T6900 is all about virality and community. 



Murad reckons that utility coins are passé. The future is with no-fundamentals meme coins that can generate zeitgeist real estate by harnessing the power of decentralized networks. 

Meme coins crystallize the otherwise latent or unrealizable values of what used to be called brand power. But now, with social media, brands are easily subverted and undermined by online communities – yes, we're looking at you, Cracker Barrel.

T6900 takes this ethos and runs with it as exit liquidity for late capitalism. T6900 is your elector seat to escape the financial ancients' régime.

Vibe liquidity stands at the center of the T6900 world. This crypto shouts to the market: “Cometh to me, you huddled masses; there is liberty and wealth for those brave enough to seize it. T6900 is your ultimate brain-rot finance for the new American financial revolution.”

There's no AI hype machine or flash website promising to revolutionize legacy industries. Instead, T6900 is the product of the collective hallucinations of terminally online traders.

Suffice to say, T6900 is the ultimate trading vehicle – the dream coin and object of desire of degen traders everywhere. And in an America where the President puts crypto first, you would be a fool to bet against T6900.

Crypto YouTube rising star Borch has told his 92.1k subscribers that T6900 could be in store for 2,000% gains because of its viral potential and leveraging of the SPX6900 mindspace.

Borch does not hold back: “This could be one of the most exciting early opportunities in the crypto space right now. In this video, I'll break down everything you need to know about TOKEN6900, why people are hyped, and how you can get in before the big pump.”

In six days' time, when T6900 claiming and trading go live, there will be some who look back and say, “Why didn't he buy some of that 69 action”, and subsequently live to regret not being the second-coming of Murad.  



Actually, it's not quite true that T6900 has no fundamentals because it does offer staking, allowing token owners who deposit into the staking smart contract to earn 33% per annum rewards. 

That's the sort of passive income that legacy finance can't match in an environment of falling interest rates. Once claiming is live, earned rewards will vest over 30 days.

You can purchase TOKEN6900 on the presale site and start staking today. Alternatively, you can buy T6900 directly from the website or in Best Wallet, which is one of the best crypto and bitcoin wallets. 

Best Wallet was recently awarded WalletConnect certification and can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Finally, Coinsult and SolidProof have audited TOKEN6900's smart contract, and no critical issues have been found.

 The US government announced on Tuesday that it is publishing economic data onchain to boost transparency for government spending. 

The US government has tapped Chainlink and Pyth, two blockchain oracle providers, to publish economic data onchain.

Chainlink was selected to provide data feeds from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and will publish additional data feeds in response to consumer demand or at the behest of the US government, a Chainlink spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

These feeds include real gross domestic product (GDP), personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, and real final sales to private domestic purchasers, the company said.

Pyth was also selected by the Department of Commerce to be a publisher of gross domestic product (GDP) data — the total economic output in a year — according to an announcement Thursday.

Publishing government data onchain is part of the Trump administration's plan to make government spending more transparent in a bid to improve accountability and make the US a “world capital” of crypto.

Bringing government economic data onchain will provide positive benefits to spot crypto markets, a Chainlink spokesperson said.

These include automated trading strategies that execute based on changing government data, real-time prediction markets for macroeconomic developments and risk-management strategies for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Stablecoins, tokenized government bonds, perpetual futures contracts, real-world tokenized assets (RWAs) and other digital financial instruments reliant on macroeconomic inputs also stand to benefit from onchain government economic data.

Proposals to bring public spending data and other macroeconomic figures onchain are currently fomenting in the Philippines, the United Kingdom and El Salvador. 

The price of Pyth (PYTH) surged by nearly 70% on the news, and LINK (LINK) posted modest gains of over 3% before falling back to about $25.

LINK has rallied by about 61% since the start of August, going from a low of about $15.43 per token to the current price level.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, led by Bill Pulte, took an unusual step by reducing the number of Federal Home Loan Bank board director seats at most of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, with the steepest reductions at institutions located in heavily-Democratic cities. 



Efforts under the Trump administration to roll back certain regulations and engage with the industry in less confrontational ways will be an opportunity for banks, but it's unclear just how much benefit they'll see.



A federal jury in Puerto Rico on Tuesday convicted Oluwasegun Baiyewu, 37, of Richmond, Texas, in a money-laundering conspiracy stemming from wide-ranging wire, mail and device fraud schemes that funneled illicit funds to Nigerian transnational organized crime groups through car part auctions.



The European Central Bank is considering a central bank digital currency powered by public blockchain, which would enable EU issuers to compete with U.S.-issued stablecoins. Europe's Central Bank recently released a progress report on a pending CBDC, saying more than 70 organizations are testing payment use cases, and ways to integrate a digital euro with mainstream payment systems.

Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. His work has appeared in...

A new “WEB3” token presale has come under heavy scrutiny after blockchain investigator ZachXBT warned that the project may be tied to individuals behind some of the most notorious scams in the NFT space, including the failed Squiggles collection and alleged scammer “Raichu.”

The project, called WEB3, announced its token presale this week through its official X account. The post instructed users to send SOL to a specified wallet address in exchange for $WEB3 tokens, which would later be airdropped to contributors. 

According to the announcement, the WEB3 price will be determined by the amount of SOL raised divided by the total supply. The team also noted that the presale could end at any time and emphasized that participants should not send funds from exchange wallets.

Reportedly, the project raised $500k in 3 hours, and it has less than 12 hours left. 

While the project framed the offering as a step toward fairness and transparency, ZachXBT quickly raised concerns. “Community alert: @web3 is linked to a team member of the Squiggles NFT rug and Raichu, who I previously posted about,” he wrote on X.

The alarm comes amid resurfacing evidence of the Squiggles scandal in early 2022, when the project drew more than 230,000 Twitter followers and over 360,000 Discord members ahead of a highly anticipated NFT drop.

Investigations at the time by YouTuber Coffeezilla and others suggested the collection's founders were frontmen for a group of serial scammers known as “NFT Factory LA.” The group was linked to multiple failed projects, including League of Sacred Devils, Lucky Buddhas, and Sinful Souls.

Coffeezilla's reporting revealed that Squiggles' team allegedly manipulated sales volume using “shadow wallets” to create the appearance of demand. 

A single account reportedly spent over 800 ETH, more than $2 million, across hundreds of wallets that each purchased three Squiggles NFTs before relisting them on secondary markets. 

Hours after the drop, OpenSea delisted the collection, effectively ending the scheme before it could reach its full $20 million target.

The same network of individuals has been tied to Raichu, also known as Ryan, a promoter who connected NFT projects with celebrities and influencers. 

1/ Ever wonder who connected projects with the celebrities and influencers that promote crypto scams? Here's a breakdown on one of the people doing it known as Raichu (Ryan). pic.twitter.com/uzrEZ1pAvX

ZachXBT documented Raichu's role in several rug pulls, including Baller Ape Club, which raised $2.6 million before its founder was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, and Crazy Lemur Club, which disappeared with $320,000. 

He also linked Raichu to Ancient Cats Club, which allegedly stole $1.7 million, before its team moved on to launch other scams like Bored Bunny and Rich Dwarves Tribe.

In light of this, WEB3's presale announcement has sparked skepticism. The project itself acknowledged in a statement that it anticipated controversy, referencing comparisons to previous hype-driven launches like $YZY, $Libra, and other tokens.

The team claimed it had initially pursued a private fundraising round involving prominent investors but later refunded those contributions, insisting it wanted to “level the playing field” through a public presale.

“When building @web3, we knew what the broader Crypto Twitter community would say about us,” the team wrote. “Our mission is to let the people thrive, build with core DeFi principles, and create a culture that can sustain anything. It's time to believe in something again.”

Despite the reassurances, ZachXBT's warning has amplified doubts, especially given the project's links to figures previously accused of orchestrating multimillion-dollar rug pulls. 

While WEB3 positions itself as an attempt to “Make Crypto Fair Again,” critics argue that the involvement of known actors from past scams raises serious red flags.

At press time, the WEB3 presale remains active, though questions about its legitimacy continue to grow across social platforms.

The project is calling the claims “FUD” and outlining steps it says prove legitimacy. In a public statement, the team argued that suggestions the token had launched before were “blatantly false,” urging critics to “check the chain.”

The group also distanced itself from an individual named Arsalan, accused of trying to raise funds in its name. 

Hello all – we are seeing various FUD in our comment section and thought we should take some time to address it. We understand that the public presale process is unorthodox, so bare with us as we push through here.1. There are claims that this token has been launched before,…

According to the statement, the team terminated the associated member, refunded the “extremely small” amount collected, and later returned the entirety of its private sale funds. 

The project insisted its founders had privately doxxed and described its goal as building “the largest index / media outlet in all of crypto.”

The dispute comes against a backdrop of rising crypto crime. PeckShield data shows hackers stole $142 million in July 2025, up 27% from June. India's CoinDCX lost $44.2 million in an insider-assisted attack, while DeFi protocol GMX suffered a $42 million exploit before negotiating a white-hat recovery.

In total, $2.2 billion vanished in the first half of the year across 344 incidents, with wallet hacks accounting for $1.7 billion and phishing scams another $410 million.

ZachXBT himself has tracked several high-profile frauds. In June, he unmasked New Yorker Christian Nieves, who posed as Coinbase support staff to steal $4 million from users before gambling the funds away.

🕵 ZachXBT exposes 5 North Korean workers running 30+ fake identities to target crypto projects as anonymous source compromises DPRK IT worker devices, revealing $680K Favrr exploit.#NorthKorea #Lazarushttps://t.co/ZmPCIZmVpW

More recently, on Aug. 13, he exposed a ring of five North Korean IT operatives who allegedly forged identities to secure developer jobs at crypto projects. Breached device data revealed fake IDs, Upwork and LinkedIn accounts, and stolen credentials.

The latest presale controversy shows how even high-profile projects remain vulnerable to reputational damage amid a widening climate of crypto fraud.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Another stablecoin startup has raised serious cash. M0, a company that develops stablecoin infrastructure, announced Thursday that it had raised $40 million in a funding round led by the crypto venture capital firm Polychain and the fintech investor Ribbit Capital. 

Other participants included the Endeavor Catalyst fund and existing investors like Pantera and Bain Capital Crypto. Luca Prosperi, cofounder and CEO of M0, declined to specify his startup's valuation. The Series B round was for equity and locked stashes of the startup's cryptocurrency, or tokens that can only be sold after a set time period. M0 has raised almost $100 million in capital so far.





“We cannot have 1,000 different Tethers and Circles,” Prosperi told Fortune, referring to the two largest issuers of stablecoins. “So what we did is create a layer where different issuers can come and connect and just ensure interoperability, liquidity among themselves.”





M0 is the latest startup to rake in funding from venture capitalists hungry for exposure to one of the buzziest sectors in crypto. 





Over the past year, the once niche asset, which is a cryptocurrency pegged to underlying holdings like the U.S. dollar, has become one of the shiniest objects in Silicon Valley. In June, Circle, the second largest stablecoin issuer next to Tether, went public in a blockbuster IPO that netted the company a market capitalization of now just over $30 billion. And in July, President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law, a bill that regulates and defines rules for the burgeoning stablecoin industry. 




The buzz has become so loud that Big Tech companies like Meta and Airbnb as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their businesses.





“Stablecoins are proliferating,” Josh Rosenthal, a general partner at Polychain, told Fortune. “This is one of the hotter areas within the market—within all of fintech, frankly,”





Proponents hope that the tokens will become the base layer of financial infrastructure and usher in cheaper, faster payments than bank wires or the international transfer system SWIFT. 





That ambition is partly why Prosperi called his startup, which aims to build what he calls the “layer zero of money,” M0. (That's not to mention that anything to the power of zero is one—just like the dollar value of one stablecoin, he said.)





A longtime finance industry veteran who worked at Morgan Stanley, among other institutions, Prosperi took a deep dive into stablecoins when he started advising MakerDAO, a project that issues a stablecoin controlled by a group of crypto investors, rather than a single entity. (Maker has since rebranded to Sky.)




In 2023, he teamed up with his cofounder Gregory Di Prisco, who also worked at MakerDAO, to launch M0. Their startup develops technology lower on the stablecoin tech stack than, say, the stablecoin company Bridge, which was recently acquired by Stripe.





M0 is building a network on which stablecoin issuers can deploy their tokens and not worry about the nitty gritty software decisions that go into transferring assets across blockchains like Ethereum or Solana or changing, say, Circle's token into PayPal's.  





For the time being, Prosperi isn't focused on making his company profitable. Just like Uber, which first expanded its operations across the U.S. before it paid attention to revenue, M0 aims to onboard as many stablecoin issuers onto its network as possible. That includes the crypto wallet MetaMask, which recently announced the launch of its stablecoin in partnership with M0.





“My mandate as a CEO in the next two to five years is to scale this network as much as possible,” said Prosperi. “This is the obsession.”

What is the best crypto narrative of 2025? While mainstream attention focuses on established players, several overlooked sectors are quietly gaining momentum. Real-world asset tokenization projects, emerging layer 1 platforms, and select meme coins are beginning to capture serious investor interest. These under-the-radar opportunities may hold the key to surprising growth stories in the months ahead. This article explores why these asset classes could become standout performers in the next market cycle.

LINK floated between $23.52 and $28 this week, inching up 3.93% while staying above its 10-day average of $24.34. Buyers kept nudging the token higher, but the bid keeps stalling two dollars under the 30 ceiling. The 56 RSI and a mild MACD uptick hint that bulls still have energy, though no one is ready to chase at any cost.

Zoom out one month and the picture looks brighter. LINK has added 27.55% in 30 days and 61.95% in six months, soundly beating most large-cap rivals. The 100-day average sits at $24.82, almost level with the shorter trend line, so momentum is steady rather than overheated. Volume spikes have been modest, suggesting the move is driven by gradual accumulation instead of frantic hype.

If momentum holds, a clean break above $28 puts $30 in play. A push through that mark would open a path to $35, about 25%-35% above today's midpoint. Failure to clear $28 could send LINK back to $21.21, roughly a 15% slide, with a deeper dip toward $16.73 wiping out about 35%. Right now the bias leans upward thanks to recent gains and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, but traders need to see a daily close over $30 to confirm the next leg higher.

HBAR trades in a narrow $0.23-$0.26 band after a 4.90% weekly lift that trimmed part of last month's 16.70% slide. Even with that short-term dip, the token still shows a 21.40% gain over the past six months, keeping it above both its 10-day and 100-day simple averages at $0.24.

Momentum looks steady. RSI sits at 57, Stochastic at 69, and MACD edges above zero, all hinting at mild buying drive rather than overheated action. The nearest ceiling is $0.27; clearing it could open a sprint to the next barrier at $0.31, roughly 15%-20% above the current upper band. Support rests at $0.21, then $0.18. A slip to the first floor would shave about 12% from the current midpoint, while a drop to $0.18 would erase around 30% of recent gains.

Given the modest upward bias, a break toward $0.27 looks more probable than a plunge to $0.21. If buying volume grows, HBAR could test $0.31 within weeks, adding up to 20%. Failure to hold the $0.24 average would flip sentiment and drag the coin back to the $0.21 line, slicing near 15%. Traders watch that balance as the next move takes shape.

The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.

The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.

XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.



XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”

Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it's working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.

Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.

Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends

Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.

One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that's just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse's commitment to expanding its utility. It's a big move that gives the community something to actually use.

As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.

With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won't last forever—so if you're interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.

 

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity

SOL has sprinted 19.16% in the last 7 days and 11.33% in the past month. Stretch the lens to 6 months and the gain grows to 52.48%. The coin now shifts between $183.88 and $220.07, well above its 10-day average of $206 and its 100-day average of $200.09. Momentum is hot, but the pace is starting to look stretched.

Traders eye $234 as the next ceiling. If buyers clear that line, the chart opens toward $270.32, about 24% higher than the top of today's band. The main floor sits at $161.75; a slip there would point to $125.56, roughly 32% under the high side of the current range. Strength gauges back up the bullish case, yet both the 74.67 RSI and 94.62 Stochastic hint at overbought conditions.

The recent record says buyers keep winning, so an advance to $234 looks doable. A clean break could lift SOL another 15-25% in the short run. Still, the crowded long side could spark a quick shakeout toward $162, a dip of around 12%. Net take: trend up, but expect a breather before the next jump.

Ethereum pushed higher again. The coin trades between $4245 and $5136 after jumping 13.92% in the past week and 19.87% over the month. It sits near its 10-day and 100-day averages around $4620, showing the rally still has a base. Six-month gains now stand at 101.15%.

Market signals stay friendly. The strength index reads 59.86, in the safe zone. The fast oscillator is high at 85.31, flagging strong demand, while momentum adds 24.52. If buyers stay active, the first barrier sits at $5492.31. A clean break there points to $6383, about 30% above the current band.

Support rests at $3710.13 and deeper at $2819.04. A dip to the first floor would shave roughly 20%; the second would cut near 40%. Given fresh double-digit gains and positive momentum, the path of least resistance is up. A push toward $5500 looks likely, and a sprint to $6400 cannot be ruled out once the market catches its breath.

LINK, HBAR, SOL, and ETH offer solid upside in the ongoing 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) couples sports passion with meme energy, eyeing 20,000% gains through a community-led, media-backed roadmap.

Oops, something went wrong

For a lot of people, cryptocurrency still feels like the Wild West of banking. It's relatively new, hard to understand and challenging to learn which types of digital coins are worth investing in. While most people have at least heard of bitcoin, other coins exist, too. Are they worth your money?

Dubbed “altcoins,” I asked ChatGPT to explain a bit about these wily little digital coins and which ones are worth investing in. Here's what it said.

I confess, I wasn't clear on the nature of an altcoin, so the AI clarified for me that it's basically “any cryptocurrency that isn't bitcoin.” Uncreatively, the name comes from “alternative” + “coin.” Some people exclude Ethereum from the category because it's so big, but technically, Ethereum is an altcoin too.

While bitcoin was designed mainly as digital money and a store of value, ChatGPT told me “altcoins explore all sorts of other uses.”

For example:

Ethereum (ETH): Runs smart contracts and decentralized apps.

Ripple/XRP: Focuses on fast, cheap cross-border payments.

Cardano (ADA): Aims to be eco-friendly and research-driven.

Solana (SOL): Offers super-fast and low-cost transactions.

Meme coins (like Dogecoin): Started as jokes but gained popularity.

The examples above already show how altcoins serve a wide range of purposes. ChatGPT explained that most of them were created “to improve on bitcoin's limitations,” be that speed, energy use or programming issues, or “offer completely new functions in finance, gaming, NFTs and more.”

While some of them offer real utility, others are highly speculative, and you definitely don't want to blindly invest in them.

ChatGPT warned that for the average American worker, “balancing safety and upside is key.” You can expect bigger, more established altcoins to offer more stability, whereas newer projects can yield explosive gains — or total losses.

In the realm of the more stable and established picks, ChatGPT offered the following three choices based on insights from Barron's and Crypto Economy.

Ethereum (ETH): The AI suggested that Ethereum is among the most stable altcoins. “Think of Ethereum as the main ‘operating system' for most crypto apps,” it said. A lot of digital contracts and new kinds of online finance run on Ethereum. Thus, “big investors are pouring money in, and some experts think it could climb toward $7,000 this year,” the AI said.

Solana (SOL): Solana is an altcoin that's known for being “lightning-fast and cheap to use,” ChatGPT said, able to process thousands of transactions per second at very low cost, making it practical for things like payments, digital art (NFTs) and other online projects. “Large investors are quietly buying in, which suggests confidence in its future,” the AI said.

Ripple (XRP): XRP is often interchangeably referred to as Ripple, the company that makes it, and is designed for “quick, low-cost money transfers across borders–like sending dollars to Europe in seconds,” the AI said. Though it had some legal battles, they are now settled, giving people more optimism in its staying power.

A couple others that may be on a growth path include TRON (TRX) and Cardano (ADA).

You don't have to take ChatGPT's word for it, however, you can do your own due diligence by:

Looking at market capitalization (the total value of the coin): Bigger = generally more stable.

Sticking to the top projects (Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, etc.): These have survived multiple market cycles.

Noting red flags: Avoid tiny “penny” coins with huge promises but no track record.

Find out what the altcoin you're interested in really does, ChatGPT suggested. For instance, does it solve a real-world problem (faster payments, smart contracts, gaming) or is it just hype (like meme coins)?

“The more use cases and adoption, the more likely it is to hold value long-term,” the AI said.

Also look into the team and company behind it. Do they have a solid track record, an active developer community that is continually working to improve it and transparency? If not, be wary.

Before you invest, make sure that you can easily buy and sell it on major exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken. “If it's only on obscure exchanges, that's a risk,” the AI warned. The higher the liquidity, the less chance of getting “stuck” with a coin you can't sell.

Most of all, don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) drive you, ChatGPT warned. “Just because it's trending on TikTok doesn't mean it's safe.”

Moreover, if the returns sound too good to be true, trust that instinct. And never invest money you need for essentials like rent or emergency funds into crypto.

A Sioux Falls hedge fund accused of bilking millions from investors in a cryptocurrency scheme is the subject of a multi-state criminal investigation being led by the FBI.

And earlier this month a federal judge presiding over an open civil case against Benaiah Holdings — and its principal officers, Benjamin Wiener and Christopher Hmielewski — froze the company's assets after finding merit in allegations it committed fraud with the allure of digital currency.

“The court has reviewed the facts and information provided to it and has determined that plaintiff has presented evidence of a potential fraud, that there is imminent danger of further dissipation of assets, and that Benjamin Wiener (“Wiener”) engaged in deceptive and misleading statements,” Federal District Court Judge Camela Theeler wrote in an Aug. 15 ruling that ordered the confiscation of Benaiah's assets.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- XRP nears $4 resistance, driven by Fibonacci levels and institutional momentum, with potential to reach $20.

- SEC's 2025 ruling and ETF approvals could unlock $8.4B in capital, boosting liquidity and adoption.

- Real-world use in cross-border payments and CBDC integration strengthens XRP's utility-driven demand.

The cryptocurrency market has long been a theater of volatility, but XRP's trajectory in 2025 suggests a unique confluence of technical, institutional, and utility-driven forces. As the token approaches the $4 resistance level—a critical Fibonacci threshold—investors must weigh the interplay of technical breakouts, regulatory clarity, and real-world adoption to assess its potential to scale toward $20.  

XRP's price action in 2025 has been shaped by Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, which analysts like EGRAG Crypto and Captain Redbeard have meticulously mapped. The token is currently retracing toward the 0.618 Fibonacci level (~$2.90), a golden ratio often signaling a pivot point for bullish continuation. If XRP holds above this level, it could retest $4.67 by late November 2025, a target derived from the 1.272 extension.  

Beyond $4, the 1.618 extension (~$8) and 2.618 extension (~$13.56) represent intermediate and long-term targets. EGRAG Crypto's ambitious projection of $27.17 hinges on XRP surpassing its 2021 all-time high of $3.31, a level it has already exceeded. The $4 resistance, therefore, is not an endpoint but a gateway to higher-order momentum.  

The institutionalization of XRP has accelerated since the U.S. SEC's August 2025 resolution, which affirmed XRP's non-security status in secondary markets. This regulatory clarity has unlocked $7.1 billion in liquidity, with Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) now used by over 300 financial institutions. CME Group's XRP futures, with open interest exceeding $9.02 billion, reflect robust institutional positioning.  

The potential approval of XRP ETFs by October 2025 could inject $8.4 billion in capital, mirroring Bitcoin's ETF-driven rally. ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) is a leading candidate, with a 95% approval probability. Such inflows would amplify XRP's liquidity and price discovery, particularly as macroeconomic tailwinds—such as inflation-linked demand for alternative assets—persist.  

XRP's value proposition extends beyond speculative trading. Ripple's ODL has become a cornerstone for institutions like Santander, SBI Holdings, and Standard Chartered, enabling real-time cross-border payments with 70% lower costs than traditional systems. Santander's Q3 2024 report highlighted $2.5 billion in ODL transactions, underscoring XRP's role as a bridge asset.  

Emerging markets are pivotal to XRP's adoption. In Africa, Ripple's partnership with Onafriq has expanded remittance corridors across 27 countries, while SBI Holdings' integration in Asia has streamlined high-frequency payments. These use cases position XRP as a solution to systemic inefficiencies, not merely a speculative token.  

Moreover, XRP's compatibility with ISO 20022 standards and its potential as a CBDC intermediary suggest a future where it facilitates seamless fiat-digital currency conversions. This utility-driven narrative strengthens its case for sustained demand.  

Despite the bullish thesis, risks remain. A breakout above $4 could trigger profit-taking corrections, particularly if short-term traders capitalize on momentum. Additionally, while the SEC case is resolved, regulatory scrutiny in other jurisdictions—such as the EU's MiCA framework—could introduce friction.  

Technical indicators like the TD Sequential “buy” signal and whale accumulation (300 million XRP in August 2025) suggest resilience, but investors must remain vigilant. A retest of the $2.90 support level could test conviction, though institutional buying power may stabilize the token.  

For investors, the case for XRP hinges on three pillars:1. Technical Validation: A clean break above $3.12 and $4.67 would confirm the bullish structure, with $8 as a near-term target.2. Institutional Inflows: ETF approvals and futures growth could drive liquidity, reducing volatility and attracting long-term capital.3. Utility Expansion: Cross-border payment adoption and CBDC integration provide a flywheel of demand, insulating XRP from speculative cycles.  

Given these factors, accumulating XRP at key Fibonacci levels—particularly below $2.90—offers a compelling risk-reward profile. A breakout above $4 could catalyze a parabolic move toward $20, especially if macroeconomic conditions favor alternative assets.  

In conclusion, XRP's path to $20 is not a speculative leap but a calculated convergence of technical, institutional, and utility-driven forces. For those with a medium-term horizon, the token's regulatory clarity, real-world adoption, and Fibonacci-driven momentum present a rare opportunity to participate in a digital asset poised to redefine global finance.

Coinbase's Layer-2 blockchain Base has taken a big leap in the NFT market, securing the third spot in global 30-day NFT trading volume.

Over the last month, Base recorded $47.67 million in NFT trading volume, completing a 70% surge that pushed it past competitors like Immutable zkEVM and Solana, which now rank fourth and fifth, respectively.

The surge was largely driven by collections like Get Based, DX Terminal, and Based Style, which together accounted for nearly $25 million in volume. Beyond NFTs, Base has also become one of the busiest ecosystems overall: in the past 30 days, the network processed 27 million transactions and more than $16 billion in dApp volume.

Despite Base's momentum, Ethereum remains the NFT market leader, logging $408 million in trading volume in the same period. Blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, Moonbirds, BAYC, and Lil Pudgys generated over $200 million in combined activity. However, this dominance comes against a backdrop of declining floor prices. 

Polygon continues to hold second place with $62.29 million in 30-day NFT volume, up 15% on the month. Interestingly, most of this growth came from Courtyard NFTs, a project tokenizing real-world assets like trading cards, which alone contributed $57.65 million, up 21%.

The competition among Ethereum, Polygon, and Base underscores the shifting dynamics of NFT adoption. With Base rapidly climbing the ranks and diversifying its ecosystem activity, analysts suggest it could continue to eat into Solana and Immutable's market share if growth remains steady.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Philippine Senator Bam Aquino said he intends to soon propose a bill seeking to place the country's national budget on a blockchain platform, local media reported.

During his appearance at the Manila Tech Summit on Wednesday, Aquino said he plans to file a bill in the next couple of weeks proposing to place government budgeting and transactions to a blockchain-based system for greater openness, local business news website BusinessWorld reported.

"No one is crazy enough to put their transactions on blockchain, where every single step of the way will be logged and transparent to every single citizen. But we want to start,” Aquino said at the conference, according to a report from local TV news channel Bilyonaryo.

In a separate Facebook post, Aquino noted that he talked about innovations at the conference, such as "blockchain-based budgeting to make every peso transparent and accountable."

"If we're able to do this, I think we'll be the first country to have our budget on the blockchain. Of course, I don't know what kind of support I will get," Aquino added.

The Block has reached out to Aquino's office for further information.

Aquino's remarks came after the Department of Budget and Management launched a blockchain-based document validation system on Polygon last month. At the time, Undersecretary Maria Francesca Del Rosario said the system could help combat AI deepfakes and prevent bad actors from falsifying government documents. It's unclear if Aquino's planned measure would be linked to the initiative.

Governments worldwide are exploring blockchain applications for public sector operations. On Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the department will begin publishing economic statistics on the blockchain, starting with GDP figures.

Meanwhile, Philippine Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte has proposed a bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, aiming to accumulate a total of 10,000 BTC over five years.

Bitcoin rebounds to $117K before cooling; Ethereum hits $4,900 as altcoin season signals emerge with BTC dominance slipping to 57%.

Analyst picks Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, Sui, Tron, and Injective as top long-term altcoin plays amid capital rotation from Bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency market has had a turbulent week, swinging between sharp pullbacks and brief rallies. After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday, Bitcoin staged a dramatic rebound, jumping from $110,000 to nearly $117,000 within hours. Ethereum also stole headlines by hitting a fresh all-time high at $4,900. But as quickly as momentum arrived, the market has cooled again, leaving traders trying to read the next move.

One development stands out: Bitcoin dominance is slipping. Currently hovering around 57%, this decline shows capital rotating into altcoins. The pattern is similar to earlier bull market cycles, where Bitcoin rallies first, stalls, and then altcoins take the stage. 

Historically, August has been a slow month for crypto markets. In 2021, momentum didn't return until late September.

The fall in Bitcoin dominance, combined with Ethereum's breakout, hints that altcoins may be on the verge of their own season. If history repeats, the next few weeks could see liquidity pour into a wider set of projects.

In a recent interview with Coinpedia, market analyst Lennaert Snyder outlined where he sees the greatest long-term opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. His focus is on Layer-1 blockchains with thriving ecosystems and Ethereum Layer-2 networks that enhance scalability.

He said that Arbitrum and Optimism are the two Ethereum Layer-2s poised for lasting success, with Arbitrum being his top pick thanks to its developer activity and adoption.

“I also believe ETH L2s will continue to play a major role in scaling Ethereum. That's why I see Arbitrum and Optimism as strong long-term plays, with ARB as my favorite,” he said.

On the Layer-1 side, Snyder pointed to Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), Tron (TRX), and Injective (INJ) as projects with solid fundamentals. Each, he argued, brings unique strengths, particularly in DeFi and stablecoin markets, making them stand out for long-term accumulation.

The e-rupee is already tiring. What does the US' pro-stablecoin stance mean for the RBI's pet crypto project?

 A weekly newsletter about how finance is getting supercharged by tech in India, and how you can make money work for you Subscribe here


 Good morning [%first_name |Dear Reader%], 

You are reading our subscriber-only newsletter Ka-Ching!—a weekly commentary on fintech and personal finance 

Enter your email address to receive a daily curation of our latest newsletters, stories, and podcasts. 

When was the last time you paid in e-rupees? 
Wait, let me amend that. When have you ever paid in e-rupees? 
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) pet CBDC—or central bank digital currency—has always been a rare beast on the ground, regardless of the fact that it was first launched as early as 2022. As of March 2025, India was purportedly running the world's second-largest CBDC pilot (after China), with around Rs 1,000 crore of e-rupees in circulation ($122 million)—a 334% jump from the previous year. But that, and the 5 million total users it has, are minuscule in the context of India's 1.4 billion population. Less, if you account for the fact that active users number only 400,000. 
About 17 banks and fintechs have so far launched e-rupee wallets for their users, but the enthusiasm seems to be fading before even the first leg is done. For instance, several users told The Ken that digital-rupee wallets on Cred, one of the fintechs that launched them, have now disappeared from the app. 
I can understand why few people have been interested in exploring the e-rupee. Why use them when you can transfer regular rupees from bank account to bank account just as easily, through UPI or bank apps or other wallets? Why keep track of all these different (albeit colourful) denominations?

Tim Draper, an American billionaire and venture capitalist who is one of the bigger crypto sector investors in the world, with a portfolio of over 50 crypto startups, did not hold back on his disinterest in CBDCs in a recent chat with me. “They are ridiculous,” he said, “China has one, and people hate it, too.” Instead, he touts stablecoins and bitcoins as the route to a great crypto economy. 
Setting aside Draper's own motivations, and interests, he isn't the only one who seems to be thinking along these lines. US President Donald Trump, too, has been openly betting on stablecoins over CBDCs for a while. 
In fact, his GENIUS Act, signed into law in the US in July, puts most global CBDC projects at risk—including India's. 
CBDCs vs Stablecoins

To get down to brass tacks, CBDCs are all issued by central banks, and are intended to serve as blockchain versions of regular currencies and function as legal tender.

I enjoy reading The Ken because it is informative, the articles are well researched, well written, without the spin and bias. I admire The Ken team for their dedication to getting closer to the true picture.

Hari Buggana

Chairman and MD, InvAscent

Transparent, Honest, Detailed. To me, The Ken has been this since the day I subscribed to them. The research that they put into each story and the way it is presented is thoroughly interesting. Personally, I've always had a great time interacting with the publication and reading the stories.

Harshil Mathur

CEO and Co-Founder, Razorpay

The Ken has proven naysayers wrong by successfully running a digital news publication on a pure-subscription business model in India. They have shown that discerning readers are willing to pay for well-researched, well-written, in-dept news articles.

Kiran Mazumdar Shaw

Executive Chairperson, Biocon Limited

As a designer, it's easy to get lost in the craft of building products. As a business owner however, keeping up with a rapidly changing landscape is key to saying relevant. The Ken doesn't just help me stay on top of what's happening in India(and beyond), but makes it fun to do so.

Zhou Xiaochuan stresses need for vigilance to prevent digital currencies being used for excessive speculation

Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has urged a more measured tone amid a global surge of interest in stablecoins, calling for a “multidimensional assessment” of their genuine utility and the systemic risks they may pose.

The United States and Hong Kong are rolling out regulatory frameworks for the asset, and speculation has been growing about the likelihood of Beijing following suit by introducing yuan-backed stablecoins in a bid to further internationalise its currency.

“We need to be vigilant against the risk of stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, as misdirection could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system,” Zhou said at a closed-door China Finance 40 Forum (CF40) seminar last month, according to an article published on Wednesday by the think tank, whose membership includes senior Chinese regulatory officials and financial experts.

He warned that some industry players could leverage the hype around stablecoins to boost their valuations, focusing on cashing out rather than the profitability or sustainability of the stablecoin business, which would be “detrimental to the healthy development of the financial system” and could lead to the accumulation of “systemic risks”.

What's the hype about stablecoins?

The article, which compiled Zhou's comments at the seminar, said that some current discussions on stablecoins were based on a single perspective, and there needed to be a “multidimensional, multi-perspective assessment” instead.

Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague. 

“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.

The dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time. 

Jane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England's most evocative historic monuments.” 

The Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country's Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds. 

The current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287. 

And since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower's previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you're buried closer to the church, you're more important, and if you're buried inside the church, you're much, much more important, and if you're buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.

Known burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.  

“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower's community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University's School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals' lives.” 

The analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time. 

The second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.

“I'm looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”

Along with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn't usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them). 

“At the moment we've got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it's going to be really exciting to see whether we've picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”

Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the "workhorses" of life essential to nearly every living process. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In a new study, published in Nature, researchers chemically linked life's amino acids to RNA in conditions that could have occurred on the early Earth -- an achievement that has eluded scientists since the early 1970s.

Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: "Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. Understanding the origin of protein synthesis is fundamental to understanding where life came from.

"Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis.

"Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. This machine requires chemical instructions written in messenger RNA, which carries a gene's sequence from a cell's DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein.

"We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. The chemistry is spontaneous, selective and could have occurred on the early Earth."

Previous attempts to attach amino acids to RNA used highly reactive molecules, but these broke down in water and caused the amino acids to react with each other, rather than become linked to RNA.

For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. This activation involved a thioester, a high-energy chemical compound important in many of life's biochemical processes and that has already been theorized to play a role at the start of life*.

Professor Powner said: "Our study unites two prominent origin of life theories -- the 'RNA world', where self-replicating RNA is proposed to be fundamental, and the 'thioester world', in which thioesters are seen as the energy source for the earliest forms of life."

In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life.

The next step, the researchers said, was to establish how RNA sequences could bind preferentially to specific amino acids, so that RNA could begin to code instructions for protein synthesis -- the origin of the genetic code.

"There are numerous problems to overcome before we can fully elucidate the origin of life, but the most challenging and exciting remains the origins of protein synthesis," said Professor Powner.

Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: "Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin.

"Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life.

"What is particularly groundbreaking is that the activated amino acid used in this study is a thioester, a type of molecule made from Coenzyme A, a chemical found in all living cells. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building."

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said that the reactions they demonstrated could plausibly have taken place in pools or lakes of water on the early Earth (but not likely in the oceans as the concentrations of the chemicals would likely be too diluted).

The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules).

Notes

*The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a "thioester world" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters.

** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape. As part of their study, the research team showed how, once the amino acids were loaded on to the RNA, they could synthesize with other amino acids to form peptides.

The work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the Simons Foundation and the Royal Society.

New Cell Transplant for Type 1 Diabetes Sidesteps Need for Immunosuppressants

Scientists treated a person's type 1 diabetes with genetically modified insulin-producing cells that evaded immune system attacks. This is the first therapy for the condition that does not require immunosuppressant drugs

Insulin-producing cells can be genetically modified to hide from the immune system.

People with type 1 diabetes must constantly rely on insulin injections or pumps, usually for the rest of their life after diagnosis. The autoimmune disease destroys the cells that produce the hormone, which is crucial to keeping blood sugar in check. But now research suggests a new therapy could finally allow people with type 1 diabetes to make insulin on their own.

A 42-year-old man who has lived most of his life with type 1 diabetes has become the first human to receive a transplant of genetically modified insulin-producing cells that can slip past the immune system's mistaken attacks. This marks the first pancreatic cell transplant in a human to sidestep the need for immunosuppressant drugs—and it might even lead to a future cure for the disease, researchers say.

“This is the most exciting moment of my scientific career,” says cell biologist Per-Ola Carlsson of Uppsala University in Sweden, who helped develop the procedure. The new treatment, he says, “opens the future possibility of treating not only diabetes but other autoimmune diseases.”

Scientists injected nearly 80 million genetically tweaked cells into the participant's forearm muscle, and 12 weeks later the cells were still alive and producing insulin. The recipient did require additional insulin injections—but the injected cells showed no signs of rejection, which the researchers say is a major step forward. The results were reported this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.

About two million people in the U.S. live with type 1 diabetes, which typically requires an intensive regimen of insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring. If their blood sugar runs amok, people face severe risks, including heart attacks, nerve damage, vision problems, kidney disease, and more.

For decades, scientists have struggled to develop therapies that can successfully replenish beta cells—the specialized insulin-producing cells that are found in the pancreas. Newly added functional beta cells are usually quickly destroyed because a type 1 diabetic immune system flags them as invaders. A few past attempts successfully transplanted donor islets—clusters of pancreatic cells that included beta cells—but these always ultimately triggered an aggressive immune response. And such a response requires recipients to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs, which come with serious side effects, such as increased risks of infections and cancer. For example, at a conference in June, Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that 10 out of 12 participants who were treated with a stem-cell-based infusion during a clinical trial no longer required insulin injections a year after the therapy. But they may continue to need to immunosuppressants.

In the new study, Carlsson and his team looked for ways to dodge the immune response. First, they broke down a deceased donor's pancreatic islets into single cells. Using the common gene-editing technique CRISPR, the researchers inactivated in some of these cells two genes that control the expression of proteins called human leukocyte antigens, which direct the immune system to the foreign cells. Without those markers, the immune system can't easily recognize and destroy the donor cells.

To further evade immune system detection, the team made some cells express higher levels of a gene that discourages attacks by the body's natural killer cells and macrophages, two types of immune cells. Three months after the treatment, although the immune system attacked some cells in the graft, it left the cells that had the inactivated genes and overexpressed gene alone. Blood tests showed no measurable immune cell activation or antibody production in response to these cells.

Before the transplant, the participant had no measurable naturally produced insulin and was receiving daily doses of the hormone. But within four to 12 weeks following the transplant, his levels rose slightly on their own after meals—showing that the new beta cells were releasing some insulin in response to glucose. Four adverse events occurred, but none were serious or related to the modified cells.

The advance “is amazing,” says Laura Alonso, chief of the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. Unlike type 2 diabetes, in which people have poorly functioning beta cells, type 1 diabetes can destroy beta cells completely. Some people with type 1 diabetes may still have a small set of functional beta cells, but in more established cases, the immune system often whittles away all cells, Alonso says. For those established cases, she says, “cell-based therapy is where we need to go.”

Alonso adds, however, that even though the new study is promising, it involved just one participant and is therefore preliminary. And longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the therapy's safety before it can be offered to more people. She also notes that the injected cells produced only 7 percent of the insulin needed for a person to be fully independent of additional medication. The researchers supplied the recipient with insulin doses to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

“It's a relatively short but nonetheless important finding,” says Kevan Herold, an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine, who was also not involved in the study. Because the participant still required a substantial amount of insulin after the transplant and no others have received this treatment yet, Harold cautions that “the clinical significance is somewhat unproven.”

Carlsson says the team will continue to monitor the transplant recipient over the next year and will increase the dose of the modified cells if no adverse effects occur. In the meantime, he and his colleagues are developing a stem cell source that would be capable of producing large quantities of insulin-producing cells. “The combination of those two advances would create the possibility of a cure for type 1 diabetes,” he says.

While Herold thinks it's still too early to consider this approach for a cure, “these options are now here to change the disease in ways that have never been possible before,” he says. “There's tremendous hope.”

These Succulents Glow in the Dark—And They're Gorgeous

Houseplants become rechargeable night-lights after injection with tiny phosphor particles

By Katherine Bourzac & Nature magazine 

Researchers gave these succulents in the Echevaria genus a glow up by injecting them with luminescent particles.

Liu et al./Matter

University students might soon have something other than black-light posters to brighten their dorm rooms. Researchers have created glow-in-the-dark plants by injecting succulents with materials similar to those that make the posters light up. The fleshy plants shine as brightly as a night light, and can be made to do so in a wide variety of colours — a first for glowing houseplants, according to the team.

The researchers, led by Xuejie Zhang, a materials scientist at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, describe today how they produced the plants in the journal Matter. They have applied for a patent on the technology, which they hope will lead to decorative installations and living lighting.

The idea of making glowing plants has captivated scientists since the late 1980s, when researchers made the first bioluminescent plant by inserting a gene from a firefly (Photinus pyralis) into a type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). This work laid the foundation for the first genetically engineered luminescent houseplant to come on the market in the United States, last year. The biotechnology firm Light Bio in Sun Valley, Idaho, sells the petunia (Petunia hybrida), which glows a very faint green thanks to genes from a light-emitting mushroom.

Unlike the petunia, which emits light through chemical reactions in its cells, the succulent glows because of materials injected into its leaves. These materials — phosphor particles made of strontium and aluminium dosed with other metals — absorb energy from light at one wavelength, store some of that energy and then slowly re-emit it at a different wavelength for several hours. For instance, one material the scientists injected into their succulents absorbs ultraviolet and blue light, and re-emits it as green light.

This type of ‘afterglow' phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark toys and paints, and as an imaging tracer for laboratory animals. Whereas genetically engineered bioluminescent plants are, so far, limited in the range of colours they emit, afterglow phosphors span a wide variety of hues, including red and blue, and they can be combined to produce a white glow.

This video shows how the tiny phosphor particles spread through the succulent leaves after they are injected.

Liu et al./Matter

The researchers purchased phosphors containing strontium aluminate and ground them down to particles of various sizes before injecting them into an assortment of plants. They found that particles around 7 micrometres in diameter glowed more brightly than did nanoparticles in plants, and were able to fill up the interior tissues of succulent leaves for a stronger, more uniform glow. By contrast, plants with simple leaf structures, such as tobacco plants and pak choi, emitted a more patchy glow.

The plant favoured by the team is the succulent Echevaria ‘Mebina', a common houseplant that grows rosettes of dense, fleshy leaves. To make every leaf glow, the researchers had to inject each one with phoshor particles, a process that takes about ten minutes. The luminescence — which the team generated in hues of blue-green, blue-violet, green, red and white — lasted as long as 120 minutes after exposing the plant to tailored wavelengths of light or sunlight, and could be triggered again and again over the 10 days of the study.

The researchers estimate that the cost of materials to create one plant is about 10 yuan (US$1.40).

Co-author Shuting Liu, also at the South China Agricultural University, says that the team hopes to move away from injecting each leaf by using smaller particles, which can spread more readily throughout plants. But the team will need to overcome an obstacle: the smaller the particle, the dimmer the glow.

Keith Wood, chief executive of Light Bio, says it's not yet clear how these particles affect the health of the plants over their lifespan. Additionally, the researchers acknowledge that more safety testing is needed; in particular, they need to know whether a leaf full of particles would be toxic if accidentally ingested.

Wood is also sceptical that glowing plants will ever be a living lighting system, capable of replacing light bulbs. So far, researchers have fallen “spectacularly short of that objective”, he says. Instead, whimsy is the name of the game with these plants. “We're making something fun, enjoyable, magical,” he adds.

In the context of an increasing need for clinical assessments of foundation models, we developed EyeFM, a multimodal vision–language eyecare copilot, and conducted a multifaceted evaluation, including retrospective validations, multicountry efficacy validation as a clinical copilot and a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT). EyeFM was pretrained on 14.5 million ocular images from five imaging modalities paired with clinical texts from global, multiethnic datasets. Efficacy validation invited 44 ophthalmologists across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa in primary and specialty care settings, highlighting its utility as a clinical copilot. The RCT—a parallel, single-center, double-masked study—assessed EyeFM as a clinical copilot in retinal disease screening among a high-risk population in China. A total of 668 participants (mean age 57.5 years, 79.5% male) were randomized to 16 ophthalmologists, equally allocated into intervention (with EyeFM copilot) and control (standard care) groups. The primary endpoint indicated that ophthalmologists with EyeFM copilot achieved higher correct diagnostic rate (92.2% versus 75.4%, P < 0.001) and referral rate (92.2% versus 80.5%, P < 0.001). Secondary outcome indicated improved standardization score of clinical reports (median 33 versus 37, P < 0.001). Participant satisfaction with the screening was similar between groups, whereas the intervention group demonstrated higher compliance with self-management (70.1% versus 49.1%, P < 0.001) and referral suggestions (33.7% versus 20.2%, P < 0.001) at follow-up. Post-deployment evaluations indicated strong user acceptance. Our study provided evidence that implementing EyeFM copilot can improve the performance of ophthalmologists and the outcome of patients.

For patients attending ocular disease screening in the primary care centre where only low-cost examination technics are available, EyeFM can use its single modality and cross-modality ability to assist disease detection, followed with screening report writing assisted by its vision-question answering ability. Then, some patients will be referred to specialty care settings for further examination, where EyeFM can use its integrated modality disease detection or even zero-shot ability to facilitate further diagnosis. The image-report writing ability and vision-question answering can also assist to improve the efficiency of clinical report and patient letter drafting in specialty care settings.

a) The diagram of pretraining process for EyeFM. EyeFM was first pretrained for its image encoder with five modalities of images, then conducted vision-language joint pretraining. The image module includes one encoder and five decoders. The encoder comprises 24 Transformer blocks. Each decoder comprises two Transformer blocks. The linear projection layer is implemented with a single convolutional layer. In the vision-language module, the projection is implemented using a single linear layer, which serves to connect the image encoder with the language module. The language module is based on LLaMA 2 architecture with 7 billion parameters. b) The diagram of human-in-the-loop process for EyeFM. EyeFM human-in-the-loop utilized DPO and federated learning for distributed knowledge evolution.

First, we conducted retrospective validations, comparing EyeFM with prior benchmarks of medical foundation models. This step serves as the foundation for evaluating the model's performance and safety when progressing to clinical applications. Second, we conducted reader studies and real-world study prospectively to test the efficiency of EyeFM as a clinical copilot to assist ophthalmologists. This step bridged the gap between the performance of the model its own and its efficiency when applicated by clinicians. At last, we validated EyeFM with a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Colored chart, above, validation experiments and their corresponding relationship with the functions of EyeFM. The x-axis represents different tasks of EyeFM and y-axis represents validation experiments. Cells were coloured if the experiments have validated corresponding functions. Below, glossary table of the tasks, clinical scenario and experiments. RCT, randomised controlled trial.

a) For disease detection on CFP, the sample sizes and P values are: DR (n = 1501, P = 0.042), glaucoma suspect (n = 405, P = 0.533), AMD suspect (n = 370, P = 0.627), MMD (n = 643, P = 0.030). For disease detection on OCT, the sample sizes and P values are: ciDME (n = 523, P = 0.002), glaucoma (n = 412, P = 0.333), AMD (n = 379, n = 0.036). The sample size for cataract detection on external eye photo was 198 and the P value was 0.102. Error bars represent 95% CI. b)Segmentation dice similarity coefficient. The sample size for segmentation on CFP are: HE (n = 13), SE (n = 14), HM (n = 27) and MA (n = 27). The P value for haemorrhages was 0.083. The sample size was 759 for OCT segmentation. Error bars represent 95% CI. c) Cross-modality disease detection of ciDME that usually need to be diagnosed by OCT with CFP inputs only (left), the sample size was 405 and the P value was <0.001. Cross-modality disease detection of wet-AMD that usually need to be diagnosed by CFP with external eye photo inputs (right) the sample size was 332 and the P value was 0.583. Boxes indicate quartile values and whiskers indicate 1.5×the interquartile range. d) Image-report generation, model performance was evaluated by automatic metrics labelled as the x-axis. The sample size was 500. Boxes indicate quartile values and whiskers indicate 1.5× the interquartile range. e) Head-to-head comparison of answers generated by EyeFM and ophthalmologists, the measurement was summed score for quality, safety and empathy, ranged from 3–15 scores. Presented as Kernel Density Plot. The sample size was 300 for EyeFM and 1200 for ophthalmologists. P values were calculated with two-sided t-test between EyeFM and the better-performed reference model. *** denotes P < 0.001, n.s. represents P > 0.05. CFP, colour fundus photo; OCT, optical coherence tomography; EEP, external eye photo; DR, diabetic retinopathy; DME, diabetic macular oedema; AMD, age-related macular degeneration; MMD, myopic macular degeneration; MA, microaneurysms; HE, hard exudates; HM, haemorrhages; SE, soft exudates.

Source data

Participants included in the trial will first receive diagnosis and report by ophthalmologists by CFP, then receive additional OCT examinations for consultant-level reviewers to assess and revise the diagnosis and report. All diagnosis and reports before revision by consultant-level reviewers will be included in the analysis for correct diagnosis rate, correct referral rate and standardization score of reports. Only participants that are correctly diagnosed as ‘with fundus abnormality' will be included in the follow-up for patient compliance analysis. CFP, colour fundus photo; OCT, optical coherence tomography.

Sample preparation remains a bottleneck for protein structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy. A frequently encountered issue is that proteins adsorb to the air–water interface of the sample in a limited number of orientations. This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions, or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.

Since the resolution revolution, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has greatly expedited the process of protein structure determination1,2. Advances in instrumentation and single-particle analysis now routinely enable high-resolution reconstructions for a wide range of proteins and protein complexes3,4,5,6. However, sample preparation issues have remained a major bottleneck7. In particular, one common challenge involves preferred particle orientation8,9,10. When the sample solution is applied to the cryo-EM specimen support, the hydrophobic regions of the protein surface adsorb to the air–water interface, so that only a limited number of viewing directions are present after vitrification. Strong preferred orientation limits the resolution of a single-particle reconstruction along certain viewing directions and can even make it difficult to obtain a reconstruction at all11.

Although several strategies can address preferred orientation issues, no universal solution has been found. Tilting the sample provides a wider range of particle views, but usually results in larger beam-induced motion, an increased ice thickness in the viewing direction and a defocus gradient across the viewing area12,13. Preferred orientation can be reduced by covering the air–water interface with detergents or small proteins to block adsorption of the particles of interest14,15. Moreover, different specimen supports, such as graphene, graphene oxide or other functionalized surfaces, can prevent some particles from diffusing to the interface16,17,18,19,20. However, adopting such strategies often requires time-consuming reoptimization of the sample preparation procedure. Adsorption at the air–water interface can also be minimized by limiting the time between sample application onto the specimen support and vitrification21,22,23,24,25,26. Although this interval can be shortened to a few milliseconds, particles generally diffuse to the interface within a few microseconds. Substantially faster preparation speeds would therefore be required to prevent the majority of particles from reaching the interface. Finally, machine-learning techniques have been developed to guess missing views27,28,29. However, such approaches cannot replace actual experimental observations.

We have previously observed that flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples with microsecond laser pulses reduces preferred orientation for some large, highly symmetric particles30,31,32. Flash melting seems to exert small forces on the proteins, altering their orientation and resulting in an uneven spatial distribution after revitrification, with particles clustering together in some areas30,32. High-resolution reconstructions suggest that the revitrification process preserves particle integrity and does not impose a fundamental limit on the obtainable spatial resolution30,33. However, the practicality of using flash melting to address preferred orientation and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we show that this effect extends to smaller proteins, as well as particles with lower symmetry. We also introduce two variants of the experiment that provide larger changes in preferred orientation for some proteins and that allow us to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

Our experimental approach is illustrated in Figure 1a (refs. 30,32,34,35). A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with 20-µs or 30-µs rectangular laser pulses, where the laser power is kept constant for the pulse duration (Fig. 1b). This causes some particles to detach from the air–water interface and change their orientation. Once the laser beam is switched off, the sample cools in just a few microseconds and revitrifies35,36, trapping the proteins in a non-equilibrium angular distribution (Fig. 1a). We performed in situ flash-melting experiments following previously described protocols, using a transmission electron microscope that we have modified for time-resolved experiments37,38. The sample is locally flash melted by aiming the laser beam (532 nm wavelength, 28-µm diameter spot size in the sample plane) at the center of a grid square of the holey gold specimen support (1.2 µm holes, 1.3 µm apart on 300-mesh gold). Typically, an area of 9–16 grid holes is revitrified. The samples are then transferred to a high-resolution electron microscope for imaging (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9–12 and Supplementary Table 1).

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse, which scrambles the orientation of the particles. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, trapping the particles in a non-equilibrium angular distribution. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape. c–f Reconstructions, with the applied symmetry noted in parentheses, and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), 50S ribosomal subunit (d), HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (e) and hemagglutinin (f). The SCF*, which is a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, as well as the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, as judged by the quality of the map.

Figure 1c demonstrates that flash melting reduces preferred orientation for a sample of the T20S proteasome. A reconstruction from a conventional sample is shown at the top, together with the angular distribution of the particles. It exhibits a series of maxima that arise from the T20S proteasome's strong preference to adsorb to the air–water interface on its side, resulting in sparse population of particles in the top views. Upon revitrification (bottom), the angular distribution broadens noticeably, with a larger fraction of the particles populating the less-favored views. At the same time, the sampling compensation factor (SCF*), a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, improves from 0.89 to 0.95. The SCF* takes values between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to a perfectly isotropic angular distribution5,39,40.

An even greater reduction in preferred orientation can be achieved for the 50S ribosomal subunit. Unlike the highly symmetric T20S proteasome (point group D7), the asymmetric 50S ribosomal subunit (C1) exhibits strong preferred orientation (Fig. 1d). In a conventional sample, the angular distribution features a small number of pronounced maxima, with many views absent altogether (white) and a low SCF* of 0.42. Upon revitrification, most of the missing views become populated, and the SCF* improves to 0.74. At the same time, the streaky artefacts that are visible in the reconstruction from the conventional sample and that are the result of preferred orientation disappear (Supplementary Fig. 5)41. Flash melting can also improve the angular distribution of much smaller proteins, such as the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (210 kDa), for which the SCF* increases from 0.89 to 0.99 (Fig. 1e). Among these examples, a noticeable gain in resolution is observed only for the 50S ribosomal subunit, the only protein for which the preferred orientation is so pronounced that many views are not populated at all. For the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein, the resolution slightly decreases. This seems to be largely due to astigmatism in the micrographs recorded for the revitrified sample.

Laser flash melting seems to be less efficient at reducing preferred orientation for proteins that are more strongly bound to the air–water interface. Hemagglutinin (170 kDa) exhibits a preference for top and bottom views (Fig. 1f). Although revitrification depopulates particles in the bottom views, the overall angular distribution remains similar, with the SCF* slightly decreasing from 0.60 to 0.56. This suggests either that flash melting detaches only a few proteins from the interface or that detached particles return to their preferred orientation rapidly after diffusing to the surface. Both explanations indicate that there is a strong interaction between hemagglutinin and the air–water interface. For the proteins studied here, diffusion to the interface is expected to occur in just a few microseconds, which is shorter than the duration of the experiment (30 µs).

Experiments with shaped microsecond laser pulses provide clues about the mechanism through which the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. We have previously shown that cryo-EM samples partially crystallize during flash melting with rectangular laser pulses35,42. This led us to speculate whether the transient formation of crystallites, which preferentially form at the sample surface43, might exert small forces on the particles, leading to their detachment and reorientation30. We test this hypothesis by melting samples with shaped laser pulses that feature an intense 1-µs initial spike and ten times the laser power (Fig. 2a,b)44. This increases the heating rate during flash melting to about 2 × 108 K s−1, twice the critical heating rate of 1 × 108 K s−1, so that the sample does not crystallize44. If crystallization was the dominant mechanism for reshuffling the particle orientations, we would expect the angular distribution to barely change under these conditions. Contrary to our expectation, flash melting with such a shaped laser pulse decreases preferred orientation even more drastically for the 50S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). The SCF* increases from 0.18 to 0.90 in revitrified areas of the sample, and the map resolution improves markedly, from 4.1 Å to 2.9 Å. Of note, the angular distribution of the sample is different from that in Figure 1d, despite both being prepared using the same procedure. This suggests that the interaction of the particles with the interface is very sensitive to preparation conditions and can be easily altered.

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a shaped 30-µs laser pulse that features an intense leading edge. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, and the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. b, Schematic of the laser pulse shape, which features an intense spike at its onset (1-µs duration with the laser power increased ten-fold). c,d, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the 50S ribosomal subunit (c) and hemagglutinin (d). The SCF* and the resolution of the reconstructions are shown below the maps. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

Clearly, transient crystallization of the sample cannot be the dominant mechanism for particle reorientation. Instead, the effect appears to intensify with increased heating rates, suggesting several possible mechanisms. Impulsive laser heating of a thin, suspended membrane, such as the holey gold film of the specimen support, induces drumming motions that typically persist on microsecond timescales45,46. With the larger initial heating power of the shaped laser pulses, such oscillations likely reach a larger amplitude and exert greater forces on the thin liquid film in which the particles are suspended. This could allow them to detach from the air–water interface more readily and reorient. The impinging laser beam also deforms the thin liquid film directly through the radiation forces47. Additionally, it is also conceivable that some particles detach from the interface owing to the evaporation of the liquid sample in the vacuum of the electron microscope42. Simulations indicate that, during the initial spike of the shaped laser pulse, the sample temperature briefly increases by about 25 K (Supplementary Fig. 15). Because the evaporation rate increases exponentially with temperature48, this could cause more particles to detach. However, there are also changes in preferred orientation when samples are revitrified at atmospheric pressure, under which evaporation is substantially reduced33,49. It is therefore unlikely that evaporation is the dominant effect that causes particles to detach from the air–water interface. For hemagglutinin, even shaped laser pulses cannot reduce the amount of preferred orientation, although they induce some changes in the angular distribution (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 14).

Our experiments suggest that the changes in the angular distribution induced by flash melting are the result of two opposing processes. First, particles must be successfully detached from the air–water interface to reorient. But given enough time, they can then diffuse back to the interface and return to their preferred orientation. A simple experiment allowed us to detach all particles from the interface before laser melting the sample, disentangling both processes (Fig. 3a). We deposited a 20-nm-thick layer of amorphous ice onto both sides of the sample by introducing water vapor into the volume surrounding the specimen in our modified transmission electron microscope50. After flash melting the sample with a rectangular laser pulse (Fig. 3b), the particles all began at a distance from the interface, having lost all memory of where they used to be located. The angular distribution obtained after revitrification then exclusively reflects the result of the particles' free diffusion.

a, A 20-nm layer of amorphous ice is deposited in situ onto the cryo-EM sample before it is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies with the particle orientations redistributed. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape used. c–e, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), the 50S ribosomal subunit (d) and hemagglutinin (e). The sampling compensation factor (SCF*) and the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

When we revitrify a T20S proteasome sample after depositing a layer of amorphous ice, we obtain the angular distribution in Fig. 3c (bottom, Supplementary Fig. 3). The estimated rotational timescale of the particles (about 5 µs) is shorter than the timescale of the experiment, so one might expect that this should yield an isotropic distribution. Instead, the distribution closely resembles that obtained without prior deposition of amorphous ice (Fig. 1c) and notably features a preference for side views. This clearly indicates that the particles have diffused back to the interface, which occurs on an estimated timescale of only about 4 µs, and have partially settled into their preferred orientations. The striking similarity of the angular distribution to that in Figure 1c suggests that both are the result of the free diffusion and partial readsorption of the particles. It therefore appears likely that, even without prior deposition of amorphous ice, the laser pulse efficiently detaches the T20S proteasome particles from the interface.

Flash melting of a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit, following the deposition of amorphous ice, similarly results in a broad angular distribution with a small degree of preferred orientation, indicating that some particles have readsorbed to the interface (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6). The SCF* increased from 0.42 to 0.90. Curiously, however, the distribution substantially changed, featuring maxima at orientations that were previously only sparsely populated. This suggests that the interaction between the particles and the interface was altered in our experiments. As discussed above, the preferential orientation of the 50S ribosomal subunit varies, even in conventional samples prepared under otherwise identical conditions (Figs. 1d and 2c), suggesting that the properties of the interface are easily modified. Sample transfer and handling could have introduced traces of surface-active compounds, thereby modifying the chemical composition of the interface. Additionally, the interaction between the particles and the surface could have been affected by the dilution of the buffer during our experiment. At the laser powers used, less material is evaporated than has been deposited, so that the sample thickness slightly increases overall. As shown in Figure 3e, we obtain a similar result for hemagglutinin (Supplementary Fig. 13). After amorphous ice deposition and revitrification, the particles show a substantial amount of preferred orientation, indicating that many have readsorbed to the interface. However, the prominent top views have been largely depopulated, whereas the bottom views now dominate the angular distribution.

Our experiments yield a simple picture of the competing processes that occur during laser revitrification. Flash melting detaches some particles from the interface (Fig. 4a,b), a process that becomes more efficient as the heating rate is increased. As these particles rotate freely, their orientations are scrambled, resulting in improved angular distribution. In a competing process, particles diffuse back to the interface (Fig. 4c) before the sample is revitrified (Fig. 4d), allowing some proteins to efficiently readsorb in their preferred orientation. This process generally is more efficient for small proteins because of their shorter diffusion times. It could be possible to improve the angular distribution of such proteins by reducing the duration of the laser pulse to below the diffusion timescale (a few microseconds), so that the particles do not have enough time to reach the interface. In some experiments, proteins readsorbed in a different preferred orientation, such as when we deposited a layer of amorphous ice prior to revitrification. Apparently, our experiment has altered the interfacial properties, making adsorption in new orientations favorable. This implies that it should be possible to purposely modify the interface before flash melting, for example through vapor deposition of a hydrophilic compound onto the cryo-EM sample. Upon laser melting, all particles should then desorb and randomize their orientation. Such experiments are currently underway in our lab51.

a, In a conventional cryo-EM sample, particles adsorb to the air–water interface in preferred orientations. b, Flash melting detaches the proteins from the interface, so that they are able to rotate freely. c, While the sample is liquid, many particles diffuse back to the interface, where some adsorb in their preferred orientation. d, The sample is revitrified and the ensemble is arrested in a non-equilibrium angular distribution.

Our experiments also provide a practical toolbox for addressing preferred orientation, with some proteins showing dramatic improvements in their angular distribution. For example, revitrifying a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit with shaped laser pulses improves the resolution by 1.2 Å under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 2c). To put this in perspective, 18 times as many micrographs of a conventional sample would be needed to achieve the same improvement. Reshuffling the particle orientations through laser flash melting can therefore provide considerable cost and time savings. Our method can be easily combined with other established approaches for addressing preferred orientation. Importantly, as a simple physical approach, flash melting does not require any time-consuming changes to the sample-preparation procedure, but can be easily integrated into existing workflows. As we have previously shown, cryo-EM samples can also be revitrified in an optical microscope equipped for correlative light and electron microscopy experiments33. This approach is technically less involved and might therefore be more accessible to other labs. It could also be integrated into vitrification devices, some of which already use an optical microscope to assess sample quality. Laser-melting experiments could be directly integrated into high-resolution electron microscopes at cryo-EM facilities. If a sample is found to exhibit preferred orientation during data acquisition, it could then be revitrified on the fly with little additional time.

Purified T20S proteasome (3.7 mg ml−1 in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM sodium chloride) and purified 50S ribosome52 (an optical density at 260 nm (OD260) of 40 per ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride) were gifts from A. Guskov, University of Gröningnen, and B. Beckert, DCI Lausanne respectively. The purified hemagglutinin sample (1 mg ml−1 in PBS pH 7.5) was purchased from MyBioSource (MBS434205). The cryo-EM samples of purified proteins were prepared by applying 3.5 µl of the sample solution to glow-discharged (0.25 mbar, 15 mA, 60 s) gold grids (UltrAuFoil, R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH). Surplus sample was removed by blotting for 2–4 s using a blot force of 10 in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, held at 20 °C, 100% relative humidity). The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (HIV-1 CH505TF Envelope SOSIP ectodomain)53 was generously provided by R. Henderson, Duke Center for HIV Structural Biology. The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (5 mg ml−1 in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol) was applied to glow discharged gold grids (Au-flat, 0.6 µm/1 µm hole diameter/pitch, 300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The sample was blotted with the minimum blot time that can be set (0 s). The conventional sample was blotted using a blot force of 10, whereas the revitrified sample was blotted using blot forces of 5 and 10. All samples were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen until experiments were carried out.

The revitrification experiments with rectangular laser pulses (Fig. 1) were performed in situ using a modified JEOL 2200FS transmission electron microscope equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS) and an in-column Omega energy filter38. The samples were loaded into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. The sample was melted and revitrified in the center of multiple grid squares (typically 80 – 100) through irradiation with microsecond laser pulses30,32,35. A 30-µs laser pulse was used for the 50S and HIV-1 samples, and a 20-μs laser pulse for the T20S sample. The hemagglutinin sample was revitrified with two 30-µs pulses with a 250-ms delay between the pulses. The laser pulses were generated by chopping the continuous output of a 532 nm laser (Ventus532, Laser Quantum) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic). The laser beam was focused to a spot size of 28 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum) in the sample plane, as determined by a knife-edge scan, and aligned to the center of the grid squares. The laser power was adjusted on the fly to keep the size of the revitrified region, typically 15–22 µm in diameter, approximately constant35. After revitrification, the grids were unloaded from the side entry holder and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection.

The revitrification experiments with shaped laser pulses (Fig. 2) were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)50,54,55. The plunge-frozen cryo-EM samples were inserted into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. Shaped laser pulses with an intense leading edge (1 µs initial spike at ten times the laser power) were generated by modulating the output of a continuous green laser (532 nm, Verdi Coherent) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic) that was controlled by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix AFG1062)44. The laser beam was focused to a spot of 38 µm FWHM in the sample plane, as determined by imaging the beam with a CCD camera placed in a plane conjugate to the sample plane. The laser power required for laser melting was determined by using ordinary rectangular pulses. The initial spike was then added to perform the revitrification experiment.

The experiments in Figure 3, in which the sample was revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)42,50,54,55. Amorphous ice was deposited by leaking water vapor into the volume surrounding the sample through a gas dosing valve50. The vapor enters the microscope through a stainless steel tube that terminates inside of the cold shield, in close proximity to the sample. To obtain a well-defined thickness, the deposition rate was first determined with the following procedure. A multilayer graphene sample on a gold specimen grid (UltrAu Foil, 600 mesh, R2/1) was cooled to about 100 K in an Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan). While amorphous ice was being deposited on the graphene sheet, the diffraction patterns of the growing ice layer were recorded. During the deposition, the intensity of the molecular diffraction pattern of the amorphous ice initially increased linearly but then leveled off and plateaued once the ice film was so thick that multiple and inelastic scattering became important. From the characteristic curve shape of the diffraction intensity as a function of deposition time, the deposition rate was then determined (typically 0.3 nm s−1)42,50, and the deposition time was adjusted accordingly (typically 74 s to deposit about 10 nm on each side of the sample, 20 nm total).

To perform the deposition and revitrification experiment, the cryo-EM sample was loaded into the microscope with a second Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan, approximately at 100 K). To begin the deposition, the shutter of the specimen holder was opened for the predetermined amount of time, before the shutter was closed to stop any further deposition of amorphous ice. The gas dosing valve was then closed, and the cryo shield surrounding the sample was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Once the pressure in the microscope column had dropped to below 5 × 10−5 Pa, the shutter of the cryo-transfer holder was opened, and the revitrification experiment was performed using rectangular laser pulses, as described above.

The T20S datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G3i, equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded as tiff images in super-resolution mode and binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV. The data were collected using a 100 µm objective aperture at a nominal magnification of ×130,000 during a 1.3-s exposure with a defocus range of –0.6 µm to –2.0 µm and a total dose of 67 e− Å−2.

The datasets were processed in cryoSPARC v4.4 and v4.5 (ref. 5). For the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, 3,479, 6,105 and 3,641 micrographs were collected, respectively. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion-correction and patch contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation before manual curation on the basis of CTF resolution estimation, ice thickness and total full-frame motion. Particles were initially picked with a blob picker with a diameter of 100–200 Å from 1,519, 2,287 and 2,255 high-quality micrographs for the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, respectively, and were then extracted with a box size of 512 px and down sampled to 128 px. After two rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classifications, the selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles assigned to the better resolved class were refined against the obtained volume in a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. The resulting volume was used to generate templates for template-based picking with a particle diameter of 150 Å. The particles were again extracted with a box size of 512 px, Fourier-cropped to a box size of 256 px, and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification. The selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with only one class, followed by homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and again directed into a homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. To ensure the comparability of the datasets obtained from the different experimental conditions, a low-pass-filtered volume (filtered to 30 Å) obtained from the conventional dataset was used as a reference input for homogeneous refinements for all the three datasets. Finally, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles.

The conventional, revitrified and deposited and revitrified 50S datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4 camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging facility in Lausanne, Switzerland. The videos were collected in eer format, with a 100 µm objective aperture inserted, at a nominal magnification of ×120,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.658 Å per pixel. Micrographs were collected with a defocus range of –0.4 µm to –1 µm using a total dose of 40 e− Å−2. The sample that had been revitrified with the shaped laser pulse and the corresponding conventional control were collected on a Titan Krios G3i, fitted with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded during a 1.2-s exposure at ×130,000 magnification, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.3255 Å in super-resolution mode. The data were binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å per pixel. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV and the objective aperture to 100 µm. The defocus used ranged from –0.4 µm to –1.6 µm, whereas the electron dose was 63 e− Å−2.

For the 50S datasets, 11,121, 6,174, 9,532, 7,416 and 7,725 micrographs were collected for conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified, conventional (control for shaped pulses) and shaped pulse revitrified, respectively. The micrographs were patch motion-corrected (40 fractions, no up-sampling), and patch CTF-estimated before being subjected to a manual curation in which low-quality micrographs, judged by CTF estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, were discarded. The selected 6,236, 5,870, 6,641, 3,485, and 5,227 high-quality micrographs were subjected to a blob picker with a particle diameter of 200–300 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 784 px and cropped to 392 px. After two rounds of 2D classification, selected particles were directed into an ab initio reconstruction with two to three classes. The particles from the best class were refined against the volumes from the best and worst class in one round of heterogeneous refinement. The selected particles from the heterogeneous refinement were directed into a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and refined through homogeneous refinement using C1 symmetry and a low-pass filtered volume from the conventional dataset as a reference. Ultimately, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles. Unlike the other reconstructions in this manuscript, the 50S ribosomal subunit maps were not sharpened to preserve the details in the flexible L1 stalk.

The HIV-1 datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 using a Falcon 4i camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were recorded in eer format using a magnification of ×96,000, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å per pixel. A total dose of 50 e− Å−2 was used and the defocus range was set to –1 µm to –2.4 µm.

For the conventional HIV-1 dataset, 2,614 micrographs were collected. For the revitrified dataset, data were collected from two different grids; from the first grid, 5,447 micrographs were collected; from the second, 5,081 images were recorded. All datasets were subjected patch motion correction, patch CTF estimation and a manual curation based on CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and the defocus range. Next, the particles were picked using a blob picker with a diameter of 100–150 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 480 px and down sampled to 240 px. The particles from the two revitrified datasets were combined before sorting in two rounds of two-dimensional classification. The selected particles were subjected to an ab initio reconstruction using two classes. Particles were further classified in three dimensions through two rounds of heterogeneous refinements, in which all selected particles from the first round of 2D classification were sorted against the good initial volume and five decoy classes, generated through the pre-mature termination of an ab initio reconstruction. The selected set of particles was then refined in a non-uniform refinement with C1 symmetry. Next, the particles were re-extracted at full box size, locally and globally CTF-refined before being directed into another non-uniform refinement, without dynamic masking and symmetry enforcement. Finally, 50,000 random particles were selected and again refined in a non-uniform refinement without dynamic masking using C1 symmetry and the filtered conventional volume as a reference, before being directed into an orientation diagnostics job.

The four hemagglutinin datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4i and a SelectrisX energy filter at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were collected in eer format at a magnification of ×165,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.732 Å. A total dose of 40 e− Å−2 was used for the conventional, revitrified and leading-edge revitrified and deposited and revitrified dataset, respectively. A defocus range of –0.8 µm to –2.5 µm and an energy filter slit of 10 eV was applied for all four datasets.

For the conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified and shaped pulse revitrified HA samples, 2,251, 6,476, 10,114 and 10,270 micrographs were collected. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation. The micrographs were manually curated on the basis of their CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, resulting in 1,651, 4,608, 7,982 and 8,590 high-quality micrographs. On 100 micrographs of each dataset, a denoiser was trained and subsequently applied to the curated micrographs. Particles were picked from denoised micrographs using a blob picker with a diameter of 80–140 Å. Next, the particles were extracted from the raw, non-denoised micrographs using a box size of 360 px, which was cropped to 180 px. The extracted particles were subjected to one to two rounds of 2D classification, followed by an ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles were then further cleaned up in one round of heterogeneous refinement using a decoy volume and the best-resolved ab initio volume as inputs. The sorted particles were then refined in a homogeneous refinement, before being re-extracted at full box size. Out of these, 50,000 random particles were selected and then subjected into a final homogeneous refinement with C3 symmetry, using the filtered conventional map as a reference, and an orientation diagnostics job.

The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and translocase of the inner membrane 23 (TIM23) complexes are coupled to control protein import across the outer and inner membranes, respectively. However, the mechanisms of protein recognition and sorting in the TOM–TIM23 pathway remain unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of a translocating polypeptide substrate captured in the active TOM–TIM23 supercomplex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the TOM complex, the polypeptide substrate adopts multiple conformations stabilized by hydrophilic residues from distinct regions of the Tom40 channel. In the TIM23 complex, the Tim17 and Mgr2 subunits create the translocation pathway, with a central restriction formed by four highly conserved hydrophobic residues. The substrate primarily interacts with hydrophobic residues along the Tim17–Mgr2 pathway. Substrate hydrophobicity modulates the association of Mgr2 with Tim17, enabling dynamic regulation of protein sorting toward either the matrix or membrane. These findings reveal a sophisticated translocation mechanism of the TOM–TIM23 supercomplex that ensures the efficient import of diverse mitochondrial proteins.

MD simulations trajectories illustrating the translocation of a polypeptide substrate through the Tim17–Mgr2 pathway. The substrate was steered into the matrix (downward) by a pulling force in MD simulations. The polypeptide is depicted in green with side chains highlighted as balls and sticks. Mgr2 is shown in transparent yellow. Key hydrophobic residues of Tim17 and Mgr2 that interact with the substrate are shown as color-coded balls and sticks: orange, F65 of Tim17; lime, W68 of Tim17; purple, L12 of Tim17; deep pink, F67 of Mgr2; silver, F70 of Mgr2. Notably, the applied force was not constant and could be accumulated in certain polypeptide-trapped locations during simulations. This could result in uneven translocation rates of the polypeptide substrate.

Same as Supplementary Video 1, except that the substrate was pulled toward the IMS.

Same as Supplementary Video 1, except that the simulation was conducted without Mgr2.

Same as Supplementary Video 2, except that the simulation was conducted without Mgr2.

Plastics play a fundamental role in modern life, but their resistance to biodegradation makes them very difficult to dispose of. New research reveals how “plastivore” caterpillars can metabolically degrade plastics in a matter of days, not decades, and store them internally as body fat – but at what cost?

In 2017, a groundbreaking study demonstrated that the caterpillars of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella), known as waxworms, can degrade polyethylene plastic. Polyethylene is the world's most commonly manufactured plastic, with over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene produced globally each year. Polyethylene is chemically resilient, which makes it resistant to decomposition and can take decades or even hundreds of years to fully degrade.

While this plastic degradation process has been demonstrated by waxworms at a small scale, this ongoing research project is helping us to better understand the biological mechanisms at work, the impact of an all-plastic diet on the health of these organisms, and their viability as a sustainable solution to plastic pollution.

“Around 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire polyethylene bag in as little as 24 hours, although we believe that co-supplementation with feeding stimulants like sugars can reduce the number of worms considerably,” says Dr Bryan Cassone, a Professor of Insect Pest and Vector Biology in the Department of Biology at Brandon University, Canada. “However, understanding the biological mechanisms and consequences on fitness associated with plastic biodegradation is key to using waxworms for large-scale plastic remediation.”

Utilizing a suite of techniques spanning animal physiology, material science, molecular biology and genomics, Dr Cassone and his team have studied the interesting relationship between waxworms, their bacterial microbiome, and their potential for large-scale plastic biodegradation, as well as the possible impacts on waxworm health and survivability.

This research reveals that waxworms metabolically process the plastics down into lipids and store it as body fat. “This is similar to us eating steak – if we consume too much saturated and unsaturated fat, it becomes stored in adipose tissue as lipid reserves, rather than being used as energy,” says Dr Cassone.

While waxworms will readily consume polyethylene, this research also shows that this ultimately ends in a quick death. “They do not survive more than a few days on a plastic-only diet and they lose considerable mass,” says Dr Cassone. “However, we are optimistic that we can formulate a co-supplementation that not only restores their fitness to natural levels but exceeds it.”

Dr Cassone and his team have identified two ways in which waxworms could contribute solutions to the ongoing plastic pollution crisis. “Firstly, we could mass rear waxworms on a co-supplemented polyethylene diet as part of a circular economy,” he says. “Secondly, we could explore the re-engineering of the plastic biodegradation pathway outside the animal.”

As a bonus benefit, the mass production of waxworms would also generate a substantial surplus of insect biomass, which could represent an additional economic opportunity in aquaculture. “Our preliminary data suggests that they could become part of a very nutritious diet for commercial food fishes,” says Dr Cassone.

This research is being presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in Antwerp, Belgium on the 8th July 2025.

Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is switching to a reusable cup program facilitated by Bold Reuse, a Portland-based startup, in the venue's ongoing bid to eliminate waste at sports and entertainment events.

The new cups will debut Saturday during the Seattle Storm WNBA game. Fans will receive their drinks in durable cups that can be returned to collection bins throughout the stadium. The cups are collected, professionally sanitized and returned by Bold Reuse.

They will be used at all Climate Pledge Arena events, from Kraken hockey games to concerts and more, replacing the arena's use of recyclable aluminum cups.

Climate Pledge Arena has received accolades for its environmental efforts, and in 2023 became the first sports stadium in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from a nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings.

The arena is named after The Climate Pledge, an initiative founded by Amazon and Global Optimism asking global corporations to become net zero carbon by 2040. 

Bold Reuse initially launched as GO Box in 2011, providing reusable takeout containers. Co-founder and CEO Jocelyn Quarrell acquired the business in 2018, and rebranded it four years later. The company expanded into Seattle in February 2024 and opened a 9,000-square-feet dishwashing facility in the city's Chinatown-International District.

Bold Reuse launched a pilot program with material science company Avery Dennison in June in which RFID tags are being implemented to track the entire lifecycle of reusable cups — from distribution and return to wash cycles and end-of-life. 

The two-month pilot was live at the company's Portland wash hub as well as two of the city's sports venues: Moda Center and Providence Park.

Earlier this month, Bold Reuse announced a new partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs — the first NFL team to offer reusable cups stadium-wide for every event. 

Reusable cups from Minnesota-based r.World are used at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo ZooTunes concert events; SIFF Cinema Downtown, the former Cinerama movie theater; and WAMU Theater.

A new report from local venture capital firm Madrona features three Seattle-based startups among the top 40 private artificial intelligence companies globally.

The annual Intelligent Applications 40 (IA40) list provides an overview of the leading startups that are integrating AI into business solutions.

To compile the list, more than 70 VC investors from 54 firms nominated more than 340 private companies. These investors then voted on a short list of finalists, and the results were combined with PitchBook's “Venture Exit Predictor Tool” to produce the final ranking.

The ranking, co-authored by Madrona, features a significant turnover rate with 27 new companies on the list, reflecting a rapid pace of innovation. The list also highlights the concentration of AI startups in San Francisco, which accounts for a significant proportion of the honorees.

While California-based startups dominate the list, three companies from the Seattle area made the cut:

The IA40 list highlights a small-but-impactful group of Seattle companies alongside a much larger representation from the Bay Area, which includes major players like OpenAI and Anthropic. GeekWire recently reported on the lack of superstar AI startups in the Seattle region, despite its brand as a global AI hub.

Key takeaways from the IA40 report include the rise of next-generation user interfaces that are conversational and “agentic” — systems that can reason and execute autonomously. 

The report also highlights a multi-billion dollar opportunity in new AI tools for software development, along with the success of “service-as-software” business models. These trends are supported by the continued importance of the data layer and the maturity of the enabling infrastructure that powers these innovations, allowing for strong vertical momentum as companies build AI-native products for specific industries.

Framer, a Dutch company specializing in tools for automating web design, has secured a $100 million funding round that values the startup at $2 billion.

The investment was led by existing backers Meritech Capital Partners and Atomico, according to a statement released Thursday.

The massive capital infusion positions it to take on its largest rival, Figma, which also uses a community-based model to create websites and design. It went public in 2023 and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this summer and now holds a lofty market cap of $37.68 billion.

No-code websites teach users to create websites and apps without extensive programming knowledge. As the no-code and AI-driven design sector heats up, Framer's rapid valuation jump underscores investor enthusiasm for platforms that simplify web development using generative AI, making it a key player to watch as the industry continues to evolve.

Framer claims a user base of 500,000 active monthly users, most of whom are startups. The company aims to attract larger enterprise clients as it scales. The last funding round in 2023 was a $27 million raise, though the valuation at that time was not disclosed.

“Close to half of the latest Y Combinator batch launched with Framer, alongside global brands like Perplexity, Scale AI, Huel, Miro, Zapier, and Mixpanel,” Framer said in a statement. “Today, hundreds of thousands of sites run on Framer, with more than half a million people using the platform each month.”

Venture capitalists see significant potential in AI-powered tools that enable rapid website creation and design, especially following the September 2023 IPO of Figma, which soared 250% on debut and has become a benchmark for the sector. It has since seen a rollercoaster ride for its share price.

“Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said after Figma's IPO. “Because of this three-year bottleneck, tech IPO investors have been starved for new deals.”

That appetite has only grown. Venture capital firms invested approximately $162.8 billion across various deals in the first six months of 2025, according to data from PitchBook.

Notably, about 30% of this funding was allocated to late-stage startups, reflecting a continued appetite among investors for established companies preparing for or already pursuing IPOs and acquisitions.

Founded in 2014 in Amsterdam by by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk who had previously sold their company, Sofa, to Facebook, Framer initially focused on prototyping tools for website design. Over time, it expanded into web publishing and “no-code” development.

The funding underscores a broader trend among technology investors betting heavily on startups that offer no-code or “vibe coding” features, which rely on generative AI models from providers like OpenAI.

Framer markets itself as a simpler alternative to Figma and Squarespace, offering an integrated platform for web animation, marketing analytics, and publishing.

“We empower designers to publish websites without needing costly developers,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said in the statement today.

Other startups in the space, such as Anysphere, which produces the AI coding assistant Cursor, are reaching hefty valuations on relatively modest revenue. In July, Anysphere announced over $500 million in annualized revenue, valuing the company at nearly $10 billion.

Framer, on the other hand, generated around $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year and projects to double that figure in 2026, driven by growing demand for AI-enhanced design tools.

Lucasfilm just announced the cast of Star Wars: Starfighter, directed by Shawn Levy, which is now in production. Ryan Gosling stars, and he'll be joined by Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams.

“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said on the official Star Wars website. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”

Above, you get our first glimpse of the film, featuring Gosling and Gray. While there's still no official word on the plot of the film, that image certainly suggests the rumors about a mentor and mentee relationship are true. All the official site says is that it's “an all-new standalone adventure” and “an entirely original story set in a period of time never before explored in Star Wars.” That's referring to the time after the events of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.

In terms of the cast, Smith and Goth had been rumored, but several of the other names are brand new, and, among those, a few stand out. Aaron Pierre, who'll next be seen in the DC series Lanterns, is one. The talented Rebel Ridge actor is now also a DC and Star Wars guy. The other is multi-Oscar-nominee Amy Adams, who is also now a DC and Star Wars person. There's no word on who each is playing, but they are intriguing additions to the Star Wars universe.

With Starfighter now in production, it's locking in on its release date of May 28, 2027, which is almost exactly 50 years after the release of the first Star Wars.

Some CPUs will now no longer have a bundled cooler

Ever since the introduction of the Ryzen line-up, AMD has supplied a stock cooler in the box with most of its CPUs. These range from the basic Wraith Stealth units to the RGB-laden Wraith Prism, and the Wraith Spire which sits in between. While the Wraith line-up has existed prior to modern Ryzen processors, the Prism debuted with the Ryzen 2000 series in 2018, it is now retiring after seven years.

Spotted by @momomo_us, AMD has updated the OPN codes for some of its boxed Ryzen CPUs, with a new message highlighting the end-of-life status for Wraith Prism and Wraith Spire. Starting August, 2025, the cooler has been completely retired and will no longer come with processors such as the Ryzen 9 7900. There's no substitute either; there will simply be no stock cooler bundled with some AMD CPUs.

 




Alongside the Prism, even the Wraith Spire is being discontinued, with select units shifting to the lower-tier Wraith Stealth. AMD already moved away from including boxed coolers entirely with the Ryzen 9000 series, arguing that higher-end CPUs are paired with aftermarket solutions anyways. The only exception to this is the Ryzen 5 9600, which fittingly ships with a Wraith Stealth — so that's safe.

Of the Ryzen 9000 series, only the Ryzen 5 9600 gets a Wraith Stealth cooler, but the Ryzen 7000 series fairs better with a handful of CPUs coming with in-box cooling. These are the Ryzen 9 7900 (Prism), 7 7700, 5 7600, , 5 7500F and the 5 7400F which all come with Wraith Stealth coolers. The older Ryzen 5 series CPUs fair much better with 11 of the 26 CPUs coming with cooling.

The Wraith Prism itself is an upgraded version of the original Wraith Max coolers that AMD shipped with its FX CPUs. It's the most capable of the bunch (or was), rated for 140W TDP which means it should be able to cool even flagship 16-core SKUs from the Red Team. On the other hand, the Wraith Stealth launched with the original 1000-series Ryzen chips and they're essentially the same cooler, just with different sized heatsinks.

While these coolers are technically nothing special, they still lowered the barrier to entry to a new platform. People previously using Intel processors, or building their first-ever PCs wouldn't have to worry about yet another component, avoiding the compatibility checks often needed before buying and pairing PC parts with each other. Nowadays, both AMD and Intel seem to have largely moved away from this model, forcing people to exclusively rely on a separate purchase.

What happens when your first 10 hires aren't people at all? At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at San Francisco's Moscone West, we're digging into the new wave of startups replacing or augmenting early employees with AI agents. Think outbound sales, billing, and customer support — automated from day one.

This panel, hosted on the Builders Stage, features a mix of technical founders and seasoned operators who are actually doing it, debating where the line between human and machine should be drawn — and how far is too far.

Caleb Peffer, founder and CEO of Firecrawl, is helping over 350,000 developers (and companies like Shopify and Zapier) plug AI directly into the live web. His dev-first platform is already reshaping how AI agents interact with the internet and scale with clean data.

Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, founder and CEO of Artisan, made waves with his “Stop Hiring Humans” campaign — and he's serious. His company raised $35 million to build AI employees, starting with sales. Expect bold insights on replacing go-to-market teams with code.

Sarah Franklin, CEO of Lattice and former Salesforce president and CMO, brings hard-won wisdom on scaling companies with impact. She's built and led real teams at the highest level and knows exactly where AI helps — and where it hurts.

Whether you're already embedding AI into your stack or just testing prompts on your product team, this conversation is about more than hype. It's about getting real on ROI, trust, team dynamics, and what it means to build a business that moves faster than ever with fewer human hands.

This session is just one of hundreds featured across five industry stages, plus breakouts and roundtables. Grab your pass to Disrupt 2025 before prices jump in mid-September. Get your ticket now.

Topics

Put your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge. Secure your exhibit space before your competitor does.

Are you looking for a GPU deal for a new or existing build and want to have the latest generation of graphics cards in your system? Well, today we have one of the best bang-for-buck performers from Nvidia's AIB partner MSI. The RTX 5060 Ti 16GB hits the price-to-performance sweet spot, with the latest Blackwell architecture, an ample 16GB of superfast GDDR7 VRAM, access to the latest Nvidia software features such as DLSS 4 and Reflex 2, Nvidia Broadcast, and more.

Hitting an all-time low price on Newegg, MSI's Shadow 2X OC Plus RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is now only $409.99 when you make use of the $20 rebate that Newegg is offering. This places the card below the MSRP asking price, and as of the writing of this article, it is the cheapest RTX 5060 Ti 16GB available to buy.

The MSI Shadow 2X OC Plus RTX 5060 Ti 16GB features 4608 CUDA cores for graphics processing, a boost clock of 2602MHz, and, when using the MSI Center software, can utilize the "Extreme Performance" setting to reach a maximum clock speed of up to 2617MHz. The super-fast GDDR7 VRAM features memory speeds of 28 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, and with 16GB available, there is ample memory for compiling shaders and textures to achieve optimal game performance.

Probably the best bang-for-buck GPU out of the 50-series lineup, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB comes with enough VRAM to rival the higher-tier cards, with enough raw compute to play your favourite games. PCIe 5, 4608 CUDA cores, and a compact twin-fan cooling setup make this GPU perfect for a smaller build. 

We've been testing the latest 50-series cards extensively and benchmarking them against some of the most popular game titles out there. You can see how the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB ranks in our review, where we put the Nvidia GPU through its paces. In the chart below, you can see where the RTX 5060 Ti ranks in regard to the geomean averages for rasterization in our suite of games. Placing middle of the pack in our chart, it beats out the previous generation RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, and slots in behind the RTX 5070.

The MSI Shadow 2X OC Plus RTX 5060 Ti 16GB comes in a compact size with a dual-fan cooling setup. The size makes it a good fit for a smaller form factor build where size matters, but you still want to have enough power to amp the framerates in your gaming sessions.

It's always inconvenient to have a different charger for each device to travel with. Your computer desires one, your phone another, and all of a sudden your bag is so heavy it's like carrying a brick with frustratingly knotted cables and big blocks. That's why taking along one charger to do it all is such a relief.

Right now, the Ugreen 65W Nexode GaN charger is on sale on Amazon to a mere $25, its lowest price ever in its entire history compared to its usual $43 (40% off). That's a massive saving for something that will be capable of replacing several of your current chargers simultaneously.

See at Amazon

The best part about this charger is rather simple: instead of needing to carry multiple adapters, you simply need to carry this small block. It has a powerful 65W output so it's able to power more demanding devices like a MacBook and charge it to half in 30 minutes. That is a game-changer if you're rushed and only need to top up and go. For everyday phones like an iPhone, Galaxy, or Pixel, fast charging is expected to get you out of the worry mode about running out of battery sooner.

We also love this model because of the port array: With three USB-C ports and one USB-A, you can charge four devices at once without slowing them down. So, imagine charging your laptop, phone, tablet and wireless earbuds all at once and watching them all hike back to 100%. It's handy for anyone who has to work with multiple devices every day.

This Ugreen charger also uses GaN technology: while the term may sound like something out of the tech lab, the benefit is straightforward. GaN miniaturizes chargers to a smaller, more efficient, safer size compared to old-school silicon. It protects the charger from overheating, saves energy wasted, and prevents your devices from exposure to hazardous fluctuations.

Measuring just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches and with a foldable plug, it's easy to throw in a backpack or even a jacket pocket without worrying about carrying yet another bulky gadget. If you've ever struggled to fit multiple chargers into a power strip or crammed ones with awkward shapes into a small carry-on, you'll appreciate how neatly this block fits without hogging space.

This price won't last long, so it makes sense to grab it now while it's at its all-time low.

Credit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers' personal information.

In a filing with Maine's attorney general's office on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers' personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations.

TransUnion claimed “no credit information was accessed,” but provided no immediate evidence for its claim. The data breach notice did not specify what specific types of personal data were stolen.

In a separate data breach disclosure filed later on Thursday with Texas' attorney general's office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers' names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

When reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company's data breach, or say what types of customers' personally identifiable information were taken. 

TransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the financial data of more than 260 million Americans. It's the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting the insurance, retail, and transportation and airline industries. 

Several companies, including Google, insurance giant Allianz Life, Cisco, and HR giant Workday, reported data breaches of customer data stored in their Salesforce-hosted cloud databases. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters.

It's not clear who is behind the breach at TransUnion, or if the hackers made any demands to the company.

Updated with a response from TransUnion, and updated with additional details from the Texas state filing.

Nvidia and Carbon Robotics' tractor-pulled device is designed to kill large areas of weeds

Nvidia has revealed a surprising partnership with an agricultural robotics company whose flagship product deals out instant laser death to fields full of weeds. The awe-inspiring Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2 packs in 24 high power lasers and 24 Nvidia GPUs to facilitate its claimed “10,000 weeds per minute” zapping performance. That's equivalent to 600,000 weeds per hour, or 167 weeds per second.

Though the claimed performance is amazing, we aren't talking about a compact, home garden-style device here. The flagship LaserWeeder G2 600 is a hulking tractor-pulled device spanning 20 feet. We note there are G2 models smaller than this flagship, but even the smallest G2 200 model is 110 x 85 x 127-inches and requires at least a 110hp tractor with 6,500 lbs lift capacity. The cut down size of the G2 200 reduces performance to 2,500 weeds per minute, which remains impressively rapid and equivalent to nearly 42 weeds per second.

Carbon Robotics is of course very positive about the qualities and performance of an AI and laser-powered weed control system. It highlights the trend of weeds becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides. It touts the sub-millimeter precision and identification accuracy of the Nvidia-accelerated ‘Large Plant Model' weed identification system, which ensures your crops don't fall to friendly fire. The robotics device is also a massive labor saver, outperforming “a hand crew of 75 people,” according to the product pages for the G2 600 model.

Interestingly, Carbon Robotics also aims to address the “global shortage of tractor drivers.” It is an autonomous retrofit for existing tractors, says the Nvidia blog. It can thus work long and ungodly hours. For extra safety, these autonomous tractors are said to be monitored via a remote operations center.

There are some downsides to devices like the G2, though. Such robotic machinery surely comes with a lofty price tag. Including the Nvidia GPUs and laser tech probably makes this tractor-pulled tech much more expensive than traditional farming machinery.

Also, those with experience of using devices which burn weeds will be aware that if a root survives, it sometimes doesn't take very long for it to spring right back up. Lastly, there is some added hazard here, due to the laser technology inadvertently injuring someone's eyes or skin. In arid areas, there may also be concerns about fires propagating from the fields to the surrounding countryside.

Thank you for calling Lockheed Martin, please hold

An accident report has revealed that a U.S. Air Force pilot spent 50 minutes on a conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers ahead of his plane plummeting to the ground and exploding in a fireball. Thankfully, the unnamed pilot ejected safely with just minor injuries, reports CNN, but the $200 million F-35 fighter jet was destroyed.

This incident took place on January 28, near Eielson Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. Investigations point towards the presence of water in hydraulic lines as the root cause of this military jet crash. But the investigator's report also suggests the pilot and engineering team's handling of the landing gear issue could have been better.

Shortly after take-off, the pilot ran into an issue with the F-35. The landing gear wouldn't retract correctly, so he sought to lower it again, but it then became locked at an angle, neither retracted nor correctly lowered… Running through operational check lists didn't remedy the situation.

Sensing the need for assistance, the pilot then decided to consult the experts. He managed to get a group of five Lockheed Martin engineers (the F-35's makers) to participate in a conference call. According to CNN's viewing of the incident report, five engineers were on the call: “a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three specialists in landing gear systems.”

We can't be sure of the advice given, but next in the chain of dramatic events was the pilot attempting two ‘touch and go' landings. During these procedures, the idea was to try and straighten out the landing gear. However, the nose wheel still couldn't be straightened.

Things actually got worse after the two dummy landing attempts. CNN notes that the left and right main landing gears also froze along with the nose wheel.

Now, flying the plane with multiple system errors was bad enough, but the plane then became “uncontrollable” as it started to operate in “automated ground-operation mode.”

Without proper flying mode power or controls, the pilot thus made the decision to eject. The pilot suffered a few minor injuries, but the $200m plane ended up in a fireball.

On inspection of the wreckage, the hydraulic system appears to have mistakenly been partly filled with water (a third of the fluid present). There should have been no water in these lines due to the extremely low temperatures aircraft endure at altitudes. CNN notes that on the day of the flight, the ground temperature was an already chilly -1 degree Fahrenheit (about -17 degrees Celsius).

Another F-35 at the same base was flown 9-days later, and suffered a similar hydraulic icing issue – but it was able to land safely.

Focusing back on the headlining fireball incident, and the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board concluded a mix of “crew decision making” and hydraulic fluid maintenance programs contributed to the crash.

This might seem harsh on the pilot and engineers. However, the engineers reportedly talked about a 2024 maintenance update during the conference call. If they had followed this updated guidance, then “they likely would have advised a planned full stop landing or a controlled ejection instead of a second touch-and-go,” says the report.

The world's largest living fish has plenty to fear from people. New research shows that a large proportion of whale sharks at a popular and protected tourism region bear scars caused by human activity.

A large group of marine scientists examined more than a decade's worth of whale shark sightings in the Bird's Head Seascape off Indonesia. Among other things, they found that over half of the sharks had injuries attributable to humans. Many of these injuries were preventable, the researchers say, and simple measures can be taken to ensure the safety of these gentle giants moving forward.

“[The] high percentage of injured whale sharks shows that even in protected zones, the whale shark interactions with fishing gear and tourism still pose risks to them,” study author Edy Setyawan, lead conservation scientist at the Elasmobranch Institute Indonesia, told Gizmodo.

Befitting its nickname, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is certainly hefty.

As adults, they commonly reach lengths between 30 and 40 feet (9 and 12 meters) and usually weigh around 18 tons; some get even larger. Despite their size, though, they're no ferocious sea monster. These slow-moving fish are filter feeders that suck up their meals from the surrounding water. Though they can eat large and small marine organisms alike, they typically stick to microscopic plankton.

Whale sharks can be found in warm and tropical waters all over the world, but their numbers have dwindled dramatically in recent decades, and they're classified as an endangered species. They face several human-made threats, including hunting, climate change, and bycatching (being unintentionally caught by fishing boats). And even with ongoing conservation efforts, their recovery has been slow, partly because it can take up to 30 years for the sharks to reach sexual maturity.

According to Edy Setyawan, previous studies looking at the population health of these sharks have been limited to short-term surveys or snapshots of a single location. In their new research, the team was able to analyze 13 years of sightings along the Bird's Head Seascape (2010 to 2023) from four regions of the area.

The seascape is well known for its diversity and is estimated to contain three-quarters of the world's coral species along with many other migrating species like the whale shark. The seascape is a popular destination for marine tourism and is covered by a network of 26 different Marine Protected Areas.

Though the researchers largely studied past data they themselves collected, they also relied on photos captured by tourism operators and citizen scientists. All told, they identified 268 unique whale sharks. Roughly 200 of these sharks sported visible injuries, they found. And of these, 80% had injuries determined to be human-caused (58.3% had injuries from natural causes, while some sharks had both).

On the positive side, severe injuries, including amputation, caused by humans were relatively rare (17.7%). The most common human-associated injuries were caused by sharks colliding into boats and bagans—floating platforms adorned with nets and lights used for fishing.

The team's findings were published Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Fishing and marine tourism are important parts of the local economy, including whale shark sighting tours. And while the increasing popularity of these tours could lead to more injured sharks, the researchers argue this doesn't have to be inevitable.

They lay out simple steps that can greatly cut down on whale shark injuries, such as stricter regulations that would compel bagan fishers and owners to remove the sharp edges from their platforms. Tourism-related measures, like limiting boat traffic, enforcing slow-speed zones, and promoting responsible diving and snorkeling practices, would further reduce harm, Setyawan said.

Not all the team's findings are dire. They've learned a lot about these majestic aquatic beasts, including the main regions they reside within the seascape. Most of the sharks found there were also young juvenile males, suggesting the area is an important nursery habitat for the species.

They next plan to track the annual population trends of whale sharks living in the seascape via satellite tags, which should also help them answer important questions like whether these populations migrate elsewhere.

Researchers at Wayne State University are pursuing new therapies for treating chemical injuries to the eyes with the help of a two-year, $400,400 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, a research scientist in the laboratory of Dr. Ashok Kumar, professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences at Wayne State University's School of Medicine, has been awarded the grant, "Harnessing Immunometabolism to Ameliorate the Pathology of Ocular Chemical Injuries," to support innovative studies into developing novel therapies to enhance corneal nerve repair and promote wound healing after ocular chemical injury - a pressing issue among military personnel exposed to harmful substances in combat and training environments.

Ocular chemical injuries can lead to chronic inflammation, corneal nerve damage, persistent pain, dry eye and even permanent vision loss. Unfortunately, current treatment options are often inadequate, offering only partial relief and sometimes leading to undesirable side effects."

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, research scientist

Singh's research aims to overcome these challenges by investigating the therapeutic potential of host-derived metabolites to reduce inflammation, promote corneal nerve regeneration and enhance wound healing.

"This project will serve as a proof of concept for leveraging endogenous metabolites to modulate immune responses and lessen disease severity following chemical injury," Singh explained. "By reprogramming immune cells and enhancing tissue repair, we aim to develop effective strategies to preserve vision and improve patient outcomes."

The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating immunometabolism, cell biology and advanced drug delivery technologies. One of its central innovations is the use of hydrogel-based platforms for delivering therapeutic metabolites. Compared to conventional eye drops, hydrogels provide sustained release, improved bioavailability and reduced dosing frequency - crucial advantages in field conditions with limited access to medical care.

"In the long term, this work has the potential to yield clinically translatable treatments that not only preserve vision but also lessen the emotional and economic burden on service members, their families and the broader health care system," said Kumar, who serves as the project's co-investigator.

"Department of Defense funding for health-related research is critical to ensure the health and welfare of our country's service members," said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "I look forward to seeing the results of this important research by Drs. Singh and Kumar, which aims to create novel treatment options that will be useful not only to those in the military, but others facing similar ocular injuries."

The award number for this grant from the U.S. Department of Defense is HT94252510634.

PFAs, also known as 'forever chemicals', account for nearly 9,000 different chemicals, some of which are already prohibited or heavily regulated. Their extensive use has left a lasting mark on both the environment and public health.

The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) are reviewing PFAs risks to guide REACH UK on potential updates to chemical safety laws.

Ensuring the safety of our food remains a fundamental public health priority. Experts say wider quality and safety checks are needed on more food products as shifting industrial processes alter environmental conditions.

Research has connected PFA exposure to cancer and to harmful effects on the immune, reproductive, and hormonal systems.

Since the 1960s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized some PFAs in food packaging for their non-stick, grease-proof, and water-resistant properties. The highest PFA concentrations are often found in molded fiber packaging such as takeaway bowls, plates, and food boxes.

The United States has passed more PFA laws than most other countries, including the United Kingdom. To improve food safety, the FDA introduced an official testing method (C-010.01) to detect PFAs in a variety of foods. This method was changed in December 2021 to version C-010.02.

In this regard, a useful Application Note for Method C-010.02 has been published. The updated C-010.02 method offers a fast, reliable way to measure PFAs in foods from dairy to baked goods, eggs, and vegetables.

Tired of the limits that come with purchasing conventional reference materials from stock catalogs? Sifting through endless catalogue pages with varying concentrations and matrices wastes valuable time, with no guarantee of finding the standard you need.

Many chemists avoid the tedious process entirely, instead mixing their own analytical standards in-house. However, this approach adds extra workload and considerable risk.

Luckily, there is a better solution. Custom certified reference materials (CRMs) from Inorganic Ventures are a simpler and faster approach to obtain the appropriate analytical standard reference material for your unique use case. Inorganic Ventures always encourages its clients to share the responsibility for establishing calibration standards.

Allow Inorganic Ventures to handle the burden of creating custom analytical standards depending on your specific requirements. This saves time and removes the risks of blending standards by hand.

Not sure that custom CRMs outperform analytical standards mixed in-house? Here are six reasons why you should trust Inorganic Ventures to create calibration solutions for your workflow rather than blending them yourself.

Combining single-element analytical standards into a viable solution requires both resources and time. Consider the administrative, equipment, and human costs of stocking and measuring reorder points per solution. These costs mount quickly into a significant ongoing expense.

Inorganic Ventures' analytical standards ensure that you pay only for what you need, making inventory management much easier. Its CRMs are ready for instant use without any additional preparation, and each standard can be diluted directly from the bottle.

When creating your own calibration standards, you are always responsible for providing verification.

Labs held to strict testing specifications must continuously ensure that every standard is generated to the highest possible standards. This requires a high level of confidence and organization. An audit can turn this into a high-pressure test of record-keeping.

With a custom CRM, all regulatory documents, including CoA and SDS, are prepared for you and ready for inspection. Its standards are manufactured and certified in accordance with ISO 17025 and ISO 17034 Scopes.

To err is human, and even experienced scientists make mistakes. When mixing analytical standards in-house, you will inevitably second-guess the validity of your data. Unfortunately, there is no margin for error in the analytical sector.

Mixing errors, whether in amounts, matrix composition, or other factors, can quickly undermine accuracy.

Common human errors that can jeopardize DIY standards include: 

Transpiration can progressively raise the concentration of your analytical standards over time. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this phenomenon when combining your own working standards in-house, as it is caused by water vapor penetration into the mixture, either through container walls or through the opening.

Inorganic Ventures' proprietary packaging technology minimizes transpiration, preserving CRM integrity for years. Transpiration Control Technology (TCT) prevents transpiration from the bottle by creating an equilibrium within the heat-sealed container.

Analytical standards packaged in this manner keep their integrity for up to four years after manufacturing.

Products can be stored in the TCT bag for up to three years, and then for another year after removal. The time and expense savings associated with regular inventory refilling are completely removed, thus alleviating your storage worries.

Analytical standards must be delivered in ultra-clean bottles, and the CRM is prepared using sterile laboratory equipment and clean beginning materials. It is possible to reproduce these stringent cleaning conditions in your own lab, but this is just another example of the work and cost implications of mixing calibration standards oneself.

The Inorganic Ventures team conducted comprehensive leaching experiments to determine contamination levels in all materials used to produce the CRMs. The team obtain the cleanest components (beginning materials, weigh boats, pipettes, bottles, and so on) and correctly leach them all to achieve the cleanest final analytical standard possible. 

Inorganic Ventures also has a separate clean room with a HEPA filtration system and ultra-high purity acids for manufacture. This safeguards against environmental contamination at every stage. 

If your results are incorrect, it might be incredibly difficult to identify the cause of the error. Simple mistakes, such as going over volume, will necessitate boiling the concentrate, usually in glass, which may introduce more pollutants. The only solution is to start afresh.

Despite advances in insulin therapy and automated delivery systems, people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) still face a daily struggle: manually dosing insulin before meals. Current insulin options - rapid-acting or ultra-rapid analogs - are too slow to match the body's natural insulin response, making full automation elusive.

A new research project at Wayne State University, supported by a $300,000 grant from Breakthrough T1D International, aims to change that. Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, is developing a next-generation ultra-rapid insulin designed to dramatically accelerate insulin action and remove the need for user input at mealtime.

Our goal is to create an insulin that acts fast enough to truly mimic the human pancreas. When combined with advanced insulin delivery algorithms, this could make fully automated systems a reality and help patients manage their condition with fewer interruptions to daily life."

Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, Wayne State University

By addressing the limitations of current insulin analogs in terms of speed, onset and duration, the project has the potential to significantly improve glycemic control and reduce the burden of disease management for people with T1D.

Since joining Wayne State in 2013, Cao has received more than $6 million in external funding for diabetes-related research, including multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health and Breakthrough T1D.

Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State, praised the project's potential and the university's role in advancing human health through translational research.

"Type 1 diabetes affects millions of individuals and families, often beginning in childhood," said Obasi. "Dr. Cao's research is critical in helping to move us closer to an improved treatment that will bring new hope to those living with the disease. This funding underscores the importance of sustained investment in research to impact lives now and in the future."

Dr. Ali Abolmaali, dean of the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, said Cao's work exemplifies the college's commitment to solving real-world health challenges.

"This project is a testament to how engineering research can directly improve lives," said Abolmaali. "We're proud to support faculty like Dr. Cao, whose work bridges science, medicine and technology to serve the public good."

Breakthrough T1D International is a leading global funder of T1D research, supporting projects that accelerate the development of treatments and technologies to improve the lives of people affected by the disease.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. A key reason for its high death toll is that it often goes undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Although modern colonoscopy has greatly improved the early detection of precancerous lesions, determining which ones are likely to become cancerous remains a challenge-especially during the procedure itself. A new study published in Biophotonics Discovery may offer a promising solution.

A team led by researchers at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal tested an advanced imaging method that uses the natural glow (or autofluorescence) of tissues when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Importantly, this approach doesn't require any dyes or contrast agents. By analyzing how long this autofluorescence lasts-called "fluorescence lifetime"-the researchers could detect subtle differences in the tissue's biochemistry. Combined with machine learning, this label-free method could distinguish benign from malignant lesions in real time.

The researchers collected fresh tissue samples from 117 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. They scanned each specimen using a fiber-optic probe and a dual-laser autofluorescence lifetime system, which illuminated the tissue at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 445 nm) to excite various molecules like collagen and cellular coenzymes. This setup captured data from multiple optical channels, tracking how each type of tissue responded to the light over time. These measurements were then matched to pathology diagnoses to serve as training data for an AI-based classification model.

Using an ensemble learning technique known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), the model was trained to recognize patterns in the spectroscopic data that correspond to benign or cancerous tissue. On the training set, the model achieved 87 percent accuracy, with a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 83 percent and a specificity (true negative rate) of 90 percent. When tested on a separate set of new samples, the model performed almost as well, with 85 percent accuracy, 85 percent sensitivity, and 85 percent specificity.

In practical terms, this means the system was able to identify cancerous tissues with high reliability based only on their autofluorescence signatures. Even when applied to individual measurement points-rather than larger tissue regions-the model generated useful probability maps that highlighted tumor areas. These findings suggest that the technology could one day guide doctors during colonoscopy or surgery, helping them decide which lesions to remove and where to focus their attention.

The study also investigated whether the complex imaging system could be simplified without sacrificing accuracy. The results showed that using a reduced set of optical channels-focusing on the most informative biochemical signals-still produced strong performance, potentially lowering the cost and complexity of future clinical devices.

Although more work is needed to improve accuracy, especially for early or borderline lesions, and to expand testing to larger and more diverse patient groups, this research marks an important step toward integrating real-time, AI-guided optical diagnostics into routine colorectal cancer care. It could eventually help reduce unnecessary biopsies, shorten procedures, and ensure that dangerous lesions aren't missed.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition with significant health implications worldwide. In Nigeria, data on its prevalence and characteristics are limited, highlighting the need for comprehensive studies to better understand its epidemiology and clinical features in the region. This study aimed to assess the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and management challenges of IBD among patients undergoing colonoscopy in Nigeria.

Over five years (2019–2024), a multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted involving clinicians across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. It included a retrospective review of records from 18 centers. Data collection was conducted in two phases via Google Forms, focusing on care practices and detailed case information, including demographics, clinical features, histology, and treatment. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and tests for associations, with significance set at p < 0.05.

A total of 459 suspected IBD cases (9.7%) were identified among over 4,700 colonoscopies, with histological confirmation in 208 cases (4.4%), indicating the prevalence of IBD in the Nigerian patient population. The most common subtype was ulcerative colitis (53.9%), followed by Crohn's disease (21.0%) and indeterminate colitis (25.0%). Regional variations were observed, with higher diagnosis rates in some zones (North-West: 14.9%; South-East: 1.4%). The predominant clinical feature was rectal bleeding. Endoscopic findings frequently showed pan-colitis (62%), with significant regional differences (p < 0.001), and management mainly involved medications such as acetylsalicylic acid derivatives (60.0%), with surgical options rarely employed (0.6%). Challenges included high medication costs and limited availability, which affected nearly half of the patients (49.4%; 46.2%).

The findings of this multicenter survey illuminate the pressing issues surrounding IBD in Nigeria, drawing attention to its prevalence, complex clinical presentations, and significant management challenges. The data reveal critical similarities and differences compared to findings in West Africa, other regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The lower prevalence in Nigeria and other African studies reflects unique genetic and environmental factors influencing IBD development. Demographic trends indicate a younger population affected by IBD in Nigeria, consistent with regional observations. However, disparities in clinical presentations, treatment modalities, and barriers to care highlight broader challenges within the Nigerian healthcare system that warrant urgent attention.

Food allergies affect more than half a billion people worldwide. In severe cases, even a small bite of the wrong food can trigger anaphylaxis - a rapid, body-wide allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, a dangerous drop in blood pressure and even death.

Scientists have long understood how injected allergens - like those in lab tests or insect stings - trigger anaphylaxis. But researchers have puzzled over how anaphylaxis begins in the gut after eating a food allergen.

Now, Arizona State University researchers, in collaboration with a team led by Yale University and other partners, have pinpointed a surprising culprit: specialized immune cells in the intestine that produce powerful chemical messengers.

These chemical messengers can cause muscles in the airways and gut to contract, increase mucus production and boost inflammation. They're already known to play a role in asthma attacks. This study shows they are also key drivers of severe food allergy reactions that start in the gut.

The findings, published in the current issue of Science, reveal that reactions to allergens in the gut are fundamentally different from reactions to allergens entering the bloodstream directly.

Until now, we assumed that anaphylaxis followed the same pathway regardless of where allergens entered the body, with histamine from mast cells as the main driver. Our study shows that when allergens are ingested, a specialized set of mast cells in the gut don't release histamine - instead, they produce lipid-based molecules called leukotrienes. These molecules, rather than histamine, trigger anaphylaxis in the gastrointestinal tract."

Esther Borges Florsheim, ASU researcher 

Florsheim is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes and assistant professor with the School of Life Sciences at ASU. 

In both food and systemic allergies, immune cells called mast cells play a central role. When these cells detect an allergen via antibodies called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, they burst open, releasing chemicals that cause swelling, low blood pressure and other symptoms.

In the bloodstream, the most important of these chemicals is histamine, which is why antihistamines can help in some allergic situations. However, the new research shows that when an allergen is ingested, mast cells in the intestinal lining respond differently. They make relatively little histamine. Instead, they ramp up production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of inflammatory lipids already known to constrict airways in conditions like asthma.

In the gut lining, intestinal mast cells take cues from nearby epithelial cells. These cues shift the cells' activity, so they make more leukotrienes and less histamine. Detailed genetic and chemical analyses showed that intestinal mast cells come in several subtypes. Compared to mast cells elsewhere in the body, mast cells in the gut were primed to make leukotrienes.

Previous research found that blocking the IgE pathway - either by removing IgE antibodies or the receptor they bind to on mast cells - protected against developing severe symptoms. 

To test whether leukotrienes were truly driving the reaction, the team used zileuton, an FDA-approved drug used to treat asthma, which blocks a crucial enzyme needed to make leukotrienes. 

The results showed the drug reduced allergy symptoms and provided protection from a dangerous drop in body temperature - a hallmark of anaphylaxis.

Importantly, the same drug did not prevent reactions caused by allergens injected into the bloodstream. That finding showed that the gut pathway is different from the whole-body allergic pathway and has its own chemical drivers.

Current emergency treatments for severe allergic reactions, such as epinephrine, are aimed at quickly reversing symptoms once anaphylaxis starts. Antihistamines can help in mild reactions, but they are far less effective for preventing severe events - especially those triggered by food.

The new findings suggest that targeting leukotrienes could offer a new preventive or therapeutic approach for food-triggered anaphylaxis. 

More research is still needed to test whether the results from this study can be applied to humans. However, drugs that block leukotriene production (like zileuton) or leukotriene receptors (such as montelukast, also commonly used for asthma) are already approved for other uses, which could speed up testing for food allergy applications.

Beyond the potential clinical applications, the work changes how scientists think about allergic reactions. It shows that how an allergen gets into the body - through the skin, bloodstream or gut - can shape the type of immune response involved.

"This finding highlights the gut as unique in how it senses allergens and potentially other harmful environmental challenges, such as food additives," Florsheim says. "It also helps explain a long-standing puzzle: why levels of food-specific antibodies, especially IgE, do not reliably predict the risk of food allergy."

The researchers plan to follow up by studying whether similar mast cell populations and leukotriene-driven pathways exist in human intestines, and whether blocking them can reduce or prevent severe reactions in people with life-threatening food allergies.

For women diagnosed with early breast cancer, the long-term risk of developing a second primary cancer is low (around 2-3% greater than women in the general population), finds a study published by The BMJ today.

The researchers say this information can help reassure many breast cancer survivors who believe their risk of a second primary cancer is much higher than these results suggest.

Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers, but risk estimates from previous studies are inconsistent. The risk and type of a second cancer can also be affected by the initial treatment received, as well as social, lifestyle and genetic factors.

To address this uncertainty, researchers used data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service for England to estimate the long-term risks of second primary cancers compared with the general population, and the various factors associated with these risks.

Their findings are based on 476,373 women diagnosed in England from 1993 to 2016 with early invasive breast cancer at ages 20-75 years who underwent surgery.

Over a follow-up period of up to 20 years, 64,747 women developed a second primary cancer, but the absolute excess risks compared with risks in the general population were small. 

By 20 years, 13.6% of women had developed a non-breast cancer (mainly womb, lung or bowel cancer), 2.1% more than expected in the general population, and 5.6% had developed a contralateral breast cancer (on the other side of the body), 3.1% more than expected.

When patients were grouped by age at first breast cancer diagnosis, the excess risk of a second non-breast cancer varied little across age groups. However, the excess risk of a contralateral breast cancer was greater in younger than in older women.

For example, for a woman whose first breast cancer was diagnosed when aged 60, her estimated risks of developing a new cancer by the age of 80 are 17% for non-breast cancer and 5% for contralateral breast cancer compared to risks of 15% and 3% respectively for women of the same age in the general population.

For a woman diagnosed when aged 40, her estimated risks of developing a second cancer by the age of 60 are 6% for both non-breast and contralateral breast cancer compared to 4% and 2% respectively for women in the general population.

When patients were grouped according to other (adjuvant) treatments they received after surgery, radiotherapy was associated with higher rates of contralateral breast and lung cancers, endocrine therapy with uterine cancer (along with reduced contralateral breast cancer), and chemotherapy with acute leukaemia.

Based on these results, the researchers estimate that around 7% of excess second cancers may be due to the use of adjuvant therapies, but note that their benefits outweigh this small risk in almost all circumstances where these treatments are recommended.

The authors acknowledge that their findings may be affected by incomplete cancer registry data for some variables. What's more, they did not have information on family history, genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices such as smoking.

However, this long-term study describes the development of second cancers according to multiple patient, tumour and treatment characteristics amongst all women with early invasive breast cancer so the findings can reliably inform breast cancer patients and the clinicians who treat and support them.

They are also relevant to clinical practice and policy, and may help inform the design of future studies to assess cancer risk.

These results are reassuring and should be shared widely, say patients in a linked opinion article, who note that finding detailed information on the risks of second cancers after breast cancer was particularly difficult.

In general, the benefits of treatments in protecting patients from recurrence of breast cancer far outweigh the potential downsides, the patients write. Such information should be available and offered by clinicians at the time that adjuvant therapies are discussed.

They acknowledge that not everyone will want all the details at diagnosis, but say it should be there for those who do want it and for those who seek it later. "Information on risks should be readily available. It helps us to plan our lives and think ahead to the future," they conclude.

Investigators at Mass General Brigham and the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have uncovered how patients' healthcare spending has changed following the implementation of the No Surprises Act in 2022, a bipartisan law prohibiting unexpected or "surprise" bills after patients receive out-of-network medical care. The team found that the law dramatically reduced out-of-pocket costs, with an average annual savings of nearly $600 per patient. The findings are published in The BMJ.

"One in five insured adults in the U.S. incurred surprise bills before the No Surprises Act, and these bills frequently exceeded thousands of dollars, resulting in substantial financial hardship among patients," said lead author Michael Liu, MD, MPhil, a clinical fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and research fellow at the Smith Center. "Government agencies have called for rigorous evaluations of the law, and we believe our paper is the first to do so."

Liu and his colleagues analyzed data on 17,351 adults aged 19-64 years with direct-purchase private insurance. Some resided in intervention states that gained protections from the No Surprises Act and others resided in control states that already had laws providing comprehensive surprise billing protections and therefore did not gain additional protections from the law.

After implementation of the No Surprises Act, out-of-pocket medical spending declined significantly in intervention states-nearly $600 annually per patient-but not in control states, indicating that the law was successful in protecting patients from surprise medical bills. Although experts initially projected that premium spending (fixed monthly payments to insurance companies) would decline because the law was supposed to promote fair payment negotiations between insurers and providers, the researchers observed that such spending was unchanged after the law. "This finding is in line with anecdotal reports that providers-especially those backed by private equity firms-are leveraging loopholes and unfair tactics to secure higher payments at the expense of patients and the healthcare system," said Liu.

Importantly, the No Surprises Act did not meaningfully reduce high burden medical spending, defined as a family spending more than 10% of their income on health care, suggesting that opportunities remain to build upon the law and pursue additional policy strategies to reduce healthcare-related financial strain, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

Our findings have important implications for patients and should inform ongoing policy efforts to prevent financial toxicity and address the healthcare affordability crisis in the U.S."

Bulimia nervosa (BN), or bulimia, is a mental health disorder characterized by binge eating and a fear of gaining weight, which drives people to try and avoid weight gain, usually by compensatory (vomiting etc.). Over time, this binge–purge cycle harms both physical and mental health of the individual, leading to problems like dehydration, low blood pressure, depression, and even self-harm. BN mostly affects young women and often begins in their teenage years, with studies showing that up to three percent of women may experience BN at some point in their lives, putting them at higher risk if left untreated.

BN is thought to develop from harmful learned habits that can be changed with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This approach helps people break the binge–purge cycle by challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to dieting and body weight. However, for many people, especially those living far away from specialist clinics, accessing face-to-face therapy is not always easy or even possible.

Now, in the first study of its kind conducted in Asia, an international team of researchers have shown that CBT can also be effective when delivered online. Their findings suggest that guided internet-based CBT (ICBT) can help people who otherwise struggle to get specialist care.

The study was conducted by Dr. Sayo Hamatani from the Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Japan, and included several co-authors, such as Dr. Kazuki Matsumoto from Kagoshima University, Japan; Dr. Gerhard Andersson from Linköping University in Sweden; and Dr. Yoshifumi Mizuno from the University of Fukui, along with researchers from Tohoku University Hospital, Chiba University, Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, and Tokushima University. The results were published online in Volume 8 of the journal JAMA Network Open on August 05, 2025.

"We undertook this study to lower barriers to accessing specialist care and help create a society where people can receive high-quality treatment regardless of where they live. By establishing a specialist online therapy that can be delivered at home, even patients in remote areas or with busy schedules will find it easier to continue treatment, supporting early intervention and preventing progression to more severe forms," explains Dr. Hamatani as she speaks of the motivation behind the study.

The researchers assessed the efficacy of guided ICBT by comparing it to that of usual care. To this end, they recruited 61 women between the age of 13–65 years (average age: 28 years), who were randomly assigned either to an intervention group that received guided ICBT or to a control group that continued with usual care. The program lasted 12 weeks, during which participants in the ICBT group worked through weekly online modules adapted for Japanese patients and received support from a therapist through an online platform. The program included strategies to help people resist urges to binge and purge, such as exercises to face triggers in a safe way and activities to help reshape negative views about their own bodies.

When the researchers compared the results at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention, they found that women in the ICBT group showed significantly reduced binge eating and compensatory behaviors compared to those in the usual care group, with an average decrease of about 10 episodes in total. The percentage of women whose symptoms improved enough to be considered in remission, rose from just 13% with usual care to up to 55% with ICBT. Participants also reported feeling more satisfied with the online program, with more than 75% stating they would return to this treatment program if they needed help again.

These findings strongly make the case for continued support as essential for treating BN and preventing the condition from becoming more severe. Making CBT available online could very well be a game-changer for people who cannot easily access a clinic. "With insurance support and integration into healthcare systems, this approach could reach many more people and play a key role in treating BN," highlights Dr. Hamatani.

Developing a system based on this study could potentially lead to high-quality care, promoting equitable mental healthcare and improving the overall quality-of-life among patients with BN.

A novel, multi-analyte test developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Ludwig Center and the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurosurgery can accurately identify brain cancers using small samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a promising new tool to guide clinical decision-making. 

The findings, supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, were published Aug. 25 in Cancer Discovery and demonstrate that combining multiple biological markers, including tumor-derived DNA and immune cell signatures, is more effective for diagnosing central nervous system cancers than using any one marker alone. 

"This study highlights how much more information we can gain when we evaluate several analytes together," says senior study author Chetan Bettegowda, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Cushing Professor and Director of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, director of the Reza Khatib Brain Tumor Research Center at Johns Hopkins, medical director of the Ludwig Center, and a senior author on the study. "The ability to detect cancers with high specificity and also gain insight into the immune environment of the brain could be an important advance in the care of patients with brain tumors." 

To evaluate the potential of a multi-analyte approach, investigators analyzed 206 CSF samples, including samples from patients with high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, metastases and central nervous system lymphomas. Their test, called CSF-BAM (cerebrospinal fluid–B/T cell receptor, aneuploidy and mutation), measured chromosomal abnormalities, tumor-specific mutations, and T and B cell receptor sequences. In combination, these markers identified brain cancers with more than 80% sensitivity (ability to detect cancer) and 100% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer-free) in the validation cohort. The 100% specificity means no false positives were recorded among individuals with noncancerous conditions. 

The study also showed that the assay could distinguish between the immune cell populations present in cancer and noncancer cases, offering additional biological context that could be helpful in more-challenging clinical scenarios. Investigators say this ability to categorize T and B cell populations in the CSF provides insights into both disease presence and immune response. 

Many patients with brain lesions face invasive diagnostic procedures to confirm a cancer diagnosis. A tool like this could help us make better-informed decisions about who really needs a biopsy and who doesn't."

Christopher Douville, M.D., assistant professor of oncology and senior study author

Researchers say the test could be particularly useful for cases in which conventional imaging or cytology is inconclusive, or in situations when obtaining tissue for diagnosis is risky or not possible. The multi-analyte approach, they say, enables clinicians to better detect cancer and better understand the disease status, supporting a more tailored approach to patient care.

Scientists in Australia are launching one of the most comprehensive trials to date to test whether ditching plastics in food, personal care, and household products can lower internal chemical loads and improve markers of cardiometabolic health.

In a recent public health protocol published in BMJ Open, researchers describe the PERTH (Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health) trial, a new randomized controlled study protocol designed to investigate whether a comprehensive, 4-week "low-plastic" diet and lifestyle intervention can reduce exposure to plastic-derived chemicals.

These chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors with documented links to obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The PERTH trial examines whether a cohort of 60 adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, provided with all-plastic-free food, cookware, and personal care products, can demonstrate measurable reductions in plastic-associated chemical excretion and exploratory changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers.

From the top of Mt. Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, plastics from food packaging, kitchen utensils, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies can be found everywhere and comprise an inescapable part of modern life. Alarmingly, in addition to their ecological and environmental impacts, a growing body of scientific literature reports extensive physiological concerns associated with them.

Two classes of chemicals commonly used in plastics: 1. bisphenols (like Bisphenol A [BPA]) and 2. phthalates (like diethyl phthalate [DEP]) are known endocrine disruptors. Observational research has linked higher exposure to these “plastic-associated chemicals (PACs)” with various adverse physiological outcomes, including obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation.

Clinical evidence suggests these outcomes substantially increase individuals' risk and severity of cardiometabolic disease. Unfortunately, whether actively and drastically reducing PAC exposure can reverse previous harm remains to be investigated through controlled intervention studies.

The present public health protocol details the proposed methodology of the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of a low-plastic lifestyle intervention on measurable health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors.

The study will involve 60 community-dwelling adults (aged 18–60 years) in Perth, Australia, who have established cardiometabolic risk factors. Study inclusion criteria include: 1. A body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², and 2. A high waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women). The study will randomly assign participants into a case (“intervention”; n = 30) or control (n = 30) group.

The intervention period will last four weeks, during which time the intervention cohort participants will receive a comprehensive, all-inclusive low-plastic lifestyle package. This includes: 1. Delivering all food and beverages in plastic-free packaging, 2. Replacement plastic-free kitchenware (e.g., stainless steel pots, glass containers), 3. Personal care products (such as shampoo and soap), and 4. Cleaning supplies.

Interventional group participants will receive detailed instructions on how to minimize plastic exposure in their daily lives. In contrast, the control group will be asked to maintain their routine lifestyle and dietary patterns.

Study outcomes will be measured by evaluating the change in a composite z-score of urinary bisphenol concentrations (BPA and BPS) between participants in the intervention and control groups. Secondary and tertiary outcomes will include changes in urinary phthalate metabolites and a range of key health markers, including cardiometabolic biomarkers, blood pressure, and body composition. Participants will also collect their own stool and nasal lavage samples to support exploratory analyses.

Participants' sociodemographic information will be recorded at baseline, and all biomedical measurements will be taken at baseline, midpoint (week 2), and at the end of the 4-week intervention.

By providing all food and products to the intervention group, the PERTH trial will be the most comprehensive and rigorously controlled trial ever conducted on the topic. Impressively, pilot trials have already revealed that BPA was detectable in over 91% of urine samples derived from healthy (no cardiometabolic disease) adults, confirming that PAC exposure is widespread in Australia.

These pilots further demonstrated that a 7-day low-plastic intervention could significantly reduce urinary PAC levels, providing a strong basis for this larger, longer trial. Notably, while laboratory staff will be blinded to participant allocation, both participants and investigators cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention.

Finally, the PERTH study leverages the Plastic-Associated Chemical-exposure Questionnaire (PACeQ) to meticulously track and assess all potential routes of plastic exposure (ingestion, inhalation, and absorption), ensuring robust and trustworthy results. The protocol also highlights the ethical rationale for the holistic intervention approach, as it avoids artificial PAC exposure in controls due to safety concerns.

The PERTH trial is a critically important study that will provide the first protocolised attempt to test the causal effects of whether a comprehensive reduction in exposure to everyday plastic chemicals can lead to exploratory improvements in cardiometabolic health markers.

Study outcomes have the potential to significantly impact public health guidelines, inform regulatory policy on the use of chemicals in consumer products, and empower individuals with practical, evidence-based strategies to reduce their body's plastic burden. While the study's Australian focus prevents its global generalizability, it comprises the first significant step from observational links to real-world interventions.

From "no added sugar" to "organic goodness," infant and toddler foods in New Zealand are overloaded with promotional claims, many of which may mislead parents and blur the line between marketing and nutrition.

Products averaged 7.5 distinct claims each, ranging wildly from just 3 claims up to a cluttered 15 claims per package.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition & Dietetics, researchers found that all commercial toddler and infant food products in New Zealand had multiple on-pack claims.

Nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life can influence health and well-being. Early life is a period of rapid growth and could shape healthy eating patterns. Therefore, optimal nutrition in early childhood is central to healthy growth, development, and well-being. The Nutrient and Promotion Profile Model (NPPM) of the World Health Organization provides a framework for developing effective policy and legal measures to ensure the sale of appropriate toddler and infant foods.

NPPM recommends that commercial toddler and infant foods not carry nutrition, health, composition, or marketing claims. The paper highlights a key regulatory gap, as the current Australia-New Zealand Food Standards Code does not address marketing claims (such as those related to taste or convenience). Infant and toddler food labeling has been identified as an area of concern by the Food Regulation Standing Committee (FRSC) of New Zealand and Australia, as caregivers struggle to determine which foods align with the Healthy Eating Guidelines for New Zealand Babies and Toddlers.

"Free from" claims for artificial flavors and colors topped the list, appearing on 72% and 71% of products respectively, even more than "no added sugar" (53%).

The present study aimed to identify on-pack claims on commercial toddler and infant foods in New Zealand. First, all relevant toddler and infant food products were identified through the Nutritrack database. Data were annually collected from four major supermarket chains in New Zealand. Images of foods and beverages were taken, and data from the photos were entered into a database. To account for products new to the market since the last data collection, this was supplemented by an online supermarket search in January 2024, which identified 21 additional products. Products were classified into 59 categories and 15 food groups.

The study used products categorized as baby foods, which included products indicated on-pack as intended for toddlers and infants. Additionally, the food groups of dairy and snack foods were examined to identify other foods suitable for toddlers and infants. Infant products were defined as those intended for ages < 12 months. Toddler products were those designed for ages 12 to <36 months. Infant formulas, toddler milks, and follow-on formulas were excluded from the analysis.

The identified products were stratified into 14 food categories or subcategories based on the NPPM. The presence/absence of nutrition, composition, marketing, and health claims was identified. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the frequency of claims by food category and overall. The frequency of products with imagery of fruits or vegetables was also examined.

Snacks and finger foods displaying vegetable images often relied on powdered forms, contributing to their low average vegetable content of just 11.4%.

The researchers identified 210 toddler and infant food products. These included 43 toddler products and 167 infant products. Most products (35%) were vegetable and fruit purees, followed by snacks and finger foods (28%), and savory meals (24%). On average, each product had 7.5 unique claims. All products carried a marketing claim, 19% featured a health claim, and 99% had a nutrition or composition claim.

Nutrition and composition claims were the most common, with an average of four claims per product, followed by marketing claims (3.3 claims) and health claims (0.2 claims). Further, “free from” claims, relating to the absence of ingredients generally perceived to be harmful, were the most prevalent nutrition or composition claims found on 97% of products; “free from” claims most commonly referred to added sugars, flavors, colors, salt, and preservatives.

Approximately 68% of products featured words such as "fresh," "organic," "natural," or "real" on their packaging. Most products with a health claim were found in the dry cereals and starches (77%) and snacks and finger foods (34%) categories. The most common health claim was related to beneficial health and development, and these claims were more than twice as prevalent on toddler foods (found on 33% of products) compared to infant foods (15%). The most common marketing claims were related to ideal texture, taste, optimum feeding, high quality, and lifestyle or convenience.

Further, 58% of products featured images of fruits, 88% of which contained processed fruit sugars. The percentage of fruit in products with fruit imagery ranged from 0% to 100%. One-fifth of products with fruit imagery had less than 5% fruit. Vegetable images were found on the packaging of 36% of products. Most products were savory meals or purees, containing an average of 49% vegetables. Beyond imagery, the study also found that the product names themselves were often misleading. For 27% of products, the name did not accurately reflect the ingredients in the order they appear. For example, a product named ‘Organic Lamb and Garden Vegetables' implied that lamb was the main ingredient, when in fact it contained only 10% lamb compared to 90% vegetables.

Among the 27% of products with misleading names, a striking 24 out of 27 were savory meals overstating the prominence of meat or chicken.

Commercial foods for infants and toddlers in New Zealand were saturated with claims, with all products featuring at least three unique claims. Composition and nutrition claims were the most common category. Marketing claims were also common, while health claims were less frequent. One-fourth of products featured all three categories of claims.

Besides, a combined 88% of products featured vegetable and/or fruit imagery. Similar types and numbers of claims were found on infant and toddler foods, except for health claims that were more prevalent on toddler foods. The paper notes that previous research confirms these claims can be powerful, with one study finding that ‘free from' claims can promote inaccurate perceptions of a product's healthiness and influence purchasing choices. Overall, regulations are needed to restrict the use of claims and align them with best practices, thereby preventing caregivers from being misled by these promotional messages.

A landmark UK Biobank study reveals that not all additives are equal: while sugars, sweeteners, and flavorings drive higher mortality, gelling agents may offer protection, reshaping how we view the risks of ultra-processed foods.

In a recent article in the journal eClinicalMedicine, researchers in Germany investigated whether specific markers of ultra-processing (MUPs) are associated with mortality, beyond the established links between ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and poor health.

Their findings indicate that certain types of sugar, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavor enhancers, and flavors were associated with a higher risk of mortality, as was overall UPF intake.

Flavour additives dominated UK supermarket foods, appearing in 13.6% of total food intake on average, more than any other MUP category analyzed in the study.

UPFs are highly industrially processed items that are typically rich in fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients such as fiber, protein, and vitamins. These foods are marketed aggressively and valued for their convenience, often replacing healthier dietary options.

The consumption of UPFs has been rising globally, with countries such as the UK and the USA deriving more than 50% of their total energy intake from them, compared with around 10% in Italy.

This trend is concerning, as UPFs have consistently been associated with obesity, weight gain, and numerous negative health outcomes. Consequently, several national dietary guidelines recommend limiting UPF intake.

Food processing is commonly classified using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods into four groups. UPFs fall under NOVA group 4 and can be identified through MUPs. These include cosmetic additives such as sweeteners, flavors, and colors, as well as non-culinary ingredients like modified oils or fructose.

A food is classified as UPF if it contains at least one MUP. Although UPFs have been strongly linked to mortality, no studies have directly examined whether specific MUPs contribute equally to these risks. This knowledge gap is critical, as certain additives may lead to negative health outcomes, while others may not.

Assessing portion sizes required creative solutions: When packaging data was unavailable, researchers turned to the UK Food Standards Agency's standard portion guides to estimate grams consumed.

Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study of over 500,000 adults recruited between 2006 and 2010.

For this study, 186,744 participants aged 40–75 years were included after applying exclusions for missing information, implausible dietary reports, and pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes or malabsorption disorders. Dietary intake was assessed using up to five 24-hour web-based food recalls completed per participant.

To estimate UPF and MUP consumption, researchers matched each food item reported to up to ten commercial products from UK supermarkets. Ingredient lists were analyzed for 57 possible MUPs grouped into nine categories, with 37 of these found in at least one product. For each food item, a Marker Likelihood Index (MLI) was calculated based on the proportion of commercial products containing a specific MUP.

The proportion of intake from UPFs or specific MUPs for each participant was calculated relative to total food intake (expressed as a percentage of total food intake, %TFI).

Mortality data were obtained from national health registries, with follow-up until December 2022 (mean follow-up 11.0 years).

Statistical analyses used Cox proportional hazard regression models with penalized cubic splines to examine associations between MUP intake and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, alcohol intake, BMI, ethnicity, health status, education, psychiatric history, income, physical activity, blood pressure, sex, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings.

Even cumulative exposure to multiple MUPs mattered: Total intake across all markers showed a significant link to higher mortality risk, beyond individual MUP effects.

The participants were 58 years old on average, and 57% were female; UPF intake accounted for an average of 20.0% of their total food intake. Over 11 years of follow-up, 10,203 deaths occurred. Higher UPF consumption was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk (HR-nadir) at 18% TFI and risk rising beyond that intake level.

When examining specific MUPs, five categories – flavour, flavour enhancers, colouring agents, sweeteners, and varieties of sugar – showed strong positive associations with mortality risk at specific intake levels:

In contrast, no associations were observed for processing aids, modified oils, protein sources, or fibre.

At the individual level, 13 specific MUPs were significantly related to mortality. These included glutamate and ribonucleotides (flavor enhancers); acesulfame, saccharin, and sucralose (sweeteners); caking agents, firming agents, thickeners (processing aids); and fructose, inverted sugar, lactose, and maltodextrin (sugars). Notably, gelling agents (processing aids) showed an inverse association with mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results, especially for UPF, flavour, coloring agents, and sweeteners.

Results held firm after excluding early deaths: Sensitivity analyses removed participants who died within 2 years of dietary assessment, reducing concerns about reverse causation.

This exploratory study is the first to assess broad categories and specific MUPs in relation to mortality, showing associations between higher mortality risk and both overall UPF intake as well as several MUPs (flavors, flavor enhancers, coloring agents, sweeteners, and sugars).

The findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence linking these additives to weight gain, metabolic disruption, and alterations in gut microbiota. The inverse association for gelling agents (possibly due to pectin content) highlights significant variation in health effects across additives.

Strengths include the large cohort size, extended follow-up, and novel MUP-based classification using commercial product analysis, which enhances objectivity compared with predefined UPF food lists. However, as an exploratory analysis, limitations include reliance on self-reported dietary data, potential residual confounding, limited power for rarer MUPs, and the ‘healthy volunteer' bias of the UK Biobank.

These results highlight specific MUPs, such as flavorings, colorings, sweeteners, certain processing aids (e.g., thickeners), and sugars, as potential drivers of UPF-related health risks. Replication and exploration of mechanisms in future research are needed.

I spent the earlier part of this week living under the stars, in a tent deep inside Yellowstone National Park, with only a patchy cellphone signal, no internet or television. It wasn't quite an Aaron Rodgers retreat but it was an amazing experience.

Anyone who has ever ‘disconnected' in that manner, understands the value that it brings. You have time to break free from the constant demands of everyday life, to refocus and renew before re-emerging with fresh energy.

But when I came out of the retreat and saw Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the upcoming games against South Korea and Japan, I wondered for half a second if I wasn't now living in an alternative reality.

Almost half of Pochettino's 23-man squad is made up of players from Major League Soccer ,as he continues to experiment with new players while the likes of Weston McKennie at Juventus, Johnny Cardoso of Atlético Madrid, Yunus Musah at AC Milan and Tanner Tessmann at Lyon have been left out.

We are nine months away from the start of the World Cup on home soil and the coach is still experimenting, still familiarizing himself with the player pool and still ‘sending messages' to players? Really?

At this stage, I would expect the national team coach to be focused on his core starting team and supporting cast, getting players familiar with their roles, the partnerships that are so vital across the field and the group dynamics that need to be fine tuned before competing with the world's elite.

Of course, there is always room for bringing in a form player or two or trying out alternative options and testing the depth of his roster. And there is some validity in Pochettino's likely goals here – broadening the pool, lighting a fire under those excluded and perhaps giving European-based players the chance to focus on their club situations for now.

But the benefits of a player being allowed to stay with a European club are limited when you remember that during the international break, large numbers of the first-team squad at clubs like Milan, Juve and Atlético, are away with their national teams anyway, weakening the significance of those training sessions, which are mainly for reserves and other non-internationals.

Two things really concern me about this roster.

Firstly, the U.S. is playing against Japan and South Korea, two teams with quality players and top-tier experience, who are exactly the kind of opponents that might be waiting in the World Cup itself, especially in the knockout phase.

With no qualifying games, these friendlies should be treated as seriously as possible, to get the squad truly competitive encounters – to test them and help them grow. As we saw with the debacle of June's 4-0 crushing by Switzerland in Nashville, if the opposition is high-level and comes in motivated, the outcome for an experimental team can be ugly.

There is already a worrying lack of enthusiasm bordering on apathy in the USMNT's fan base at a time when positivity and optimism should be growing in anticipation of this huge moment in American soccer. I don't even want to think about what the impact would be of another heavy loss at home.

Secondly, while the time for ‘sending messages' should be over by now, I also worry about exactly what kind of message Pochettino is sending by his selection of MLS players who few people, if any, were clamoring for.

When I played for the national team under Bob Bradley, there was an unwritten rule for emerging American MLS talent. If you want to be a national team player, you earn yourself a move abroad, you fight for your place at your club, you perform week-in, week-out and then you get your chance.

It was highly motivating. It led people like me to turn down, after college, a Generation Adidas contract with MLS and head to Europe. It was why I battled for a starting place at Hammarby in Sweden, moved to Sochaux in France and played for Randers in Denmark.

Jurgen Klinsmann was another national team coach who was keen to see Americans move to Europe, pushing players to get as close to the highest level as possible. It's why so many of our players over the last 25 years improved, became more professional and more steeled. It's not easy as an American walking into a European locker-room, proving yourself, earning a starting place and keeping it. It's a grind every single day. It meant the national team coach got players who had been forged by that experience, hardened and sharpened.

Advertisement

It also gave players in MLS something to aim for. You might be performing well enough for your club, but were you playing well enough to attract the attention of European scouts?

So what is the message the players receive when they see Pochettino's roster?

With all due respect, have the likes of Roman Celentano, Tristan Blackmon, Nathan Harriel and Sean Zawadzki really been performing at such a consistently high-level in MLS that they simply could not be ignored? Have they really thrust themselves into contention for World Cup places?

Even if you were looking to MLS-based players, it is surprising that some of these new faces are being picked ahead of the likes of Djordje Mihailovic (11 caps), DeJuan Jones (10 caps) and Chicago's exciting talent Brian Gutierrez (two caps).

But the message sent is even worse. When I see a player like Paxton Aaronson, who after trying to make it at Eintracht Frankfurt took on the challenge of a loan spell at Utrecht and earned a starting place at a top-four club in the Dutch league, take a move back to MLS, it leaves me thinking the players have understood that under Pochettino you'd actually be better off in MLS.

That is a crazy situation. But what other conclusion could we draw from the fact that a promising player like Aidan Morris, who was rightly called up due to his excellent form with the Columbus Crew, is now ignored despite being a regular in the highly competitive Championship with Middlesbrough?

Morris won two MLS Cups with the Crew before, at the age of 22, going to play for then-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick, a great coach to learn from, given he played in Morris's midfield role. That's the kind of initiative that I would lean towards rewarding.

Morris could now be forgiven for thinking that he would have been better off, from a national team perspective, staying with the Crew, never having to worry about losing his place, never having to push himself, under pressure, every week in the grind of that league. He'd probably be in this roster if he was playing in MLS – which is absurd.

There are contradictions in Pochettino's approach, too. If the aim is to give players in new club environments space to settle, then why call up Tim Weah? He is in his first season with Marseille, adapting to a new system under Roberto De Zerbi and new teammates, and yet he is (deservedly) included in the roster.

And he should be, because Weah is a vital piece of the U.S. puzzle. His speed, quickness, timing, 1-v-1 ability, two-way commitment and World Cup experience (including scoring against Wales in Qatar) make him unique in this group.

The reality is that outside of him, the USMNT simply doesn't have another wide player with that blend of qualities. His inclusion underscores just how inconsistent the logic is when other Europe-based players in similar or even stronger club situations are left behind.

At least Pochettino says this is the last window before the experimenting stops in October. That is a relief, but I think not going with a full-strength squad for these games is another missed opportunity for the coach and the team.

Hopefully the approach to the games will be less experimental than the roster call-ups suggests. If the U.S. wants to inspire belief heading into the home World Cup, now is the time to sharpen, not experiment.

Thankfully, Christian Pulisic is on the roster, and I really hope that he and everyone else can now put this summer's unpleasant conflict behind them. The whole saga was the result of poor communication. No one blinked an eye when it was announced that Musah was missing the Gold Cup for ‘personal reasons,' and few would have objected if Christian's absence was put down to muscle fatigue or a minor injury.

I'll never understand why it was instead described by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker as the player asking to “step back” this summer due to the volume of games. The whole thing could have been avoided with different language.

Christian had a new coach coming in at AC Milan and it was important for him to be at the Milanello training ground fresh and ready to go on day one of preseason and not coming in late or tired from the Gold Cup and playing catch-up ahead of the new season.

The U.S. needs Pulisic to have a great season with Milan and to return in style to the national team. He's central to World Cup hopes, and whatever people think of his decision this summer, it is time to put it behind us and get behind our best player. Just as it's time for Pochettino to get behind his best players, period.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Lionel Messi has not yet announced when he plans to retire, but he knows that next week's match against Venezuela could be his last one playing at home in a World Cup qualifier with Argentina's national team.

“It's going to be a very, very special match for me because it's the last qualifying match,” the 38-year-old Messi said Wednesday night after Inter Miami progressed to the Leagues Cup final by beating Orlando City.

Argentina, with a spot already secured in next year's World Cup, will host Venezuela next Thursday at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires for the penultimate round of South American qualifiers. Its last match will be at Ecuador on Sept. 9.

Messi has hinted that he will retire from the national team after next year's World Cup, where Argentina is going to defend the title they won in Qatar 2022.

The qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when the soccer star will be 40 years old.

“I don't know if there will be friendlies or more matches after (Venezuela), but it is a very special match, so my family will be there with me: my wife, my children, my parents, my siblings," Messi said. "We're going to live it like that. I don't know what will happen next.”

Following Messi's statements, CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, wrote on social media that “the last dance is coming,” with a picture of Messi in an Argentina shirt.

Meanwhile, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) is trying to capitalize on Messi's last home match by raising ticket prices, with the cheapest going for $100 and the most expensive costing around $500.

Chelsea will welcome Barcelona to Stamford Bridge in the league phase of the Champions League, while Arsenal host Bayern Munich.

As was the case last season, all 36 teams in the competition will compete in one big league and each play eight fixtures.

Chelsea have a trip to Bayern Munich to look forward, but the standout fixture for the Blues is a home clash against Barcelona.

Alongside those two fixtures, there will be a reunion with former boss Antonio Conte when they travel to take on Napoli.

Arsenal, who reached the semi-finals last season, will also face Bayern, as has regularly been the case in this competition over the past decade.

That will come at the Emirates Stadium, as will a blockbuster encounter with Atletico Madrid.

There is a trip to Milan to face Inter for Mikel Arteta's side. The Italian side beat Arsenal in the league phase of the Champions League last season.

Tottenham, meanwhile, are back at Europe's top table and take on holders Paris Saint-Germain, who were fortunate to beat them in the UEFA Super Cup earlier this month.

Thomas Frank's side have plenty of familiar opponents. They travel to take on Eintracht Frankfurt, beaten on the way to Europa League glory last season, as well as Bodo/Glimt, who Spurs saw off in the semi-finals of that run.

Liverpool face another heavyweight showdown with Real Madrid, in what is a swift return to Anfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Manchester City will be at the Bernabeu to take on the 15-time champions, while they host Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and Galatasaray.

Newcastle complete the six Premier League sides in the competition and have been handed a tough set of fixtures.

The Magpies have tricky away trips, including against PSG, Leverkusen and Marseille, while Barcelona will be hosted at St James' Park.

Manchester City: Borussia Dortmund (H), Real Madrid (A), Bayer Leverkusen (H), Villarreal (A), Napoli (H), Bodo/Glimt (A), Galatasaray (H), Monaco (A)

Liverpool: Real Madrid (H), Inter Milan (A), Atletico Madrid (H), Eintracht Frankfurt (A), PSV (H), Marseille (A), Qarabag (H), Galatasaray (A)

Arsenal: Bayern Munich (H), Inter Milan (A), Atletico Madrid (H), Club Brugge (A), Olympiacos (H), Slavia Prague (A), Kairat Almaty (H), Athletic Bilbao (A)

Tottenham: Borussia Dortmund (H), PSG (A), Villarreal (H), Eintracht Frankfurt (A), Slavia Prague (H), Bodo/Glimt (A), Copenhagen (H), Monaco (A)

Chelsea: Barcelona (H), Bayern Munich (A), Benfica (H), Atalanta (A), Ajax (H), Napoli (A), Pafos (H), Qarabag (A)

Newcastle: Barcelona (H), PSG (A), Benfica (H), Bayer Leverkusen (A), PSV, (H), Marseille (A), Athletic Bilbao (H), Union SG (A)

Exact order of the games and kick-off times still TBC.

The Blues' talisman is already facing a short spell on the sidelines after a strenuous summer where he was overworked in the pursuit of silverware

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.

Could Folarin Balogun deliver for the United States in September?

That'll be top of mind as the U.S. Men's National Team gears up to face Korea Republic and Japan in the September FIFA window.

Balogun was added to the now 23-player roster on Wednesday ahead of Aug. 31 when players report to New Jersey for training camp. He earned his first cap in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League Finals and scored his first goal in the 2-0 win against Canada in the Final, quickly garnering a name for himself as a scoring threat.

This window and the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup also give Balogun a chance to answer another question: Can he stay healthy?

He last competed with the National Team in September 2024, just as Pochettino was hired. However, this isn't Balogun's first call-up under the head coach. Balogun was one of five forwards selected to the roster for June camp, but he sustained an ankle injury before reporting for National Team duty. The forward missed significant time during the last Ligue 1 season with a dislocated shoulder and the ankle injury.

This will give Pochettino a chance to evaluate the 24-year-old forward more thoroughly. Though, the forward has proven to be efficient for both club and country. Balogun has racked up five goals in 17 caps with the USMNT. On the club side, he recorded four goals in 16 appearances for AS Monaco last season.

Josh Sargent, Damion Downs and Tim Weah are forwards on this September roster who have played the No. 9 position. This September camp gives Pochettino a chance to look at several different players as decisions for the upcoming World Cup roster need to be made. And like other positions, the striker is ripe for the taking.

Other options at the position in the player pool — Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Downs — have all earned caps under Pochettino. Now, Balogun is poised with the opportunity to prove his value, too, in Harrison, N.J. on Sept. 6 and then in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 9.

Nilson Angulo has had a fantastic start to the campaign with Anderlecht. The young Ecuadorian winger, who is likely going to be featuring at the World Cup next summer, has scored twice and grabbed three assists in just eight games this season. As a result, clubs have been interested, but recently Angulo said he would prefer to stay in Belgiu. However, that may now change. Rudy Galetti has revealed that Portuguese club Sporting CP have engaged in talks with Anderlecht over bringing the 22-year-old Angulo to Portugal. Sporting CP recently missed out on the signing of Yeremay from Deportivo so are looking for an alternative.

while Anderlecht are also keen to keep Angulo, that may change if the side fail to overcome AEK Athens in Conference League qualification. After a 1-1 draw in Brussels, the side travel to Greece tonight for the return leg. Missing out on European football will mean they need to bring the financial benefits into the club via player sales. Even with a positive result in Europe, if Sporting CP submit an offer that is too good to turn down, Anderlecht will likely allow Angulo to move to Lisbon.

Anderlecht and Sporting CP are no strangers to each other, with Zeno Debast having moved from Brussels to Lisbon in the past season.

As we head towards the final few days of the transfer market, Barcelona are expected to finalise the future of two of their academy graduates in Hector Fort and Jan Virgili.

While Fort is no longer seen as a viable first-team option for Hansi Flick, Virgili, who recently impressed at the iconic Maracana, is on the verge of joining Mallorca this summer.

But even in the midst of such uncertainty surrounding their Barcelona future, both of them, as well as teammate Andres Cuenca, have been called up for action.

Fort, Cuenca, and Virgili have all been included in Spain's U-20 squad for their September training camp in Clairefontaine, France.

The camp will feature two friendlies against the French U-20 team – on September 4th and September 7th – serving as the final preparation ahead of the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile.

Spain are set to kick off their World Cup campaign on September 28 against Morocco at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, before facing Mexico (October 1) and Brazil (October 3) in what promises to be a challenging group stage.

It will be interesting to see how these three players, each facing a distinct situation, respond to the call-up.

As mentioned earlier, Virgili is already on his way out of Barcelona, while Fort, too, may leave the club in favour of a loan move elsewhere, incidentally to Mallorca as well.

Cuenca might be the only player still remaining at Barcelona, though the youngster will largely ply his trade with the second team.

Although their involvement in Chile won't directly affect Barça's first team, losing Cuenca in particular would be a blow for the reserves.

Before there was a chance for any controversy to emerge surrounding Folarin Balogun's omission from Mauricio Pochettino's latest U.S. men's national team (USMNT) roster, the Monaco forward was belatedly called up.

Balogun earned his chance to face South Korea and Japan in a series of friendlies after Vancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White pulled out through injury. The 29-year-old sustained a hamstring strain during last weekend's victory over St. Louis, creating a gap in the roster which many already expected to be filled by Balogun.

Injury hampered much of the 2024–25 campaign for the former Arsenal striker, who was sidelined for the best part of six months with a dislocated shoulder and the surgery required to fix it. After getting back on the pitch in spring, Balogun was initially included in this summer's Gold Cup roster only for an ankle injury to force him out.

Balogun's most recent international appearance came back in September 2024, before Pochettino's reign even began. His last international win and goal was the opening game of the 2024 Copa América against Bolivia.

The 24-year-old had previously been considered to be USMNT's first-choice No. 9 and will be competing for a starting spot in September with Southampton's Damion Downs and Norwich City frontman Josh Sargent. 

Pochettino's initial choice of Vancouver's White over Balogun may have been a consequence of his lofty opinion of MLS. The top flight of North American soccer is widely considered to be inferior to Europe's elite divisions, yet the Argentine coach offered an impassioned counter-view at his squad announcement.

“We need to give MLS the value, because I think competing there, I think players can show that they can perform in the national team,” Pochettino told assembled media this week. “I think it's not necessary to move from MLS to Europe. Because sometimes MLS, under my assessment, maybe is more competitive than some leagues in Europe.”

Carlo Ancelotti has announced the Brazil squad for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia. This marks the Italian coach's second international break in charge, and he has named an exciting squad.

The 25-man squad includes 12 Premier League players, 2025 Champions League winner Marquinhos and FC Barcelona's incredible talent Raphinha. Brazil will play at the FIFA 2026 World Cup next summer, but Ancelotti's job is to make this group a contender for the title, not just a participant.

Wesley could start on the right side of the backline for Brazil. The ex-Flamengo player suffered a baptism of fire with the national team when Argentina smashed the 'Seleção' 4-1 in March. However, the young full-back has huge potential and keeps improving at club level.

Since that tricky night in Buenos Aires, Wesley has performed incredibly for Flamengo in Brazil, earning a $29 million move to Italian Serie A outfit Roma. Wesley slotted straight into Gian Piero Gasperini's starting line-up and scored the only goal on the opening day of the season as Roma defeated Bologna 1-0.

Kaio Jorge is the top scorer in the Brazilian league so far this season and he is leading a title charge for his club. The forward has notched 15 goals and five assists in 20 league matches. Jorge has been a revelation in domestic football this year and will likely be rewarded with his first ever minutes for Brazil on the international stage.

Jorge probably won't start ahead of the likes of Chelsea's João Pedro or Tottenham's Richarlison, but given that Ancelotti wants to experiment with his team, the boss will surely give the Cruzeiro star a chance to prove his worth. Jorge will have to take every chance he gets if he wants to keep a spot in the national team.

Estêvão enjoyed a short cameo in Chelsea's first Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace. The winger then registered an assist against West Ham on matchday two. An injury forced Cole Palmer out during the warm-up, so the young Brazilian came into the starting line-up and made no mistake in showing his quality at the very top level of club football.

The kid who shone in Brazil for Palmeiras, and impressed against Chelsea at the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the summer, is showing his quality faster than many expected. Just a couple of weeks into the season fans can expect 18 year-old Estêvão to play regular football for Chelsea and Ancelotti's Brazil. The dynamic attacker has an abundance of raw talent and can go all the way to the top, but can he become a Brazil starter ahead of the FIFA 2026 World Cup?

Domains created to take advantage of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 in the United States were recently found. It's a sign of what's to come for the big one – the 2026 World Cup.

According to PreCrime Labs, the threat research team at BforeAI, a cybersecurity company specializing in proactive threat prevention, many domains used this year have already been registered for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

“This highlights two key tactics used by attackers: they either repurpose old domains for new campaigns or register new ones well in advance,” said the researchers. 

“By ‘aging' these domains for a year or more, attackers can better avoid detection and improve their success rates as the event nears. We even discovered domains registered for the FIFA tournaments in 2030 and 2034.”

In their report, PreCrime says it has analyzed a set of 498 domains that contain FIFA, football (soccer), and World Cup-related brand terms (e.g., “worldcup,” “fifa,” “football”). 

These domains span a mix of obvious trademark typosquats, speculative registrations, generic fan, merchandise, and betting names, and community or amateur-football sites.

In one example, researchers found a domain with a page title that says “FIFA world cup schedule” to lure users searching for official match information. When they visit the site, they are met with a betting page. 

This is a common trend observed around mega sporting events, where adversaries abuse trending keywords to maximize search visibility and social media spread.

The page content is in Mandarin Chinese, but FIFA and official broadcasters don't actually use such channels for promotions. Prominent use of celebrity pictures and “official partner” keywords are used to establish legitimacy, which is not verifiable with FIFA's actual sponsor list. 

Claims like “ 巴 西 圣 保 罗 ” (Brazil São Paulo official partner) are used, but in Mandarin, to enhance credibility.

Another webpage promotes an “EV Map for World Cup 2026,” claiming to help traveling fans find hotels and restaurants with EV chargers. In fact, the campaign obviously aims to collect personally identifiable information through a B2B phishing scheme.

Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 

In this case, fake branding elements, especially those of payment partners (VISA), flags, and FIFA logo lookalikes, were strategically added to the domains.


Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 


Major events tournaments such as global soccer events or huge concert tours predictably trigger spikes in fraud infrastructure: fake ticketing, counterfeit merchandise, unlawful streaming, betting lures, and generic “fan guide” pages used as lead-gen or phishing launchpads.

And the FIFA World Cup is undoubtedly the largest one out there. In 2022, when the tournament was held in Qatar, it engaged five billion fans across all media, FIFA said. 


    Cybernews researchers have discovered severe misconfigurations affecting two Tencent sites, exposing sensitive credentials and internal source code. The critical flaws could potentially grant full access to internal services and backend infrastructure within Tencent Cloud.

Arsenal and USWNT defender Emily Fox admits she was surprised to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or. (1:07)

The NWSL's transfer window is officially closed, and for the second straight time, it involved a world-record deal -- this time for an incoming player.

Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle moved from Tigres to the Orlando Pride last week and set the new women's global transfer record at $1.5 million, per ESPN sources. But there have been several other high-profile transfers involving NWSL players and some U.S. women's national team hopefuls, too.

Outgoing transfers and intra-league trades can still take place, but the transfer window is now closed for new summer arrivals in the NWSL. So, which transfers were the best for the respective player's career? Let's grade them and dig into what these moves mean for the future.

- How women's transfer record skyrocketed with Ovalle move
- NWSL Power Rankings: Orlando Pride are officially in a slump
- USWNT debutants ranked: All 24 players with first caps under Hayes

Grade: A-

Ovalle is known as La Maga (The Magician) for her audacious play, from the scorpion-kick goal seen round the world earlier this year for Tigres to last year's cheeky goal that lifted Mexico to its first win over the USWNT on American soil.

Ovalle is already a household name in Mexico. Her move to the NWSL in her prime at 25 years old will give her a global platform to showcase those skills and, if all goes to plan, fully insert herself into the conversation as one of the world's best.

Alexis Nunes and Ali Krieger discuss the potential record signing of Lizbeth Ovalle to Orlando Pride.

That plan requires Ovalle to become a focal point for Orlando, a team already blessed with depth and talent. She'll have at least a few months (if not more) to play alongside six-time World Player of the Year Marta. The recent season-ending injury to Barbra Banda also means that Ovalle will be needed even more immediately if the Pride want to repeat.

Orlando's 22 goals scored is the lowest among the top seven teams right now -- and Banda scored eight of those. The Pride are creating opportunities -- 26.3 expected goals, per FBref so Ovalle could be the missing piece.

A world-record transfer fee will come with pressure, however. How will she handle it?

Grade: B+

Fishel's move to Seattle was about the long term. Chelsea's roster is perpetually crowded, and Fishel has eyes on the 2027 World Cup with the USWNT. To be there and to be a prominent player for United States coach Emma Hayes (who signed her at Chelsea), Fishel needs more consistent reps as a bona-fide starting forward for her club.

That is what Seattle expects from her, evidenced by an NWSL record cumulative salary and that should play out in the long term.

Right now, Fishel is still assimilating into a new club after a relatively recent return from a torn ACL. She has played limited minutes off the bench in three games for Seattle. The Reign, and Fishel, are going to need time to adapt to one another.

Grade: B+

Sentnor's move from the NWSL's last-place team to the league leaders in August is another case of playing the long game.

There are valid short-term questions about how Sentnor fits into an already stacked Kansas City roster. Sentnor was the focal point and franchise player in Utah; in Kansas City, she is not a guaranteed starter, as talented as she is. Not right now, anyway.

Alexis Nunes is joined on Futbol W by Emily Keogh to discuss the rise of Utah Royals' Ally Sentnor.

But this move is about the future for a 21-year-old rising star -- which is why Kansas City paid an intra-league record $600,000 (plus potential add-ons) to sign her. Sentnor will be coached by Vlatko Andonovski, arguably the NWSL's most successful coach and a former USWNT coach who knows what is needed in that environment.

Kansas City isn't exactly overly young, either, with Debinha turning 34 in October and Bia turning 32 in December. Roster turnover is inevitable in the NWSL especially, and Sentnor is likely to become a long-term centerpiece for the Current. This move is about her development.

Grade: A

Rarely does the cliché of "a win-win" ring true, but it is a fitting description of this move.

Watt became the first signing for 2026 NWSL expansion team Denver Summit FC, which is a nice touch of history for the Colorado native. She gets to go home for a historic moment next year to anchor a new franchise, and Orlando get salary cap relief and extra funds to use on an already expensive roster (more on that soon).

Plus, Watt gets to finish the 2025 NWSL season with Orlando on loan, giving her a six-month runway to join her new team and relocate her life. She's also an important part of the Pride's push to repeat as NWSL champions.

Watt is exactly the type of player NWSL expansion teams need to establish success. Yes, there are likely more splashy signings to come, but Watt is a hard worker who contributes offensively with dynamic wing play, and she brings championship, veteran experience to Denver. And can establish herself as an early leader at the club.

Grade: B+

On one hand, Sanchez is a loss for San Diego and the NWSL. That she left San Diego just over a year after a then-NWSL record transfer from the Houston Dash is also a bit anticlimactic. The reality, however, is that Sanchez was fighting for minutes on an overhauled Wave roster being guided by a new head coach in Jonas Eidevall. Sanchez started in only three of her last eight games for the Wave before making the move back to Tigres, where she played earlier in her career.

Sanchez already has five goals for Tigres, which is among the league leaders. That's all a net positive for her, even if she has moved around a fair amount to end up back at Estadio Universitario.

Grade: A-

Cantore joined the Spirit from Juventus after a strong showing with Italy at Euro 2025, which further boosted her celebrity, and has settled into life in Washington nicely, already after scoring in her second NWSL appearance.

The 25-year-old fills a void on a Spirit team that has dealt with endless injuries or other absences, including at the forward position, and combines well with her new teammates, as she showed again in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bay FC.

She is like a magnet for the ball in the attack, and could be an important addition for the team that looks most ready to challenge the Kansas City Current's dominance come playoff time.

Soccer's governing body is spending millions on out-of-home advertising for the 2026 World Cup before a ball has even been kicked. That early push signals how global live events are becoming OOH's new frontier.

Fifa has already poured more than $5m into out-of-home (OOH) advertising in Q2 2025 to promote the Fifa Club World Cup. That figure might look like a footnote in a $2.86bn quarter for the OOH industry, but it is more than just a one-off media buy. It is an early signal of how the governing body intends to use public space to build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup, now less than a year away.

OOH has long played a supporting role during global tournaments, but Fifa's spend this far in advance shows a shift in strategy. By dominating transit hubs, airports and city centers, the organization is creating a year-long build toward one of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Anna Bager, president and chief executive of the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA), framed it this way in the group's latest report: OOH “mirrors the cultural and social moments that shape how people spend their time and is where brands show up to connect with audiences at scale.” For Fifa, that connection starts now.

Recent tournaments show how OOH becomes indispensable during shared cultural moments. At Euro 2024, brands spent more than €313m on OOH campaigns across Europe's biggest markets, turning fan zones and city squares into branded stages. Beyond static signage, activations included live score updates on digital screens, creative that shifted with match outcomes and branded experiences embedded directly into public viewing areas. These executions helped transform city centers into extensions of the stadium experience.

Digital OOH has only heightened that role. Programmatic buying now allows advertisers to adjust messaging in real time, align creative with match results and target audiences by location or context. The flexibility of digital formats means campaigns can scale quickly while remaining responsive to the highs and lows of live sport, something static placements cannot achieve on their own.

This evolution highlights why OOH has become one of the most engaging channels for fans during major events. Stadium crowds and fan festivals are not just gatherings of spectators; they are cultural canvases where brands can establish visibility and presence at scale.

The World Cup is one of the few events that commands attention on every continent and advertisers know it. OOH revenue in the US alone grew 3% in Q2 2025, with digital formats climbing 9.2% and transit advertising up nearly 9%. Financial services, communications, and real estate brands were among the fastest-growing categories. Tech and direct-to-consumer companies made up more than a quarter of the top 100 OOH advertisers, with names such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon leading the way.

Fifa's heavy spend puts it in line with those top-tier players but also highlights the unique role of live sport. While TV spots for the 2026 Super Bowl are already priced at more than $8m for 30 seconds, OOH offers Fifa the chance to saturate the real-world environments where fans live, travel and gather. From city-center fan festivals to screens outside stadiums, out-of-home gives the World Cup a physical presence months before kickoff.

If Fifa's $5m spend in Q2 is any indication, OOH is no longer just a backdrop for major tournaments. It is becoming one of the lead platforms, capable of delivering cultural ownership in the places fans experience sport together, on the streets, in transit and across every corner of the host cities.

Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City.

At a Legislative Budget Committee meeting on Aug. 26, Kansas lawmakers received an update from Kansas City 2026, the nonprofit overseeing the strategy of hosting the World Cup. Some key details are still hazy, with fewer than 300 days to go before the start of the event.

Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium.

There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence.

"The team base camps are really the team's home away from home, those are the locations where teams will come and train to prep for the tournament," said Lindsey Douglas, chief operating officer for Kansas City 2026. "These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial."

In the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," the large tax and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump, allocated $625 million for a security at the 11 host cities. It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million.

About 650,000 visitors are expected to the Kansas City area through the duration of the World Cup. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days.

The event will double the number of teams playing from prior World Cups to 48. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game.

"The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, this will be the largest version of that sporting event in 2026. Even though soccer is one of many sports we follow here in the United States, by far at the world stage, it is the largest," Douglas said.

That many people coming to the region is anticipated to generate $653 million in direct economic impact. Kansas City 2026 said it's attempting to leverage the visitors and the economic impact for longer-term partnerships.

"We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this," Douglas said.

There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners.

The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000.

Kansas Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, the chair of the Legislative Budget Committee, raised concerns about the number of hotel rooms available for the influx of guests. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup.

"We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area," Douglas said. "We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. Also campgrounds are really looking at this as an opportunity as well. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have."

Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. The existing public transit networks aren't substantial enough to accommodate the number of visitors coming in.

School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest.

Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport.

FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.

England face Andorra at Villa Park and Serbia away in World Cup qualifiers; John Stones, Phil Foden, Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw among familiar faces available again after June defeat to Senegal; Jack Grealish, Mason Mount will hope for call, as well as U21 stars such as Adam Wharton

By Peter Smith and Rob Dorsett 

Thursday 28 August 2025 11:53, UK

Thomas Tuchel will be without key players Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham when he names his squad for September's World Cup qualifiers but familiar faces will be pushing for a recall as preparations for next summer ramp up.

The June camp ended in embarrassment for Tuchel and England, with the team soundly beaten by Senegal after an underwhelming 1-0 win away to Andorra.

England's squad announcement takes place at 2pm on Friday - follow it on Sky Sports News and the Sky Sports website and App.

But with England's toughest test of qualifying - their trip to Serbia on September 9 - in this next double-header and subsequent international breaks in October and November, Tuchel is entering a pivotal part of his project to win the World Cup in North America in 2026. His squad, named on Thursday, should reflect that.

This will be his most substantial block of training and game time with his squad before the tournament - assuming England complete what now looks like a straightforward qualification - and also a period where players will be aiming to carve out clear roles in the head coach's plans. The time for experimenting is over.

It is significant, then, that of players who missed the previous squad, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Marc Guehi, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden are fit and available. Rashford, like Trent Alexander-Arnold, hasn't had a glittering start to life in Spain, but both seem primed to be involved.

Jack Grealish will also hope his two assists for Everton at the weekend will help to nudge him back into the frame. His inclusion or absence will be a major talking point either way.

Mason Mount may feel his prospects of adding to his 36 caps are on the rise after his involvement for Manchester United this term and the long chat he had with Tuchel after the opening-weekend defeat to Arsenal.

His United team-mate Shaw is also enjoying his football again, after a couple of injury-ravaged seasons. Interestingly, Myles Lewis-Skelly, who had come in at left-back for England, has begun both Arsenal games on the bench. Djed Spence, meanwhile, has helped Tottenham make a fast start with his performances at left-back.

Adam Wharton, Tino Livramento and Liam Delap - who missed the last camp due to the U21 Euros, although Delap instead linked up with Chelsea at the Club World Cup - could be in with the seniors this time.

But will Delap dislodge surprise summer pick Ivan Toney? Dominic Solanke will also be waiting on a recall after being omitted in June, despite helping Tottenham to a Europa League success.

Tuchel made the trip to Slovakia to watch the youth team win the Euros and it will be intriguing to see if any other members of Lee Carsley's group have impressed enough. Jarell Quansah has had a call-up from Tuchel previously and, after his victorious summer with the U21s, scored on his Bayer Leverkusen debut.

Elliot Anderson is also among the Young Lions most likely to get a shout, with central midfield still a conundrum. Kobbie Mainoo's lack of game time at Manchester United will surely count against a player once seen set to become an important figure in the middle of the park for his country.

James Maddison certainly won't be involved, given his injury lay-off, while Levi Colwill is another out for the long term.

It also looks probable Ben White's international absence will continue, with the right-back - who finally made himself available for selection again in the summer - missing Arsenal's game last weekend with injury. Conor Gallagher - a favourite of Tuchel's at Chelsea - has played just over an hour's worth of football so far this season for Atletico Madrid.

In goal, Jordan Pickford remains the clear No 1 with Dean Henderson and James Trafford called up as well for the last outing. They are expected to deputise again. Aaron Ramsdale has since moved to Newcastle but is currently behind compatriot Nick Pope in the club pecking order.

Will we get the odd surprise? Tuchel has thrown those up in each squad he has named so far - but the expectation is that a clearer idea of his primary World Cup contenders will emerge with his selections this week.

Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:

The FA's youth team coaches are considering promoting Max Dowman to England's U19 squad after his impressive debut for the Arsenal first team against Leeds United at the weekend.

The 15-year-old winger has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games.

Now there is a possibility he will jump another age group, in recognition of his progress in senior football. But for that to happen, because he is still a minor, it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal.

His development will be carefully managed - by club and country. His team-mate Ethan Nwanieri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21s in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness. He went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's side as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches.

The feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken.

Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: "There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life. For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great."

The teenager has been involved with England's junior teams for several years, making his international debut for the U16s - and then the U17s - in 2024. However, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1 2026.

Dowman stood out in pre-season, coming off the bench on numerous occasions and impressing Mikel Arteta with the impact he made. That prompted the Arsenal boss to bring him on at the Emirates on Saturday - albeit with his side already 4-0 up. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal.

Dowman instantly excited the home crowd with a number of runs down the right wing on Saturday, and won the penalty in stoppage time that Gyokeres converted for 5-0.

GOAL breaks down all 36 participants in the latest edition of the European club game's most prestigious tournament

The Champions League is almost back! On Thursday, the eagerly-awaited draw for the league phase will take place in Monaco. Obviously, with this being a UEFA-run competition, the ceremony will needlessly take well over an hour, as the European game's governing body always insists on carrying out painfully awkward interviews while dishing out meaningless awards.

However, if last year's event is anything to go by, we should learn the computer-generated fixture lists for all 36 participants after about 75 minutes of tedium. After that, we'll be able to look forward to the actual football.  

With that in mind, GOAL is back again with its Champions League power rankings to let you know which sides are looking like potential winners ahead of the draw - and who could be in trouble from the get-go...

...

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.

Rather concerningly, this is an injury that Palmer has been carrying for some time, which means it may well have been exacerbated by Chelsea going all the way at the Club World Cup and the scaled-back pre-season that followed, with the gruelling summer tournament only reaching its conclusion in mid-July.

Following his last-minute withdrawal before the thumping victory over West Ham on Friday, apparently after painkillers failed to have the desired effect, head coach Enzo Maresca admitted his talisman had already been playing through the pain barrier in the season opener against Crystal Palace five days prior, where the attacker was criticised for a subdued performance in the goalless draw. The decision to start him there deserves some scrutiny if Palmer's absence proves to be a lengthy one.

"Cole in the last four or five days was not 100 per cent,” the Italian tactician revealed. "He tried the warm-up but he felt something. We preferred not to take any risks. We will see if it's something important or not. [It's in the] groin. For the Crystal Palace game, he was not 100% but he tried to make a big effort for the club, the fans and the team. He tried tonight, but it was not very good."

Palmer was underwent a scan on Tuesday, although it remains to be seen when the results of those tests will be revealed with Chelsea not due to play again until Saturday lunchtime when they host neighbours Fulham, by which time eight days will have passed since he pulled out of the West Ham clash.

According to Chelsea reporter Si Phillips, the attacker could be sidelined for up to six weeks, although there is optimism that his layoff will be shorter and that he might even be available immediately after the upcoming pause for World Cup qualifying action.

Although England almost certainly won't have Palmer at their disposal, Chelsea will consider the international break to be well-timed as their players prepare to disperse after the Fulham game. However, their key man could still miss Premier League clashes against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton in September, while the Blues will be desperate to have him available for the visit of champions Liverpool on Saturday, October 4, in just under six weeks' time.

Having played such a key role in getting the club there, the 23-year-old may also miss out on the Blues' first two fixtures back in the Champions League in mid- and late September, as well as the third round of the Carabao Cup.

Whatever the result of the scan, this injury is a crushing blow for Chelsea at such an early stage of a season that had offered renewed hope. It's common knowledge that Palmer has been a revelation since joining the Blues less than two years ago, emerging as a creative and goal-scoring force, but his durability is an underrated attribute.

Since his arrival from Manchester City, you can count the number of games he has missed at club level on one hand; in 2023-24 he only missed the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal through illness, and there was some strange symmetry last season as he sat out the same fixture due to a hamstring problem.

His international record is strangely more patchy; after being sidelined for two England games following the defeat at the Emirates in March, Palmer has only featured in three of his country's last 10 games, having withdrawn from two squads during Lee Carsley's interim reign following Euro 2024, and he is now set to miss another camp.

The attacker's club might think the international break comes at a good time, but this could still be his longest absence since joining Chelsea, and his most significant since a serious foot injury he suffered during his time at City in 2022.

There is little doubt that this is an injury that Palmer could have avoided or would have been less severe if it wasn't for Chelsea's run to unexpected glory at the Club World Cup, where the 23-year-old was their hero once again as he dismantled European champions Paris Saint-Germain almost singlehandedly in the final. Ironically, it was a performance that led to much of the optimism around Stamford Bridge at the start of the new season, which has now been diminished in light of Palmer's setback.

Despite the west Londoners often coming up against relatively weaker opposition in the U.S., Palmer was only rested for the clash against Morocco's Esperance - clocking up more than 550 minutes in six games over the course of just under a month. It is believed that this groin problem flared up at some point during the tournament, where matches were invariably played in excruciating and physically draining heat and humidity.

It's easy to forget that he was involved in the completely misguided post-season England camp in June, too, needlessly playing in what should have been a routine win over Andorra before warming the bench against Senegal.

In normal circumstances, Palmer would have had ample time in pre-season to recover, but going all the way at the Club World Cup has come at a cost. After the final on July 13, the squad was afforded just three weeks off before reporting back for training in early August as part of their scaled-back warm-up plans, with Palmer playing more than 100 minutes across their two friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan on the same weekend when, evidently, he wasn't fully fit.

Inevitably, Palmer's imminent absence has led to scepticism over how Maresca's men will handle their upcoming games. Speaking before the West Ham clash, Sky Sports pundit and Chelsea fan Paul Merson said: "If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have.

"Palmer is the talk of the town in team talks against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea."

The ex-Arsenal man continued: "It's not just all on Palmer because the coach has to come up with solutions, too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it."

Of course, the Blues handled their business pretty well without him at the London Stadium in a thumping 5-1 victory, although some atrocious defending from a West Ham side in disarray at the start of the campaign contributed to all of their goals.

Nevertheless, it was a victory that led Maresca to effuse that Chelsea are not the one-man team that some of their detractors believe them to be, as his side delivered a cohesive performance despite the absence of their lynchpin, with five different names on the scoresheet.

"The ones that say we are 'just a Cole team', for sure Cole is our best player no doubt," the Italian said. "For sure with Cole we are (a) much better team, but I think we already showed last year in the two or three months where Cole was not 100%, when we achieved top four that no one expected."

And in fairness, if this injury is a precursor to Palmer being unavailable or ineffective more often, then the contributions of Estevao Willian and Joao Pedro in particular will be very encouraging. The former was Palmer's replacement in the starting line-up and collected the Player of the Match award after a dazzling performance that belied his tender years, including a scintillating dart to the byline before pulling the ball back for an Enzo Fernandez tap-in, while the latter scored a simple header and laid on two more for his team-mates from his sidelined colleague's No.10 position.

Behind the scenes, Chelsea may well be working on a more permanent solution. The Premier League giants are still pursuing RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons as we enter the final days of the transfer window, with the Dutchman a player capable of shouldering the creative and attacking burden that so often falls on Palmer. However, it seems his arrival will be contingent on outgoings.

Meanwhile, Barcelona's Fermin Lopez is the latest creative player to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge as the Blues look to capitalise on a bloated midfield in Catalunya, with talks opened with his representatives and a €50 million (£43m/$58m) offer supposedly lodged. Again, that clearly suggests Chelsea view acquiring cover for their talisman as something of a priority, before it's too late.

Whatever happens before the deadline on September 1, it's clear Chelsea need to alleviate the workload on their No.10. They might get away with this particular injury being a minor one, but as the fixtures pile up and the season progresses, they risk losing Palmer for a much longer period after a rest-less summer.

Mauricio Pochettino named a U.S. national team roster for the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan that left out some familiar names and top emerging players.

That sparked short-term questions — how will the USA fare against a pair of Asian powers? — and long-term speculation about Pochettino's selection process heading toward the 2026 World Cup.

Big picture/Small picture issues

It is possible to examine this roster for both the short- and the long-term implications. Pochettino helped explain during Tuesday's media call with several key statements. 

First, he quantified the USMNT player pool and said he was tracking 60-65 players on a weekly basis to monitor their progress. 

Second, he said this was the last camp with the possibility of bringing in new faces (at least in significant numbers). 

Third, and most importantly, he addressed the nature of needing roster spots to become more competitive within the squad. In a specific point that addressed the nature of the roster, he said he didn't have “A team” players or “B team” players as the media and fans like to refer to teams. Often this leads to the assumption that only a few players are competing for roster spots while others are “locks” who can take their spots for granted. 

“We respect and have full respect for all the players who can be called by us,” Pochettino said. “All need to feel the possibility to fight for a place. If we want to be a team that is really competitive, we cannot nominate 13, 14, 16 players and say for sure these guys will arrive at the World Cup and the rest need to fight for a place. 

“Come on, that is not the real sport of football. When you see national teams that have won World Cups, you really understand what that means.

“Players need to feel the threat from your teammates They need to defend their place every single possibility they have with the national team.”

Many fans were critical of the roster. Even giving full respect to a coach of Pochettino's stature, some of the picks were tough to comprehend. But critics of the roster must ask: What, exactly, makes this team exempt from an overhaul? What about the team over the past 16 months is worth clinging to? 

At the Copa America and at the Nations League, the team played far below the sum of its parts. The Gold Cup was somewhat better but even then, Pochettino was limited with roster constraints. 

If Pochettino wants to change the direction of the team, he can't call back the same core each camp, which was a valid criticism during the later years of Gregg Berhalter's tenure. The few new faces that would occasionally emerge would then have a harder time finding their way because the large core would dictate the culture. 

To get to the heart of it, this roster is about cleaning the slate. 

This camp is about making players work for call-ups, and when they get back into camp, having a new tone. It is sending a message to players.  

An important takeaway: the players not in camp are just as important as the players who are on this roster. Pochettino wants to see those who were left off respond the way Josh Sargent has (scoring goals in each of Norwich's first four games this season). 

Pochettino wants to see desperation for call-ups, not players simply assuming they'll be invited. Then once they're in camp, they know they must perform to earn playing time. 

Pochettino inherited a flawed team whose core has been together for over half a decade. It's a process to fix it. It's not about a few simple tactical adjustments but rather more drastic measures. 

We don't yet know how the team will look in October. But the players in this camp have a huge opportunity to boost their stock. The players not in this camp simply have to work harder and perform better. Pochettino and his staff are watching their club performances. 

Here's a position-by-position look at things.

Goalkeeping

Pochettino has turned the goalkeeping position on its head. Not since Tim Howard or Brad Guzan were in the picture has the USMNT willingly dropped Matt Turner, Zack Steffen or Ethan Horvath in a FIFA calendar window. Then, on top of that, 2024 Olympic team goalkeeper Patrick Schulte has also been dropped. 

Matt Freese is a great example of how things can change for a player. With Pochettino wanting to look at different options beyond Turner, Freese was given the starting Gold Cup spot when Schulte and Steffen were injured. A bad mistake against Haiti aside, he took advantage of the opportunity. He's now fighting to possibly be a World Cup starter.

Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach.

NEW YORK -- There have been times this year when Naomi Osaka expressed frustration at her lack of progress after returning to tennis as a mother. But as the North American summer hard-court season sweeps to a conclusion, it's clear she again has that championship gleam in her eye.

Thursday's 6-3, 6-1 win over Hailey Baptiste was a study in controlled aggression. Despite the swirling wind, the four-time Grand Slam champion was a composed, serene presence in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Osaka, who needed only 70 minutes to win, busted out the big strokes only when necessary.

On Saturday, the No. 23-seeded Osaka will play the winner of the later match between No. 15 Daria Kasatkina and Kamilla Rakhimova.

It's probably not a coincidence that since coach Tomasz Wiktorowski joined her team in Montreal, Osaka has won eight of nine matches.

Asked on court what he's bringing to her game, Osaka dodged the question.

“I can't give up my secrets,” she said, laughing. “But he definitely makes me see tennis in a different way -- and you can see it in the way I'm playing recently.”

Osaka's signature strokes -- a powerful serve and a forehand to go with it -- still get most of the attention. She had seven aces (and no double faults) in her first-round victory over Greet Minnen.

But it's her new-and-improved return game that suggests she might soon return to Top 10 form. It's been a point of emphasis for Wiktorowski.

“I feel like with Tomasz we've been working a lot on my returns,” Osaka told reporters, “and I feel more confident. So I think that's a really big point for me, because I feel like I was able to focus and kind of break back immediately when I needed to.”

Her return position appears to be slightly deeper -- she was about five feet off the baseline against Baptiste -- and “it's made me a lot more comfortable returning.”

In her two matches, Osaka is 11-for-14 in break-point conversions.

In perhaps the most telling statistic in tennis, she has won an extraordinary 41 of 54 (.759) second-serve return points.

Osaka, who turned heads with her red-sparkle ensemble in the opening round, came out for her second match awash in purple from head to toe. After playing the first several games with her hair down, she quickly fashioned it into a bun -- and her game picked up noticeably.

The No. 47-ranked Baptiste and Osaka had played two previous matches, earlier this year on hard courts in Auckland and Miami, and both went the three-set distance before Osaka prevailed. This time, Osaka asserted herself early and often, with service breaks in the second and sixth games.

The second set was much the same, with breaks coming from Osaka in the first, fifth and seventh games. Baptiste reached the second round at the US Open for the first time, following best-ever results at Roland Garros (fourth round) and Wimbledon (third round).

Osaka, who won US Open titles in 2018 and 2020, is now 20-5 in second-round matches at the Grand Slams and 7-1 in New York.

Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach.

The world No. 1 spoke with Ostapenko following her confrontation with Taylor Townsend.ByDavid KanePublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 28, 2025

NEW YORK—Aryna Sabalenka revealed she spoke with Jelena Ostapenko in the immediate aftermath of the No. 25 seed's dramatic second-round crash out to Taylor Townsend at the 2025 US Open.“During our conversation, I didn't know what happened,” the world No. 1 said in answer to a question from *Bounces* following her second-round victory over Polina Kudermetova.What happened: Ostapenko castigated a victorious Townsend for failing to acknowledge a lucky netcord in the first set of the latter's 7-5, 6-1 victory, accusing Townsend of having “no class and no education” before getting booed off a packed Court 11 on Wednesday.“Well, I have to say that she's nice,” said Sabalenka. “You know, she just sometimes can lose control. She has some things in life to face and some struggles. I was just trying to help her to…face it more in mature way, but I was just trying to help her to settle down and kind of, like…just was someone she could speak to and just let it go.”

Sabalenka herself suffered an emotional lapse when she fell in the final of Roland Garros to Coco Gauff, later apologizing for post-match press comments that disparaged Gauff's play.“You know, I think she just sometimes can just lose control over her emotions, which [is] pretty tough,” Sabalenka continued. “I really hope that one day she will figure herself and she will handle it much better.”Read more: Ostapenko comments “came from an ugly place”Asked to clarify whether she believed Ostapenko was going through personal issues, Sabalenka said:I think so, yeah.

You just don't understand what's going on in the moment.I'm pretty sure, looking back, she's not happy with her behavior.Ostapenko was not immediately apologetic on social media, continuing to insist in since-deleted Instagram stories that Townsend owed her an apology for the netcord shot, adding that Townsend's preference to begin her pre-match warm-up broke an unwritten tennis rule.“Situations like that motivate me to work even harder,” wrote Ostapenko, who will be back on court Thursday for her first round of women's doubles with Barbora Krejcikova against No. 11 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani.

Ostapenko was not immediately apologetic on social media, continuing to insist in since-deleted Instagram stories that Townsend owed her an apology for the netcord shot, adding that Townsend's preference to begin her pre-match warm-up broke an unwritten tennis rule.“Situations like that motivate me to work even harder,” wrote Ostapenko, who will be back on court Thursday for her first round of women's doubles with Barbora Krejcikova against No. 11 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani.

Defending US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Polina Kudermetova on Wednesday. Earlier in the night, Jasmine Paolini overcame 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, winning 6-3, 6-3 to advance herself to the third round as well.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was broken in the opening game Wednesday night and tested throughout by Polina Kudermetova, but ultimately showed the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd why she's the defending US Open champion.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Sabalenka prevailed 7-6 (4), 6-2 in 1 hour and 36 minutes to reach the third round and keep her title defense on track.

The win marks her 30th career main-draw victory at the US Open.

“In the first set, I was super tight and super aggressive,” Sabalenka said after the match. “It felt like there were almost no points. It was more about the serve and first shot and it was super quick. I'm glad that I was able to handle that pressure and put it back on her and get that first set.

“Then in the second set, I felt much better on the return game and my serve was much better. So, I'm really glad that in the first set I stayed really strong.”

Wednesday's second-round match was their second meeting of 2025, after Sabalenka defeated Kudermetova in January to win the Brisbane International title.

As she did in Australia, Kudermetova gave the World No. 1 everything she could handle in the first set this time around.

After Sabalenka saved four break points in the first game, Kudermetova finally converted the fifth chance to go up an early break. Sabalenka responded immediately, breaking back in the next game, but Kudermetova's barrage of forehand winners kept the pressure on, forcing a tiebreak

That's when “Tiebreakalenka” lived up to her nickname, winning her 19th tiebreak of the season in 20 attempts.

“I don't know,” Sabalenka said. “I'm just trying to stay aggressive. I'm trying to fight for every point, and I know that every point can be a key moment of the set, so I'm just trying to stay strong and I'm just trying to play aggressive.”

After trading holds early in the second set, Sabalenka struck first, breaking for a 2-1 lead. Following a medical timeout for Kudermetova's right knee during the ensuing changeover, the defending champion pulled away, securing a second break to close out the match.

Sabalenka will face 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the third round.

The two have faced each other just once in their careers, having last met in the semifinals of the aforementioned 2021 US Open, when Fernandez won in three sets.

Jasmine Paolini advanced to the third round of the US Open for the second consecutive year, defeating 17-year-old American Iva Jovic 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday night.

Paolini broke Jovic's serve five times in the 1-hour, 26-minute match.

Despite the scoreline, the contest was competitive, with Paolini saving her best stuff for the biggest moments, saving nine break points out of the 11 she faced.

The Italian now holds a 2-0 record against Jovic in head-to-head matchups.

Next, Paolini will face former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round. It will be their first meeting in a WTA Tour main draw.

NEW YORK — Can lightning strike twice for Alexei Popyrin at the US Open?For the second year in a row, the Australian is set to face the tournament's defending champion, this time world No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday.Last year, Popyrin shocked the tennis world with his third-round win over Novak Djokovic, who was chasing his record 25th Grand Slam title. Now he's hoping for more of the same after defeating Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3) to set up a second-round meeting with Sinner.Read More: The unquenchable fire in Novak Djokovic—and Venus Williams“Jannik is the best in the world, and he's one of the best for a reason,” Popyrin told press on Tuesday. “But I don't feel too starstruck by the occasion. I've been in that position before—I think last year is a great example of it.“For me, I feel like if I can stick to my game, if I can play the way I want to play, then I can cause trouble.”

“For me, I feel like if I can stick to my game, if I can play the way I want to play, then I can cause trouble.”

That Djokovic win was a career highlight. It was Popyrin's third Grand Slam meeting with Djokovic that year, having taken sets off him at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon before Djokovic prevailed. But in New York, Popyrin turned the tables, arriving fresh after winning his biggest title to date at the ATP Masters 1000 in Montreal and stunning Djokovic in four sets.This season has been different. Currently ranked No. 36, Popyrin's best results are quarterfinal runs in Monte Carlo and Toronto. Without a title coming into the US Open, he admits confidence isn't quite as high but says he's leaning on his experience and preparation.“I think there's a game plan to beat anybody, I think everybody has some sort of weakness,” he said. “A lot of the top guys, they hide it really really well… But I feel like everyone does have a weakness.”“I just have to focus on myself, just have to focus on what I'm doing,” he added. “For me, that's playing aggressive and playing my game. I have to focus on myself and just doing what I've been doing in the last couple of months, because it's been working.”

Popyrin actually holds the head-to-head edge over Sinner, though their only meeting came on clay in Madrid in 2021—a lifetime ago considering the Italian's surge to the top. Sinner is now world No. 1 and the reigning champion at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open.“He's just an unbelievable ballstriker,” Popyrin said of Sinner. “You give him a little bit of time, if you give him a slow ball, he'll put you away. If you hit the same rhythm to him all the time, he'll be unbelievable.“His serve has improved over the years, and I think that's what got him to where he is now… his returns are good. He's just an all-around great player and an unbelievable mover too.”

Could Popyrin be primed for another upset?

Carlitos hit cleanly and stayed in command. His talented opponent, Mattia Bellucci, tight for two sets, never showed what he can do.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—It only took two games for the first sign of trouble to appear.Mattia Bellucci was serving at 0-1, 15-40 versus Carlos Alcaraz. That the 65th-ranked player in the world would go down an immediate break against a five-time Grand Slam champ was hardly a shock, or a disaster in a best-of-five-set match. This was the first time the 24-year-old Italian had played under the bright lights in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Alcaraz, of course, knows that super-charged atmosphere well. You might say he embodies it.So it wasn't the fact that Bellucci ended up losing his serve in the second game of the match that seemed so ominous, it was the way he lost it. At 15-40, he fired a serve and followed it with a forehand winner. One break point down. At 30-40, he fired another serve, drew a short reply from Alcaraz, and moved in for the kill. It looked for a split second that he would get himself out of the jam, and get on the board early—always a plus for an Ashe rookie.But instead of knocking off that short forehand at the peak of its bounce, Bellucci waited for the ball to come down a bit. And then, possibly because he wanted to see which way Alcaraz was going, he waited some more. When Bellucci finally swung, he could no longer pound it straight down. He had to use topspin to get it over the net and back down in the court. He didn't use enough, the ball went long, and he was broken.

Sorry, I gotta do my job. Carlos Alcaraz, to the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd

Bellucci was clearly tight and hesitant. Typically, a player in his position will lose the first set quickly, and then loosen up somewhere in the second, once he gets a couple holds under his belt. Bellucci did the first thing—he lost the opening set 6-1. But he never loosened up in the second, and lost it 6-0.Playing on Ashe at night is one thing. Doing it against an in-form and not-nervous Alcaraz, who has been spotted an early lead, is another, much worse proposition. An opponent of his can normally count on him dropping his level, donating you a few wild errors, and maybe helping you to a break of serve. But that wasn't the Alcaraz we saw on Wednesday. He was clean and in command. He won 86 percent of his first-serve points, had 17 break points on Bellucci's serve, was 14 of 18 at net, and hit 32 winners while holding his opponent to 11.“I played great, to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” Alcaraz said after his 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 win. “I tried to make the most of his mistakes, getting a good good rhythm.”

That said, the most important stat of the night was Bellucci's winner-to-error ratio: He hit 11 of the former, and made 35 of the latter. Even in the third set, when he had finally relaxed and Alcaraz had lost a little focus, Bellucci couldn't keep the ball in long enough to create any scoreboard pressure.“I know Mattia's level, and today wasn't his day,” Alcaraz said, while apologizing to the crowd for not making the match last longer.“Sorry, I gotta do my job.”

When I saw the draw, I won't say I circled this match, but I did think it would be interesting and potentially entertaining for a night crowd. When he's feeling good, Bellucci has a wide repertoire of shots and superb touch. His run to the semis in Rotterdam earlier this year, where he beat Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, was memorable. He killed them with his jumping backhand drop shot.But I can only remember Bellucci daring to hit that shot once against Alcaraz on Wednesday. It won him the point with a brilliantly angled short backhand, but it was a one-off, a glimpse of what could have been. Bellucci lost to Alcaraz, but he lost first to Ashe.As for the winner, he moves on to the third round, and a date with another, higher-ranked Italian, Luciano Darderi.

NEW YORK—Aryna Sabalenka has battled through some late nights at the US Open, starting one match after midnight en route to her 2024 title.The defending champion could have been in for a similarly late finish as she was scheduled to follow former champion Carlos Alcaraz and close out the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium.But Alcaraz came through for Sabalenka on Wednesday night, posting a one-hour, 36-minute victory over Mattia Bellucci and paving the way for Sabalenka to ease into the third round by 11PM.To say Sabalenka was relieved was an understatement:

To say Sabalenka was relieved was an understatement:

Q. Last year you started a match here after midnight, I believe. You started much more on time tonight, and you finished relatively early. How big a difference does that make in your recovery?ARYNA SABALENKA: Oh, thank you, Carlos. Thank you so much for finishing that match in three sets and making it quick and not too much of a wait for me, because I hate playing the second after 7:00 after guys.It's the worst. Especially when you play in the later stages of the tournament when the matches get tighter, and there's, like, five sets, and you are, like, it's 12:00, and you're still waiting.I'm super happy that he did it really quick, and I went on court on time. Now I'll be back, and I'll have some more time to recover.The top seed navigated a tough first set against Polina Kudermetova before racing through the second, putting together a 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory in an identical time of one hour and 36 minutes, reaching the third round at Flushing Meadows for a fifth straight year.Sabalenka will next face Leylah Fernandez in a rematch of their 2021 semifinal, a match Fernandez won in three in three sets and the world No. 1 initially claimed not to remember.“Of course, I do remember a couple of things,” she clarified, “and I love revenge. So, I'm actually super excited facing her here again.”Sabalenka is scheduled to take on Fernandez on Friday—not too late, perhaps Alcaraz willing.

"I designed this outfit a while ago," Osaka revealed in her post-match press conference. "I just thought it would be really fun to do a New York under the lights. I'm glad that my first match was a night match, because this outfit was really fun to play in."Completing her walkout look: a red embellished jacket, matching headphones—and a red bejeweled Labubu figurine with its own blue racquet, which she proudly showed off post-match.“This is my Labubu!” she told the crowd with a grin. “She's named Billie Jean Bling—not Billie Jean King, Billie Jean Bling.”

Osaka has worn a floral-inspired Nike kit at nearly every Grand Slam this year. At the Australian Open, she rocked a sunflower-themed kit, complete with matching clips and earrings. At Roland Garros, she went full ‘sakura' with cherry blossom nails and magical girl-inspired hair.At Wimbledon, however, she hit pause on the floral looks, opting for a more understated white outfit after an early exit in Paris.“Since it's Wimbledon and I haven't really seen anyone doing anything, I felt like I was being the extra one again,” Osaka told press in London. “Spoiler alert, but the US Open (outfit) is really extra.”

Townsend shrugged off the net incident, saying “You're not going to disrespect me in my face.”ByDavid KanePublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—“This is the type of day you all live for,” Taylor Townsend told the media as she sat down for her post-match press conference at the 2025 US Open.Townsend had just clinched a 7-5, 6-1 win over Jelena Ostapenko that devolved into near-bedlam as the No. 25 seeded-Ostapenko lashed out at her victorious opponent at net, accusing her of having “no class and no education,” drawing boos from the Court 11 crowd.“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

I chalk it up to being upset and, you know, she pulled out all the stops to try and break the momentum. Sometimes people do that, but it is what it is. Still, there's no beef. But again, like you guys saw, I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter. Taylor Townsend

“I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect,” she added in press. “If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter.“I think that that's tennis, right? You know no matter what's going on, it's me versus you, but at the end of the day we have to respect each other and respect what happens out on the court. It's competition.“So, you know, it was unfortunate, but…it's something I can put on my TikTok!”

“So, you know, it was unfortunate, but…it's something I can put on my TikTok!”

Ostapenko wrote a statement after the match on her Instagram stories, later posting an update to deny allegations that her outburst had racist undertones. (IG/@jelena.ostapenko).

By the time Townsend had taken the podium for her press conference Ostapenko, who had not been requested by the media in the event that she lost her second round, posted a statement to social media accusing Townsend of being “very disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding moment and didn't say sorry.“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was the first time ever that this happened to me on tour.”Ostapenko, who later denied the outburst had racist understones on her Instagram stories, further accused Townsend of breaking a rule by to start their pre-match warm-up at the net, something Townsend said she does before every match.

“You know, this isn't the first, second, third, fourth time I've played Jelena, so if she's complaining about how I warm up, that's fine,” said Townsend. “You can go back to the time that I played my first-ever pro tennis match, and I've been doing this since even juniors. It wasn't anything targeted towards her to try and take her off of her game or her rhythm. You know, I just was doing my thing.“Honestly, laugh at it. I think it's comical. I think that it's kind of funny, because to then go online and have to justify what you said, you obviously feel some type of way and feel like you have to give an explanation for how you acted. I don't feel like I have to explain how I acted. I think it was very self-explanatory. I'm standing in what I said.”Though she called this behavior part of Ostapenko's “MO,” Townsend said she bore no ill will against the former French Open champion after the match, the top-ranked doubles player dismissing the suggestion that Ostapenko be barred from competing in the doubles event as a result of the incident.

The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here sitting in front of you guys moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important. She's packed up and she's gone. I'm here, and that's the only thing that matters. Taylor Townsend

“I'm an Aries, so I'm a fire sign. I wore fire today. Maybe that's why I was fired up. I was ready to go,” she said with a laugh.“Yeah, I mean, this is one of the reasons why I love sports. You know, to be able to watch the tension and watch things and to see how someone can handle themselves in the moment.

I'm here, and that's the only thing that matters.”Into the third round of the US Open for the third time in her singles career, Townsend will next face No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva for the chance to reach the second week.

“Yeah, I mean, this is one of the reasons why I love sports. You know, to be able to watch the tension and watch things and to see how someone can handle themselves in the moment.

NEW YORK (AP)—Daniil Medvedev was fined a total of $42,500 by the US Open on Wednesday—more than a third of his $110,000 tournament prize money—for his meltdown during a first-round loss after a photographer wandered onto the court during the match.Tournament referee Jake Garner docked Medvedev $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and another $12,500 for racket abuse. When the match ended, Medvedev repeatedly smacked a racket against his sideline chair, destroying the equipment.Medvedev, a former No. 1-ranked player who won the championship at Flushing Meadows in 2021, was angered on Sunday night when chair umpire Greg Allensworth decided to allow opponent Benjamin Bonzi another first serve after the bizarre interruption.Bonzi was a point from winning while leading 5-4 in the third set when the photographer—whose credential was later revoked—began walking along the side of the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium just after a fault.Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay. Medvedev approached the official to complain, and that is when things got wild. The crowd began booing and chanted, "Second serve!" In all, play was held up for more than six minutes as Medvedev riled up the fans and insulted Allensworth.

"He wants to go home, guys. He doesn't like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour," Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.When order was restored, Medvedev wound up taking that set—and the fourth, too. But Bonzi eventually wound up winning 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4.It was Medvedev's third consecutive Grand Slam loss in the first round, including last month at Wimbledon against Bonzi.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

See which driver's got the smarts in the final episode of Grill the Grid for 2025.

We like to think our Grill the Grids are pretty fiendish – but our producers really had it in for the F1 drivers with the final round of the series for 2025.

The current field were asked to guess the Grand Prix and the year in which it took place from some pretty opaque descriptions – with each question involving three separate clues, and points on offer from three down to one depending on how many of those clues the drivers required.

It was tricky enough to make Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg plead “help me” to his press officer waiting in the wings – as the drivers' efforts set the final scores for the 2025 Grill the Grid championship.

Hit play on the video above to see who aced the final round of Grill the Grid – and find out which driver was crowned the series champion for 2025.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue.

A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery.

A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1.

Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid.

Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

To listen to this week's episode, simply hit go on the audio player above or click here to listen via your preferred podcasting platform.

You can also check out a huge selection of previous episodes – spanning every decade of F1 – in our dedicated Beyond The Grid library here.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Here is all the information you need to follow the Dutch Grand Prix live on F1 TV.

Formula 1 kicks off the second half of the season this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix marks the sport's return from its summer break – and here's all the information you need to follow the action live on F1 TV.

Oscar Piastri remains at the top of the Drivers' Championship ahead of Round 15, but his lead now stands at just nine points from McLaren team mate Lando Norris following the Briton's victory last time out in Hungary.

Norris was also the race winner when F1 visited Zandvoort in 2024 – but can the 25-year-old repeat that this time around, or will Piastri return to the top step of the podium?

There is likely to be plenty of fan support for Max Verstappen as the Dutchman enters into his home weekend. Red Bull struggled for pace at the Hungaroring, but can they bounce back this time out? And where will Mercedes and Ferrari place in the pecking order?

As usual, we will bring you coverage of all the action from the Dutch Grand Prix across our various platforms.

You can enjoy the coverage from every session live on F1 TV Pro, where we bring you closer to the action via exclusive features like onboard cameras on all 20 of the drivers' cars, and access to both our Pre-Race and Post-Race Shows.

Viewers can watch every F1 Grand Prix, F1 Sprint, Qualifying and practice session live in 4K Ultra HD/HDR at home, with F2, F3, F1 ACADEMY and Porsche Supercup sessions also available to watch live on the platform.

Other highlights on F1 TV include in-depth shows such as Tech Talk Retro, which shines a light on iconic car designs from years gone by, and F1 Icons, which tells the exhilarating stories of legendary drivers of the past.

From a user experience perspective, there is a fresh, mobile-friendly design to make it easier to navigate and select F1 TV content on the go, and an ‘Interactive Schedule' for web and mobile, enabling users to follow sessions live and access content straight from the schedule.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31.

*From the last four races in the Netherlands

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference.

You don't really appreciate the banking until you go around it at Turn 3. The theory is multiple lines, but everyone just bolts for the outside line and tries to get the exit right. And again, coming through the final corner as well, running the banking.

It is a nice, flowing track. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well...

“For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The teams will have a choice of the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, whereas in 2024 the available compounds were C1, C2 and C3.

“The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.

“[In 2024], 16 drivers lined up on the grid on the medium tyre, while three – Lewis Hamilton, Yuki Tsunoda and Valtteri Bottas – went for the soft, with Kevin Magnussen starting from the pit lane on hards. Three quarters of the field made just one stop during the race, taking on the hard as the second set, while Magnussen went with the medium.

“The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium.

“Nico Hulkenberg drove the longest stint of all, completing 57 laps on the hard. Oscar Piastri topped the list with the medium on 33 laps, while Hamilton ran 24 on the soft.”

The season resumes with things still very much all to play for in the Drivers' Championship. Just nine points now separate leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris at the top of the standings, with Norris seemingly holding the momentum after winning three of the last four Grands Prix before the summer break.

Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far.

It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. However, McLaren have also voiced their concerns about the possibility of the squad's rivals posing more of a challenge in the second half of the campaign.

Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again.

Red Bull, meanwhile, faced a challenging weekend at the Hungaroring, with the RB21 struggling to match the team's competitors. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans?

Elsewhere, the midfield battle remains as tight as ever. Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort.

James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented.

In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out.

Once the rest of the field had eventually pitted, Hunt found himself in the giddy heights of P1 – a position Lauda was desperate to reclaim. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation.

It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will resume their intra-team fight at the upcoming Dutch Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri has taken a moment to reflect on his battle against McLaren team mate Lando Norris this season, with the championship situation finely poised ahead of the decisive 10-round run-in.

Making the most of an ultra-competitive McLaren package, Piastri and Norris often found themselves in a fight of their own over the first 14 Grand Prix weekends – the Australian winning six races to the Briton's five so far.

While there have been some dramatic moments, such as a collision at the Canadian Grand Prix and close calls during wheel-to-wheel scraps in Austria and Hungary, the two drivers have maintained cordial relations.

Speaking ahead of the campaign resuming at the Dutch Grand Prix, Piastri provided some more insight on the intra-team environment – and how the two McLaren drivers are balancing their respective bids for the individual title with the team's collective goals.

“Our relationship hasn't really changed,” Piastri, who leads Norris by a slender margin of nine points, explained in an interview for the official McLaren website.

“The competitive environment is quite different this year, yes, but our relationship is pretty much the same. The way we work together, how we try and help the team, and what we want from the car, it is all the same.

“I think we're both very conscious that we want to have success with this team for a long time. That is not lost on either of us. Healthy competition is important, of course, but it is important to keep the team united, and I think we both have that in the back of our minds.”

Piastri, who is navigating his third season in F1, compared to Norris' seventh, also reflected more generally on how he has dealt with the weight of being in contention for the title.

“I would say I've handled it well, but this has been the part of the year when the pressure isn't really on in the championship fight,” he commented.

“Obviously, you don't want to give away points, but it has been far too early to be thinking of the season in that way. At this stage, you just want to go into the weekend trying to get the most out of it as you can, rather than thinking of the championship overall.

“So yes, I think I've handled it well, but I haven't concentrated on it much.”

Looking ahead, though, Piastri admitted: “The pressure is only going to increase from here. When we get to the latter part of the year, that is when the pressure will ramp up.”

While Piastri and Norris' head-to-head looks set to rumble on, McLaren are cruising towards back-to-back Teams' Championship titles for the first time since 1991 – boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari in the standings.

EXCLUSIVE: When NBC's Chicago Med returns this fall for its eleventh season, it will be without one of its three remaining original cast members. Marlyne Barrett, who has played doting yet no-nonsense ER nurse Maggie Lockwood since the show's 2015 launch, is stepping back from the medical drama for personal reasons, sources tell Deadline. 


	This is envisioned as a temporary leave, and the hope is for her to return at some point, I hear. 


	As Deadline reported in June, the other two Chicago Med original cast members, series stars S. Epatha Merkerson (Sharon Goodwin) and Oliver Platt (Daniel Charles), are set to come back after their options for the 2025-26 season were picked up. And just this week, Deadline broke the news that fellow OG Nick Gehlfuss, who left after eight seasons, will make a return this season as a guest-star, reprising his role as Dr. Will Halstead.

	Over the years, Barrett's Charge Nurse Maggie has become the eyes, ears and heart of Gaffney Medical's Emergency Department, endlessly dedicated to her position and loyal to all the physicians around her. Maggie's major Season 10 storyline involved the tense nursing union negotiations at the hospital, which culminated in a sick-out.


	In Season 5, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and eventually went into remission. Barrett announced her real-life diagnosis of uterine and ovarian cancer in July 2022. In September 2024, the actress revealed that she was in full remission. 

	











Chicago Med, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Allen MacDonald, Stephen Hootstein and Peter Jankowski.


	The three One Chicago dramas kick off their new seasons Oct. 1, with Chicago Med leading the charge at 8 p.m.

A major star for the majority of his adult life, Jay Kelly has so thoroughly subsumed himself into his classic screen persona — smirking, debonair, heroic — that he no longer seems to know who he is off set. More troublingly, the world-famous actor has come to like it that way. As Sylvia Plath once wrote: “It's a hell of a responsibility to be yourself. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.” 

That quote serves as an almost oppressively fitting epigraph for the misty-eyed Netflix movie that Noah Baumbach has made about one of the last true Hollywood stars — or two of them, I should say, as Jay Kelly is so transparent a stand-in for the actor who plays him that he and George Clooney share the same body of work. (No complaint here: “Funny People” is one of my favorite genres). Plath's words help to frame “Jay Kelly” as the story of a dashing sexagenerian who's known by everyone and no one in equal measure, but Baumbach's uncharacteristically precious screenplay, co-written with thee Emily Mortimer, has little trouble articulating that dilemma on its own terms.

One catchy line that claws at the same idea: “All my memories are movies.” Jay delivers it towards the start of the film, so soon after he's wrapped production on a new crime picture — “8 Men from Now,” which ends with the actor dying for the umpteenth time — that he might as well still be reading from a script. There's an immediately perceptible twinge of regret in Clooney's voice, like the kind of shooting pain that can't mean anything serious so long as you choose to ignore it, but the real wound of that double-bladed dialogue won't be felt until much later. 

 










The problem for Jay isn't that his movies are memories, and that he's gone from one part to another for so long that he's forgotten how to act without the cameras rolling; that's a problem, but also one that has always managed to solve itself. No, the problem for Jay is that his memories are movies: They're frozen in time, shared by everyone who's seen them, and practically impossible to change once they've been cemented in the public imagination. On set, Jay has the power to go again. To do another take. To get one more just for safety. In life, however, he has to live with the choices he's made. And as Jay reaches a certain age and starts being threatened with career tributes, he suddenly finds himself forced to watch those choices back in a veritable supercut of great success and profound misgiving. 

Which is to say that yes, “Jay Kelly” is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves. Baumbach lacks Sofia Coppola's singular ability to leverage a character's wealth for the wanting it reveals of them, but he, Mortimer, and Clooney share a vivid understanding of the resentments that can form in the space between who we are and how we're seen — and of how stardom can widen that space to the point that friendships and families are liable to fall into it unnoticed. 

 










It's a space that Baumbach explores here with an unusually gentle touch. On the one hand, the “Meyerowitz Stories” director has never been as allergic to sentimentality as his prickliest work might suggest, and I find it hard to begrudge any of the great filmmakers for going soft as they get older — we should all be so lucky to reach the back half of our lives and feel as if the world was a kinder, more loving place than we once thought. On the other hand, watching a director as scabrous as Noah Baumbach make a movie as tenderly indrawn as “Jay Kelly” can feel like watching a ginsu knife get dulled into a loofah. 

Here, Baumbach compensates for that sometimes clumsily overdrawn emotionality by rooting his film in a cragged bedrock of sadness — one that adds a serrated edge to the constant refrain of “I was too busy having sex with movie stars to spend time with my daughters” melancholy. That sadness is baked into the story from the start, as “Jay Kelly” begins with the death of a mentor figure named Peter (Jim Broadbent, seen in flashback), who directed Jay's breakout success 30 years earlier. Peter was desperately fending off irrelevance the last time they spoke, and had begged Jay to help him get his comeback project off the ground. Jay felt the project was too raw and vulnerable for his brand, and was unmoved by Peter's appeal to his filial duty. In the end, Peter failed to get the movie financed, and Jay can't help but suspect that it literally killed him.

 










That suspicion furrows something deep behind Jay's eyes; it's a serious wrinkle on the face of someone whose job requires him to be a dimple-cheeked blank slate at all times, pliable enough to play a variety of parts but always recognizably “himself.” A whole team of people have devoted the best years of their lives to ensuring that Jay never has to feel anything worse than mild discomfort, his sweet if self-annihilating manager Ron Sukenick (Adam Sandler) chief among them, but they don't pick up on the aftershocks of Peter's death until after it's too late. They don't know what's going to happen when Jay is lured to a bar for a post-funeral drink with his old acting school friend Timothy (Billy Crudup), who's aged into a pediatrician with a serious chip on his shoulder.

The next thing Ron knows, Jay has a black eye, he's pulling out of the big new movie he's due to start in a few days, and he's loading his entire team onto a plane to France as part of a wildly ill-advised plan to crash his teenage daughter's European vacation and spend some quality time with her before she goes to college in the fall. It's the perfect setup for a Sturgian misadventure across the continent, but “Jay Kelly” — more frantic than funny, and increasingly trending towards wistful revelation — is less interested in pursuing madcap laughs than it is in exploring the life of the mind. And so an overnight train ride that puts Jay among the common folk becomes the venue for a head trip down memory lane, complete with Trafalmadorian flashbacks that taunt the movie star by denying him another take. 

 










By design, “Jay Kelly” strikes an uneasy balance between moving forward and being stuck in the past. The long and emotionally imprecise flashbacks — which find Jay revisiting the critical audition where he upstaged Timothy, a set romance he had with one of his co-stars, and a more recent therapy session that he attended with his semi-estranged adult daughter (Riley Keough) — are meant to act as headwinds for a story about a man careening out of control, but none of them crackle with Baumbach's usual wit, and all of them suffer from a slightly elevated tone that only serves the “unreality” of Jay's life by making every part of it even harder to believe. 

That Clooney is just playing a sadder, more blinkered version of himself — one who never found a lasting love, nor started a family he was interested in keeping — would seem to solve any issues of verisimilitude, and there are a number of sequences in “Jay Kelly” where his real-life fame adds credence to the chaos we're seeing on-screen (most of them having to do with a starstruck member of the public). There are also several moments in which the self-reflexiveness of Clooney's casting effectively baits us into believing that the Cary Grant of his day is baring his soul for our edification. That he's waving us backstage and confessing the awful truth that some part of ourselves always looked for behind every red carpet smile and Golden Globes acceptance speech. That he's not that happy. That his life isn't perfect. That money, looks, and an unimpeachable run across the six greatest seasons of any network drama ever made don't make him better than us, even though that third thing objectively does. 

 










The last of those moments is heartstoppingly transcendent, as Baumbach brings the full weight of Clooney's iconography to bear on Jay's most private misgivings. The problem is that the rest of them rely on Clooney's persona to get the job done, and — in stark contrast to the unsparing honesty of “Funny People” — they aren't mean enough to sell us on the idea that Jay could be such a dithering cocker spaniel in his private life (there's a reason why Ron always addresses him as “puppy,” besides the fact that Ron addresses all of his clients that way). 

There's no use in faulting Clooney for his performance, as no one does Clooney better, and his leading man appeal — somehow wide-eyed and “aw shucks” at the same time — has seldom been used more acutely than it is here. Alas, his ineffable Clooney-ness also has the perverse effect of making “Jay Kelly” less convincing at the same time, at least so far as its lead character is being played by a man who makes all of his foibles that much harder to believe. I'm sure George Clooney has problems of his own, but no one would have a harder time inhabiting the problems that Corge Glooney is meant to have in this movie. That Jay Kelly's flaws clash against George Clooney's charms is precisely the point, of course — one is simply no match for the other. 

 










It's up to the rest of the cast to help level the playing field, but the only thing “Jay Kelly” does with its traveling circus is to winnow them down one by one as they get tired of Jay's antics. He's the overgrown child who takes them away from their actual children, blithely indifferent to the fact that he means more to them than they do to him in return. 

Some employees, like his publicist (Laura Dern), bail at the first sign of real trouble. Others, like Ron, are suffering from too great a sunk-cost fallacy to quit on him now. Sandler wears the shit out of a puffy Polo vest, and it's fun to see him lead with quiet resignation instead of unchecked rage, but I don't know if he's ever starred in a movie that's given him less to do. While Baumbach uses Ron to gesture at the specifically Hollywood complications of mixing business with pleasure, and to address the sheer number of people who are subsumed into the personal identity of a single brand-name star (“You're Jay Kelly,” Ron moans, “but I'm Jay Kelly too”), the character never develops beyond the tender embodiment of all the things his boss has forfeited along the way, including self-awareness, a cohesive family, and a wife played by Greta Gerwig. 

Getting close to other people was something that Jay always planned to do later, and the prospect of receiving a tribute from a Tuscan film festival is an unavoidable sign that he's running out of time. But other people were always going to be incidental to what really matters about “Jay Kelly,” a gorgeously bittersweet shortfaller that hits hardest as a cautionary tale about the perils of trying to avoid oneself in a world that only allows us to act like there's anyone else for us to be. Being a movie star just makes it that much easier to pass on the roles you were born to play. 

 










“Jay Kelly” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Netflix will release it in select theaters on Friday, November 14, and on Netflix on Friday, December 5.

Dr. Phil's contentious legal battle over the bankruptcy of his media venture, Merit Street Media, has taken a juicy turn. Merit's former broadcasting partners Trinity Broadcasting and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) have joined forces to accuse Phil McGraw of all sorts of shady shit, most notably that he swindled both organizations for millions and then used the bankruptcy to launch a new media venture, Envoy. This week, Trinity complained in court that McGraw has been going to “extraordinary lengths” to avoid deposition (per Deadline). 

One of his deposition-dodging tactics is allegedly refusing to hand over relevant materials for discovery in Trinity's breach of contract lawsuit. But the materials PBR has managed to acquire are pretty damning. Text messages from Merit Street's chief operating officer Joel Cheatwood suggest a bankruptcy conspiracy, evidenced by the fact that he instructed employees to keep all communications off of their work emails. The texts (via The Independent) lay out a scheme to wind down operations at Merit Street while shifting staffers over to Envoy. “The way this will probably work is once MSM is wound down there will be an auction of assets and newco will bid to buy the MSM program library,” he explained in one text. He also texted that he and Merit's Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon needed to “be very careful with our public activities associated with Envoy since we are still full and active employees” of Merit, adding that any “[a]ctivities that would indicate we are more focused on Envoy could be problematic if called into question.”

“The Debtor and its executives knew the Envoy scheme was problematic and tried to conceal it by using only personal emails and texts. On June 30 (two days before the bankruptcy), Mr. Cheatwood instructed a colleague that ‘any communication involving timing of events, strategies, etc. we need to not use the merit street e-mail system. Use text instead,'” PBR's filing reads. (PBR hasn't outright sued Merit Street, but accused the company of failing to pay millions in owed payments.) “The documents produced to date demonstrate that this bankruptcy was conceived as a scheme to divert the Debtor's employees and intellectual property to Envoy, a competing business Dr. Phil founded the day before this case was filed, and leave the Debtor's business as a shell with nothing more than a repeated loop of re-runs.”

“By its own admission in a meet-and-confer between counsel on August 26, 2025, Peteski still has not produced all of Phillip C. McGraw's emails and text messages (despite his deposition being scheduled to begin in less than 48 hours from the time of such conference), nor has it produced all of the documents concerning Envoy,” Trinity stated in its own filing (via Deadline). “Peteski's same delay tactics persist. The pattern is so striking that it is more than mere déjà vu; it is a deliberate rerun, scripted by parties who have decided that the Court's orders are optional guidance rather than binding directives.”

Sabrina Carpenter warned that the provocative lyrics on her upcoming album Man's Best Friend might not be for prude-minded people in a preview from the singer's interview with CBS Mornings.


	“The album is not for any pearl clutchers,” Carpenter told Gayle King in a clip shared Thursday, one day before Man's Best Friend's arrival. “But I also think that even pearl clutchers can listen to an album like that in their own solitude and find something that makes them smirk and chuckle to themselves.”

“This is just fun”: In an exclusive interview tomorrow, pop superstar @SabrinaAnnLynn tells @GayleKing how she embraces the provocative lyrics in her highly-anticipated next album, “Man's Best Friend.” pic.twitter.com/DBWlGjXu2K


	While previous hits like “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” were more subtle with the innuendo, Man's Best Friend's previous singles and controversial album art suggest a bolder, more sexual LP, one that might make casual fans uncomfortable.


	“Sometimes people hear the lyrics that are really bold, and they go, ‘I don't want to sing this in front of other people.' It's like it's almost too TMI,” Carpenter added.

	“But I think about being at a concert with, you know, however many young women I see in the front row that are screaming at the top of their lungs with their best friends, and you can go like, ‘Oh, we can all sigh of relief, like, ‘This is just fun.' And that's all it has to be.”


	In her recent Rolling Stone cover story, Carpenter said of the people bemoaning her sultry stage shows, in particular her “Juno” positions, “It's always so funny to me when people complain. They're like, ‘All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. Clearly you love sex. You're obsessed with it. It's in my show. There's so many more moments than the ‘Juno' positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I can't control that. If you come to the show, you'll [also] hear the ballads, you'll hear the more introspective numbers. I find irony and humor in all of that, because it seems to be a recurring theme. I'm not upset about it, other than I feel mad pressure to be funny sometimes.”

Hayley Williams of Paramore has released a new solo album comprised of the 17 tracks shared earlier this summer and the new bonus song “Parachute.” Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party is out now on streaming services, with physical releases arriving on November 7 via Post Atlantic—Williams' own label, started after her 20-year contract with Atlantic ended—and distributed by Secretly Distribution. Listen to the new album below.

Since granting the title track with a music video, Williams has also shared a visual for “Glum,” directed by AJ Gibboney and Zac Farro, which you can watch below. Williams and Daniel James wrote, played, and recorded most instruments on Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, with additional help longtime collaborators Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard. Jim-E Stack also contributed to “True Believer.”

Back in 2020, Williams made her solo debut with the full-length album Petals for Armor. She followed it up with the three-track Petals for Armor: Self-Serenades EP that same year and Flowers for Vases / Descansos in 2021. She described the latter LP as “a prequel, or some sort of detour between parts 1 and 2 of Petals.” Afterward, Paramore wrote and released their fifth studio album as a band, This Is Why, in 2023.

Shouldn't a first look, you know, actually give you a first look at a movie? Especially when it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” set we've seen in over six years?

 It's been that long since “The Rise of Skywalker” came out, that long that Lucasfilm has been figuring what the future of “Star Wars” would be on the big screen. And now we have heard that the upcoming “Star Wars: Starfighter,” set in the years after “Rise of Skywalker,” has set much of the rest of its cast — Amy Adams, Aaron Pierre, Flynn Gray, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, and Daniel Ings join the already announced Ryan Gosling, Matt Smith, and Mia Goth — is going into production, and is giving us a first look.

If you can even call it a first look. What's the opposite of a first look? A blank stare. That's kinda what Gosling and Gray are doing above. 

Look, a posed photo of the actors just being themselves isn't always terrible — the epochal 2014 “Force Awakens” cast photo was incredible, just to see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford occupy the same space once again, but that involved a level of interest that simply is not yet there for “Starfighter.”

 










Three IndieWire staffers had strong thoughts about this “Star Wars: Starfighter” first look, and we're going to vent them like superheated plasma.

Over the course of a normal workday — especially one in the thick of fall film festival season — one can probably imagine the glut of emails that arrive with tick-tock regularity in the ol' IndieWire inboxes, so the unexpected ones? Those require a higher level of interest to get me clicking. A “first look” image of the next “Star Wars” movie? That fits the bill — but, alas. There's no question that plenty of words and phrases have lost their meaning in recent years, and “first look” seems to be one of them, at least in the entertainment space.

What should a true “first look” be? Well, for my money, it should be an actual production still, an initial peek not quite behind the curtain, but adjacent to it. I want to get a sense of what the final film will look like and feel like, a little action, a little movement. A black and white still — not, it seems clear, a photo taken during the filming of a real scene — with our stars (or is it their characters? that's always unclear) simply resting on a landspeeder, everything so dark and muddled that it's impossible to see much else? There are, uh, big pipes? Sure. Star Ryan Gosling might be wearing a cape? Fine. 

 










It's fine enough to mark the start of production with some glamour shots, but a “first look” this does not make, because it doesn't speak to the primary function of these kinds of photos: it doesn't tell me about the film itself. It doesn't even tell me about the making of this film (think about that recent first look for Richard Linkater's “Nouvelle Vague,” which captured the impish creative charm that runs through the final film). And don't even get me started on the use of black and white. “Star Wars” films used to have some pop and pizzazz, but this first look? Doesn't tell me anything.

It's not just funny, it's fitting, that the very first reply on Discussing Film's tweet with the photo is “It is time for ‘Drive' in space.” Because there's almost nothing that actually connotes “Star Wars” here other than the vaguest outline of a landspeeder. Why is this in black and white other than because of some idea that black and white signifies importance? If this is really a set from the movie, it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” movie set in over six years — we deserve to see that in color. You know, the way the movie itself will be presented? Gosling doesn't look like he's in a flight suit, and Flynn Gray looks like he's just Ezra from “Star Wars: Rebels” come to life, even though we know this movie will be set in a time when Ezra is a middle-aged man. What is there here to be really excited about? You couldn't even have a glimpse of an actual “Star Wars” starfighter in this first look at “Star Wars: Starfighter”? Maybe give us an A-Wing, to think outside the box a bit. Hell, throw Expanded Universe fans a bone and make it an E-Wing. I'm not saying that there needs to be some Easter Egg to suggest Gosling is playing Corran Horn (though, let's face it, any diehard “Star Wars” fan will tell you they could do a lot worse than adapting Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston's peerlessly great “X-Wing” books), but something to suggest, you know, intrigue. “Who's that guy?” People loved asking that when Vanity Fair would run their (color!) first looks at “Star Wars” movies back in the day. No one is going to ask “Who's that guy?” about this image.

 










Sometimes, a traumatic experience burns itself so deeply into your psyche that your worldview is irreparably altered. For me, one such memory was the first look photo for “Tulsa King” Season 1 dropping. The year was 2022, we hadn't seen a trailer for the Sylvester Stallone-led gangster series, and the world was hopelessly naive to the crime comedy delights that awaited us. But, one day, our first breadcrumb arrived… and it was just a picture of Stallone standing in a suit, looking exactly like I imagine he looks when he goes out for coffee on a random Tuesday. 

Perhaps it was just a formative memory because it came early in my media career, but I remember being dumbfounded by the notion that a show whose entire appeal rested on a single star would announce itself with such a regular-ass picture of said star. (To give some reluctant credit, he was standing in Tulsa, but I feel that's a detail we could have inferred from the title.) Close friends of mine know not to bring up the “Tulsa King” first look around me anymore because it often devolves into a rant that has real potential to ruin a night. 

“Tulsa King” has since become one of my favorite shows, so all's well that ends well. But that was the day I decided I was done with first look photos. I'm not even sure that the difference between black-and-white or color matters. I simply have no desire to see A-list stars looking exactly like themselves in a movie before I have the chance to see a second of them in action. I don't think there's a single person who looks at these things who isn't already following movies closely enough to be aware of what's coming out. These photos aren't swaying anybody, no matter how devilishly handsome Ryan Gosling looks. 

 










Nobody on this planet is lacking for opportunities to see pictures of celebrities anymore. We can Google or stream anything at any time, and algorithms go out of their way to shove our favorite beautiful people in our faces at all hours of the day. Yet we're still just uploading more pixels of the same people to data servers simply because we can! Somebody has to stand up to this madness, and I'm willing to risk everything to do it. I know attention spans are getting shorter, but I truly believe the human race is capable of waiting for a trailer.

Hayley Williams has always been bold — from her brightly-hued hair dye to her kickass attitude as the lead singer of Paramore. When it comes to music, the singer is equally unafraid. She belts her heart out and spits brutally honest lyrics across the band's discography and her own solo albums, 2020's Petals for Armor and 2021's Flowers for Vases/Descansos. But never has Williams sounded as brave as she does on her third album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. “I'll be the biggest star at this fucking karaoke bar,” she declares on the moody title track. The song's chorus repeats one line over and over again (“Can only go up from here”) as Williams gives up on shooting for the moon and settles for a more modest version of fame. It's ironic that a song about a literal ego death should be a highlight of Williams' strongest solo work to date. On Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, she's headed well beyond the stars — and she knows it.


	“Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party” and 16 other songs were surprise-released at the beginning of August after the singer initially uploaded the collection of songs on her website via an old-school web player. Despite being long enough for a full LP, the collection wasn't marketed as an album. (Even though it totally was). But now, after Williams gave Ego Death a properly long name true to her emo roots, and an official track list, the project finally feels complete.

	











	The track list was a major piece of this puzzle. Once Williams uploaded the 17 singles to streaming platforms just a few days after the web player, fans immediately created their own track lists through playlists. An overzealous Haleyhead even compiled all of the fan-made trackl ists into a website. Just like the web player, the experience felt plucked from the early-aughts days of Limewire downloads and the detailed labor of CD and cassette mixtapes. Williams said she wanted to shirk the weighty responsibility onto fans and gain inspiration from the way they received the music. But one listen to Ego Death and it's apparent the unconventional rollout was by design. Every heartfelt lyric and song transition details how Williams has clawed her way out of major loss and grief to uncover a new version of herself.

	Not only did Williams finally select a track list and provide an album title, she also shared a new song, “Parachute.” It's cacophonous and raging with regret, packing its deepest blows in the second verse. “You were at my wedding … You could've told me not to do it,” she shouts. That kind of romantic trauma is a theme throughout the record. Her rough vocal take is filled with hurt; Williams strains her voice as each word turns into a yell. It makes the wail she uncorked on Paramore's “All I Wanted” pale in comparison. There are plenty of other lovesick melodies on Ego Death, from the Lost in Translation-inspired “Dream Girl in Shibuya” to the Weezer-esque “Disappearing Man.” But “Parachute” sums up the scope of the heartbreak that defines much of the album best, especially as it closes out the LP. It follows the tender “I Won't Quit on You,” a hopeful moment where Williams promises she won't give up on her relationship. On “Parachute,” that hope is lost. But even so, with tracks like “Whim” and “Love Me Different,” the singer shows she's not afraid to open the metal cages to her black-tar heart and show all its boundless love.


	Throughout the album, there are similar hints of desired optimism. The sun peaks through the blinds and Williams is desperate to feel its warmth once more as she struggles with her loss. The cover alone is a perfect example of this dichotomy: it's a black-and-white close-up image of Williams with a yellow square around her face, echoing the aesthetic of the 17 singles. Even on some of the most depressing tracks, like the meditative “Glum” or antidepressant ode “Mirtzapine,” lyrics like “In the wake of your sunshine, I've never felt more glum” are pushed up against vibrant beats and clashes of powerful guitar.

	At 17 songs, Ego Death might seem bloated. But this album marks the first time Williams has ever owned her work outright, and who can blame her for wanting to make the most of that? (In 2024, the musician's decades-plus, controversial record contract with Atlantic ended.) This newfound freedom is a revelation for Williams, who calls out the “dumb motherfuckers that I made rich” on the trip-hop-tinged “Ice in My OJ.” Even with the lengthy track list, every song feels purposeful, each its own reflection of the musician's unique sonic landscape. Williams reaches for all of her influences and sprinkles samples of them onto Ego Death songs. From French alt-rock band Phoenix on “Love Me Different” to post-Weezer jokers the Bloodhound Gang for the chorus of “Discovery Channel,” and even a nod to TLC's “Waterfalls” in the lyrics of the title track, the album is a kaleidoscope of the music taste Williams has cultivated over the years.

Ego Death is also notably more percussive and louder than the rest of the singer's solo work. Producer Daniel James worked on Flowers for Vases and returned for Williams' third LP. With help from Paramore touring musicians Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard, as well as Lorde producer Jim-E Stack, who has a hand in “True Believer,” every track is propulsive no matter if it's diving into synth-pop or alt-rock. Gone is the sparse production of Petals or the quiet dissonance of Flowers. Here, the music is alive and banger-ready.


	If Williams' first two LPs saw her dipping her toe into solo work, Ego Death is a full plunge. Never has she sounded more certain or free. There is a kind of death here, one where the musician leaves behind bits of her past self, but more than anything, the album feels like a baptism. Williams emerges from the depths of her focused creation ready for a new life, where the possibilities are endless.

With “The Favourite” and “Poor Things,” Yorgos Lanthimos went from the Greek arthouse curiosity behind films like “Dogtooth” and “The Lobster” to a major Oscar player. His tart-tongued Queen Anne period piece “The Favourite” earned 10 Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress Olivia Colman. With “Poor Things,” he again solidified a Best Actress winner with Emma Stone as a brain-transplant patient turned feminist, with three crafts wins in tow. The writing was on the walls for future success when Lanthimos and his screenwriting collaborator Efthimis Filippou earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for “The Lobster” in 2016.

“The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and his nihilistic triptych “Kinds of Kindness” (which he shot as a diversion from the post-production rigors of “Poor Things”) were all set up at Searchlight; with “Bugonia,” he joins Focus Features for the first time. 

His latest film and tenth feature, “Bugonia” premieres Thursday night in competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos' stomping grounds for “The Favourite” and 2023 Golden Lion winner “Poor Things,” though press caught the first screenings on the Lido this morning. Lanthimos and his cast and crew (including cinematographer Robbie Ryan) took questions from the Venice press corps afterward.

 










A hostage thriller with a timely political bent, “Bugonia” is a remake of the 2003 Korean sci-fi film “Save the Green Planet!” “Kinds of Kindness” Cannes 2024 Best Actor winner Jesse Plemons plays a mentally disturbed vigilante who kidnaps Emma Stone‘s big pharma CEO, believing she is an alien sent to Earth to take over the human race. 

While early footage suggested Stone might factor as a supporting actor in “Bugonia,” she's indeed the co-lead of the film alongside Plemons (Aidan Delbis plays the cousin Plemons forces into his conspiracist scheme). “Bugonia” doesn't necessarily feel like an Oscar movie up front, though Focus' October release date and festival play this weekend at Telluride suggest awards hopes for the violent, darkly funny sci-fi allegory.

The script comes from Emmy-winning “Succession” and “The Menu” writer/director Will Tracy, rather than Lanthimos' Oscar-nominated writing collaborators Tony McNamara (“Poor Things,” “The Favourite”) or Filippou.

“With the exception of Will, we have all worked with Yorgos multiple times,” Stone said at the press conference, also noting that the “idea that we are alone” in the universe, given the movie's extraterrestrial narrative, is “pretty narcissistic to think.” She added, “It ends up feeling like … a really comforting and safe environment to explore and feel as free as possible. I know everybody says it's ‘like we're a family,' but it does really feel like that when you've made so many things together and you've sort of been in those trenches together.”

 










She also said the film, in which Plemons is a would-be foot soldier for the human resistance against corporate greed, is “reflective of this point in time in our world,” and a “really fascinating and moving, funny and fucked-up, and alive” story. 

Both Plemons and Stone revealed they did not watch Jang Joon-hwan's “Save the Green Planet!” before making “Bugonia,” which shot on 35mm and VistaVision cameras in England last summer. DP Robbie Ryan's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos after “The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and “Kinds of Kindness” should gain notices of awards crafts voters for its ambitious visuals despite the pressure-cooker, home-invasion chamber drama setup.

“Not much of the dystopia in this film is very fictional,” said Lanthimos, who recognized the film became even more time-sensitive during production and post-production with lone wolf assassins bent on taking down corporate bigwigs dominating news headlines. “A lot of it is very reflective of the real world. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a dystopic film, which, in my mind, is presenting an image of the future and what happened to civilization.”

“I don't know how much time we have with everything that's happening in the world, with technology, AI, wars, climate change, and the denial of all these things,” he added.

 










“Bugonia” might be too weird and too violent for the Academy, but with a roomy Best Actress field (no certain entrant stands out just yet), two-time winner Stone (“La La Land” as well) could break into the race. Calling her performance as CEO Michelle Fuller — which the actress literally shaved her head for — a supporting actress role would be blatant category fraud, as she's in most scenes of the movie going toe-to-toe with co-lead Plemons. And the physical rigors of her portrayal (the movie appears to show her getting a buzzcut live on camera) have already earned the sort of attention that makes her a Best Actress contender to watch for.

Plemons too, all gaunt and disheveled and mentally harried, makes the case for an overdue lead actor nomination after earning a supporting nod for “The Power of the Dog.” It's a busy Best Actor race, though, with George Clooney also debuting in Venice as a Hollywood actor at the end of his tether in Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.” In terms of Best Picture chances, the edgy and dark “Bugonia” doesn't feel so tailor-made for the top category as the high-concept crowd-pleaser “Poor Things” or the period lushness and spicy dialogue of “The Favourite.”

I'd keep a closer eye on the cinematography and craft of “Bugonia” in terms of an awards traction, though Tracy's pedigree from “Succession” and as an EP on the Emmy-nominated HBO movie “Mountainhead” gives him an awards season edge. Plus, the 2025 Academy loves an underdog-championing, eat-the-rich story, as we of course saw with the more accessible but still original indie “Anora.”

 










Focus Features will release “Bugonia” in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

Before releasing his great new album, Live Laugh Love, Earl Sweatshirt played it for fans at a Los Angeles listening party. The thing was, the rapper was not there, instead sending an imposter the way that the late MF Doom used to do. Earl Sweatshirt is now giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the whole imposter process, via his new video for “Crisco.”

The new video, from director, producer, and editor Jimmy Regular, begins with a simple message: “earl was not looking forward to performing at his album listening party. instead, he decided to cast someone to embody his overall essence on stage.” From there, we see that Sweatshirt, his mother, and Zack Fox auditioned four men to fill in for the rapper. The obvious candidate was Gary Murakami, who spent some time with Sweatshirt to see what living life as the Californian is really like. The visual ends with Murakami's stand-in performance for Sweatshirt at the party. Watch the “Crisco” video below.

“Crisco” is the second Live Laugh Love track to get a music video, following “Tourmaline.” The album follows 2022's Sick! and the Alchemist collaboration Voir Dire.

Imagine if Michael Haneke's “Funny Games” were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia.” 

Jesse Plemons stars as a galaxy-brained conspiracist beekeeper who's either severely mentally ill or the only prophet among us, hijacking his cousin (Aidan Delbis) into a scheme to kidnap a big pharma executive (Emma Stone) whom he believes to be a body-snatched alien sent to end the planet.

 










Lanthimos works from an on-the-nose-for-the-now feature screenplay by “Succession” and “The Menu” writer Will Tracy, diverting from the droll theater of cruelty present in scripts by Efthimis Filippou (“Kinds of Kindness”) or the florid repartee of Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”). “Bugonia” has all the streak of Tracy's kill-the-rich brand of satire, but with the Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker interrogating the potential performativity of such capitalist-fighting crusades.

That's because Lanthimos brings to this film his signature stamp of perverse detachment, though without the fish-eyed lenses this harrowing time around depravity's merry-go-round. Recall that the most unexpectedly mainstream-friendly film of his career, “Poor Things,” revealed a tender, even hopeful side to the “Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Dogtooth” director known for his clinical stance on humankind's worthiness; “Kinds of Kindness,” though, snapped us back into his grim worldview with a trio of nihilistic tales about mental manipulation.

“Bugonia” falls somewhere between that film, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” and “The Lobster” in terms of both its double-sided callousness toward and guarded optimism about our willingness or ability to reverse course. 

It's both a funny, fucked-up trifle — one that hurtles toward a hilariously unsubtle, “Burn After Reading”-esque note of we-learned-nothing existential futility — and an earnest message movie for our disintegrating present, a warning that we are probably too late to effect any real change on the world we so vaingloriously messed up. Accusations of Lanthimos veering toward the twee of late (or always) apply less to “Bugonia,” which has no shortage of entrails or a torture scene set to, of all songs, Green Day's “Nick Shea.” 

 










Lanthimos' tenth feature would have been more consistently engaging, a real home run, as a 90-minute feature as opposed to two hours that encroach on a tedious overplaying of their themes. But would it then seem important enough? “Bugonia” is either profound or profoundly silly. It's also both.

This time, Lanthimos takes a stab at a remake, faithfully re-mounting, save for a few significant changes, Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 Korean sci-fi movie “Save the Green Planet!” Ultimately, this film's absurd existentialist deadpan aligns Lanthimos' work here closer to Ruben Östlund than ever — himself a filmmaker likely drawing from Lanthimos these days — to mine the comedy of repetitious futility to disorienting effect. Social burnout Teddy lives in the kind of paranoiac's hovel where the windows are papered over by tinfoil, and where you can all but feel the bugs crawling over you, while not working as a factory lackey for biomedical company Auxolith in middle-of-depressing-nowhere U.S.A. He maintains multiple beehives in his backyard, obsessing over the colony collapse disorder that threatens not just his bees, but all of them everywhere. Is his property the control room of a hoped-for utopia, or an unkempt truther's hell-hole bunker? You decide.

At the top of the Auxolith's pyramid is decorated CEO Michelle Fuller. She keeps a picture with Michelle Obama in her office, but bristles at the language of DEI training while knowing well enough to put on a placid, phony smile and encourage her employees to, sure, head home by 5:30 p.m. — one of many requisite gestures of pity toward her underlings that, dear God no, should not be understood by them as compulsory. One of those “we care about our employees” little treats of false gratitude that always comes with an asterisk, a footnote, and then that other footnote. 

 










Anyone who's been a cog in the corporate world can resonate with the hollow ring of Michelle's posturing, as if a gun was put to her head by a committee demanding she do better. In the boardroom, she's all for socially conscious messaging around her company's questionable medical advancements, but off the clock, when she's not popping mystery pills and singing to Chappell Roan in her shiny SUV, she has no trouble sleeping at night despite her company having destroyed lives with a vanguard opioid-withdrawal medication that backfired.

Teddy is one such casualty of Auxolith's pioneering biotechnology, with his mother (Alicia Silverstone) now in a coma bed with tubes attached after a drug trial gone wrong. So it makes sense that the chosen target of his master plan is Michelle herself. Jacked up on steroids, Teddy and his dutiful, clearly exploited cousin Don stage a home invasion, drugging and kidnapping Michelle to drag her back to Teddy's disheveled outpost. Lanthimos and cinematographer Robbie Ryan stage and shoot said home invasion like a Jacques Tati sequence — that is to say, from an amused, ironic distance that watches humans squirm and scramble without intervention. Though, of course, Lanthimos not intervening or getting too close to the action is its own sort of intervention, doing by not doing.

 










But “Bugonia” will eventually rub your face much closer into viscera and shrapnel and other bodily horrors. Emma Stone actually shaved her head for the movie, appearing to do so on camera with commendable, unfazed dedication to the task, as Teddy and Don hold Michelle hostage, and she starts to play along with the idea that, yeah, sure, she might be an extraterrestrial sent to our Earth to wreak havoc. Anything to get her out of those damned chains, and convince Teddy to loosen his tightening grasp, hell-bent on Michelle withdrawing her supposed species from Earth before the next lunar eclipse. Is Teddy insane, or actually onto something? The film is clever in how it constantly shifts our allegiances, and its own.

“Bugonia” is fascinating in contrast to a film like “Kinds of Kindness,” which Lanthimos shot almost as a lark, a slice of escapism from the large-scale demands of “Poor Things,” with a minimalist crew and set. His latest film is even more scaled-down — until it isn't — than “Kinds of Kindness,” serving almost as a stagelike chamber drama wrought on Super 35 and VistaVision. The canvas may be small, but Lanthimos colors inside the lines with grandeur, treating the deceptively walled-up material with the application of a bigger-budget studio project.

 










Stone is predictably great, but her Michelle Fuller is closer to her spiraling flip-anthropist in TV's “The Curse” than the can't-take-her-down feminist Bella Baxter of “Poor Things.” Lanthimos' skepticism of humankind's capacity to evolve is a welcome comfort, as always, in our politically miserable era. Some hot-button jokes land better than others, though “Bugonia” is always questioning the ideology on either side. Teddy confesses to having tried alt-right, “alt-lite,” Marxism, you name it, with no costume quite fitting his mentally collapsing outlook. There's a great line in which Teddy calls college education a “credentialist scam for laundering privilege,” and it's spoken so convincingly that it makes you wonder, well, isn't it?

A superb and unvarnished Plemons, who played a cherub-faced corporate drone in one of three roles in “Kinds of Kindness,” slims down and goes gaunter and more manic, physically and emotionally, than ever to play a borderline-psychopathic conspiracy head with sadistic tendencies. And don't count out Stavros Halkias in a Paul Walter Hauser-type performance as Teddy's childhood babysitter who's now the town cop. When cops show up at the door for a wellness check at an ongoing, in-the-basement hostage situation at any house in the movies, well, we know how that story ends.

 










The timely urgency of “Bugonia” could be identified from outer space unless you've been living under a celestial object these days, as rogue vigilantes taking down corporate bigwigs have, in a post-2020 world, turned into the folk heroes dominating headlines and activating internet warriors. That's not to say “Bugonia” carries an empowering message: If anything, it's distrusting in humanity's ability to rise above our own failures, arguing that while it's not too late to turn things around, we probably won't anyway.

“Bugonia” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Focus Features will release the film in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

EXCLUSIVE: Kristen Bell and Daniela Melchior are set to join David Harbour in the cast of Violent Night 2 for Universal Pictures and 87North. Tommy Wirkola will direct from a screenplay by Pat Casey and Josh Miller.


	Universal Pictures will release Violent Night 2 on Wednesday, December 4, 2026.


	While exact plot details are under wraps, Harbour's ass-kicking Santa Clause is back. And he's not happy.


	The 2022 bare-knuckle holiday sensation Violent Night followed an embittered Santa, armed with lethal combat skills, who takes out a team of ruthless mercenaries to rescue a girl and her family. Now, it's time for not-so-jolly Saint Nick to suit up again.

	Following breakout roles in The Suicide Squad and Fast X, Melchior most recently co-starred in the Amazon MGM Studios reimagining of Road House opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. Her upcoming slate includes Balls Up, a comedy directed by Academy Award winner Peter Farrelly (Green Book) in which she stars alongside Mark Wahlberg. She has also been cast in Sony Pictures' reboot of Anaconda, joining an ensemble that includes Jack Black and Paul Rudd.


	Bell most recently starred in the Netflix comedy series Nobody Wants This alongside Adam Brody, in which she also serves as an executive producer; a Season 2 is in the works. Recent acting credits include leading roles in the Amazon Prime comedy film The People We Hate at the Wedding, alongside Allison Janney and Ben Platt, and Netflix's parody comedy The Woman in the House.

	











	She also starred in the NBC series The Good Place, opposite Ted Danson, the animated Amazon children's series Do, Re, & Mi, and STX Films' couponing adventure Queenpins. In 2019, Bell reprised her role as Anna in Frozen 2, which has earned over $1.45 billion at the global box office, surpassing the $1.2 billion Frozen earned. She also served as an executive producer in the revival of the Los Angeles production of Reefer Madness The Musical.


	Bell is represented by CAA. Melchior is represented by Gersh, Brave Artists Management and Felker Toczek Suddleson.

TIFF and NYFF are just around the corner, but we're finally starting to see trailers for some of the films that already made waves at festivals earlier this year. The latest offering is Kleber Mendonça Filho's The Secret Agent, which Neon snagged the rights to after it received widespread acclaim at Cannes this spring. Filho and Wagner Moura left the Croisette with the Best Director and Best Actor awards respectively, so this is definitely one to look out for.

The film's trailer portrays an energetic but chaotic vision of 1977 Brazil. “Marcelo (Moura), a technology expert in his early 40s, is on the run,” the film's logline reads. “He arrives in Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes that the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.” Marcelo may also not be quite as much of a pacifist as he likes to envision himself. “I am not a violent person,” he says at the end of the clip. “But this man… I'd kill him with a hammer.” 



The Secret Agent is a Portuguese-language film, marking a return to Moura's native language after starring in English-language productions like Civil War and Dope Thief. “It's incredibly liberating to act in Portuguese,” the actor told Variety in May. “When I work in English or Spanish, the words don't come out of my mouth filled with memories the way they do in Portuguese. For me, it's pivotal to keep connected to Brazilian cinema.” 

Filho, who previously competed at Cannes with 2016's Aquarius and 2019's Bacurau, also expressed a lot of pride in the film and its portrayal of his country. “The film takes place in a pre-globalized Brazil,” he said. “Globalization standardized worldwide aesthetics, which made it even more beautiful to work on recreating 70s Recife. People went to their families to look for pictures of their parents, to understand how they dressed, how their houses looked… I believe this brings a great level of authenticity. As I've said, I'm very happy with the film.”

The Secret Agent opens November 26 in select theaters.

	Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings and Amy Adams have officially been set to join Ryan Gosling in Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Starfighter. Shawn Levy is directing the pic, which was penned by Jonathan Tropper.


	“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said Thursday, when the casting news was revealed on Starwars.com, along with the news that production has begun in the UK. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The post also included a first look at the set, with Gosling and Gray leaning and sitting, respectively, on what looks to be a landspeeder. See it above.

	











	“From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally,” Levy continued. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”


	The film is set to bow on May 28, 2027. Levy produces with Kennedy. Executive producers are Gosling, Dan Levine, Mary McLaglen and Josh McLaglen. 


Details of Starfighter were unveiled in April at the Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo. The film is set five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the Skywalker saga and currently stands as the final feature chronologically on the Star Wars timeline.

	











	When Deadline broke the news of Smith's casting, sources said he would be playing the villain role.

Peacock will become available in Amazon Channels, as the NBCUniversal streaming service pursues more bundles and channel deals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, will become available as an add-on for Prime Video customers as part of a wide-ranging deal between Amazon and Comcast.


	The agreement will see Peacock Premium Plus (that's the ad-free tier) become available via Prime Video's channels offering for $16.99 per month or $169.99 per year. Prime Video Channels has become a major aggregator of streaming services, with HBO Max, Paramount+, Starz and Apple TV+ among the services offered, underscoring its effectiveness in driving subscriptions and Amazon's one-stop billing capabilities.

	Peacock has largely eschewed from participating in bundles and channels programs up to this point, but a source familiar with the talks says that the company is likely to become more aggressive in pursuing those sorts of arrangements moving forward, using the Amazon deal as a template.


	While Peacock has been available as part of bundles within the Comcast Xfinity environment, and in a deal with Charter Spectrum, Prime Video Channels is the first tech platform to offer the service as an add-on. Google's YouTube and Roku also have robust channels offerings, while Disney and HBO Max have been opportunistically seeking bundle arrangements.


	The Amazon deal is likely the first of a number of deals that will expand the availability of Peacock, which is still smaller than many of its subscription streaming competitors with about 41 million subscribers. Peacock has shifted much of its focus to live sports, and will add the NBA this fall.


	The deal also improves Prime Video's sports proposition, with the platform also recently adding Fox One to its channels offering. With both Peacock and Fox One, Prime Video now provides access to four of the five national NFL packages (ESPN is still the lone holdout for now).

	











	The Amazon-Comcast deal also includes extensions on distribution deals covering a number of other areas, ensuring Peacock's continued availability on Fire TV devices, Prime Video availability on Xfinity X1 devices, and allowing users to continue to buy and rent films from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on Prime Video.


	“This multi-faceted set of agreements is a testament to our close collaboration with Amazon, delivering significant value across our businesses and expanding exposure of our world-class content,” said Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation. “Millions of Amazon customers can continue to enjoy NBCUniversal's popular shows, films, and live events on Peacock via Fire TV or through Prime Video Subscriptions, or buying or renting on Prime Video, while also accessing Amazon's premier entertainment on Xfinity X1 — ensuring they can watch what they love, wherever and however they choose.”


	“At Amazon, we are always working to make customers' lives better every day and these new agreements with Comcast NBCU are fantastic for millions of customers, who are looking for the fastest and easiest way to find all their entertainment and sports in one place,” added Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “Adding Peacock to our growing list of subscriptions – while renewing our long-standing agreements for Fire TV, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and Xfinity X1 – deepens an incredible working relationship with Comcast/NBCU, and we look forward to a future of mutual distribution that benefits our shared customers.”

EXCLUSIVE: It's a CBS homecoming for Roger Howarth: the longtime soap actor is joining The Young and the Restless for a major story arc this fall.


	Sadly, details about his character and storyline are being kept under wraps. Deadline has learned the Emmy-winning actor will begin taping in mid-September for his on-screen debut later this year.


	From 2001 to 2010, Howarth played Paul Ryan on CBS' old sudser As the World Turns. He went on to play Todd Manning on One Life to Live from 1993 to 2013, before joining General Hospital in 2012 to take over as Dr. Austin Gatlin-Holt.


	Howarth came and went from the ABC soap until his character was fatally shot in a 2023 episode. He let fans know via Instagram at the time that his run on GH had officially ended.

	“Three things that I know for sure,” wrote Howarth. “1, Daytime fans are lovely and amazing and supportive and dedicated and I am deeply grateful to each sparkly one of them. 2, I enjoyed my time at general hospital and wish the cast and crew the best and continued success. It was a pleasure working with you all. 3, Life is amazing. We just don't ever know what's gonna happen. How great! Turn toward the light. Always. Huge thank you to you all.”


	Howarth won a Daytime Emmy for his work on One Life to Live in 1994.

Ivy and Theo (Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch), chef and architect, meet on a whim in the Michelin-grade kitchen where Ivy works, after Theo bursts in unannounced to blow off steam mid-meal. Disappointed and distressed that their superiors can't see their minor geniuses—dehydrated blueberries and cascading garden balconies, respectively—they bond over a distrust of the old guard and an immediate hope in one another, one that blooms with the swift surreality of a time-lapsed flower reaching maturation in a minute flat. Before they leave the kitchen, they're in love. But unbeknownst to them, the war of The Roses has begun.

Calling it a meet-cute wouldn't be accurate. They don't do “cute.” When it comes to Ivy and Theo, unapologetic audacity is the only road traveled, which makes for a beginning as explosive as the ending. “But we haven't even had sex yet,” Ivy says suggestively, the two having only just exchanged names. “Well, that's only minutes away,” returns Theo. The seemingly pre-programmed words tumble out of their mouths as if they were suddenly out of control, on existential autopilot, as surprised by what they're saying as we are.

Soon after they meet, they leave the U.K. for California, where they take root and raise a couple kids. In the first phase of their life together, Theo rises through the ranks of the architecture world and Ivy shapes the children, as well as the family's every meal, much to her pleasure. Opinionated, irreverent, and secure, even in the face of each other, the Roses possess an ebullience and resilience that slowly erodes (albeit, in hilarious fashion) under the rushing river of marriage management and child-rearing that comes to dominate their busying lives.

The cultural significance of Warren Adler's The War Of The Roses bookended the 1980s with the release of his novel in '81 and the Danny DeVito-directed film in '89. In 2025, the book and movie might as well be historical artifacts, but the ghost of the story has stuck around. The tale of two embittered lovers going straight for the jugular carries across generations—it's unfortunately supremely relatable. Modernized remake The Roses sits under the glass ceiling of the rom-com genre and walks on well-tread narrative territory. But, under Jay Roach's measured direction, that's not a problem. He gives the timeless story an original edge, never allowing a dull frame to slow the sharp film. 

One can't imagine Ivy and Theo together after the opening scene, a disastrous marriage counseling session that ends with the therapist swearing them off in the name of incurable resentment, self-righteousness, and defensiveness as the crumbling couple gangs up on the innocent clinician in a fit of delirious enablement. (In the therapist's defense, the nicest thing either of them had to say about each other was, “He has arms.”) A dark, organ-reeling jazz jam propels the sequence, a tonal harbinger of the passion and ferocity to come and a bellwether for the film's terrific taste in music, both in Severance composer Theodore Shapiro's score and the inspired indie-folk soundtrack.

However, it's also almost impossible to imagine the pair apart after the first hour of inimitable chemistry and pitch-black comedy charm. Things finally go awry when Theo's attempt at a masterpiece—a maritime museum in the shape of a large sailing vessel—opens on the same night an unparalleled storm hits the bay. But the storm also gives way to a new opportunity for Ivy. In the second act, the couple's dynamic flips, and she's the globetrotting careerist to Theo's stay-at-home dad.  Eventually, they each get the opportunity to fund the others' dreams, and they do. But it's still not enough. The tides turn practically overnight, and the sudden desperation for divorce begets an avalanche of life-ruining sabotage.

Supporting them are Kate McKinnon and Andy Samberg (American friends, met at a gun range) in career-best bit parts: A bizarro, kinky-sad, nothing-to-lose, overfamiliar type for the former—an equal blend of Sheila Sovage, Debette Goldry, and Kathryn Hahn in Step Brothers—and an obliviously overconfident dude-bro for the latter. But, instead of an unhinged couple in their 20s or 30s, they've adapted their mode to the disillusionment of 40-somethings sunk up to the eyes in suburban suppression. Allison Janney takes a terse turn as an unbearable divorce lawyer, while Ncuti Gatwa and Sunita Mani stand out among the rest of the stacked cast.

Roach—the wunderkind studio comedy director (the Austin Powers trilogy, Meet The Parents and Fockers) turned historical dramatist (Trumbo, Bombshell)—hasn't delivered much of note in the last nine years. But he's back with a bang in The Roses. There's a rejuvenated spirit to his pace and craft that stems from a now-veteran wisdom and the fresh collaboration with screenwriter Tony McNamara, who's had enormous success in film, alongside Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite, Poor Things, Cruella), and TV (The Great), since 2018.

Having written a much looser and sharper-tongued Colman character in The Favourite—which is saying a lot, considering Ivy names her dainty seafood shack “We've Got Crabs!”—McNamara precisely pens her role, while Colman winks, flirts, punches, swings, and sings right in her comfort zone. To make the rich richer, it turns out Cumberbatch is McNamara's male Colman. The wit and restraint behind his interpretation of the driven-husband-turned-superdad is grounded in this same script-star chemistry. As a result, the leads are magnets, whether they're surgically picking each other apart with the cruelty of Caligula or steaming up a seductive romance. Their remarkable rapport makes The Roses essential viewing, a must-watch rom-com.

T
he first ICE detention center inaugurated in the second Trump era is a squat, soot-colored building surrounded by parking lots, warehouses, and petrochemical holding tanks on a deserted stretch of industrial waterfront in Newark, New Jersey. 


	In May, this patch of asphalt and chainlink was the site of a dramatic showdown between nearly two dozen federal law enforcement officers and four Democratic officials. That encounter has culminated in one of the most shockingly brazen political prosecutions in recent history — a case that, depending on its outcome, could augur a new political reality for anyone willing to challenge the president's regime.


	Delaney Hall is operated by GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison contractor whose for-profit facilities have been dogged by allegations of wrongful death, sexual abuse, and exposing inmates to toxic chemicals. Its corporate PAC was also the first to max out donations to Donald Trump's 2024 reelection campaign. 

	











	Almost as soon as Trump re-took office, GEO Group inked a 15-year, $1 billion contract to warehouse immigrants at Delaney Hall. Before the mothballed facility reopened, inspectors flagged at least two dozen fire code, plumbing, and electricity issues, according to the city's lawyers, who sued in an unsuccessful effort to prevent GEO from resuming operations there.


	Today, Delaney Hall holds 548 individuals — 89 percent of whom have no criminal record — rounded up in the Trump administration's immigration dragnet. 

	











	On May 9, a few days after GEO Group began housing detainees at the Newark detention center, three members of Congress representing New Jersey — Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, in whose district the facility sits — arrived at Delaney Hall to perform an oversight visit. 


	Weeks earlier, the same delegation checked in on a similar facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. (Such inspections are a routine part of Congress' function.) But, this time, their tour was being slow-walked. The members of Congress had already been waiting for an hour and half when Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrived. Baraka was standing inside the fenced area — a guard let him in — when nearly two dozen officers arrived and confronted him. They told Baraka he was trespassing, and threatened to arrest him.

	Video of the incident shows 80-year-old Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman trying to reason with them. “You are here on private property— ” she is saying, as an officer interrupts her. “Ma'am, this is the last warning,” he tells her. 


	“It's ‘Congresswoman,'” McIver replies sharply. “Show some respect!”  


	Baraka agreed to leave, and he was outside the facility a few minutes later when an officer with the Department of Homeland Security announced he would be arresting the Newark mayor anyway, “per the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.” (This is according to body camera footage described in court documents filed as part of an ongoing criminal case over the incident.)


	The crowd of protesters already gathered outside the facility was outraged. “Circle the mayor!” one yelled, as officers — some in windbreakers, others in riot gear — fought their way toward Baraka. Later, as Baraka was violently forced into a pair of handcuffs, McIver could be seen pushing through the crowd after him. The entire scene looked more like a mosh pit than anything else, with everyone — demonstrators, journalists, elected officials and federal officers — shoving and struggling against each other.

	A judge would later excoriate the Justice Department for its “hasty” decision to arrest Baraka, “a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences” — and a choice that, the judge added, “suggests a worrying misstep by your office.” 


	The charges against the mayor were dropped a little more than a week later. But they were replaced by new ones: this time against McIver, who was indicted for  “assaulting, impeding, and interfering” with a federal officer — a trio of charges that, together, carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison.

	











	“The days of woke are over,” President Trump said, speaking about the charges against McIver. “That woman — I have no idea who she is — she was out of control. She was shoving federal agents… The days of that crap are over in this country.”


	Trump has been loudly declaring his desire and intention to “lock up” his political enemies since his first campaign for office, but that bluster has taken a more sinister turn since the president returned to office in January, emboldened and enabled by a stable of sycophantic appointees eager to do his bidding. In the last few weeks alone, the Justice Department has announced investigations of Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and New York Attorney General Letitia James, each of whom oversaw high-profile investigations of Trump after his first term. The FBI recently searched the home of former Trump adviser-turned-critic John Bolton. The DOJ has reportedly opened criminal investigations into John Brennan and James Comey, the CIA director and FBI director who both served in Trump's first administration, and, in what may be a prelude of things still to come, Trump's director of national intelligence has accused Barack Obama and his officials of a “years-long coup” against the current president. 


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said last month, referring to Obama and members of his administration. 


	Unlike with California Sen. Alex Padilla (handcuffed and escorted out of a press conference in Los Angeles), or New York City Comptroller Brad Lander (detained at immigration court, before the charges against him were dropped), or some of the other Democrats Trump has threatened or his administration is investigating, the Trump administration appears determined to prosecute McIver to the fullest extent of the law.


	Her case will be an important test of what, if any, guardrails remain to prevent the Trump administration from siccing a pack of Justice Department lawyers on anyone with the temerity to question his administration's authority.


	Sitting in her office in June, wearing a pair of fluffy pink slippers and snacking on a pack of peanut M&Ms after a long day on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, McIver doesn't much resemble the menace U.S. attorney Alina Habba — Trump's former personal lawyer, and the acting, but disputed, United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey — has portrayed in her indictment.

	











	McIver, who favors bright suits and colorful glasses, is gregarious and warm, fussing over anyone who enters her orbit — staffer, colleague, stranger — like they're her own child. The quality of her energy can make McIver seem older than she is. At 38, she is among the youngest sitting members of Congress, and, having arrived here in Washington, D.C., less than a year ago, she is also among its greenest. 


	And yet, with the full force of a weaponized Department of Justice bearing down on her, she  remains remarkably composed.


	“I really look forward to court,” she tells me with a shrug. “To lay out all of the facts, to go through everything that happened and to make sure that the truth is told.” 


	“We know why we were there,” she adds. “To do our jobs.”


	The first thing you need to know about LaMonica McIver is that, despite her disarming demeanor, she is not afraid of a fight. Growing up in the heart of Newark's Central Ward, she got into plenty of them. 


	“I was always getting suspended for fighting,” she says. “My mom, at some point, was like, ‘I'm gonna stop taking you back to school because all you gonna do is get suspended again. I don't need to keep running back here.'”


	It was her fifth grade teacher — future Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — who helped her find an outlet for her energy, inviting her down to his campaign headquarters to volunteer. Baraka was the cool teacher — the one who showed up in Timberland boots, whose voice you can hear on the interstitial tracks on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the one who challenged Newark's longtime mayor, Sharpe James, running on the slogan “Shorty for Mayor,” when he was just 24 years old.


	“She was always feisty, no nonsense,” Baraka says of his former student. “As we like to say: She didn't take no tea for the fever. But, at the end of the day, she grew up in a rough community, rough neighborhood, and always had to defend herself — or defend other people.”


	In those days, Baraka's campaign headquarters were in a repurposed strip mall doctor's office, flanked by a Chinese restaurant, a fish market, and a nail salon. “I'll never forget — the place was so raggedy that it still had the hospital bed in one of the rooms. I remember we used to go back there and take a nap,” McIver says, laughing. Her first day was volunteering at the African American Day parade, where Lauryn Hill was riding with the candidate on the truck, and all the kids from McIver's school were marching around it in T-shirts that said “Take It Personal” — the campaign slogan that year. McIver was hooked.

	











	She started canvassing the neighborhood for the campaign, handing out literature in her spare time. At first she says that she just liked telling people what to do — ”Go out and vote!” — but eventually she was possessed by a larger sense of civic purpose. “Learning your community, learning what it means to be ‘of service,' learning what it means to care about people — to learn that at 10? To have someone instill that in you? And it wasn't just Ras Baraka,” she says. “It was all the people around him, who were from the city, involved in public service.”


	Baraka ended up losing that race in 1998. But the loss didn't deter McIver — neither did the many, many losses that followed. Through middle school and high school, she returned every four years when he launched a new bid for office, and helped out with the clothing drives, food drives, voter registration drives they mounted in the political off-season. 


	By the time Baraka won a seat on the city council, in 2010, McIver was out of college. She had spent the last years of her college career raising her three younger siblings — her brother, in high school, and two sisters, both in elementary school — after her mother entered rehab for drug addiction. 


	During the 19 months her mom spent in treatment, McIver commuted between college and home, packing her siblings lunches and helping them with their homework between her own classes. “It wasn't as hard an adjustment as you might think,” McIver's sister, LaShay McIver, tells me. “She was playing a parent figure in our lives for a very long time — probably since her early teens… Making sure our grades are good, making sure we're behaving in school. When she would get her paycheck, she would buy me clothes.”


	After she graduated, McIver worked in school districts all around the state of New Jersey, before she felt the call to run for office herself in 2018. The Newark city council skewed older and male, and she decided there ought to be someone there advocating for the interests of young parents like herself — by this time, she had her own two-year-old daughter — so she decided to mount a campaign.


	She ran against nine men, and won, becoming the youngest woman in city history to sit on the council. Two years later, in 2020, she was elected council president — right as the pandemic was poised to bear down on Newark. “I'll never forget,” she says. “We were going inside our larger senior buildings, having to get assistance to pull dead bodies out, because the hospitals were taxed, the funeral homes couldn't take another person. We had to get our police department to rent ice trucks inside of our city parking lot, just to get bodies out of the buildings.” 

	











	Those horrific months were followed by protests ignited in the wake of George Floyd's murder, when, McIver says, “We had people showing up from all over the world trying to burn down downtown.”


	Things had barely returned to normal in Newark, when she set her sights on a higher office. It was 2024, and Congressman Donald Payne Jr. — who, with his father before him, had represented this district most of McIver's life —  suddenly died of a heart attack. 


	McIver made it through the special election gauntlet, arriving in Congress in September of 2024, to little fanfare and no orientation — just a massive backlog of constituent services cases to deal with. By then, her district had been without a congressional representative for five months. She was only in D.C. for a week before the session adjourned, and she had to head back to New Jersey to campaign in the general election — her fourth race in as many months.


	She won, but returned to Congress in November with a new reality waiting for her, as a soon-to-be member of the minority party, under a dangerously emboldened Trump administration. “It's been unreal,” she says, looking back. “I did not come here for this.”


	“All my life, I've been wanting to serve in public service, to work for people, to deliver,” McIver tells me over lunch at The Yard, a burger joint in downtown Newark's Military Park. Everyone seems to know her here. When we walked in, she was met with applause and pledges to support her legal fund. Her profile, already outsized after representing this area first in City Council and now in Congress, has only continued to grow since she became a target of the Trump administration. “I just feel like, in this moment, there is nothing to deliver. We have a party in control that is not interested in delivering help — at least not for people that I represent.”


	Roughly one-third of McIver's constituents are immigrants, and from the moment Trump took office, the community has been in the crosshairs of the federal government. Two days after Trump's inauguration, ICE raided The Net, a Portuguese neighborhood in downtown Newark. 


	“They were out on the street in this little quaint neighborhood with big guns, Army vests, everything — and they scared the crap out of these residents,” McIver says. “From that day on, it's been downhill, in most of my communities in the 10th [congressional district].”

	











	Weeks before she and her colleagues went to Delaney Hall to perform the infamous oversight visit, McIver and her colleague, Rep. Rob Menendez, met with ICE officials at their office in Newark to discuss the fallout from those raids and, at the very least, try to open a line of communication.


	“We were like, ‘Look, the people of the East [ward] are scared to death. Businesses are not booming. This is an area where there are usually droves of people walking, shopping, eating in restaurants. Since ICE came down, though, people are scared — not even because they are here undocumented, just because they're like I don't want to be approached,” she says. “We went to these folks' office to meet with them, saying, ‘Hey, can we try to establish a better relationship? …Let's just work together. We want a safe border too — a protected one. We just don't want you harassing communities. So, what can we do?'”


	The meeting went smoothly, which is why she was caught so off guard by the disturbingly disproportionate response she and her colleagues were met with a few weeks later at Delaney Hall. 


	“They say this whole thing is about ‘criminals,' but it's not about criminals — it's about being cruel and attacking anybody who is here that is, basically, not white, to be honest with you,” McIver says. “I just think people didn't sign up for this, they're like, ‘Hey, when you get criminals, get the criminals. But not my neighbor. Not the people that cook our food, not the person trying to get their green card or going through citizenship, who is 60 years old, or people who were given protections to be here and now you tell them, Screw you, you're gone.'… It's just heartbreaking. To see families being ripped apart, to see kids with cancer being deported, to see people in college who are here — being innovators, engineers and teachers — to see [people say to] them, ‘Oh, your student visa is gone.' No explanation, no due process.”


	It's just all so senselessly punitive, McIver tells me. And a similar sentiment might be expressed about her own legal predicament — the breathtakingly political prosecution of a sitting member of Congress, one with virtually no precedent in recent history. How that case will ultimately resolve remains an open question.


	In June, McIver pleaded not guilty to all three charges against her, and, just last week, her lawyers submitted a new motion to dismiss the charges, drawing comparisons between the conduct she is alleged to have committed against federal officers while exercising her statutory and constitutional oversight responsibilities, and the conduct demonstrated by some 160 rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 — “throwing explosives, beating federal officers with baseball bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray” — all of whom recently had their charges under the same statute dismissed by the Justice Department.

	McIver, for her part, is spending as little time as possible thinking about the case. She's too busy with work. “I'm angry that the administration is choosing to waste taxpayers dollars and energy, to charge me for going there — for doing my job,” she says. “But at the same time, I'm not mad about representing the people that I represent here in New Jersey, or for going to check on their family members at Delaney Hall because that's what they sent me to Congress to do.


	“I can't be scared about doing that.”

Fall festivals supply the nutrients for a rich diet of films for the next six months, all the way until Oscar night. Venice launched Wednesday with Francis Coppola paying tribute to his friend Werner Herzog. On Thursday, Telluride revealed its lineup, which plays over the Labor Day weekend. (And, yes, the German maverick will fly to Telluride, as always.)

He's among the Telluride regulars who return for the summer-camp vibe in the mountains of Colorado. Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy usually throw a party. So does Muppet scion Lisa Henson. Oprah Winfrey is coming this year, even without a film, as are filmmakers Rian Johnson and Jason Reitman. (Herzog does have a film: documentary “Ghost Elephants,” shot in Namibia and Angola.)

“Our community is a real community,” said festival director Julie Huntsinger in a phone interview with IndieWire. “And I want everybody to hang out together and have fun and watch.”

This year, Huntsinger wants to avoid the scheduling snafus that led so many loyal badge holders ($780 each) standing in line for hours without seeing the big films. Distributors like to see how movies play for Telluride's cross-section of the national arthouse audience, passing word of mouth from line to line.

 










One clue that something special was happening last year with Sean Baker's Palme D'Or-winner “Anora” was the huge number of turnaways when the film was booked in small venues (patron passes, which cost $4,900, get in first). “Anora” eventually won five Oscars, including Best Picture. “Nobody saw that coming, I promise you, to the extent that it was popular,” said Huntsinger. “It's a crapshoot, what people will go crazy for.”

Huntsinger and her programmers cherry-pick titles from Sundance, Berlin, and especially Cannes. And well before Telluride co-founder Tom Luddy's death in 2023, Huntsinger has been flying solo and booking a strong lineup of highbrow awards contenders, classics, and idiosyncratic discoveries.

“We have exactly what we wanted,” she said. “Everything that plays in Cannes is fair game. We'll contact people and say, ‘Oh, we'd very much like to show it.' And I don't think we've ever been turned down.”

When it comes to new titles, though, the competition is fierce, even if Huntsinger pretends that Telluride doesn't truck in “world premieres,” and landing the celebrities who go with them. That requires distributors like Netflix to pony up for a private jet to fly George Clooney, Laura Dern, and Adam Sandler from Venice to Telluride for Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” a profile of an aging actor looking at himself in the mirror.

 










Also making the trek from Venice are Yorgos Lanthimos and his regulars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons, returning to the festival for Focus Features' “Bugonia.” “It's [Lanthimos'] usual, ‘Oh, my God. What was he thinking?,'” said Huntsinger. “This time, he has kicked the living shit out of Emma Stone. What more will he ask her to do? But it's a fantastic ride. Jesse Plemons will be the talk of everything.”

On the other hand, Kathryn Bigelow's Netflix film “A House of Dynamite” will not travel from Venice to Telluride. And so far, Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” starring Oscar Isaac as the scientist and Jacob Elordi as the monster, has not been announced. But there's always a “secret screening” or two as the festival runs its course.

Some titles on Telluride's top-secret lineup circulate in advance — inevitable as other festivals reveal their premieres and publicists organize their schedules. Prominent showings include Netflix's “Ballad of a Small Player” (Edward Berger's return after “Conclave”) starring Colin Farrell as a sad-sack gambler, and Chloé Zhao's adaptation of the bestselling tearjerker “Hamnet” (Focus), starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William and Agnes Shakespeare.

“Ballad of a Small Player” proves Berger's virtuosity, said Huntsinger. “It is true that Edward can direct anything, his versatility is so underrated. This is unusual and dreamy and almost like a bit of a Wong Kar-Wai feel. But he never feels derivative or copycat.”

 










“Hamnet” represents something of a homecoming: It was born out of a walk in the woods at Telluride 2022 with Zhao and Mescal when he was there for “Aftersun.” 

“The film is a meditation on loss from a feminine perspective,” said Huntsinger. “It shifts the story around Shakespeare to focus on his wife, but it doesn't diminish anybody in the process. Chloé's working with Paul and Jesse. They're like a beautiful instrument, all three of them working together.”

Other first-time showings include “Crazy Heart” director Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” (20th Century Studios). “It delivers,” said Huntsinger. “It's one of those movies that, on paper, sounds good, although musical performances can be iffy. But [Timothee] Chalamet knocked it out of the park with ‘A Complete Unknown.' Jeremy Allen White does the same, it's all his voice. It's not a singing-performance heavy film with the giant concert scenes. This is [Scott Cooper's] best movie.”

Huntsinger usually offers a few unexpected gems, like last year's “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics), which launched major new auteur Embeth Davidtz. This year's surprises include “Tuner,” the feature-directing debut of “Navalny” Oscar-winner Daniel Roher, starring Dustin Hoffman. (Its sound designer is “The Zone of Interest” Oscar-winner Johnnie Burn.) Huntsinger also made room for a last-minute submission from Ondi Timoner with her short film about losing a home to the Altadena fires, “All the Walls Came Down.”

 










Telluride launches Oscar conversations and reminds everyone of Cannes gems in the awards hunt. These include three prize-winners from Neon: “It Was Just an Accident” (director Jafar Panahi will accept a special tribute), “The Secret Agent,” starring Best Actor Cannes winner Wagner Moura, and Norwegian Oscar entry “Sentimental Value,” starring Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Rensve.

Skarsgård's son Alexander stars in risque entry, “Pillion” (A24), which debuted in Un Certain Regard. MUBI brings two films starring Josh O'Connor with Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound” and Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind.” Also showing is Harris Dickinson's directorial debut “Urchin” (1-2 Special), starring Un Certain Regard actor-winner Frank Dillane. Some missing titles, like Neon's “Sirat,” will turn up on the schedules at Toronto and NYFF.

Not screening at Telluride, or any of the fall festivals, is MUBI's $24-million Cannes pickup “Die, My Love” from Lynne Ramsay, which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. It earned mixed reviews at Cannes and might continue to do so. MUBI plans a wide release on November 7.

Also not in the festival lineups is Paul Thomas Anderson's Leonardo DiCaprio-starring “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros., September 26). Anderson doesn't like attending festivals.

 










Dickinson and Mescal will attend Telluride even though they're shooting one of Sam Mendes' Beatles movies (Dickinson is Paul McCartney; Mescal is John Lennon). The actual McCartney is on tour, so he will not be there to support Morgan Neville's Wings documentary “Man on the Run” (Amazon/MGM). Related: McCartney's former roommate, swinging '60s music producer Peter Asher, is the subject of Telluride documentary “Everywhere Man: The Life and Times of Peter Asher.” (McCartney once dated Peter's sister, Jane.)

Sundance hit “If I Had Legs I Could Kick You” could reignite Oscar talk around Rose Byrne's incendiary performance as a frayed mother with a special-needs child. And Berlin breakout “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) marks not only two festival entries from Richard Linklater, who also directed Cannes' “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix), but the Austin director's first visit to Telluride.

“Blue Moon” stars Telluride tributee Ethan Hawke as alcoholic songwriter Lorenz Hart, sadly watching his former partner Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) celebrate the opening night of “Oklahoma!” at Sardi's. (Scott took home the Berlin Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.) Hawke will also be at Telluride to support his Merle Haggard documentary, “Highway 99: A Double Album.”

 










Telluride continue to support documentaries, which are often neglected at festivals like Cannes. (Ironically, Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux directed a documentary, “Lumière, le Cinéma,” which is among the 15 in the main SHOW.) “Sometimes they're better than the scripted films that are out nowadays,” said Huntsinger.

Telluride docs include “Summer Tour” (Grateful Dead & Co.); “Ask E. Jean,” Ivy Meeropol's portrait of E. Jean Carroll, who is now 82; Laura Poitras' “Cover-Up,” a profile of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh; Nick Hooker's “Karl,” about Karl Lagerfeld, and “Lost in the Jungle” from Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, a search-and-rescue mission about Colombian children who survived a plane crash. “It is a thriller,” said Huntsinger. “Even though you know the ending.”

There's a plethora of films from the U.K., from Plan B's adaptation of bestselling memoir “H is for Hawk” starring Claire Foy and an Eurasian goshawk (it's already screening for distributors), to Riz Ahmed's South Asian take on “Hamlet.” “That country, that culture, they support filmmaking,” said Huntsinger. “Every aspect of it.” She's grateful, as the American supply of films feels diminished, “with our cupboard being a little bare right now.”

After Venice and Telluride come the larger amplifier festivals Toronto and New York and a series of regional festivals from the Hamptons and Middleburg to SCAD. Oscar campaigners will relentlessly bang the drums through March. But Telluride gets the beat started.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: How I Met Your Father star Hilary Duff is returning to Hulu and reuniting with 20th Television for Pretty Ugly, a drama series she is attached to star in and executive produce. The Disney streamer is developing the project, from writer Kirker Butler, director Silver Tree and Aaron Kaplan's Kapital Entertainment.


	Butler is writing Pretty Ugly based on his 2015 novel of the same name. Miranda Miller's (Duff) mission in life is to make her ten-year-old daughter Bailey the most successful child pageant contestant in the United States. A former teenage pageant queen herself, Miranda dreams of endorsement deals, beauty brands, maybe even a TV show. Bailey, however, wants none of it. She's been doing pageants since she was three months old and is burned out.

	But Miranda can't imagine slowing down. In fact, she's seven months pregnant and already mapping out her unborn daughter's future pageant career. While Miranda is busy building her empire, her husband Ray, a nurse with a hobby of taking random pills, has knocked up the eighteen-year-old granddaughter of one of his hospice patients; and her mother Joan, a widowed shut-in, is plotting a murder with Jesus. It's all pretty ugly.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Duff, Butler and Silver Tree executive produce alongside Kaplan. 20th TV and Kapital are the co-studios.


	Former Lizzie McGuire star Duff most recently headlined Hulu's How I Met Your Mother offshoot How I Met Your Father, produced by 20th TV. She also starred in the TV Land comedy Younger, which found new popularity on Netflix this year. Duff is repped by CAA, Linden Entertainment and Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks.

	











	This marks the latest collaboration between Butler and Kaplan.

A fly-on-the-wall documentary about the making of an $120 million movie that nobody saw and even fewer people liked, Mike Figgis' “Megadoc” — shot on the Fayetteville, Georgia set of Francis Ford Coppola's “Megalopolis” — boasts all the fineries of a DVD bonus feature, and makes little effort to contextualize its footage for anyone who isn't already on a first-name basis with immortal characters like Clodio Pulcher and Wow Platinum. (Both of whom were only immortal in the figurative sense, of course, as the former was hanged upside down like Benito Mussolini, while the latter was killed by a crossbow that Jon Voight disguised as his dick.) But don't let that stop you from watching it.

Yes, it's true that I belong to the small cohort of critics who were charmed by the childlike optimism of Coppola's greatest folly. And no, my feelings about “Megalopolis” — which I saw as the strangely egoless self-portrait of an eccentric genius who dared to stake his fortune on a more optimistic vision of the future — haven't diminished since the film's humiliation ritual of a release, even if public opinion about the movie has somehow gotten worse over the last 15 months. 

 










I don't mention all of that as a point of pride (it's not), but rather to establish where I'm coming from when I argue that Figgis' doc — patchy and unpolished as it is — reaffirms what I found so vital about “Megalopolis” at the same time as it illustrates why it was still a singular trainwreck. 

“Cinema is the only art that kills what it's trying to preserve,” Coppola declares, and the last 30 years of his career — starting with “One from the Heart,” but very much including “Jack” — have stemmed from his efforts to capture that thing without snuffing it out. To create a cinema that doesn't feel like a succession of taxidermied images. To his mind, movies are so moribund because people approach them as work; as fossilization rather than creation. “Toil gives you nothing,” he declares at some point during the long and wacky rehearsal process for “Megalopolis.” “Play gives you everything.” 

But at what cost? It's no secret that Coppola invested a fortune of his own money to fund this movie, and to buy himself the luxury of making it on his own terms. The prospect scares him, as he confesses to his late wife Eleanor in a brief snippet of footage that Figgis includes from before the shoot (it's fitting that “Megadoc” begins and ends as a tribute to the director of the greatest Coppola-in-crisis documentary ever made), but as Jacques Tati once said: “Who cares if you died broke if you put all your money into something you think is beautiful?” 

 










A lot of people, it turns out. Made in the face of an industry so choked of its creative lifeblood that movie-lovers have started evaluating films like accountants, “Megalopolis” should have been received with the graciousness of an unsolicited gift, but most pundits were more only interested in the receipt. I can't begrudge anyone for rolling their eyes at such a clunky, garish, and unrelentingly sincere technofable that feels like it's been reheated in the microwave one — or 100 — too many times since Coppola started thinking about it in 1983, but I was saddened by the sheer hostility that greeted the mere idea of a self-funded passion project, as if it were gauche and embarrassing for a revered auteur to sink his wine money back into art without any real hope of recouping his investment. “What currency am I paid in?,” Coppola asks a combative Shia LaBeouf. The actor guesses “love.” The correct response was “fun.” 

The movies have always been inextricable from the cost of making them, but what might it look like if they weren't? The collective eagerness to mock the mere existence of “Megalopolis” leads me to suspect that most people may not really want to know the answer. “When we leap into the unknown,” the great Cesar Catilina once said, “we prove that we are free.” The trouble with freedom, of course, is that it exposes our limitations, which can be incredibly frustrating in its own right. Play gives you everything — including a new kind of toil all its own. 

 










“Megadoc” doesn't offer any kind of who's-who or what's-what for people who aren't already familiar with Coppola's film, and I can't pretend to imagine what Figgis' documentary might be like for people who don't know what “Megalopolis” is about, but I suspect that it still manages to resolve as a broadly fascinating look at the full toll of filmmaking — not just on the wallet, but also on the soul. 

There's octogenarian Francis Ford Coppola, giddily discussing the Days Inn he bought as a production base and happily misquoting Dante to his cast on the first day of their open-ended rehearsal process (“Abandon worry all ye who enter here,” the director insists). There's Wow Platinum herself Aubrey Plaza playing some kind of improv game with Dustin “Nush” Hoffman and Nathalie Emmanuel. There's LaBeouf, looking malevolent without eyebrows as he candidly discusses how he “fucked his whole life up” in the time since he first read the script, and how he had to make amends to Jon Voight as part of the ninth step of his recovery process; this will be the only time the film alludes to incidents of sexual violence, though Figgis appears to include the briefest of snippets from the shoot where Coppola allegedly kissed female extras without their consent. 

 










“Megalopolis” is one of those movies that feels like it offers an accurate window behind the scenes of its own creation process, and “Megadoc” confirms as much without ever becoming redundant. Everyone on location for rehearsal seems excited to be there, even if nobody knows exactly where “there” might be. Although the project had been gestating for so many decades, the footage makes clear that Coppola was still most animated by the thrill of discovery, and that he was eager to run with any of the enthusiasm that his collaborators brought to the table. 

The specifics of how that worked are largely left to the imagination (“Megadoc” is curiously short and scattershot for a documentary that must have been culled from untold hours of footage), but the mad circus vibe comes through loud and clear. Everyone seems to be high on the “is this really happening?” of it all, especially the department heads, who appear equal parts thrilled and nervous about the scale of the job at hand. 

Likewise, almost nobody seems bothered by the presence of Figgis' Nikon Z8 camera, as if there's a communal agreement that it would be wrong not to record the making of a movie that has been fighting to get off the ground for so long. (“Megadoc” includes several clips from earlier table reads and test shoots, which feature the likes of Robert De Niro and a young Ryan Gosling.) Adam Driver is the only person who may have been uncomfortable with the intrusion; a non-presence until the very end of the documentary, his elusiveness makes “Megadoc” feel considerably smaller than its title might imply.

 










Things become considerably more volatile when the actual shoot begins and Coppola's Willy Wonka-like charm — as Plaza describes it — is put to the test by the demands of realizing his mad vision once and for all. And by the demands of working with Shia LaBeouf, whose method hinges upon antagonizing his director at every turn. Shooting “Apocalypse Now” was a field day compared with the challenge of getting LaBeouf to accept the blocking of a simple dialogue scene, and Coppola — whose eruptions of anger and subsequent retreats to his Airstream RV fly in the face of the spirit he was trying to cultivate on set — eventually concedes that LaBeouf is “the biggest fucking pain in the ass of any actor I've ever worked with.” More than that, Coppola is forced to wonder if he's become too old and grouchy for this kind of work, which is a crushing thing to ask for someone who's done everything in his power to make it feel like play. 

There are still rules, even within the ultimate freedom. Actors still need direction, bills still need to be paid, and personal boundaries still need to be respected. But to watch “Megadoc” is to appreciate why “Megalopolis” feels more vital than so many other films, and also why it feels completely out of control at the same time. It's to understand how a legendary auteur can marshal all of his power and personal finances towards the ultimate bet on the future of his art form, only for it to feel like an act of charity — like everyone who participated in the project was only doing so to humor him. It's to understand that “Megalopolis” was riveting less for its story than for its Schrödinger-like ability to articulate why the movies feel so alive even while they're dying, and also why they feel so dead even when there's still so much life in the people who make them. 

 










“Megadoc” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Utopia will release it in the United States.

It's been two years since Tia Mowry's divorce from Cory Hardrict was made official. The actress, who starred in Hallmark's “A Gingerbread Christmas” in 2018, has acknowledged that she and Hardrict maintain a positive relationship. In an interview with Parents.com, she revealed what she views as the most crucial thing former couples need to remember.

“The main important thing is making sure that the children still see the parents together and communicating, and still see them [being] cordial,” she said. “That's what keeps children beautifully adjusted. It keeps their nervous system calm and at ease when they see their parents are still together, we all come together as a family.”

Her actions have proven that these aren't mere words. Earlier this year, she posted Instagram photos showing the exes celebrating their kids' birthdays together. But beyond co-parenting, she's also making sure to foster independence — no matter how challenging it may be.

“I don't think it is your job to make your kids happy,” Mowry told Parents.com. “I think that it is your job to keep your kids safe, nurture them, guide them, but they have to learn on their own how to make themselves happy, because we don't want to create co-dependency.”

A recent event showed that her methods are working. When 7-year-old Cairo went to the school nurse after being hit with a ball, the nurse asked if she should call Mowry. Cairo replied, “No.”

“I desperately wanted to speak to her and hear her voice to make sure that she was OK,” Mowry said. “But I had to allow this opportunity for her to gain independence and say, ‘I got this.'”

Mowry's thoughts on letting her kids have their own voice align with her beliefs about raising self-sufficient children. If her kids are uncomfortable with something, she doesn't expect them to do it. She admitted her upbringing was much different. 

“I think growing up, it was definitely a cultural thing where it's like, ‘My house, my rules,'” she clarified. “I didn't want to do that with my children. I wanted my children to never be afraid to express themselves.”

She may want her kids to learn independence, but she also cherishes every moment she has with them, especially with her 14-year-old, Cree.

“Sometimes I enjoy saying, ‘Did you put on your deodorant today? Did you brush your teeth?'” Mowry said, getting emotional. “Because I know I hate to sound so cliché, but I am counting down the days I have.”

The state saw a nearly 400 percent jump in applications to get filming subsidies. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Apple TV+'s The Studio and a new HBO series from Larry David headline the first round of subsidies to Hollywood after California's historic expansion of the state's entertainment tax credit program, designed to woo productions back to their cultural home.


	In total, 22 TV productions will get $256 million in incentives for shooting in California, the film commission announced on Wednesday. They're projected to generate $1.1 billion in economic activity across multiple industries with ties to the entertainment industry and employ 6,500 cast and crew members, as well as 46,100 background performers. Most of the filming is expected to take place in Los Angeles, where workers have been experiencing a shortage of jobs since the dual writers and actors strikes.

	This allotment of subsidies saw a nearly 400 percent increase in applications, according to the film commission. The main changes to the program reflect its increased popularity: the increase of the total cap from $330 million to $750 million; the 35 percent base credit; the expansion of the category of productions that qualify to include shorter TV shows, sitcoms, animated titles and large-scale competition shows.


	“California has long been the entertainment capital of the world — and the newly expanded film and TV tax credit program is keeping it that way,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. “This program means paychecks for middle-class workers, opportunities for small businesses and investment in communities up and down the state. We're not just protecting our legacy — we're reminding the world why the Golden State remains the beating heart of film and television.”  

	











	Other shows that will receive tax credits include a new 20th Television drama from This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman, Warner Bros. Television's Presumed Innocent, Sony Pictures Television's SWAT Exiles, CBS Studios's NCIS Origins and Group Chat, and a 20th Television pilot from Kenya Barris.


	“As an L.A. native, I feel lucky to have been able to shoot so many projects here throughout my career and love that we'll be able to continue spotlighting our incredible city, its people and the culture,” Barris said in a statement. “Not only does this credit allow us to work with the best crews and craftspeople around but, more importantly, it allows us to create jobs and support the LA film community at a time when it's more important than ever.”


	A main tenet of the changes to California's program involved swaying TV shows, long an anchor of production in the region, to shoot in the state. There's a separate incentive for productions that relocate from another state to California, which Tom Segura's Netflix series Bad Thoughts is taking advantage of as it moves away from Texas.


	California has steadily been losing production as other regions beef up their incentive programs in a race to host Hollywood. One example: In June, Texas passed a law that increased by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years.

The streaming era has changed a lot, but we can still count on autumn to usher in a lot of new television. On Thursday, Adult Swim announced the premiere dates for Smiling Friends and the new comedy Haha, You Clowns. Smiling Friends will return for its third season on October 5 at 11:30 P.M. Haha, You Clowns (which first began as part of the animated shorts line up for Adult Swim SMALLS) will premiere October 19 at 11:45 P.M. 

Ahead of its return, Smiling Friends has already been renewed for a fourth and fifth season. The third season “finds Pim, Charlie, Flint and the whole gang going absolutely bonkers once again, diving headfirst into their ultimate quest to spread joy upon the land,” according to a synopsis from Adult Swim. “We'll see a bunch of unexpected stuff here such as Mr. Frog running full speed at the camera, the team finally collecting all the spirit gems they need, and a totally epic showdown spectacle with an Ancient Witch of some sort. AHHHHH!!!!”

The full-series version of Haha, You Clowns was announced last year at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival and later enjoyed its world premiere at San Diego Comic-Con 2025. Created by Joe Cappa, some of the voice cast guest stars include Sean Astin, Justin Theroux, and Cheri Oteri, according to Fox 5 San Diego. The series follows “the Campbell boys, three doting teenagers and their tenderhearted dad, as they live, laugh, love their way into your living rooms. They're big dudes with big feelings who are learning to navigate life in the wake of their mother's death, sensing her presence in everyday adventures.” You can check out a first look photo below. 

“We love shows that make you smile and go ‘haha'- and that's what you'll get with Smiling Friends and Haha, You Clowns. It's right there in the titles.” Adult Swim president Michael Ouweleen said in a statement. “While totally different from each other, these two shows are united in that they're hilarious, gently unnerving, and sometimes even profound.”

The hit leads Billboard's 100-position Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century retrospective. Below, find a breakdown of the 2000-24 top 10.

	Trevor Anderson



The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” outshines all competitors on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart. The smash lands at No. 1 on the survey, which is based on performance on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from the start of 2000 through the end of 2024.


	“Blinding Lights” claims the shiny prize largely for its unprecedented longevity in the top 10: 59 weeks, the most of any song not only in the quarter century but in the entire history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, dating to its 1958 consolidation into a single, genre-encompassing listing. Of its run in the top 10, “Blinding Lights” snagged 11 frames at No. 1 — the most among The Weeknd's nine career champs.


	In November 2021, “Blinding Lights” crowned Billboard's Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs chart, dating to the weekly list's August 1958 start. “I don't think [it] has hit me yet,” The Weeknd told Billboard upon learning of the song's all-time, all-genre command. “I just count my blessings, and I'm just grateful.”


	Reflecting the biggest names in R&B and hip-hop from Y2K to today, check out the top 10 songs on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart below and the entire 100-position ranking in Billboard's Greatest of All Time charts menu.


	Following the reveal of Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the 21st Century chart and the unveiling of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums of the 21st Century chart, check back Friday (Aug. 29) for Billboard's rundown of The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart, with all coverage of Billboard's 21st Century Charts here.


	Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century recaps reflect performance on weekly charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024. The Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists category ranks the best-performing acts in that span based on activity on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. (Titles released prior to mid-1999 are excluded, although such entries that appeared on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums or Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in that span contribute to the calculation of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists chart.) The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart reflects producers with the most No. 1s on weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024, with ties broken by most top 10s and most overall chart entries.


	The star team-up dominated the summer of 2013 and beyond, racking up 16 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs that June through October. For all three hitmakers, who have enjoyed multiple No. 1s on the chart, “Blurred Lines” remains their longest-leading ruler.


	After a nearly eight-year break between albums, Maxwell returned in 2009 with BLACKsummers'night and his biggest hit single. “This song, it's about wanting to be with somebody but meeting them too early,” the singer-songwriter shared at a 2008 concert in which he performed the song pre-release. With its flight to No. 1, “Wings” and its 14-week Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs reign returned Maxwell to the summit for the first time in a decade, since “Fortunate” in 1999.


	Despite a No. 2 peak on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, SZA's “Snooze” passed many of its contemporaries in the long run thanks to strong consistency, as the 2022 release resonated after the height of its promo campaign as a single. Radio strength was an essential asset, as it claimed a record 37-week command atop the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.


	Post Malone and Swae Lee swung to No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and stuck to the top rank for 11 weeks with their Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack smash, which began its run in early 2019. Both knew the feeling of an extensive stay well: Post Malone previously … posted 14 weeks in charge via “Rockstar” in 2017-18, while Swae Lee and his brother Slim Jxmmi, as duo Rae Sremmurd, ruled for seven weeks with “Black Beatles” in 2016-17.


	Bruno Mars had much to like in 2017, as singles from his ‘90s R&B-inspired album, 24K Magic, reaped massive rewards. “That's What I Like,” the album's second single (after its title track), celebrated 10 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 2019, it was revealed as the second-biggest hit on the chart for the entire 2010s decade.


	“Thrift Shop” notched 14 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2013, pushing its main creators, duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, to a banner breakout year. Follow-up single “Can't Hold Us” captured seven weeks at No. 1 later that year, and “Thrift Shop” wrapped 2013 as the year-end No. 1 track on the annual Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs recap.


	“Sure Thing” was already a hit upon its release, hitting No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for a week in 2011. An unexpected revival from TikTok in 2023, however, pushed it into the history books. Thanks to that second wind, the single added 30 weeks to its chart run and became the track with the most weeks, 89, in the 67-year history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.


	Blige's devotional ode ranks as the top song by a woman for the quarter century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The crown chart jewel of the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul's collection conquered the tally for 15 weeks in 2006, longer than Blige's five other leaders combined. In its run, the track surpassed two other of the genre's juggernaut tracks (Deborah Cox's “Nobody's Supposed To Be Here” and Mariah Carey's “We Belong Together”) as the longest-leading hit by a woman, a mark that Blige owned for the next 17 years.


	Erasing any notion of being a one-year wonder, Lil Nas X found more hits in 2021, including his smash collaboration with Jack Harlow. The rising talents' joint effort was a runaway success, posting 19 weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. At the time, Lil Nas X owned the two longest leaders, with 2019's “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus) in first place, with 20 frames.


	Ascending from the underground alt-R&B scenes of Toronto to international stardom, The Weeknd reached unprecedented stature with the glistening “Blinding Lights.” The single spent 11 weeks in charge of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart — chief of Abel Tesfaye's nine champs — and a record 59 weeks in the top 10. The blockbuster claims history on other Billboard recaps, ruling the Top Hot 100 Songs of the 21st Century chart, announced in January, following its coronation on the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs retrospective.

Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts played Chicago's Huntington Bank Pavilion at Northerly Island on Wednesday evening, and near the end of the main set, they debuted a brand new song entitled “Big Crime” that absolutely scorches Donald Trump and his federal takeover of Washington, DC.


	“Don't need no fascist rules,” Young sings. “Don't want no fascist school/Don't want soldiers on our streets/There's big crime in DC at the White House…No more money to the fascists/the billionaire fascists/Time to blackout the system.”


	Complete video of the public performance has hit YouTube, and Young posted audio of the soundcheck rendition along with the lyrics on the Neil Young Archives. Head here to check it out in full on the NYA, and look above for the live performance.


	“Big Crime” is the only tune in the set that makes specific reference to Trump and his policies, but there are numerous protest songs – including “Be The Rain,” “Southern Man,” “Ohio,” and “Sun Green” – that show exactly where Young's head is at right now.

	











	Earlier this year, Young voiced concerns that he wouldn't be let back into America following a European tour because of his public opposition to Trump's immigration policies. “If I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” he wrote on the Neil Young Archives. “That is happening all the time now. Countries have new advice for those returning to America …If you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA if you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We'll all find that out together.”

	











	A few weeks later, he responded to Trump's public assaults on Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America,” Young wrote. “You worry about that instead of the dyin' kids in Gaza. That's your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel.”

	Bizarrely, Trump is a big Neil Young fan who has seen him in concert on several occasions. “He's got something very special,” Trump told Rolling Stone in 2008. “I've listened to his music for years. His voice is perfect and haunting. I've met him on occasions and he's a terrific guy.”


	Young's tour continues Friday night at Milwaukee's BMO Pavilion, and wraps up September 20 at Farm Aid's 40th anniversary concert at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, where he'll share the bill with Kenny Chesney, Dave Matthews, Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, and Steve Earle.


	The complete “Big Crime” lyrics:


	No more great againNo – no more great againThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	Don't need no fascist rulesDon't want no fascist schoolsDon't want soldiers on our streetsThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	Got to get the fascists outgot to Clean the white house outDon't want soldiers on our streetsThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	No more great againNo – no more great againThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	No more money to the fasciststhe billionaire fascistsTIME TO BLACKOUT THE SYSTEMno more great againNo – no more great againTIME TO BLACKOUT THE SYSTEMThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White House


	NO MORE GREAT AGAINNo NO MORE GREAT AGAINThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseThere's big crime in DC at THE White HouseNO MORE GREAT AGAINNO NO MORE GREAT AGAIN

	Sting (real name: Gordon Matthew Sumner) and his publishing company, Magnetic Publishing, are listed as defendants in the suit.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Released in 1983, “Every Breath You Take” logged eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, longer than any other single that year. It was the band's first and only leader on the chart, and won a brace of Grammy Awards, for song of the year and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals.


	The evergreen number grew wings when Summers' arpeggio was sampled on Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' Notorious B.I.G. tribute from 1997, “I'll Be Missing You.” In 2023, Puff Daddy went on the record as saying he pays Sting $5,000 every day for the use of that sample, a comment he later walked back.

	











	In 2022, Sting sold his entire song catalog from his early days in The Police through his solo career to the Universal Music Publishing Group, a business decision that reunites his music publishing rights with his master recordings.


	While terms of that deal were not disclosed, Billboard previously reported that Sting had been shopping a music asset bundle that produced an annual royalty income stream of about $12-$13 million and was looking at a roughly $360 million payday.


	With their bleach-blonde hair, tight performances, and collection of radio friendly hits, including “Roxanne,” “Message in a Bottle”, “Walking on The Moon”, “Don't Stand So Close to Me”, “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” “King of Pain” and more, The Police were arguably the biggest band in the world, certainly for an album cycle or two.


	In the UK, the band landed five consecutive No. 1s on the Official UK Albums Chart. In the U.S., Synchronicity logged 17 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The bandmates went their separate ways after completing the 1984 world tour in support of Synchronicity, before reuniting briefly in 1986 for a re-recording in “Don't Stand So Close To Me,” which appeared on a greatest hits collection.


	The former bandmates settled their differences to mount a 2007–08 world tour, marking the 30th anniversary of their formation. Sting is booked to perform at QPAC's Glasshouse Theatre in Brisbane next year, where he will present his musical The Last Ship.

The first teaser trailer for The Carpenter's Son—a biblical horror movie starring FKA twigs as Mary, mother of Jesus—is here. Nicolas Cage plays Joseph in the movie, and you can see them both in the clip below. Lofty Nathan wrote and directed the film, which stars Noah Jupe as Jesus. It is set for release this autumn, but no date has been set.

A movie synopsis shared upon the film's announcement last year said The Carpenter's Son “tells the dark story of a family hiding out in Roman Egypt. The son, known only as ‘the Boy,' is driven to doubt by another mysterious child and rebels against his guardian, the Carpenter, revealing inherent powers and a fate beyond his comprehension. As he exercises his own power, the Boy and his family become the target of horrors, natural and divine.”

FKA twigs recently starred opposite Bill Skarsgård in Rupert Sanders' remake of the 1994 cult classic The Crow. She also has a new album, Eusexua Afterglow, on the way—a standalone, full-length follow-up to Eusexua, according to her publicists.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent engagement has spawned reactions from fans and friends all over the world.

On Aug. 26, the superstar couple announced their engagement via a gorgeous, flower-filled Instagram post captioned with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”

Now, fans want to know all of the details, including when and where the lovebirds will tie the knot. While no details about the upcoming wedding have been shared publicly, it's no surprise that the suggestions are rolling on—and that includes a cheeky idea to host the wedding at a beloved college football stadium in Swift's home state of Pennsylvania.

A post shared by Penn State University (@pennstate)

Hours after Swift and Kelce revealed they were engaged, a post on Penn State University's Instagram page featured a photo from the proposal.

The university's Nittany Lion mascot was then added in, with a bubble that read, “Congrats on your engagement! We have the perfect wedding venue to seat 107k of your closest friends.”

A second slide showed photos from the couple's flower-filled engagement day, as well as shots of Swift performing in State College, PA.  Another photo featured reception tables, seemingly from past events at the school.

‘Don't shake this off because this is our type of love story 🫶,” came the caption. “Wedding in @jordancenter and reception in @beaver_stadium!”

For more than 60 years, Beaver Stadium has been home to the Nittany Lions at Penn State's University Park campus. The stadium has an official seating capacity of 106,572, which makes it the second-largest stadium in the country, per gopsusports.com.

The Bryce Jordan Center is a 15,261-seat arena on Penn State's main University Park campus.

A post shared by Penn State Football (@pennstatefball)

While the Travis and Taylor Penn State wedding idea is pretty far-fetched, weddings have been held at the iconic Beaver Stadium in the past.

The Knot previously posted photos from the nuptials for two PSU alumni in 2015 after their wedding was held at their alma mater's Beaver Stadium.

The groom even proposed to his fiancée right outside the stadium during homecoming weekend, and the entire wedding featured Penn State's navy and white color scheme.

According to Philadelphia magazine, the stadium has four event rooms in varying sizes —The Letterman's Lounge, the Recruit's Lounge,  the President's Suite & Lounge, and the supersized  Mt. Nittany Club space.

	The Ye documentary In Whose Name? has released an explosive trailer, featuring appearances from Drake, Kim Kardashian and Elon Musk.


	Directed by Nico Ballesteros, the doc follows Ye (formerly Kanye West) from about 2018 until 2024 and is completely shot on an iPhone. The trailer jumps around from West's deteriorating relationship with then-wife Kim Kardashian — who filed for divorce in 2021 — to his failed 2020 presidential run and Sunday Service performances.


	“The best thing about being an artist who's bipolar is anything you do and say is an art piece,” Ye says in the clip.

	The doc pulls the curtain back on Ye to give fans an authentic look at the method to his madness in recent years and what makes him one of the most polarizing artists of the 21st century.




			Trending on Billboard		







	There are plenty of celebrity cameos, including studio sessions with Drake, Pharrell and Swizz Beatz. West is also shown walking out with Playboi Carti and Marilyn Manson at the Donda 2 listening party in Miami and delves into his relationship with his children. 

A post shared by Nico Ballesteros (@nico.ballesteros)


	“Should I have blown up the Gap sh–? Should I have blown up the Adidas sh–? But the answer is yes,” he says, referencing his split with the companies following his antisemitic remarks in 2022. 


In Whose Name? will be released in about 1,000 theaters across the U.S. on Sept. 19 for a limited time. Tickets can be purchased on the doc's website. “A documentary six years in the making,” a press release for the film reads. “3,000 hours of footage refined to one story about the world's most polarizing living artist.”

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce‘s post on Instagram announcing their engagement got a lot of, well, engagement. 


	According to data shared with Billboard on Wednesday (Aug. 27), Meta counts that the photos of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end proposing to the pop star have surpassed 1 million reposts on Instagram — more than any other post has ever received on the platform. Even more impressive, the couple's announcement achieved that record in just six hours. 


	The news comes after Billboard previously reported that the post had earned 14 million “likes” in just one hour. At press time, Instagram displays that it has surged past 29 million.

	











	If there was ever going to be a post that would garner such high stats, it's Swift and Kelce's. The duo's big reveal — which they shared by writing, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married” — sent the internet into an absolute frenzy, with fans flooding social media with messages of shock and congratulations. Even President Donald Trump got in on the action, setting aside his grievances with the 14-time Grammy winner to say during a cabinet meeting, “I think he's a great guy, and she's a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The engagement comes after about two years of dating for Swift and the athlete, who popped the question two weeks prior to their Tuesday (Aug. 26) announcement, according to Kelce's dad, Ed. The lovebirds now have wedding planning to add to their busy schedules, which features the beginning of the Chiefs' football season on Sept. 5 and the release of the musician's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.

The singer/actress shared a nostalgic meme celebrating the longtime friends' parallel engagements.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Longtime best friends Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez have shared a lot over the years — and now they get to share their engagement journeys.


	On Wednesday (Aug. 27) — the day after Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce shared that they're getting married following two years of dating — Gomez shared the news on her Instagram Stories with the message: “When bestie gets engaged 🥰.”


	Gomez herself is also engaged, sharing the news back in December that she and pop producer Benny Blanco are getting married. “forever begins now..,” Gomez captioned the Instagram announcement, with Swift responding in the comments: “Yes I will be the flower girl.”

	











	In a second Instagram Stories post on Wednesday night, Gomez also shared a fan-made meme from X user @solelynostalgia. The meme shows a quote-tweet of a 2009 post from Swift, in which she wrote to Gomez: “Real love still happens sometimes. It's not just something we make up when we're nine. I have to believe that. You do too.” Above that nearly two-decade-old tweet, a message reads, “16 years later,” above side-by-side images of Swift and Gomez's engagement photos.

	While they haven't shared a wedding date, Gomez and Blanco's nuptials are rumored to be coming very soon, with the girls trip the singer/actress was on this past weekend reported to be her bachelorette party.


	Swift and Gomez have been friends since 2008 — the year before Taylor's sweet Twitter message about love. Their friendship started when they were both dating Jonas Brothers (Taylor dated Joe while Selena dated Nick), and Gomez said after their respective breakups: “I like to say the best thing we got out of those relationships was each other.”

Taylor Swift‘s BFF has entered the chat. 

Two best friends, two soulmates, and two love stories unfolding in the same year, it almost feels like a movie. Selena Gomez is celebrating Taylor Swift's fairytale engagement in the sweetest way. 

After Travis Kelce, 35, proposed to Swift, 35, in a romantic garden setting, Gomez couldn't resist sharing her excitement with fans.

“When bestie gets engaged,” Gomez wrote on her Instagram Story August 27, alongside photos from the couple's enchanting proposal. The short but heartfelt message quickly went viral among fans. Here are the sweetest reactions: 

Oh after y'all set selena up to look like she never posted Taylor solo now yall wanna ost what she posted first. Selena fans have the right to be nasty to all of yall. https://t.co/tRZJIBJYrR

The post also tied back to a nostalgic chapter in their friendship. 

Gomez reshared a fan post that featured Swift's 2009 tweet, in which she wrote: “Real love still happens sometimes. It's not just something we make up when we're nine. I have to believe that. You do too.” The fan added side-by-side images of both stars' proposals, captioned, “16 years later,” a moment Gomez proudly highlighted.

Swift announced her engagement to Kelce on August 26 with an Instagram carousel showing the Kansas City Chiefs star down on one knee surrounded by flowers. The Grammy winner captioned the post, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” while showing off her sparkling diamond ring.

The proposal was witnessed by both families, who were overjoyed to see the couple take this next step.

The engagement follows a milestone of Gomez's own. Last December, Swift left a playful comment under Gomez's Instagram post announcing her engagement to producer Benny Blanco, teasing, “Yes, I will be the flower girl.”

Now, with both women celebrating love at the same time, their enduring friendship continues to be a source of joy for fans.

Donna Kelce marked her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a touching online gesture. The day after the couple shared their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner to a collage of their childhood photos. The sweet side-by-side images showed Swift posing against a prop tree in a school portrait, while a young Travis smiled in a flannel shirt against a classic blue backdrop.

The producers behind popcorn thriller 'G20' were sued on Wednesday for copyright infringement. There's been an uptick in accusations of infringement in recent years, though that hasn't led to much success for those filing the lawsuits. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	It's a tale as old as Hollywood: A writer drafts a screenplay and submits it to various competitions. They get some buzz, maybe even placing in a few, though their script ultimately doesn't land anywhere. Then, they see a movie that feels similar to what they wrote. And after looking at the film's IMDB page, they realize that they're a couple levels removed from one of the title's producers or writers, who they suspect may have read their screenplay once upon a time and ripped it off. They file a lawsuit.


	Most copyright infringement lawsuits don't go anywhere, but a writer suing over popcorn thriller G20 is looking to flip the narrative. In a complaint filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Clarice Eboni Boykin-Patterson alleges the producers behind the Viola Davis action flick copied her screenplay.

	With G20, Davis joined the pantheon of action heroes tasked with saving the world from calamity. She's the president of the United States with an extensive military background and weapons training but wait, she must also balance her very serious work life with a family. When viewers meet Davis' character, she's bickering with her 17-year-old daughter after the teen snuck out to a party at a Georgetown bar. 


	Boykin-Patterson, an entertainment reporter for The Daily Beast, challenges both works featuring “intense violence” with “warm, relatable familial drama,” among other things.


	Like G20, Boykin-Patterson's screenplay follows a Black woman in politics that must save an auditorium of people, including her family, from terrorists, led by a man with a personal vendetta, who've taken over the international conference (warning: spoilers ahead). She ultimately evades capture but her husband — whose main role is to support the political ambitions of his wife in both works — is kidnapped and used as a bargaining chip. In the movie and screenplay, titled “Election Night,” the protagonist's friend appears to die but are eventually shown to have survived.

	











	The lawsuit adds both works “feature the same themes; who gets to legislate and be in power in the future, does an inclusionary style of leadership edge out those who traditionally held power, and who inherits power and gets to wield it.” It also says they share the same genre: Tense thrillers that feature a race against the block with an “underlying tension and dread that result from the precariousness of the central characters, i.e. their gender and race and their overcompensation for these traits.”


	While these broad similarities alone may not be covered by copyright law, the lawsuit alleges that, when aggregated together, they can constitute infringement. There's some truth to the argument: Courts have found that a writer stringing together several elements that aren't typically protected by copyright — like a ragtag group of misfits banding together to pull off a high-stakes con — can serve as the foundation to an idea theft claim. Still, there's an uphill battle to climb. 


	In April, Showtime Networks and Lionsgate's Entertainment One defeated a copyright lawsuit over Yellowjackets. The court found in that case that several of the alleged similarities are common tropes found in survival thrillers, pointing to the death of a head coach and survival of his two children, attempts by survivors to escape isolation and the division of groups into rival factions. If two works share basic plot points, it's natural for them to have identical tones, the court reasoned.

	











	“There can be no serious dispute that escape attempts by shipwrecked or stranded survivors are prevalent throughout fiction and history, from Odysseus, Robinson Crusoe, and Gilligan to Shackleton and the Uruguayan rugby team,” the judge wrote in an order dismissing the lawsuit.


	A major factor in the case will be whether the producers and writers behind the movie have read Boykin-Patterson's screenplay. In 2021, “Election Night” was submitted to the ScreenCraft Screenwriting Fellowship contest, where it was a quarterfinalist, and the Launch Pad Feature Competition, where it got to the second round, while being shopped around to various production companies.


	The lawsuit stresses that Logan Miller and Noah Miller, the writers of G20, are managed by Daniel Sherman, an executive producer on the movie who's been a judge in the Launch Pad competition, the same event Boykin-Patterson submitted her screenplay.


	The decision comes amid a shift in the vetting of copyright lawsuits that's increasingly encouraged creators to sue. In recent years, federal appeals courts have been cautioning lower courts against early dismissal and from imposing their views on whether two works overlap enough to warrant allowing lawsuits to proceed. One of those rulings — at least the third since 2020 overturning a defense-friendly decision in a copyright case — reversed a federal judge's decision to toss Francesca Gregorini's lawsuit against M. Night Shyamalan and Apple over Servant on the premise that dismissal was premature because “reasonable minds could differ” on whether her and the acclaimed horror director's works are substantially similar.

	











	That's contributed to an uptick in copyright lawsuits actually getting to trial. Earlier this year, juries considered claims of infringement against Disney over Moana and Shyamalan over Servant. Both ended in defense verdicts.


	The findings in those trials reaffirmed the high bar in convincing a jury that any alleged similarities between two works constitute copyright infringement. Copyright law doesn't protect general ideas — like incidents, characters and settings considered standard in the treatment of particular topics (think a priest in a movie about possession) — only the particular expression of those ideas. 


	The last case in which a plaintiff may have come out on top involves the Shape of Water. After a federal appeals court in 2020 revived the lawsuit from the estate of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel, which alleged that the makers of the Oscar-winning film ripped off Let Me Hear You Whisper, a settlement was reached.


	MRC, which distributed the movie, and JuVee Productions, Davis' production banner, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

For moms, few moments are bigger than seeing their children find happiness. Donna Kelce celebrated her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a heartfelt online tribute. 

The day after the couple announced their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner photo to a collage of Travis and Taylor's childhood pictures. 

The side-by-side shots showed Swift leaning against a prop tree in a school portrait while a young Travis posed in a flannel shirt against a blue backdrop. 

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

Even before the big announcement, Donna had hinted at the happiness in her son's life. Speaking to People in an interview published August 25, she shared, “I think his mind is settled. That's about all I can tell you. I think he feels calm and he feels like he's on a mission and he knows exactly what he wants.”

At the time, her ex-husband Ed Kelce had already confirmed that Travis had proposed earlier in August. As he told ABC Cleveland, “Travis actually did the proposal maybe two weeks—not quite two weeks ago.”

Travis had initially hoped to wait until just before the NFL season kicked off on Sept. 5 to make his proposal, but both his family and Swift's dad, Scott Swift, encouraged him not to delay.

“Scott said, ‘Come on, when are you going to get this done?'” Ed recalled on The Jimmy and Nath Show on August 26. “He was going to make a big production out of it. Wanted to make it uber special. And I told him the same thing Scott told him—asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it.”

When the NFL star finally got down on one knee, both families were overcome with joy. “The family—both sides—kind of assumed this was going to happen because we'd never seen our kids so happy,” Ed added.

While the engagement marked a new chapter for the couple, Travis and Taylor had already been sharing glimpses of their romance online.

Taylor's first Instagram post featuring Travis was a selfie with Prince William, Princess Kate, and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, backstage at her Eras Tour show in London.

Travis shared his own Instagram debut with Taylor in July 2025, including a cozy dinner photo that revealed their matching lockscreen pictures of each other.

With ‘Dead Man's Wire' premiering out of competition in Venice, the elusive auteur looks back on a career defined by risk, reinvention and ignoring all the rules.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	There's no such thing as a typical Gus Van Sant film.


	With the possible exception of Steven Soderbergh, no American filmmaker working today has had a career marked by such radical shifts in style, budget and artistic ambition as the 73-year-old director from Louisville, Kentucky. From edgy indies to blockbuster crowd-pleasers, prestige Oscar bait to experimental movies, Van Sant has spent the past 40 years delighting, surprising and confounding his audience.




	His early films — the “Portland trilogy” of 1988's Mala Noche, 1989's Drugstore Cowboy and 1991's My Own Private Idaho — were gritty, realist dramas about outsiders: migrant workers, nomadic drug addicts and gay hustlers. The mid-'90s saw Van Sant pivot to more studio-friendly fare: the glossy camp of the 1995 dark satire To Die For, featuring Nicole Kidman in a career-making wig, and 1997's Good Will Hunting, a $225 million global hit that introduced the world to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

	But at the height of his studio success, in between his first Oscar nomination for Good Will Hunting and his second for 2008's political biopic Milk, Van Sant veered in an entirely different direction.


	His “death trilogy” — 2002's Gerry, 2003's Elephant and 2005's Last Days — was a sharp turn into art house experimentation. Loosely scripted and influenced by European auteurs Béla Tarr and Chantal Akerman, these films favored long, choreographed shots, languid pacing and a disregard for Hollywood conventions. Around the same time, in 1998, he made his notorious shot-for-shot color remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, a $60 million studio picture that now plays like a conceptual art installation.

	











	“I think it goes back to the beginning, when I started making short films with my friends,” Van Sant says of his frequent shifts in style. “We were experimenting, scratching on the film, drawing on the film, animating directly onto 8mm. But we were also going to the cinema in this small town in Connecticut every Friday, watching war movies, or cartoons, or whatever. We'd watch Bonanza on TV. The experiment became: Could I extend my experiments in film into dramatic storytelling, to make something that looked like the things I would see on TV?”


	Van Sant credits his high school English teacher David Stone with introducing him to experimental cinema, showing 14-year-old Gus Canadian Film Board shorts and Citizen Kane in class. “Things like Stan Brakhage, Stan Vanderbeek, the Kuchar brothers, Ron Rice — people like that.”


	Other early influences included a stint assisting Ken Shapiro, director of 1974's pre-SNL sketch spoof The Groove Tube. “Lorne Michaels was actually working for him as a writer when he pitched Saturday Night Live to NBC,” Van Sant recalls. The job gave him a taste for counterculture comedy and the nuts and bolts of indie production.


	At the same time, he was bingeing on films from an emerging queer cinema scene. Apart from John Waters — whose 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos played every Friday at midnight at New York's Quad Cinema — “there weren't really other gay filmmakers that I knew,” he says. “In Hollywood, there was a queer scene, though it wasn't called that. At the gay film festival at the Vista Theater, [the American entries] were mostly old Tennessee Williams adaptations with gay themes, alongside Danish, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish titles. But no new American films. Americans weren't really making independent queer films.”

	











	So Van Sant made one. With $25,000 he'd earned in New York advertising, he financed Mala Noche, a 16mm black-and-white adaptation of the Walt Curtis novel about an almost-romance between a gay store clerk and two young Mexican immigrants.


	“Walt Curtis wasn't a typical city gay man,” says Van Sant. “He was more the kind of queer man who would get kicked out of a gay bar. So Mala Noche wasn't about mainstream gay culture. It was about a sidelined, independent gay man.”


	The film arrived during a golden moment for American indie cinema, fueled by upstart distributors like New Line, Orion and Miramax and the booming home video market. “Around the same time I made my film, Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch were making their first movies — She's Gotta Have It and Stranger Than Paradise — all in black-and-white and all low-budget.”


	Van Sant credits his chameleon-like approach to filmmaking to the way he shape-shifts when working with actors: “One director — I can't remember who, probably Frank Capra — was asked, ‘How do you direct different people?' And he said: ‘If they want to hear Chopin, you play Chopin. If they want to hear rock ‘n' roll, you play rock ‘n' roll.' I'm obsequious enough to mold into their needs, to understand what they want to do and how to make that thing happen.”


	He has often gravitated toward real-life stories: Mala Noche, Drugstore Cowboy and Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot were all adapted from memoirs; Milk was a biopic; To Die For satirized the Pamela Smart murder case. His latest, Dead Man's Wire, premiering out of competition in Venice (where Van Sant will receive the Campari Passion for Film Award), is based on a bizarre 1970s hostage standoff in Indianapolis. Bill Skarsgard plays Tony Kiritsis, a former developer who wired a shotgun to his mortgage banker's neck in a bid for a public apology and a payout.

	











	The project originally was set up with Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage. When they dropped out, producer Cassian Elwes — who had worked with Van Sant on Gerry — called to offer it to him. “Werner is so extreme that you start to see the extreme qualities in the story,” Van Sant says. “I also really knew the quality of this Midwest, middle-class life. My father [and] my grandfather were these types of Midwest small-town businessmen.”


	Van Sant is currently developing another real-life tale, a project about disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried.


	“Working with real stories is less about what I can bring to the story than about the story bringing itself to you, feeling like it's something you are connected to,” he says. “With Sam Bankman-Fried, I just thought this is an amazing sort of car crash in the crypto world. And then someone sent me a script about it.”


	There might not be anyone out there quite like Gus Van Sant. But asked about a kindred spirit, even a possible successor, he names Sean Baker.


	“It's amazing what he's doing. The fact that Anora just swept the Oscars shows there's hope. He comes by a style that's where I've always lived: You make something with small intentions but find the humanity within those intentions,” says Van Sant. “You don't let the money take over your sentiment as a filmmaker. You cast people that are new, that haven't been used before, and simplify the set to not have too many working parts. If you see a shot of a Bergman set, there's like four people. Or watch Godard making Breathless. There's a shopping cart and two guys.”

The truth about extraterrestrial encounters may lie on the operating table, according to doctors and skeptics. 

One night in 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas was plowing his field in rural Brazil when he saw mysterious red lights flying through the sky. What he presumed was a spacecraft landed in a nearby field. According to the farmer's account, he was approached by short humanoid creatures and taken back to their ship despite his attempts to escape. There, Boas claimed his captors experimented on him by taking samples of his body tissue and exposing him to noxious gas.   

Nearly 70 years later, Boas' extraterrestrial encounter is still one of the most famous abduction reports in history, along with other storied accounts from Barney and Betty Hill in 1961 and Travis Walton in 1975; in each case, the alleged victims recalled details similar to Boas' story, like bright lights and probing. Since that fateful night in 1957, several thousand more alien encounters have been reported, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, a research foundation based in Washington state. But are aliens actually abducting hundreds of humans each year, or even at all? Experts suggest there might be a simpler explanation—one that lies on the operating table. 

Accidental awareness is a complication where anesthesia patients wake up while they're really supposed to be unconscious. Most patients don't experience pain during accidental awareness, but may retain memories of the operating theater, according to the Royal College of Anesthetists, a UK-based professional organization. If a patient became aware during surgery, they would likely see bright lights, figures standing over them, and experience feelings of being out of control. Some scholars suggest this visual closely resembles classic abduction accounts, and that these memories may play a role in alien abduction claims. One paper in particular highlights an “altered state of consciousness” and feelings of “nakedness, pain, and a loss of control” as intraoperative experiences that could be confused with an extraterrestrial encounter.  

So why doesn't everyone who experiences accidental awareness believe they were abducted by aliens? According to Daniel J. Cole, M.D., former president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the timeline of patients remembering accidental awareness varies greatly. Memories can be instant or delayed, and sometimes they're even triggered by life events not related to the surgery itself. Cole also says there's a chance the trauma from accidental awareness could manifest as delusions. 

“This area is not well understood,” Cole says in an email. “But it is possible that intraoperative awareness could result in dissociative phenomena and false memories.”

Another expert, Benjamin Radford—paranormal investigator, author, and research fellow—says that, in some cases, remembering medical procedures could “absolutely” lead someone to believe they were abducted by aliens. However, he points out that the theory fails to explain why some people who have never undergone surgery may still believe they were abducted. Radford suggests a much more obvious culprit—one that is affecting most of our lives everyday, whether or not we even realize it. 

“I think that the more likely explanation, at least for many of these, is drawing on pop culture experiences and pop culture depictions,” says Radford, who is also deputy editor at the Skeptical Inquirer, a publication that uses reason to examine controversial and extraordinary claims. 

He points to medical dramas as possible fodder for false memories of alien abductions because the genre is popular and something most people have seen at some point or another. Radford explains that, while viewers may not be consciously memorizing technical medical terms, after watching enough of the shows, they'll eventually get a general sense of what a medical procedure could look like. With this in mind, he says “it's not surprising” that alleged abduction victims would elicit similar details when recounting their experiences. 

Professional skeptic and contributor at the Skeptical Inquirer, Daniel Reed, explains that perception is key. When it comes to our brains, perception is variable and difficult to measure, especially weeks or months after an event occurs. He uses an example of a pink elephant. While most are able to imagine a pink animal with large ears, the picture that appears in your mind is ultimately unique to you; the same goes for our perception of events. With the right level of priming, people may come to understand something fictitious to be true and then become deeply attached to those beliefs, according to Reed. 

Whether someone experiences an alien encounter because of extraterrestrial creatures or as a manifestation of medical trauma, the event deeply impacts their lives. Peter Davenport—director of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and manager of the Center's reporting hotline—says emotional impact is one of the criteria NUFORC uses when evaluating the validity of a report. He also says the strong feelings witnesses confess align with his own experiences, as he's allegedly seen several unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in his lifetime. 

“People are profoundly moved by their sightings, oftentimes,” Davenport says. “And you can hear it in their voice, even when they describe a sighting that occurred 50 years ago. You can tell they're sincere and reporting accurately just by the emotion they're exhibiting as they tell their story. […] Those emotions are hard to fake for most people.”

Christian Stepien, chief technology officer for NUFORC, emphasized in an email that the Center does not believe alien encounters are a manifestation of medical trauma, but rather true anomalous experiences. 

While the jury is still out on the relationship between alien encounters and experiences on the operating table, at least one thing's for certain in Boas' case way back in 1957: the Brazilian farmer read an article about alien invasions just one day before making his own report. 

So, was the extraterrestrial encounter a matter of mere coincidence? Or did the alien encounter story inspire Boas? And in that case, was the story that spurred his account in fact derived from another person's experience on the operating table?  

It seems only Boas—and the aliens who supposedly abducted him—will ever know.

BARBERTON, Ohio – Community members are invited to a paranormal investigation of Barberton's historic West Theatre on Aug. 30 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Experienced investigators from Haunted Havens, a paranormal investigation company, will lead the tour. Attendees will explore the mysteries and supernatural occurrences rumored to have taken place at the iconic venue - -from the boiler room to the creepy attic -- according to Haunted Havens founder Stephanie Pitz.

A Portage Lakes resident and Wadsworth High School graduate, Pitz founded Haunted Havens last year. During her childhood, she felt a connection to the supernatural world, but her parents didn't want to hear about it, she told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. A ghost tour of Savannah, Georgia, that Pitz went on about 10 years ago rekindled her interest. After taking additional tours in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and other places in the South, she decided to open her own company to lead paranormal tours at various locations in Ohio.

“I take people who want to go on ghost tours but don't know where to start, or people who don't know where to go, or don't have friends to go with them, because their friends aren't into that sort of thing. I teach the equipment, and the cost of the tours includes the use of all of the equipment,” Pitz said. 

Tour equipment includes dowsing rods (an ancient tool used to detect water), and REM rods and K2 EMF readers, which detect electrical activity, according to Pitz.

“I just want more people to understand that if you are curious about paranormal activity, you don't just have to watch shows on TV, you can get hands-on, too. I'm trying to make that link between those types of people, because I was that person,” Pitz said.

Tickets are $45 for individuals ages 12 and older. The tour is open to novice and experienced investigators. Basic paranormal equipment is provided, but attendees can also bring their own equipment and a flashlight.

West Theatre opened in August of 1947 at 1017 Wooster Road, according to the Barberton Historical Society. It showed second-run movies until its closure in 2008. The theatre briefly served as a concert venue and a church until it reopened as a theatre in January of 2017, according to Ohio.com reports.

MACON, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) – Visit Macon and the Macon Beyond team are hosting an overnight ghost hunt at one of the city's most historic landmarks, the Burke Mansion, according to Visit Macon.

The exclusive event will be held October 3, and will allow guests to spend the night in the 1887-built mansion while participating in an immersive paranormal investigation.

The ghost hunt will be hosted by actress and producer Carrie Genzel, known for her roles in “The Walking Dead,” “Supernatural,” “Jennifer's Body” and other horror films and series. She will be joined by spiritual medium Morrighan Lynne and paranormal investigator Jonathan Morgan.

The evening begins with a reception featuring wine, signature cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a guided paranormal investigation through the mansion's most storied spaces. Guests will also receive tickets to Rock Candy Tours' Macon Macabre Walking Tour.

“This team has had so much fun exploring the most requested sites in Macon for legends and lore in our video series,” Genzel said. “I have been fascinated with the unexplained, and have had numerous encounters. Moving to Macon sparked my passion for exploring the city's haunted sites and interacting with its supernatural inhabitants.”

Two ticket options are available:

Ghost Hunt Event Only — Friday, October 3, beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $45 and include the cocktail reception, guided paranormal investigation, an event T-shirt and the walking tour.

Luxury Stay + Ghost Hunt Experience — October 3-5. Packages include a two-night stay at Burke Mansion with breakfast, parking, a themed gift basket, a VIP meet-and-greet, the walking tour and access to the ghost hunt. Suites for one to two guests are $500, while the carriage house for two to four guests is $1,000.

“This is all in good fun,” said Gary Wheat, president and CEO of Visit Macon. “We saw the attention and sincere appeal for Macon's October events last year, so we have to keep building on that by creating a calendar full of activities and a place where guests will want to stay with us this season.”

Macon has been named by HGTV as one of the best small towns to celebrate Halloween and highlighted by Travel + Leisure as one of the nation's top destinations for haunted mansions and ghost tours.

In an exclusive excerpt from a new book about their 25 years working together, see how the lawman and medium found trust in each other

St. Martin's Publishing Group

 Before we left the office, I quickly grabbed a few extras from female colleagues: a bracelet, a compact mirror, a woman's watch, and a necklace. Control items, I thought. If this guy was legit, he should be able to tell the difference between what belonged to Fran and what didn't, right?


 I was still sitting on a fence of extremes when it came to this psychic.


 Part of me still thought he was a fraud, and the lawman in me wanted to take him down. I even researched reasons to arrest him. Wire fraud? Mail fraud? And yet, my stubborn heart wanted to believe he was the real deal.


 We arrived at his office in Long Island as a family was leaving. They were crying and thanking the young man, whom I took to be John, in the center of the room. The mother threw her arms around him and hugged tight.


 “You have no idea what you have done for us today.”


 I could feel my anger rising. This guy was taking advantage of a grieving family. The young man — he had a boyish face, brown hair, and glasses — approached me.


 “Hi, I'm John. Are you Agent Hilland?”


 He was not what I expected. From the voice on the radio, I imagined an older man with a grand, theatrical, presence. This guy was younger than me, humble and unassuming. He looked like someone's kid brother. He looked like goddamn Harry Potter.


 “Yes. Thanks for seeing us,” I said, introducing Dansman.


 “Glad to help. Oh. You're not FBI,” John said to Dansman.


 “You're right, I'm not,” said Dansman. He shot me an I-told-you-so look. See?


 Okay, one point for the psychic. But what else will he know? I was prepared for this to be a bust. We sat at a large, wooden desk in a plain, unadorned room. No candles, no incense, no crystal balls.


St. Martin's Publishing Group

 “My assistant tells me you need help with a case,” John began. “The first thing I need to say is that if I end up helping you, it must stay private between us. I don't want you to mention it to the press, I don't want to be in any paperwork.”


 “That's not a problem,” I told him.


 “Good. Have either of you worked with a psychic before?”


 “I have,” said Dansman. “A few times, in other cases.”


 “Never,” I said.


 “Let me explain how I work. The information comes to me from my spirit guides in three different ways: clairvoyance, clairaudience and clairsentience. That means I see pictures, I hear thoughts and I get feelings or sensations. I will interpret what I'm seeing, hearing and feeling using my own frame of reference, and hopefully you'll understand it.


 “Some of the information you might understand right away. Some you might not. It's important that you write everything down, even if you don't understand. It could make sense to you later.”


 We took out our notebooks and pens, ready to go.


 “I'll get people above you, to your side, and below you,” John continued, “meaning older, the same age, and younger. I might be off by a name, but not by an initial.”


 And one more thing, he emphasized.


 “Do not give me any information or try to steer me in any direction. I want to describe to you exactly what I'm getting without interference.”


Erica Schultz

 We nodded.


 “Before we begin, do you have any questions?”


 “Yes,” I said. “I want to confirm. This is an active case. It's not our practice to discuss our investigations with the public, so ...”


 “As far as I'm concerned, you were never here.” John said, cutting me off. “I prefer it that way. Nothing personal, but I don't like to get involved with law enforcement. My only condition in helping you guys is that you don't mention to anyone that you met with me.”


 Good. We were on the same page. Though I could see slight disappointment on Dansman's face.


 “Let's get started,” said John. “Did you bring any belongings of the person you are looking for?” John asked.


 Dansman pulled the items from a bag and placed them on John's desk. John closed his eyes, took a deep breath, cupped his palms together and focused on them. After a minute, he reached over and moved the “control” items — bracelet, mirror, watch, necklace — from the group and put them in a pile to the side.


 I was stunned. He figured it out right away.

 “I don't know what these things are,” said John, “but they have nothing to do with the reason you're here,” he said.


 Dansman and I glanced at each other. Point two for the psychic. John returned his focus to Fran's items and picked up her eyeglasses. He looked up, almost past us, as if he was staring at someone behind us.


 “I'm seeing a woman. She looks older than her actual age. She's crossed over. She has two names like Mary Anne, Barbara Anne ... but people called her by her second name ... ​there's an F sound like Fern or Fran ... wait. It's Fran.”


 My heart raced. Dansman's eyes were locked on Edward. The next chunk of information came in a rush of words.


Paul Arasim

 “She was vain about her appearance. She had breast implants — they're showing me serial numbers on them — and dyed blond hair. Blue eyes. She wore a lot of makeup. Fran was a smoker. I smell cigarette smoke and strong perfume, like when a person tries to cover up the smoke scent with a lot of perfume. She's also showing me that she couldn't walk, like she broke her leg? She's showing me crutches. I feel a strong pain in the back of my head. Was she struck in the head? Yes ... ​she was hit in the back of the head with something. She didn't see it coming. Weird,” John said, still looking beyond us.


 “I feel like she was tricked into going somewhere by someone she trusted. A boyfriend or husband. He is still here, he hasn't crossed. He has a simple J name, like John or Jim or Joe. And a second S name, very common, like ... ​Smith.”


 I shivered. This was unreal.


 John put down the glasses and picked up the hairbrush.


 “After she was hit in the head, the J-S name — let's call him ‘Smith' — strangled her to make sure she was dead. Not like a bloodbath or anything. It was like he knocked her out with one blow, then strangled her.”


 I sat back in my chair, stunned. What the actual hell? Was he was seeing all this play out in front of him? I looked over at Dansman, who was equally shocked. I barely had time to register the horror he described when another rush of information came.


 “He was much younger than her,” John continued. “Maybe 10 years. She was angry. Was there another woman? She thought there was another woman. But not in the same state where they were living."


 “She's showing me stairs. They were upstairs, on a third floor if not higher. There was an argument. She confronted him about a bunch of things, not just one issue. It feels like a whole bunch of different things. Smith was lying to her and she knew it. She called him out on it. He felt like his worlds were crashing together.”


 John shook his head.


 “Man, this guy has major control issues. Major. He needs to be in control. Whatever she did or said, she was taking that control away from him, and he didn't like it.”


 Dansman and I scribbled notes as fast as we could, trying to keep up.


 “The woman, F name — Fran — was fed up and demanded Smith take her somewhere. He was lying to her about so many things. I don't understand this. She's showing me furniture. Did he steal her furniture? There's also a second home. Like I said, she was calling him out an all his lies.”


 Dansman and I kept nodding. John kept getting hit after hit, like a pinball whacking against the bells in a machine. Tilt, tilt, tilt. But not only was John confirming details we already knew, he was giving information we didn't know — details that made sense, information that rang true that we could follow up on.


 We kept scribbling. He kept talking.


 “So, Smith calms her down, he appeases her somehow. Like, ‘Don't worry, Honey, I'll show you everything is okay.' I see them walking out of an apartment building or condo. She's using crutches. It's in the daytime, not at night. Wait, other people saw them leaving — a couple who live in the same building. It feels like they were walking in as she and Smith were leaving ... Oh.”


 John looked at Dansman. “You interviewed these people?”


 Dansman nodded.


 “And they told you they saw them leaving together. But the timing doesn't line up. It's like he kills her on a Saturday but you guys don't know she's missing until a week later.”


 Again, Dansman nodded. He was speechless.


 “So, he, Smith, helps this woman, Fran, to the car. He drives. She thinks she is going somewhere to see something she believes he is lying about. He's taking her to this place ... ​it feels right off a major highway. It's ironic. She was nervous and pissed off, because she knew she was about to expose his lie. And he was nervous and pissed off, because he knew she was about to expose his lie. They both knew."


 “So, whatever this place is, it has an industrial feel to it, like metal and steel, blacktop, concrete ... ​I hear the highway. It's near a major highway with lots of traffic. There are many doors ... ​metal garage doors ...”


 I was so charged up I couldn't stay quiet any longer.


 “Like a public storage unit?” I asked.


 John's eyes lit up.


 “Yes. It absolutely feels like that. Definitely New Jersey, not far from where they lived and where he worked.”


 Again, Dansman and I exchanged a glance. Smith had that public storage facility in New Brunswick, N.J., where Fran's furniture was supposed to be.


 John continued.


 “It was still daylight. I see him pointing to a door and drawing her attention away from what he was about to do. Then he just did it.”

 John's eyes darted around, as if he was watching it happen.


 “For her it was in an instant,” he said. “She didn't even know what happened, she was unconscious before she hit the ground. Then, instantaneously, he pulls her inside whatever this thing is, this garage unit, and closes the door so nobody can see what's happening.”


 John paused, as if trying to process the deluge of images.


 I had to ask. He said not to steer him in a direction, but he didn't say not to ask questions.


 “What did he do with her body?”


 John glanced at me, then gazed again beyond me. He squinted, like he was trying to see or understand something.


 “She's not in one piece,” he said. “He dismembered her and put the pieces in something. She's encapsulated.”


 “What do you mean?” I asked.


 John's brow furrowed.


 “She's encapsulated in something. I keep seeing cylinders ... ​I'm not sure what this is. He's very smart. Whatever he put her in, it's got no smell and it's somewhere no one would suspect there was a body ... ​or pieces of a body.”


 “Like what?”


 “I don't know. I keep seeing cylinders. Her body is in these cylinders but also in something to keep her preserved, like fluid ... ​or concrete.”


 I'm sure Dansman was thinking what I was thinking. Smith worked at an industrial company called Carborundum, which produced refractory, heat-resistant concrete blocks.


 “You know when you see a new development being built, and they have these huge concrete ... ​I don't know what you call them ... storm drains?” John asked.


 “Sewer drains?” I asked.


 “Yeah. Like that. When you find her, her body parts will be remarkably intact. Well preserved.”


 My heart was racing now. I was hanging on his every word.


 “So, we will find her?”


 John paused. He looked thoughtfully at whatever invisible presence was behind us.


 “I think so. But it's not going to be easy,” he said. “And it won't be anytime soon.”

Porepunkah, Australia — Australian police said Thursday they will not rest until they catch a 56-year-old gunman who fled into the bush two days earlier after allegedly killing two officers. Detectives said they were speaking to the man's partner and searching rugged, forested terrain near the small town of Porepunkah, in the northeast of Victoria state.   The suspect, identified by police as Dezi Freeman, escaped on foot after opening fire when a team of 10 police arrived at his property on Tuesday, allegedly killing two policemen and wounding a third.

 Police say the man — described by local media as a radicalized conspiracy theorist — is heavily armed, has bush survival skills and knows the area well.

 "We will not rest until we apprehend the offender," said Russell Barrett, Victoria police deputy commissioner for regional operations.

Police were in contact with the man's partner, had searched a number of properties, and believed he was still in the area, Barrett said.

 But "we've had no confirmed sightings," he told a news conference.

 Anyone harboring the man would be prosecuted for committing a criminal offense, Barrett warned.

 Police said they were moving carefully through the bush, and warned people not to travel into the surrounding alpine area to go skiing.

 "It is really difficult terrain. It is complex terrain," Victoria police superintendent Brett Kahan said.

 Police say the shooting happened in a matter of minutes when they descended on the man's property on Tuesday morning to execute a search warrant. 

Police fired at the suspect but apparently did not wound him, they said.

 The shootout resulted in the deaths of 59-year-old detective Neal Thompson and 35-year-old senior constable Vadim De Waart.

 Police say the wounded officer has undergone surgery and is expected to recover.

 Australia's The Age newspaper said Freeman was a self-professed "sovereign citizen," referring to a movement whose adherents falsely believe they are not subject to laws passed by the government.

 Police have not commented on those reports.

 While fighting a speeding penalty in a Melbourne court last year, Freeman referred to police as "frigging Nazis," "Gestapo," and "terrorist thugs," according to a copy of the judge's ruling.  Freeman told the court that "even the sight of a cop or a cop car… it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier," according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Deadly shootings are relatively rare in Australia, and police fatalities even rarer. The latest deaths listed in a national memorial to fallen police showed three officers were killed on duty in separate incidents in 2023, including one by gunshot.

 In December 2022, four police arrived at a tree-lined property near small Queensland town of Wieambilla and came under fire from the family living there.

 Six people were killed in that incident, including two police officers. Police later blamed the family's fundamentalist Christian beliefs for what was termed a terrorist attack.

 A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place in Australia since a 1996 mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people. 

Then-newly-elected Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative and close friend of George W. Bush, pushed through the sweeping gun control legislation just 12 days after the shooting.

"The hardest things to do in politics often involve taking away rights and privileges from your own supporters," Howard CBS News' Seth Doane in a 2022 interview, looking back at the landmark legislation.

The new laws banned the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forced people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy a firearm; and — perhaps most significantly — called for a massive, mandatory gun-buyback. Australia's government confiscated and destroyed close to 700,000 firearms, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.

"People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'" Howard recalled. "And I'd tell them: 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder?'"

ByAgustino Fontevecchia,

Contributor.

Every week that passes, a new scandal emerges. It must be the heat of the campaign. One of the latest "victims" is the controversial Justice Minister, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, who appeared on a hidden camera offering his influence to Tim Ballard, another contentious character. Ballard, a former Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security's Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce has led multiple anti-child trafficking NGOs over the years, some of which he's been expelled from accused of sexual misconduct and irregular donation procurement. He denies the accusations.

In the leaked video, Minister Cúneo Libarona tells Ballard that after watching the film "Sound of Freedom," where Hollywood star Jim Caviezel plays Ballard embarking on a dangerous mission to the Colombian jungle to rescue captive children, he was inspired to write a legal project that he wishes to send to Congress. He invites Ballard to read it and then offers him access to media outlets, journalists, and even judges and ministers to "tell your story and the issues." He goes on to tell Ballard he will help him "clear up that misunderstanding that occurred in our country."

It wasn't immediately clear what misunderstanding Cúneo Libarona was speaking of, but Ballard's name became a feature in mainstream Argentine media earlier this year when television gossip star Viviana Canosa promised to come out with serious accusations of sexual abuse and even pedophilia against several colleagues including Florencia Peña and Lizy Tagliani. Canosa's accusations sparked a media scandal and multiple legal proceedings, many against Canosa herself. She indicated that Ballard had given her information about child-trafficking, forcing the former Special Agent to admit having meeting her, but denying they ever spoke about these issues.

The opposition has called for Minister Cúneo Libaron's head, indicating he is colluding with a foreigner who is also an interested party in passing purported legislation, adding that he is an interested party. Even within the ranks of the Javier Milei administration, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has called Ballard a fraudster with multiple accusations against him. Why would someone with the political backing of President Milei and the power of a Security Minister agree to a meeting with Ballard, and then go on to incriminate himself so directly? Who filmed him? And why was the video leaked?

One of the connective threads behind the multiple scandals faced by Milei and his top officials is CPAC, the conservative think tank that counts with the Argentine President and Donald Trump as some of its highest-profile members. According to Perfil's Giselle Leclerq, the former Special Agent was part of the CPAC summit held in February where both Milei and Trump were in attendance. National deputy Esteban Paulón says that Ballard was introduced to Milei by Laura Belén Arrieta, the infamous single passenger of the private jet owned by Leondro Scatturice who entered the country with ten pieces of undeclared luggage. Arrieta, one of the organizers of CPAC's Latin American chapter, is employed by Scatturice, who has close ties with Argentina's intelligence agencies and Santiago Caputo, the controversial political aide to President Milei who runs Cúneo Libarona's Ministry through his deputy, Sebastián Amerio. Everything is connected, it seems.

Back to Bullard, his anti-child trafficking work crossed paths with the wild conspiracy theories associated with QAnon, which has a solid belief base among the ranks of the right wing-conservative MAGA movement, as Leclerq noted. The belief that a cabal of sex-traffickers and pedophiles led by prominent Democrats and Hollywood stars has led the QAnon world to "invade" the digital campaigning of the traditional NGOs in the space, as the New York Times reported, which also interviewed Ballard who noted the increased awareness was an opportunity. The idea that the QAnon cult can stop human-trafficking has led to dangerous situations such as the hostage showdown at Comet Ping Pong, where a radicalized person walked into the restaurant armed with an AR-15 style assault rifle in order to investigate the "pizzagate" conspiracy.

In Argentina, there was the troubling disappearance of five-year-old Loan Peña in Corrientes province. As the investigation was underway a man who claimed to be a member of multiple US security agencies and who was known as "the American" was arrested after trying to get involved with the case. His real name is Nicolás Gabriel Soria and he said he had worked with Ballard, something the latter denied. As Leclerq reported, a lawyer for two of Bullard's sexual abuse accusers noted that Soria had been brainwashed to believe he was helping to battle in the front lines of the battle against child-trafficking by Aerial Recovery, one of the NGOs Ballard worked with. He was part of a program aimed at helping war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who received some basic training and then become "loyal mercenaries sent to 'work' across the globe." Soria "got involved in the case thinking he was a child trafficking expert because he was given some sort of certification and he truly believes the whole [QAnon]



Rodrigo Tripolone, the attorney, suggests that Ballard has a fraudulent modus operandi: in order to feed his image as a "pedophile hunter" he presents himself as an expert, cozies up to local authorities, and then tags along in domestic police operations to gain credibility. Many of these types of images can be seen on his social media.

For whatever it's worth, Ballard's video with Minister Cúneo Libarona adds another spot to the tiger. The MAGA world appears to have easy access to Milei and his cabinet through CPAC, allowing Ballard to sit with the Justice Minister to attempt to clear his name, or 10 bags to get smuggled into the country without proper investigation on Scatturice's airplane, by his employee. A recent investigation showed that Scatturice's technology firm, OCP Tech, received a $78-million government contract for maintaining Wi-Fi connections in schools. Along the same lines, B class characters like Hayden Mark Davis, Julian Peh, along with local connections Mauricio Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy got President Milei to participate in a meme coin rugpull scam that is now under investigation by the US judiciary. Furthermore, Karina Milei's political task force, a company named Tech Security, owned by the family of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Martín Menem and advisor Eduardo "Lule" Menem, received a contract worth four billion pesos from government-owned Banco Nación. And now, the Spagnuolo scandal in the ANDIS agency for the handicapped.

The smear campaign is in full force. Several weeks ago there was a purge of the Buenos Aires Province police force accused of campaigning on behalf of Maximiliano Bondarenko, libertarian candidate in the third electoral section that is a historical bastion of Peronism. Together, all of these and other "operations" or coordinated information leaks destined to harm political opponents indicate that the traditional method of doing politics in Argentina is alive and well, and it includes illegal espionage. This doesn't mean those on the receiving-end are innocent, quite the contrary in many cases. Expect the freakshow to continue.

A new report from a crowdsourced UFO-sighting app found that among the hundreds of reports of unidentified metallic orbs between 2022 and 2025, the majority were spotted in the dead of night near military installations in California, New York and Arizona.

Enigma, which allows users to report their own UFO sightings, logged more than 8,000 reports in the U.S. between Dec. 2022 and June 2025, according to the report. Of these, 422 described the presence of a metallic orb, the majority of which were observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military bases.

Investigating such mysterious flying objects is the work of the Pentagon's All-doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which logged 757 cases between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the office's annual report. Twenty-one of these cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Of the 422 metallic orbs reportedly spotted by Enigma users, 360 of them were seen near military bases such as Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base in California.

"While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma," the report said. "Often spotted at high altitudes near sensitive infrastructure, these orbs are described as hovering silently or darting across the sky at seemingly impossible speeds."



"Consistently seen across the globe, the orbs typically lack visible propulsion systems or control surfaces."

"What makes these orbs especially compelling isn't just how often they appear, but where and how they operate. They are frequently observed in restricted airspace, near nuclear facilities, and have even been tracked on radar or captured by high-resolution infrared systems," the report added.

According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. The 24-second video was taken by an MQ-9, an unmanned aerial vehicle, though it was determined to be a "typical" unresolved UAP.

"While AARO assesses the object in the clip is not exhibiting anomalous behavior, the object remains unidentified," the AARO report said.

Of the hundreds of reports of metallic orbs, 43% mentioned the appearance of light and 40% said the object flew very low, according to Enigma. Another 35% said the object flew rapidly, fast or quick, and 38% reported the object was hovering.

A common theory about the metallic orbs paints them as surveillance devices, whether deployed by terrestrial governments or by "non-human intelligences," the Enigma report said.

"Some skeptics argue metallic orbs may be misunderstood weather balloons, optical illusions, or rare atmospheric conditions (like ball lightning)," the report admits. "And others maintain that they are a psychological manifestation, projected by the human mind during altered states or high-stress moments."

"Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown."

According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. The 24-second video was taken by an MQ-9, an unmanned aerial vehicle, though it was determined to be a "typical" unresolved UAP.

"While AARO assesses the object in the clip is not exhibiting anomalous behavior, the object remains unidentified," the AARO report said.

Of the hundreds of reports of metallic orbs, 43% mentioned the appearance of light and 40% said the object flew very low, according to Enigma. Another 35% said the object flew rapidly, fast or quick, and 38% reported the object was hovering.

A common theory about the metallic orbs paints them as surveillance devices, whether deployed by terrestrial governments or by "non-human intelligences," the Enigma report said.

"Some skeptics argue metallic orbs may be misunderstood weather balloons, optical illusions, or rare atmospheric conditions (like ball lightning)," the report admits. "And others maintain that they are a psychological manifestation, projected by the human mind during altered states or high-stress moments."

"Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown."

A new report from a crowdsourced UFO-sighting app found that among the hundreds of reports of unidentified metallic orbs between 2022 and 2025, the majority were spotted in the dead of night near military installations in California, New York and Arizona.

Enigma, which allows users to report their own UFO sightings, logged more than 8,000 reports in the U.S. between Dec. 2022 and June 2025, according to the report. Of these, 422 described the presence of a metallic orb, the majority of which were observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military bases.

Investigating such mysterious flying objects is the work of the Pentagon's All-doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which logged 757 cases between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the office's annual report. Twenty-one of these cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Of the 422 metallic orbs reportedly spotted by Enigma users, 360 of them were seen near military bases such as Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base in California.

"While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma," the report said. "Often spotted at high altitudes near sensitive infrastructure, these orbs are described as hovering silently or darting across the sky at seemingly impossible speeds."



"Consistently seen across the globe, the orbs typically lack visible propulsion systems or control surfaces."

"What makes these orbs especially compelling isn't just how often they appear, but where and how they operate. They are frequently observed in restricted airspace, near nuclear facilities, and have even been tracked on radar or captured by high-resolution infrared systems," the report added.

According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. The 24-second video was taken by an MQ-9, an unmanned aerial vehicle, though it was determined to be a "typical" unresolved UAP.

"While AARO assesses the object in the clip is not exhibiting anomalous behavior, the object remains unidentified," the AARO report said.

A 19-year-old Chinese man barely survived the worst four months of his life after being seduced and then sold into slavery by his 17-year-old girlfriend.

Chinese media recently reported the shocking case of a young man from Zhanjiang, in China's Guangdong province, who endured four months of captivity and torture at the hands of a scam ring in Myanmar, after being lured into a trap by his teenage girlfriend. The victim's sister claims the two met at a local pool hall where the 17-year-old girl hung out in revealing outfits and wore counterfeit designer handbags to project an aura of wealth. Her brother was instantly drawn to her and hung on her every word when she bragged about her family's operations in Southern Asia, even though she never offered any proof. She repeatedly tried to convince the 19-year-old to travel with her to the neighboring country for lucrative work opportunities, and eventually, he accepted, despite his family's opposition.

 In February of this year, the pair secretly traveled to Thailand, with his family learning about his whereabouts from his friends. On their way back, while approaching the Thailand-Myanmar border, the 17-year-old girl made up a story about having to pick someone up close by and simply abandoned her boyfriend in the middle of nowhere. Shortly after, a group of armed men approched him, took all his documents and his mobile phone before taking him to a secret compund.

“My brother told me people with guns had taken him away,” the teen's sister recalled, adding that this was all he was able to text her before his phone was taken away.

The 19-year-old Chinese man was taken to a secluded camp, his head was shaved, and he was forced to sit in front of a computer for 16 – 20 hours a day, carrying out scams against his fellow countrymen. If he failed to reach his daily quotas or if his efforts didn't bear fruit, the young man faced severe physical punishment, including being hit with metal rods over his back and head.

During his captivity, the 19-year-old victim lost over 10 kilograms due to food deprivation, and due to the repeated beatings, he suffered permanent hearing loss. However, because he turned out to be extremely bad at scamming people, his captors decided he wasn't going to make them any money that way, so they decided to contact his family and ask for a ransom.

In June of 2025, the teen's family managed to raise the 350,000 yuan ($49,000) ransom and secured his release. However, the rescued teenager lives in constant anxiety and fear of being abducted and tortured again. He has nightmares about his four months in captivity and has developed paranoia.

As for his treacherous girlfriend, she was arrested after returning to China following a ten-day vacation in Thailand and now faces charges for her involvement in the victim's abduction by the Myanmar scam ring.

“She's only 17 years old. Who would have thought she could do something so evil?” the victim's sister told reporters. “It's unbelievable that she's capable of such despicable acts at such a young age.”

Home - News - Supernatural creator reveals canceled Sam and Dean plot that "could have changed everything"

Kateryna Danshyna

News editor

Exactly 20 years have passed since Supernatural debuted on the air, and fans have seen 15 (!) exciting seasons and a generally satisfying finale. However, few people know that showrunner Andrew Dabba planned a completely different story for the last episodes.

One of the ideas was that the Winchester brothers would make their knowledge of the supernatural universe public.

“One storyline we talked about for a long time was that Sam and Dean would go public. They said: “We're making a public service announcement that monsters are real. If you see something strange in your city, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We are just going to spread the word.”

In the end, this plan was abandoned because it would have forced Supernatural to go in a completely different and “weird” direction. Dubb clarifies that the brothers' publicity would have been “logistically challenging for the show.”

“All of a sudden Sam and Dean became world famous, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but in reality, I think it would have ruined the show. It wouldn't have been a good thing, and that's one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

Among other canceled ideas for the show: the return of the Antichrist, played by Gattlin Griffith, in a “different form.” The character, also called Jesse Turner, was introduced in season 5, where Castiel (Misha Collins) predicted that he was destined to help Lucifer in the war against Heaven. Initially, Jesse had no idea who he was until Sam and Dean revealed the truth to him, prompting the character to go into hiding, and his whereabouts remained unknown even after the series ended.

The last episode of Supernatural aired on November 19, 2020. Now, 5 years after the show's end, the trio of main actors has a chance to reunite in another project. In February, the official page of the show published a video with Jensen Ackles gathering his colleagues Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins to appear in the fifth season of the Amazon series — all of them are rumored to appear in the same scene.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

  The entire first season of Charmed existed before I was even born, and it finished airing as I was learning how to add and subtract. Yet, I've still been infatuated with the witchy TV series for as long as I can remember.



  For those out of the loop, Charmed is an eight-season supernatural drama that ran from 1998 to 2006, following the lives of the Halliwell sisters, a trio of witches known as the Charmed Ones who are prophesied to be the greatest force of good to ever live. Like similar paranormal shows — Supernatural, Lost Girl, Grimm — the sisters fight a new baddie in each episode, which generally leads to season finale clashes with increasingly powerful forces of evil. Unlike those shows though, Charmed at its core isn't about fighting the forces of evil, but championing the goodness of love in all of its mundane and magical forms.



  As I come off my sixth re-watch of the series, (that's more than 800 hours), I've realized that it's become a comfort in some of my hardest times. Between its fully fleshed-out characters and interesting villains, seasons consisting of 20 or more hourlong episodes, and behind-the-scenes drama that encapsulates early 2000s pop culture, Charmed is like a long, warm hug to me.



  Honestly, I think it's the best TV show ever made. (The 2018 reboot, with all of its innovative and unique additions, doesn't hold a candle to the original.)



Charmed finds strength as a series in its characters. Rather than a group of one-dimensional witches focused solely on the craft, creator Constance M. Burge gives each of the sisters their own hopes and dreams beyond their duties as the Charmed Ones.



  The oldest sister is Prue (Shannen Doherty), who has the power of telekinesis. She's regarded as the strongest and is rigid in that eldest sibling kind of way (there's an entire episode where her sisters try to get Prue to say "I love you" to them). When we meet her she's an arts appraiser at the Buckland Auction House, but as she realizes she wants to create art herself, she takes a job as a photographer at a magazine.



  Then there's Piper (Holly Marie Combs), the middle sister with the power to freeze time. In the beginning she's working as a restaurant manager, but right when Season 2 starts, she opens her own nightclub, P3. Though it's an indication of Piper's character growth, it's also a clever way to add killer musical acts such as The Cranberries, Dishwalla, Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Navarro, to name a few, to the show.



  Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) is the youngest sister and the most rebellious. She's often fighting with Prue over the past. However, Phoebe's power of premonition and later, her skills as an empath, quickly adds a level of maturity to her character. By the final few seasons, Phoebe is the premiere advice columnist in all of San Francisco.



  After Prue abruptly and unceremoniously dies in the Season 3 finale — in 2023, Doherty finally confirmed that she left the show due to drama between her and Milano on set — we meet the fourth Halliwell sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Paige is their half-sister on their mom's side, and she inherits Prue's power of telekinesis. Her addition effectively changes the sisters' dynamic, which makes the show feel refreshed as it enters its fourth season.



  Beyond the main characters, their love interests are often compelling additions to the story. We meet Leo (Brian Krause), the Charmed Ones' whitelighter, or guardian angel, early on in the series. While posing as the sisters' handyman, he and Piper begin to fall for each other. Phoebe's first love interest, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), turns out to be a half-demon who wants to turn her evil. He sticks around far longer than he should, but he's just a joy to hate.



  And unlike some shows that absolutely fumble at the end (looking at you, Game of Thrones), the show's final season wraps everything up in this perfect little bow. Piper and Leo grow old together, Phoebe literally falls in love with love (his name is Coop and he's a cupid), and Paige finds her own destiny somewhere between her calling as a witch and a whitelighter. ♦

People have seen the largest number of metallic orbs over military installations in the US. Even military personnel have reported seeing them. Most of them appeared between 1 and 4 am. They hover for some time and then dash away within seconds. Pentagon officials are scratching their heads.

Metallic orb-like unidentified flying objects have swarmed the skies over military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. People have reported seeing thousands of mysterious things that can't be explained in the past two and a half years. Of the 8,000 sightings, 422 of them were metallic orbs, according to the crowdsourced platform Enigma. The majority of them were seen between 1 and 4 am, and almost all of them were hovering over a site linked to the US military. This has once again ignited rumours about these places hiding something, a secret being kept from not just Americans, but the entire world. What strengthens the argument that these objects could have been from another world is that even military personnel said they saw them. Civilians and pilots also said they saw UFOs. Enigma data shows that 360 metallic orbs were seen within a few miles of military bases in the US. In three of these cases, the orbs were seen multiple times within a distance of five miles from Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base.

The description of what these orbs do is also almost similar - they hover silently over an area, and then bolt at extreme speeds without leaving any smoke or ice trail. A lot of these sightings are accompanied by videos. One person saw two liquid metallic orbs in Brooklyn's Fort Hamilton in June 2024 for a full two minutes. In Los Angeles, a metallic orb appeared after several planes flying in a formation flew by. This has piled up a lot of work for the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which was made to find explanations for these sightings. While it dismissed most of them as either birds or planes, several of them still remain unresolved. AARO's annual report mentions that 757 UFOs were seen between May 2023 and June 2024, and 21 cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Eyewitnesses reported the maximum number of orbs in Texas and Florida. Government officials believe that they could be advanced drones that can dash from a place within seconds, an NYT report stated. Meanwhile, some even think that they could be surveillance devices sent by Russia and China. UFO sightings have been reported not only in the US but also in many other parts of the world. The Buga Sphere, which was captured from Colombia, has been generating a lot of buzz. Researchers say that it has wires inside it and has even grown in weight since being caught. It is even said that it dried up all the grass in the place it fell. A video clip on X even suggests that it is responding to Sanskrit shlokas and chants.
