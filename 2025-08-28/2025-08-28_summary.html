            After a grand jury failed to return a felony indictment against the Washington, DC, man accused of throwing a sub-style sandwich at a law enforcement officer in the first days of Trump's federal takeover of the city, federal prosecutors on Thursday filed a lesser misdemeanor charge.
    


            Prosecutors filed the charges Thursday, two weeks after the initial complaint was filed against the man, Sean Charles Dunn, a former Justice Department attorney who was fired immediately following his arrest.
    


            Dunn, prosecutors have alleged, threw a sub-style sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer one evening in early August, calling them “fascists” and yelling and cursing at the officers gathered.
    


            His attorney declined to comment on the charge.
    


            The office of US Attorney Jeanine Pirro did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
    


            Previously, the Justice Department said in court it was charging Dunn with a felony assault charge but, after a grand jury declined to hand up an indictment in the case, have now filed a lesser misdemeanor charge, cutting the maximum sentence from 8 years in jail to 1 year.
    


            Since prosecutors filed the charges by information – instead of by complaint as they previously did – they can skirt around using a grand jury and instead go right to the judge, who would need to decide whether there is probable cause and the case can proceed.
    


            Dunn has not entered a plea, and his case has been passed to a federal judge in DC, who will preside over the case.
    


            Dunn was arrested on August 10, right after he allegedly threw the sandwich. He was then released the next morning, his attorney said in court earlier this month, and attempted to get an attorney to turn himself in when he learned of a warrant for his arrest.
    


            Instead, 20 officers came to Dunn's apartment and arrested him there, his attorney told the magistrate judge initially in charge of the case.
    


            Her assertions would later be proven when the White House posted a propaganda film of decked-out deputy US Marshals and other law enforcement, including FBI agents, showing up at Dunn's door with guns drawn and a riot shield deployed to arrest him.
    


            At the time of Dunn's arrest, Pirro celebrated in a video shared on X, “We're going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.”
    


            The magistrate judge released Dunn, finding that he did not pose a threat to the community.

            A meeting of the Mexican Senate descended into violence Wednesday, after one of its members apparently became enraged at not getting a chance to speak.
    


            The scuffle broke out between two high-ranking senators toward the end of a session that had included a heated debate on the possibility of US military intervention in the country.
    


            As the national anthem was playing, the aggrieved senator, Alejandro Moreno – president of the opposition party PRI – stepped up to the podium and grabbed the arm of Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña, of the ruling Morena party, and a shoving match ensued.
    


            Others nearby then stepped in. A live broadcast of the exchange shows one man in a suit appearing to take a swing at Noroña, while Moreno pushes a different man in a green shirt to the ground.
    


            Noroña later identified the man in the green shirt as a member of his team. The man appeared alongside Noroña at a press conference, wearing a neck brace and bandages around his arm.
    


            Moreno said on social media that he had confronted Noroña because the ruling party had changed the agenda of the session to prevent the opposition from speaking out.
    


            “That cowardice provoked what followed. Let it be clear: the first physical aggression came from Noroña,” he said, claiming the Senate president started the altercation by shoving him.
    


            For his part, Noroña insisted the opposition senators were to blame. “They ganged up on me. They will say that this is freedom of expression,” he said.
    


            He said that during the session they had debated topics including US military intervention, which he had accused opposition parties of supporting.
    


            He also said he intended to file a complaint against Moreno, claiming Moreno had threatened to kill him. He also said he would seek the expulsion of Moreno and other opposition members involved in the altercation.
    


            CNN has reached out to Moreno for comment.
    


            Violence in Mexico's Congress is rare but not unheard of.
    


            In 2006, a brawl erupted between lawmakers ahead of the inauguration of President Felipe Calderon after a disputed election.

            As a teenager, Robin Westman claimed to have been suspended after discussing school shootings with classmates – later writing in a journal that the incident was the origin of a deep obsession with mass shooters.
    


            A decade later, Westman returned to Annunciation Catholic School and carried out those dark fantasies, killing two children at a Mass on Wednesday morning and injuring 18  other people.
    


            As Minneapolis reels from the shooting, officials are combing through Westman's rambling writings – which the shooter shared in YouTube videos timed to go online around the same time as the attack – to search for a motive.
    


            A CNN review of dozens of those pages – most written in Cyrillic letters to mask the disturbing content – raises questions about whether people in Westman's life missed warning signs that could have prevented Westman from purchasing the array of firearms used in the killings.
    


            Even as Westman carefully plotted out the attack, writing as recently as last week about visiting the church, diagramming the interior and testing out weapons, the shooter also hinted at a desire to be caught. After describing a family member who had remarked on “dark energy” surrounding Westman, the shooter wrote: “FIND ME I AM BEGGING FOR HELP, I AM SCREAMING FOR HELP.”
    


            Authorities confirmed to CNN on Thursday that Westman had recently visited Annunciation's church, pretending to be interested in reconnecting with the Catholic faith. In the journal, Westman describes looking at door handles, calculating how to best lock victims inside, and noting where teachers were located.
    


            While police have described the writings as a “manifesto,” CNN's review found that the hand-written entries are less a coherent statement of purpose or political declaration and more a jumbled, stream-of-consciousness window into the shooter's troubled state of mind.
    


            “This is not a church or religion attack, that is not the message,” Westman wrote. “The message is there is no message.”
    


            The journal entries provide a disturbing and extensive look at Westman's private thoughts. The shooter described working to avoid detection, writing the entries in Cyrillic script as a “cypher” in case someone found the notebook.
    


            “I really just want a place to put my thoughts,” Westman explained. “I can't talk to a therapist or family cause I will immediately be reported and put on a watchlist!”
    


            Westman had suffered from depression and faced suicidal and homicidal thoughts for years, according to the journal.
    


            “I have a loving family and a good support system of people that want to see me thrive,” Westman wrote. “For some reason, the fact that I have a pretty good life and the fact that I want kill people have never correlated to me.”
    


            “Every school I went to, I have some fantasy at some point or another of shooting up my school,” Westman added. “Even every job.”
    


            That started with the incident in seventh grade, Westman wrote. It's unclear what school Westman attended at the time – one former classmate told local news station KSTP   that the future shooter attended seventh   grade at a school in Saint Paul, and recalled disturbing behavior, including Westman praising Hitler.



            At the time, according to a journal entry, Westman asked a girl, “if there was a school shooting, where would you hide?” But after the student told adults, Westman was suspended from school for a week, the journal says.
    


            “I basically promised I didn't mean anything,” Westman wrote, adding, “I don't remember ever talking to a therapist.”
    


            Four classmates who attended Annunciation Catholic School with Westman in eighth grade told CNN that they didn't remember the future shooter saying anything violent or having any disciplinary problems at that time. Westman would have attended Wednesday Mass with other students at the school, they said.
    


            Westman was “different” for an eighth grader, former classmate Mason Wille said, “but I didn't think anything of it,” adding that Westman seemed to get along with everybody.
    


            Hearing the news that Westman was suspected as the Annunciation shooter was a shock, Wille said. “I would have never seen this coming.”
    


            Nathan Bergstrom, another former classmate, said he vaguely remembered Westman “would get mad sometimes, maybe more angry than a normal student would,” but no major incidents. At the time, Westman stuck out for often wearing Heelys – shoes with a wheel on the bottom – Bergstrom said.
    


            A fifth former classmate, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation,   said she did remember Annunciation taking disciplinary action against Westman at one point, but she did not know details about what happened.
    


            “There was some drama around it,” she said. “The students and parents never really found out what it was.”
    


            Several former classmates remembered Westman frequently carrying around a notebook – and one of the former students said she recognized Westman's handwriting in the videos posted online.
    


            After graduating from Annunciation's grade school in 2017, Westman attended at least two Minneapolis high schools, including an all-boys private military-style prep school. It's unclear if Westman graduated from any high school.
    


            In 2019, Westman's mother filed to legally change the shooter's name from Robert Paul Westman to Robin M. Westman, court documents show. A judge who approved the petition in January 2020 wrote that Westman “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”
    


            Westman had no past criminal record, according to police and court records.
    


            The journal includes discussions of other mass shooters, and dark fantasies about Westman reveling in killing children and following in the footsteps of murderers like Adam Lanza, who gunned down 26 people – including 20 children – at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012.
    


            The entries are also full of racist and antisemitic slurs and sentiments.
    


            Earlier this year, even while indulging in fantasies about mass violence, Westman described deciding not to carry out an attack to spare family members the pain. But that changed in recent months. In a more recent entry, Westman wrote, “I don't want to f**king   do this I hate myself. I cannot turn back. I cannot stop myself.”
    


            Westman zeroed in on Annunciation – and specifically the all-school mass on Wednesday – after finding an online school schedule, the journal shows. The next month, Westman described making a trial run by going to Mass in the morning and testing doors.
    


            At one point, Westman expressed surprise that family members didn't expect the coming violence.
    


            “I feel like my mom would have seen it coming due to my rocky past with violent threats,” the journal states. “The other day my stepmom… said she could feel a ‘dark energy' around me… if only you know!”
    


            Westman's family have not responded to requests for comment from CNN.
    


            Police are still investigating where Westman obtained the guns used in the attack, which authorities said included a rifle, a handgun and a shotgun. One of the YouTube videos posted the day of the attack showed antisemitic and racist slurs painted on an array of weapons.
    


            In the journal, Westman mentions a plan to try to buy a rifle from an acquaintance, and also opines on how it “should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks.”
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a press conference Thursday that authorities are not aware of Westman having any prior mental health diagnosis or mental health commitments, which could have prevented Westman from purchasing firearms.



            The journal entries continued up to just days before the shooting. In one entry dated last week, Westman wrote about plans to go to a shooting range, and described visiting Annunciation to “scout one last time.”
    


            Pages later, Westman scrawled a diagram of the inside of the church – with pews, windows and aisles clearly marked – before stabbing the drawing on camera with a knife.
    


            “Went to church this morning,” Westman wrote, adding that the teachers “will not be expecting an attack in the very first week of school.”

Diageo's Amherstburg facility, which bottles Crown Royal products, will close in February.Sean Vokey/The Canadian Press

Spirits maker Diageo DEO-N will cease operations at its bottling facility in Amherstburg, Ont., early next year, as it shifts some bottling volume to the U.S., the company announced on Thursday.

The facility, which bottles Crown Royal products, will close in February in a move aimed at improving its North American supply chain.

About 200 jobs will be affected. 

“This was a difficult decision, but one that is crucial to improving the efficiency and resiliency of our supply chain network,” Marsha McIntosh, Diageo's president of North America supply, said in a statement. 

Diageo said it will engage with the community and find ways to support its employees through the transition, and work alongside Unifor to assist unionized workers.

The company said it will still maintain a “significant” footprint in Canada – including its headquarters and warehouse operations in the Greater Toronto Area, and bottling and distillation facilities in Manitoba and Quebec.

McIntosh added the company's Crown Royal products will continue to be mashed, distilled and aged at its Canadian facilities.

A Ukrainian American DSA politician shares eyewitness thoughts on efforts to build solidarity with the Ukrainian left.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Wednesday night, Russia staged its largest attack on Ukraine since President Donald Trump started the so-called peace process. Moscow launched 598 drones and 31 missiles on targets in Ukraine. Most of them were shot down, but many others still evaded Ukraine's air defense systems, hitting over 20 locations in the capital, Kyiv, and severely damaging a building next to the European Union mission.

That came on the heels of a Russian missile strike on a U.S.-run factory in the country. Thus, despite the recent two summits that Trump called to reach a peace deal, Russia is in fact escalating its war on Ukraine. 

In Alaska, Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an arrest warrant on his head from the International Criminal Court. In Washington, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy along with several European heads of state. Trump has promised to orchestrate another meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, something that now seems highly unlikely, as Ukraine opposes the imperialist conditions Russia expects from any settlement — annexation of land and a veto for Moscow on any security guarantees against future Russian attacks.

Trump wanted to cut a deal with Putin for the partition of Ukraine. He hoped that would ensure U.S. corporations opportunities to plunder Ukraine's mineral reserves and profit from the neoliberal reconstruction of the country. Likely above all he wanted a settlement so that he could turn Washington's attention to its main imperial rival, China. 

Trump and Putin planned to bully Zelenskyy into accepting “land swaps,” essentially agreeing to Russia's illegal conquest of a whole swathe of Ukraine in return for peace. But the Ukrainian President is legally barred by the country's constitution from surrendering sovereign land. 

Moreover, 70 percent of Ukrainians oppose any such land for peace deal. They know such a compromise would likely doom people under occupation to brutal oppression and that Putin will at best pause his war only to start it again to achieve his stated goal of subordinating Ukraine in Russia's imperialist sphere of influence. 

During this charade of a peace process, Putin actually escalated the war with increased missile strikes and drone attacks with the aim of annexing more land. In the midst of Putin's escalation, Vermont State Senator Tanya Vyhovsky was in Ukraine on a speaking tour to build solidarity with the country's progressive movement. 

Vyhovsky is a Ukrainian American, clinical social worker, and a member of Vermont's Progressive Party and the Democratic Socialists of America. In this exclusive interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity and concision, she speaks with Truthout about conditions in Ukraine, its progressive forces, and why the U.S. left should rally to support the country's struggle for self-determination. 

Ashley Smith: You were in Ukraine on a speaking tour to build solidarity with the Ukrainian resistance to Russia's invasion and occupation of the country. What were conditions like? 

Tanya Vyhovsky: I met with the broad progressive movement, including unions, political parties, leftist NGOs, and student unions. It was a powerful experience to connect to the people fighting for real leftist social change in Ukraine amid a full-scale invasion. 

The war's impact really depends on where you are in the country. In the capital, Kyiv, I saw many buildings that had been bombed — apartment buildings, factories, and small businesses. These were generally outside of the city center. But it's not as bad as in other cities. The indirect impact of the war, though, is everywhere. 

For example, you can't visit the parliament, the Rada, because it is protected by razor wire and military patrols in order to keep the government safe and functioning. All the cities' fountains have been turned off to save money. All the statues are sandbagged and wrapped, and in certain districts, the lower windows are sandbags. So, at first glance, Kyiv may not seem like a war zone, but if you look just beneath the surface, you see the signs of the war. 

In Kryvyi Rih, which is closer to the front line, the war is in your face. The Russian forces bombed one of the city's parks in April. There is a memorial there for the 19 people, including nine children, who were killed when the Russian military targeted the park with cluster munitions. I couldn't stay in the city's hotels because they have been bombed by Russia. Schools have been relocated to bomb shelters.

Dnipro was functioning much as usual, except that the windows all have sandbags and there are above-ground bomb shelters on nearly every corner. Three hours after I left the city, they suffered multiple ballistic missile attacks. 

In Lviv, it feels for the most part like there isn't a war. The statues are netted, people casually mention a church statue whose head fell off during a bombing, and there were occasional air raid sirens. But the curfew is very loosely adhered to. When I was there, there hadn't been a Russian attack in six weeks. But the day after I left, there was a massive missile attack that killed people. So, despite differences, everywhere I felt like I was in a country under siege. 

I spoke to many soldiers about what it's been like for the past nearly four years. People say they're tired but not broken and that they are not willing to give up. The vast majority of Ukrainians — from citizens to soldiers — oppose Trump's attempt to cut a deal with Putin for the partition of their country. If that deal were struck, many service members told me there would have been a revolt among the troops. 

While I was not able to go to cities on the front, I did speak to a lot of people particularly in Lviv that had been internally displaced from Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and Kherson. They've had to try and rebuild their lives in Lviv and other cities where they've found refuge. They described the horrors of living under constant bombardment, especially for their kids, and felt like they had no choice but to flee. 

These internally displaced people have put a strain on housing and the cost of living in the cities where they resettled. But everyone I spoke with said it was the duty of all Ukrainians to ensure that internally displaced people are welcomed, cared for, and protected. 

While you were in Ukraine, President Trump held his two summits, first in Alaska and then in Washington. What were the various responses to these summits from Ukrainians? 

While I was there, I watched all the coverage of Trump's summit in Alaska with Putin. Because of my travel dates, I was only able to watch parts of Zelenskyy's summit in D.C. Frankly, neither I nor any Ukrainian I spoke with think that Putin or Trump are looking for peace. The plan they're putting forward is unacceptable on its face. 

A lot of Ukrainians did not watch the summit and did not expect it to yield any results. Russia is making demands that Ukraine can in no way agree to. It is demanding that Ukraine give up sovereignty and accept occupation. Trump has positioned the U.S. as a middleman but with clear sympathies with Russia. The Ukrainians rightfully demand sovereignty and the return of all their land. So, with such diametrically opposed positions, it's hard for Ukrainians to take this so-called peace process seriously. 

Ukrainians often asked my advice on what Ukraine should do. That's a question that I have no right to answer. Here in the U.S., I don't face air raids, fighting on the front, and occupation. Only Ukrainians can decide what to do. But I can say, based on Ukraine's history and the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and globally, that if Ukraine accepts a “deal” that includes occupation and further annexation of land, it will not end this war and lead to lasting peace. 

Such a deal will simply pause Russian aggression until Putin has time to regroup and come back for more Ukrainian land. This is, of course, what happened after Russia's first invasion in 2014. Putin took Crimea and sections of Donbas, bided his time, cut a deal, and then launched the war again in 2022. 

Any deal will banish people in annexed areas to brutal Russian oppression. Currently, Ukrainians suffer terrible oppression under occupation. They certainly have not found peace and safety. The stories from Crimea are horrific. I really worry that an occupation will lead to full-scale genocide as it has in Palestine after 75 years of occupation. 

Finally, I worry about the implications for democracy and sovereignty if Putin's aggression is rewarded.

People in the U.S. know little about Ukraine's progressive forces. What kinds of groups did you meet with? What were their main struggles, and how do they combine those with support for the liberation struggle?

There is a surprisingly vibrant and diverse progressive movement. I met with the federated unions, which are run by the state, as well as with the independent trade unions, which are much more politically active. I talked with members of the student unions (both federated and independent). I visited NGOs that are doing a variety of different work supporting civil society, supporting the armed forces, and supporting veterans.

I also met with a new grassroots political party, as well as with leaders of the feminist movement, young LGBTQ activists, and small groups of volunteers making food and mats for the military. They are all organizing around their issues and demands. They all voiced demands for better working conditions, higher wages, fair taxation, and expanded rights and access to reproductive health care, as well as for a more representative government. These are the same challenges we as working people face in the United States. 

But, astonishingly, Ukraine is not as neoliberalized as the U.S. 

Ukrainians have universal health care, strong public schools, and affordable if not always free university education. They are actually concerned that the West will condition its support for Ukraine with a pledge to enact a neoliberal reconstruction of the country with the usual requirements of privatization, deregulation, and austerity. 

The Ukrainian left was critical of the status quo and critical of the government. But they know that their fight for expanded democratic rights and better social programs, wages and benefits cannot be separated from the struggle to defend the country. In fact, they contend that the more those issues are addressed, the more united the country will be in fighting to preserve its independence. 

Recently, Zelensky passed a bill that undermined the independence of the government's anti-corruption agency. But after popular protest, he reversed course. Various forces you met with played a major role in organizing the protests. What is the significance of these protests? 

I met with many of the leaders and participants in these protests. While they are of course thankful that this catastrophic law was halted, they all feel that these anti-corruption agencies need to be strengthened, not just returned to the status quo. 

We should recognize that these protests occurred under martial law. They were illegal. But unlike in Russia, where they would have been met with brutal repression, they were allowed to happen, and they scored a victory. That shows the vibrancy of Ukraine's democratic freedoms even amid this war, something that Russian conquest — as we know from the occupied territories — would eradicate.

People are very critical of Zelensky and his neoliberal policies. But there was also a recognition that the war is a major obstacle to addressing these issues. At this point, they said, there is also no major left party that has representatives in parliament or grassroots power to advance their demands. But people are trying to build such a party to ensure that their country does not become a carbon copy of the United States. They want social and economic justice for all in a free and sovereign Ukraine. 

As a Vermont State Senator, you are one of DSA's prominent elected officials. While the left has uniformly supported Palestine's struggle for self-determination, it has not extended the same solidarity to Ukraine's struggle. Why? 

I think the answer to this is complicated and the result of a flawed way of approaching the question of Ukraine and its struggle for self-determination. Some on the left believe that anything the United States is involved in must be bad and therefore because the U.S. has supported Ukraine they should oppose such support. 

This is a form of American exceptionalism in reverse — the idea that everything the U.S. supports must be reactionary. This leads some on the left to oppose not just the U.S. but also Ukraine's struggle for self-determination and, in some cases, even to support Russian imperialism. Others simply know little about the history of Ukraine's resistance, including left-wing resistance to Russian imperialism. So, there is not the same kind of knee-jerk sympathy with Ukraine as there rightly is with Palestine. 

There are also those who oppose all funding of any war. They hold the naive belief that if Ukraine just stops fighting it will bring about peace. That's obviously not the case. If Ukrainians didn't resist, Russia would simply conquer the country and impose dictatorial colonial rule. The truth is that if Russia stops fighting, there will be peace, but if Ukraine stops, there will be no Ukraine. 

Finally, there is a subset of the left that mistakenly thinks that Russia is not an imperialist power but a progressive force standing up to the U.S. In reality, Putin heads a neoliberal, capitalist dictatorship. So, people on the left have various justifications for not supporting Ukraine's struggle against occupation, genocide, and imperialism, but they are all wrong. 

In your meetings with Ukraine's progressive forces, what message did they want conveyed to the U.S. left? What do they want us to advocate here? 

The Ukrainian left wants the U.S. left to know that they exist, that they are strong and united, and that they cannot fight for leftist values and ideals under Russian occupation. They told me so many stories from the long history of Ukraine's struggle for freedom and justice all the way up to today. They implored me to ask the U.S. leftists to open their minds and hearts to their fight for collective liberation in Ukraine. 

We should actually follow the example of the Ukrainian left that just organized a demonstration against Israel's manufactured famine in Gaza at the memorial of the Holodomor, the famine Stalin imposed on Ukraine. The international left should follow the words of the chant, “from Ukraine to Palestine, occupation is crime.” 

Finally, with Trump collaborating with Putin on plans to partition the country so he can turn his attention to Washington's imperial rivalry with China, what can people here in the U.S. do to materially support Ukraine's people?

There are many opportunities for people to provide desperately needed material support. They can donate to the Ukraine Solidarity Network's fund drive to support the Ukrainian Nurses Union, Be Like We Are, to purchase essential life-saving equipment to treat their patients.

But the list is really endless. People can donate to campaigns that make freeze-dried emergency food for soldiers at the front and tarps to protect soldiers. The independent unions need money to rebuild houses and provide more care to wounded veterans. The teachers need help to renovate their bomb shelter schools, and the feminists need funding for comprehensive reproductive rights education. 

There really isn't any part of civil society or the military in Ukraine that would not benefit from material support. But, most importantly of all, all people of conscience must stand with Ukraine and support its struggle for self-determination. Their struggle is our struggle — one for peace, justice, and equality.

Jake Sullivan claims his stance has changed because Israel's “war” is different now than it was under Biden.

Top Biden administration officials have begun rewriting their ironclad support of Israel throughout the end of President Joe Biden's term, now claiming to oppose Israel's starvation policy in Gaza as it's officially tipped into famine — a famine that they fully laid the groundwork for over the first 16 months of the genocide.

In an interview with “The Bulwark” published Wednesday, former national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that he now supposedly supports withholding weapons from Israel because, he claims, the situation in Gaza is different than it was last year.

“I have in fact told a number of members [of Congress] who were thinking about the votes on these resolutions that the situation as it stands today, following the breakdown of the ceasefire in March, means that a vote to withhold weapons from Israel is a totally credible position. That is a position that I would support,” Sullivan said, likely in reference to resolutions introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) to block the sale of certain weapons to Israel.

He claims that, throughout 2024, Israel was facing threats from other countries that it doesn't face today, and that a hallmark moment was when Israel showed its obstinance in unilaterally ending the ceasefire deal in March. He also points to the UN-backed declaration of famine in Gaza last week as a sign of conditions being worse. These changes mean that current pro-Israel policies are less legitimate than the Biden administration's stance, he said.

“My view is that people who, you know, thought this was wrong from the start didn't stare squarely at October 7th. And people who think it's just and righteous today are not staring squarely at what is happening in Gaza right now, you know, with the killing and the starving of innocent people,” Sullivan said. He ignores the fact that Israel was killing and starving innocent Palestinians immediately after the October 7, 2023, attack — with the stated intention of doing so.

Sullivan's claims are dubious for numerous reasons. For instance, he touts the Biden administration's supposed success in holding off a famine declaration in Gaza due to pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid. 

But the famine declaration last week has been forewarned for over a year, with Israel having used starvation as a weapon of war from the beginning of the genocide with little to no pushback from the Biden administration.

In fact, reports found in December of last year that the Biden administration had pressured the U.S.-backed Famine Early Warning System Network to retract a report warning of imminent famine in northern Gaza. Far from pressuring Israel to ease its humanitarian catastrophe, officials in the Biden administration would often say in public statements that they opposed the starvation campaign, but would do nothing in practice to stop it. Other times, they would outright lie about Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid.

For instance, in October of 2024, Biden officials sent Israel an ultimatum demanding that it increase the amount of aid entering Gaza, or else the U.S. may end its military support. Israel, in turn, actually decreased the aid flow to record lows — and the administration said that it has not assessed that Israel was in violation of its ultimatum.

Sullivan's argument that military aid to Israel was legitimate last year is also completely undercut by the International Court of Justice's opinion in January of 2024 that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide and ordered it to end the siege and lift the humanitarian blockade.

Other former Biden officials have attempted to backtrack in recent weeks. In an interview with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner published Tuesday, Biden's ambassador to Israel, Jacob Lew, said that the situation now is “very, very different” from what it was under Biden with regards to starvation in Gaza — even as experts had warned countless times that there were potentially thousands of deaths to starvation and other causes not being counted in the official death toll.

Like Sullivan, Lew also defended the genocide as it was conducted under Biden. In comments that garnered outrage, he said that Israel's pattern of killing children in Gaza was justified and legitimate. When pressed, he said that the children killed in strikes on schools and shelters were acceptable collateral damage because they were often found to be family members of Hamas fighters.

“We could almost never get answers that explained what happened before the story was fully framed in international media, and then when the facts were fully developed, it turned out that the casualties were much lower, the number of civilians was much lower, and, in many cases, the children were children of Hamas fighters, not children taking cover in places,” Lew said.

“​​It is not the simple question that it originally appears to be when the initial report makes it sound like the target was just an empty school that families took cover in,” he went on.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has decried those using the tragedy “as an opportunity to villainize our trans community.”

Trump supporters are exploiting the mass shooting in Minneapolis on Wednesday — in which two children were killed and 17 people were injured — to escalate their broader attacks on transgender people. 

“Two innocent children are dead and the far right are racing to use it as pretext to further eradicate trans people,” civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo said on Bluesky.

Early reports suggest the shooter may have identified as transgender, and the far right has seized on this to advance their ongoing campaign to demonize and criminalize trans people.

Within hours of the shooting, MAGA influencers began circulating the shooter's reported gender identity as evidence of a so-called pattern. Far right commentators like Charlie Kirk and Matt Walsh called transgender people “dangerously delusional,” “mentally sick,” and “crazy.” U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted that the shooter “claimed to be transgender,” a claim that Elon Musk then amplified on X, writing: “There is a clear pattern here.”

This pattern, however, is one the far right have been trying to manufacture for the past few years as a routine scapegoating tactic in the wake of mass violence. “The fact of the matter is a shooter is more likely to be a non-transgender white male rather than a transgender person,” LGBTQ legislative researcher Allison Chapman told Truthout. “The right-wing media machine has been quick to blame a trans person in almost all recent shootings and this time it just happened to be plausible.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the transphobic backlash, saying that anyone “using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community, or any other community out there, has lost their sense of common humanity.” He added on X that “thoughts and prayers” are not enough to confront the systemic causes of mass shootings.

Despite such “thoughts and prayers,” the Mass Shooting Tracker currently reports 339 mass shootings this year, leaving 388 people dead and nearly 1,500 wounded. Everytown for Gun Safety has recorded 91 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in 2025 alone. 

Yet rather than confronting this crisis or advancing meaningful gun control — even though the shooter obtained the firearms legally — advocates say that the far right has instead chosen to weaponize the tragedy. “I'm absolutely disgusted by how the right-wing media and the Trump regime have tried to make this story about transgender people rather than the victims. They should be ashamed,” Chapman told Truthout. 

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has dramatically escalated efforts to roll back transgender rights. He directed the Food and Drug Administration to convene a panel to determine if hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases a propensity for violence among trans people, and his administration has pushed bogus research on the efficacy of gender-affirming care for trans kids. He has also taken steps to pathologize trans people in what many trans people see as an effort to regulate and institutionalize transgender people. 

“The Trump regime is desperate for a story to legitimize their attacks on the transgender community and this is simply a convenient way to demonize a community based on the actions of a singular person,” Chapman said.

Even in the rare instances when a mass shooter is transgender, the statistical reality remains: The overwhelming majority of such incidents are carried out by cisgender men. Meanwhile, transgender people are four times more likely to be the victims of violent crime — not the perpetrators.

“I'm terrified for my kids, I'm terrified for my community, and I'm terrified at the thought of what the Trump regime could do to me and my community in response to this tragedy,” Chapman told Truthout.

At a court hearing on Wednesday, the judge didn't rule on Mario Guevara's petition to be released.

Award-winning journalist Mario Guevara, who had begun documenting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, has been detained since his arrest at a protest on June 14 in DeKalb County, Georgia. 

Guevara has spent almost all of his detention in ICE custody, although he is authorized to live and work in the United States. He immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago from El Salvador to escape persecution for his journalism. Guevara settled in Georgia and continued to work as a journalist, first for Mundo Hispánico, and then, in 2024, he founded his own news organization, MG News, which had recently begun filming ICE abductions.

In a phone interview from an ICE jail in South Georgia, Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution that the agency is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” Some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

On August 20, Guevara's legal team, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Georgia, filed a habeas corpus petition requesting that the court allow Guevara to pay the $7,500 bond set by an immigration judge on July 1. Federal prosecutors had appealed the bond order to the Board of Immigration Appeals and were granted a stay, or pause, of the order, thereby preventing Guevara's release.

At a hearing on Wednesday, the judge did not rule on Guevara's petition and requested briefs from both sides.

Guevara's saga began more than two months ago when he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest, which was part of a nationwide day of action to protest President Donald Trump. According to the petition, body camera footage from the protest shows an officer instructing other officers to, “Keep an eye on the guy in the red shirt. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. . . . He's been warned multiple times.” Another officer asked, “Press?” The first officer replied, “Yep.”

About a minute later, Guevara stepped off the sidewalk as he moved out of the way of police officers coming through the area, and was promptly arrested. Video of his arrest shows that Guevara is wearing a red shirt underneath a vest clearly marked with PRESS on the front and back.

After his arrest, ICE placed a detainer on Guevara. Although all criminal charges related to the protest have been dropped, federal prosecutors have fought to keep him locked up in ICE custody. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that ICE arrested Guevara because he is a journalist. In an email to Truthout, DHS claimed that he “is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004,” which is false. 

The immigration judge who granted Guevara bond wrote that the journalist “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.” 

The habeas petition quotes extensively from the government's filings to demonstrate that ICE is targeting Guevara because he is a journalist. 

“In the Notice of Appeal, the Government states that Mr. Guevara is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed' law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,'” it reads. “The Government further states that ‘[l]ocal law enforcement reviewed the respondent's public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.'”

Guevara is currently held in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day at the Folkston ICE Processing Center, according to the petition. For two hours a day, he's confined to a larger cell where he can “see the sky and breathe fresh air.” During his detention, he has lost approximately 20 pounds. “The freedom of press is only for U.S. citizens,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on a call from Folkston. “If I'm outside again, I don't think I will be on ICE anymore because everything is different now.”

MOSCOW, August 27. /TASS/. Russia will take tit-for-tat measures against Norwegian fishing vessels if Norway does not reconsider its position within one month, head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries Ilya Shestakov said.

"In case the Norwegian side does not reconsider its position within one month, Russia will close its exclusive economic zone for Norwegian fishing vessels. Furthermore, fisheries and distribution of catch quotas in open waters of Barents and Norwegian Seas will be carried out on the basis of Russian national interests," Shestakov said, cited by the agency's press service.

In July 2025, Norway introduced the fishing ban in its exclusive economic zone for two Russian companies. This is a gross violation of effective agreements on joint management of reserves of aquatic bioresources, the press service told TASS.

            Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters Wednesday – who they say were in the United States illegally – while they were working to contain Washington state's biggest wildfire.
    


            The Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service had requested support from a local Border Patrol station as the agencies terminated work contracts with two firms on the Olympic Peninsula, according to a news release from US Customs and Border Protection. Without offering details, the agency said the contracts were ended following the conclusion of a criminal investigation by the Bureau of Land Management.
    


            The Bear Gulch Fire on the peninsula has already torched almost 9,000 acres in the Olympic National Forest.
    


            The Bureau of Land Management requested that Border Patrol verify the identities of all the personnel present “due to the remote location of the work site,” the release states.
    


            “Several discrepancies were identified, and two individuals were found to be present in the United States illegally, one with a previous order of removal,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.
    


            CBP said the two people were arrested and taken to Bellingham Station near the Canadian border.
    


            Officials handling the Bear Gulch Fire in northwest Washington said in a short statement Thursday they “are aware of a Border Patrol operation here.”
    


            “The Border Patrol operation is not interfering with firefighting activity and Bear Gulch firefighters continue to make progress on the fire,” the statement continued.
    


            The Seattle Times was first to report the arrests.
    


            Washington Rep. Emily Randall's office confirmed the arrests in an email to CNN.
    


            The Border Patrol operation comes as President Donald Trump has cracked down on immigration across the country. In the first seven months of his second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported nearly 200,000 people, CNN previously reported – putting the federal agency on track for its highest rate of removals in at least a decade but still short of the administration's stated deportation target of 1 million deportations a year.
    


ICE protests nationwide come as agency scrambles to meet Trump's immigration arrest quotas



            “This cooperative effort highlights the coordination between federal agencies in ensuring the integrity of government operations and maintaining public trust in fiduciary matters,” US Border Patrol Blaine Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rosario P. Vasquez said in a statement. “U.S. Border Patrol steadfastly enforces the laws of the United States and unapologetically addresses violations of immigration law wherever they are encountered.”
    


            The human-caused wildfire on Washington's Olympic Peninsula has been burning since July 6 and was just 13% contained as of Thursday. A red flag warning will remain in effect until 9 p.m. local time Thursday, and thunderstorms and gusty winds could worsen firefighting conditions.
    


            Firefighters are battling the flames following intense heat waves in Western Washington that have spiked temperatures as much as 20 degrees above normal and stretched for days at least twice in August.
    


            Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said he is “deeply concerned” about the arrests.
    


            “I have asked my team to reach out to federal agencies for more information, to determine where these two individuals are, and to question why the Trump Administration's cruel immigration policies now extend to individuals fighting forest fires,” Ferguson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Washington Sen. Patty Murray demanded answers from the federal government about the circumstances of the incident in a statement Thursday.
    


            “Trump has undercut our wildland firefighting abilities in more ways than one—from decimating the Forest Service and pushing out thousands of critical support staff, to now apparently detaining firefighters on the job,” she said in a statement. “This administration's immigration policy is fundamentally sick. Trump has wrongfully detained everyone from lawful green card holders to American citizens—no one should assume this was necessary or appropriate.”
    


            Under the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security said it would not conduct immigration enforcement “at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided” such as evacuation routes or areas where emergency supplies are being distributed.
    


            Under Donald Trump's first presidential administration, as wildfires ripped through northern California and burned over 300,000 acres in 2018, DHS said it would “suspend routine immigration enforcement operations in the areas affected by the fires,” except if a serious criminal presented a public safety threat. The agency also said it wouldn't conduct any operations at evacuation sites or assistance centers. It is unclear if that stance has changed under Trump's second administration.

ANKARA, August 28. /TASS/. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in a phone conversation with his US counterpart Marco Rubio has assured of Ankara's readiness to implement its obligations in the settlement process between Russia and Ukraine.

"On August 28, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan held a phone conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. They evaluated the efforts directed at achieving peace between Russia and Ukraine. Fidan said that Turkey is ready to fulfill its obligations in this process," a source in the Turkish Foreign Ministry told TASS.

Additionally, "the current situation in the Gaza Strip and the efforts on achieving a ceasefire were discussed," the source said. In this context, Fidan "noted the necessity of the swiftest improvement in the humanitarian situation."

            The Democratic Socialists of America held their national convention this summer in the afterglow of arguably their biggest electoral victory to date: Zohran Mamdani's triumph in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor.
    


            They then passed a series of resolutions that Mamdani critics are now trying to make a political liability ahead of November's election.
    


            Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the primary, is calling attention to democratic socialist policies and argues Mamdani isn't being challenged enough on them.
    


            The DSA now bans its individual chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement, opposes measures that would fund border control and calls for a carbon-free economy and the returning of land to indigenous communities. Cuomo has pointed to DSA's calls to end criminal penalties for misdemeanor crimes and close prisons as well as its strident criticism of Israel.
    


            “People have a right to know before they vote,” said Cuomo at a news conference Wednesday.
    


            Mamdani lists himself as a democratic socialist in his social media profiles and has close ties to DSA officials in New York City and nationally. The 33-year-old state assemblyman gave a keynote address at their national conference in 2023 but has only been endorsed by the New York City chapter of the DSA for his mayoral bid.
    


            Mamdani reiterated to reporters that he does not support decriminalizing misdemeanors or defunding the police, despite his past tweets criticizing the New York Police Department.
    


            “My specific policy proposals are the ones that I talk about, the ones that I share on my platform, on my website,” Mamdani said Thursday when asked about the DSA's resolutions. “Those are the ones that I want New Yorkers to hold me accountable to.”
    


            Officials with the national organization say they do not endorse a candidate unless the local chapter files a formal request, which the New York City chapter hasn't done.  But they say they are proud of Mamdani and resist the notion that his affiliation with socialism is a liability.
    


            “While sometimes, especially with older generations, there is sometimes the big scary ‘S' word, socialism, younger folks really see that capitalism is not working out for them. It is causing mass incarceration. It is causing defunding of schools and playgrounds and it's causing them to not have healthcare. And these policies really resonate with voters,” said Megan Romer, co-chair of the DSA.
    


            Another DSA co-chair, Ashik Siddique, said in a statement that the group was “proud to count Zohran as a member.”
    


            “While we are proud that Zohran works closely with NYC-DSA, we also understand his platform for mayor is not identical to the DSA National platform,” Siddique said.
    


            The DSA at its August national convention passed an exhaustive compendium of resolutions, more than 300 pages long.
    


            Here's a look at the DSA and what it laid out in its policy resolutions.
    


            Formed in the 1970s as a result of the merging of two groups, the DSA was created with the intent of promoting workers' rights but has expanded to champion an array of socialist policies.
    


            “We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear,” they explain on their website. “We want to win ‘radical' reforms like single-payer Medicare for All, defunding the police/refunding communities, the Green New Deal, and more as a transition to a freer, more just life.”
    


            The DSA explicitly prohibits chapters from supporting or contributing funds to law enforcement and candidates from receiving endorsements from police-affiliated groups. By extension, DSA members cannot be in law enforcement.
    


            Their vision for a “Democratic Socialist Republic” includes “replacing existing law enforcement agencies with a public safety force run by local communities for de-escalation and protecting democratic and social rights.” They also call for banning former officers from joining the organization and eliminating qualified immunity.
    


            When asked about these policies, Romer, the DSA national co-chair, characterized them as more of their long-term goals for society and less of the rigid checklist that it comes across as outlined in the compendium.
    


            “We are pragmatists, and we do understand that being in office right now means working with the system as it is and modifying it as we can to make it move toward where we want it to be,” she said.
    


            For his part, Mamdani is not actively campaigning on antagonizing   police despite his past support for the defund movement.
    


            “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he told reporters in July.
    


            The DSA's compendium repeatedly refers to Israel's actions in Gaza as a genocide and calls for a single-state solution “from the river to the sea” – a phrase that supporters of Israel say calls for the elimination of the Jewish state.
    


            “DSA fundamentally supports the right of resistance of Palestinians and supports the ability of the organizations involved on the ground to carry out that liberatory vision,” it reads.
    


            They also call for supporting “the student intifada,” demonstrations of Palestinian solidarity on college campuses.
    


            Supporters of Israel see calls for an “intifada” as glorifying violence against Jews.
    


            Mamdani during the primary was criticized for declining to disavow the phrase “globalize the intifada”    in a media interview. After winning the primary, he told business leaders that he would discourage use of the phrase.

Alejandro ‘Alito' Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña grabbed and shouted at each other over the presence of foreign troops

Mexico's senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country's top politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion over the presence of foreign troops.

Alejandro “Alito” Moreno, head of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary party (Pri), grabbed at Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the senate president from the ruling Morena party, after lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to mark the end of the day's session on Wednesday.

“I'm asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly in the livestreamed video.

“Don't touch me,” Fernández Noroña responds.

When Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. When an aide to Fernández Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor.

As Fernández Noroña tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at the senate leader.

“[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He hit me on the arms and said: ‘I'm going to beat the shit out of you, I'm going to kill you.'”

Moreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.”

The scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied.

Earlier this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely welcome”.

The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries.

The senate leader said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno.

In a statement on X, Moreno accused the governing party of changing the order of the day at the last minute in order to silence the opposition.

New polling finds that opposition to sending more military aid to Israel has hit another record high among U.S. voters, further widening the gap between U.S. policy and American opinion as Israel's genocide continues without an end in sight.

In a poll released Wednesday, Quinnipiac found that 60 percent of voters now say they oppose sending more military assistance to Israel to aid in its siege of Gaza. This is the highest level of opposition since Quinnipiac asked this question in November 2023, when only 39 percent of Americans were against sending aid.

Now, only 32 percent of Americans support sending more aid, the polling found. This includes only 18 percent of Democrats, with 75 percent saying they oppose sending more aid.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

This may be because a growing number of Americans say that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Half of those polled said that Israel is committing genocide, while 35 percent said Israel was not, and 15 percent said they didn't know. 

A whopping 77 percent of Democrats said that they believe Israel is committing genocide. 

The findings underscore the wide gaps between public opinion and the actions of political officials. President Donald Trump has been a major backer of Israel's genocide, giving Israeli officials independence to operate as they wish even as they have openly embarked on a plot to illegally annex Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

Just on Tuesday, members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rejected a resolution that would have called on Democrats across the country to back an arms embargo to Israel. 

The DNC resolutions panel instead backed a competing resolution that only called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the “unconditional” release of all Israeli captives. The resolution did not include language to exert leverage over Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal, even though Israel has been openly sabotaging ceasefire negotiations for over a year at least.

Democrats “will continue to lose” due to their policies of rejecting any action in favor of Palestinian rights, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) said in response to the poll.

“The DNC voted down a resolution this week in support of an arms embargo. Enabling genocide is alienating the majority of Democrats who want the funding of war crimes to stop. Wake the fuck up!” Tlaib wrote on social media Wednesday.

The polling further suggests that support for Israel has cratered overall, not just in context of the Gaza genocide.

Sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis hit an all-time high in the latest survey since Quinnipiac began polling that question in 2001. Now, 37 percent of voters say they sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis, compared to 36 percent saying they favor Israelis. This includes 63 percent of Democrats who say they have more sympathy for Palestinians over Israelis, compared to only 13 percent who say the opposite.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

2:00 JST, August 29, 2025

The following is the full written response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to questions from The Yomiuri Shimbun.

The Yomiuri Shimbun: Mr. Prime Minister, you are visiting Japan after two years. While your visit in 2023 had a multilateral context, your current visit is seen as an important one for India-Japan relations. What should we look forward to during your two days in Japan?

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I am delighted to be in Tokyo once again, this time for the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit. I warmly thank Prime Minister Ishiba for his gracious invitation.

India and Japan are not just two close partners. We are ancient civilizations, vibrant democracies and leading economies. We share a common strategic outlook. Over the past decade, our ties have scaled new heights since they were elevated to Special Strategic and Global Partnership. The annual Summit itself is testament to the maturity and vibrancy of our ties.

During my meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, I look forward to charting the next phase of our partnership. Our focus will be to strengthen security, enhance resilience, drive innovation and deliver prosperity for our peoples.

I also look forward to visiting Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a region that symbolizes both resilience and innovation.

I am confident that my visit, though short, will be long in impact. India and Japan will continue to be a force for peace, progress and stability in Asia and the world.

Yomiuri: What concrete steps are being taken under the India-Japan partnership to improve cooperation on semiconductors, and how will this collaboration help address supply chain challenges, boost domestic manufacturing in India and support the technological ambitions of both countries?

Modi: The India-Japan partnership is unique. It spans millennia of cultural bonds, and is now shaping the contours of the 21st century. We are working together on new and emerging technologies, with semiconductor being one of them.

India's semiconductor sector is on the cusp of transformation. We have put in place a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework, backed by incentives, to build a strong semiconductor and display ecosystem. Already, six semiconductor units are taking root in India, with four more on the way.

By the end of this very year, “Made in India” chips will be in the market, a clear demonstration of India's design and manufacturing capabilities.

Japanese companies, with their technological strengths and global leadership, can play a pivotal role in this journey. A strong beginning has already been made. By combining India's scale and capabilities with Japan's advanced technologies, we can build a resilient and trusted semiconductor value chain.

This collaboration will support the technological ambitions of both our countries, and enhance global supply chain security.

I see semiconductor cooperation emerging as a major pillar of the India–Japan partnership.

After all, in this digital century, chips are not just about computers, they are about competitiveness, credibility and confidence in the future.

Yomiuri: India has an expansive vision for space exploration, and we understand that your government has recently approved the Chandrayaan 5 Mission, and that this will be done in collaboration with Japan. How do you envision the future of space exploration with Japan as the key partner?

Modi: India's space journey is a story of determination, hard work and innovation of our scientists.

From Chandrayaan-3's historic landing on the moon's south pole to our advances in interplanetary missions, India has consistently demonstrated that space is not the final frontier, it is the next frontier.

I am glad that India and Japan are joining hands for the next edition of the Chandrayaan series or the LUPEX (Lunar Polar Exploration) mission. This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole.

Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between ISRO and JAXA, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launch pads, and from research to real-world applications.

The impact of space science is linked to progress in our daily lives, from agriculture, disaster management, to communications and beyond.

I am confident that our scientific teams will be working together to push the boundaries of space science. And, our partnership in space will not only expand horizons above us, but also improve lives around us.

Yomiuri: During the India-Japan Defense Ministers' meeting in May 2025 in New Delhi, both sides focused on deepening defense cooperation in pursuing military modernization. In this regard, how has the India-Japan defense partnership evolved in recent years, and what opportunities and challenges lie ahead for both countries in improving defense cooperation?

Modi: Collaboration in the defense sector has been a strong success story for India and Japan. Both countries have a shared interest in peace, security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

Today, our partnership spans across all three services. We conduct regular bilateral and multilateral exercises. We are building a robust Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation, and working on codevelopment and coproduction of UNICORN masts for our Navy.

In recent years, Indian defense products are rapidly expanding their global footprint. Japan also has a proven record in the field of defense technology. Together, with political trust and natural complementarities, we can design and produce next generation defense platforms not just for ourselves, but also for the world.

The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to be adopted during my visit will further military modernization and defense industry collaboration, and advance our ambition for shaping a secure and stable Indo-Pacific for generations to come.

Yomiuri: How do you evaluate the economic partnership between India and Japan?

Modi: Economic partnership is one of the key pillars of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. As the world's leading economies, we have been contributing to each other's growth, competitiveness and dynamism.

Japan has been a trusted partner in India's infrastructure development across generations. Japan has also been a leading source of Foreign Direct Investment for India in key sectors including automobiles, electronics, telecom, chemicals, finance and pharmaceuticals.

The number of Japanese firms in India has grown steadily to around 1,500, while more than 400 Indian companies operate in Japan. Clearly, this is only the beginning — the real potential is much higher.

We must aim bigger and remain ambitious. The synergies across governments, businesses and people can create scale and speed in our economic partnership.

We maintain important trade relations, but it has not yet reached the levels envisaged under our CEPA [Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement]. I am confident that with renewed efforts, we can diversify our trade basket, make it more balanced and open up new frontiers as well.

The 20th century saw Japan emerge as a major partner in India's infrastructure development. I am confident that the 21st century will see Japan as a major partner in India's innovation, manufacturing, and global value chains.

Yomiuri: Some Japanese companies are positioning their production bases in India as hubs for third-country markets such as Africa. How would India support the efforts of such companies?

Modi: India has seen multi-faceted reforms which make manufacturing in India easier than ever before. We have removed compliance burdens, rolled out incentives and ensured a large skilled work force for companies to set base in India.

Many global companies, including from Japan, are setting up their production in India not only to cater to our domestic market, but also for the world.

Just a couple of days back, I was at the Suzuki plant in India where we flagged off electric vehicles to be exported to a hundred countries, including Japan.

India enjoys a historically close and multifaceted relationship with Africa and various countries of the Global South.

Steps like “Japan-India Cooperation Initiative for Sustainable Economic Development in Africa” combining Japan's technological and financial expertise with India's developmental partnership and long-standing goodwill in Africa are good efforts in the right direction.

India is well placed to play the role of a bridge connecting Japan's capabilities with Africa's growth and development priorities.

Yomiuri: One of the main items on your agenda for your visit will be India's bullet train project. What are your expectations for Japan, with its Shinkansen technology, in terms of future vehicle production in India?

Modi: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is a flagship project between India and Japan. We are aiming to have the passenger services start in a few years' time.

While the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project is on its way, we have unveiled a bigger ambition: to have a 7,000-kilometer-long network of high-speed rail in our country.

Much of it will have to be through Make in India, so that the program is sustainable and viable. I welcome active participation by Japanese companies in this endeavour.

There is also potential to expand our cooperation beyond high-speed rail to cover other areas of mobility including sectors such as ports, aviation, shipbuilding, road transport, railways and logistics where India has launched ambitious initiatives.

Clearly, Japan's technological edge in many of these areas, together with India's scale, manufacturing and innovation power, can create enormous value for both sides.

Yomiuri: People-to-People exchanges between India and Japan have become an important area of cooperation. Can you tell us more about how India and Japan plan to take this forward?

Modi: Immense mutual goodwill and friendship between the people of India and Japan is at the heart of our ties with Japan. There is great receptivity toward our cultures and cuisines in both countries.

Professionals from Japan are well respected in India and have built a niche for themselves.

Similarly, Indian diaspora across the world are contributing significantly in the growth of various countries. Whether it is Indian IT professionals or Indian scientific manpower, greater presence of the Indian diaspora in Japan can help stimulate new industries and new fields of knowledge where our two countries have so much at stake.

We have also etched important agreements under Japan's Specified Skilled Worker (SSW) program and the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) to enhance the advanced manufacturing skills of our workers.

This will help our manufacturing industry grow and contribute to our vision for a developed India. Our focus has also been in promoting language education in India which would also allow our people to connect better with each other and to tap into the complementarities. I look forward to discussing this aspect of our relations at the Summit.

Yomiuri: What can Japan and India do to help establish international rules for the reliable use of AI? What are your thoughts on data sovereignty?

Modi: We live in the digital age. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in our lives, with AI being in the forefront. India sees AI as a medium to enhance human progress.

But we are equally conscious of the risk it poses. We believe that resolving concerns and encouraging innovation should be given equal importance in AI Governance so that we only promote Responsible AI. There is a need to evolve a consensus on global governance and norms for Responsible AI.

AI Governance must go beyond mitigating risks; it should also encourage fair access and foster inclusive progress for all, especially in the Global South.

India's Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) has democratized digital commerce and addressed key data protection issues through techno-legal solutions.

Similarly, Japan's “Data Free Flow with Trust” (DFFT) initiative focuses on privacy, security and trustworthy cross-border data flows.

In a data-driven world, international collaboration is crucial for effective AI governance and secure and transparent cross-border data exchange.

India and Japan should seize this opportunity to deepen our partnership, promote interoperability while respecting sovereignty, harmonize standards through techno-legal solutions and identify convergence between regulatory approaches.

India will be hosting the AI Impact Summit in 2026. It will be an opportunity for India and Japan to collaborate and take these issues forward.

Yomiuri: What are your views on the Japanese government's concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific? How will India and Japan cooperate and enhance their relationship to realize this concept?

Modi: There is a strong convergence between Japan's vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific and India's own approach encapsulated in our Indo-Pacific vision, in the Vision MAHASAGAR and the Indo-Pacific Oceans' Initiative. India and Japan are committed to an Indo-Pacific that is peaceful, prosperous, stable and where the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations are respected.

Both our countries have strong and extensive linkages with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and we both engage with some of them in plurilateral formats to give expression to our shared objectives.

Yomiuri: You are visiting China after your visit to Japan. What is the importance of improving relations with China at this time?

Modi: At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, I would be traveling to Tianjin from here to take part in the SCO Summit. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, steady and positive progress has been made in our bilateral ties.

Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity.

This is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.

Given the current volatility in world economy, it is also important for India and China, as two major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. India is ready to advance bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.

Yomiuri: You recently held consecutive phone conversations with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. What role does India envision playing in the peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two countries?

Modi: India has maintained a principled and humanitarian stance on the conflict which is equally appreciated by both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. In line with this, both the leaders spoke to me to share their perspectives on the developments related to the conflict. I reiterated India's principled and consistent stand and encouraged dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.

I have already indicated India's willingness to support meaningful efforts aimed at achieving peaceful resolution of the conflict. I believe, by virtue of our good relations with both sides, including key stakeholders, we can strengthen efforts dedicated to the restoration of an early and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Yomiuri: As a member of BRICS, how do you view the importance of the Global South? Should Japan see India as a bridge between the Global South and other countries such as Quad members?

Modi: The global community has made a commitment to create a more equitable world through achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. If we have to live up to this commitment, then the Global South must be given priority. In a highly interconnected world, we have seen the debilitating impact of the pandemic, conflicts and supply chain disruptions on the Global South. They continue to face myriad challenges involving global governance, climate change, food and energy security, debt and financial stress, all having significant impact on their development priorities.

As members of the Global South, we clearly understand these concerns and their effects on people's lives. We have made strenuous efforts to bring these to the forefront of the global agenda.

All our global initiatives, like Mission LiFE, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, International Solar Alliance, Global Biofuels Alliance, focus on promoting the interests of the Global South. Our G20 Presidency saw the inclusion of the African Union and gave voice to the aspirations of the Global South.

Similarly, in BRICS, we are actively engaged in working toward the benefit of the Global South. India attaches importance to its engagement with BRICS, which has emerged as a valuable forum for consultation, and cooperation and has helped promote mutual understanding, on a specific set of issues of common interest to emerging economies.

Under the rubric of the Quad, we have worked for the development and progress of the countries in the Indo-Pacific.

India has also consistently called for urgent and comprehensive reforms of the global multilateral institutions to make them more effective and reflective of the current geopolitical and economic realities.

India's motto is “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — the world is one family. We believe in building bridges of cooperation and friendship among nations.

Yomiuri: When it comes to the Quad, what is the significance of the Indian prime minister visiting Japan? What areas of cooperation with Japan would you like to see confirmed ahead of the group's autumn summit? How will you develop the Quad framework in the future?

Modi: In the last twenty years since its inception in 2004, the Quad has emerged as a force of global good delivering positive outcomes for the people of the Indo-Pacific region. Quad's practical agenda ranges from maritime safety and security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, cyber security, critical and emerging technologies and connectivity to education, health and even space cooperation.

The role of the Quad in the delivery of public goods can also be very significant. We greatly value Japan's role in strengthening the Quad's agenda and believe that together we can continue to deliver practical solutions and tangible outcomes that benefit not only our region but the wider world.

The European Commission has contacted Kiev over Ukrainian missile strikes on the Druzhba pipeline that transmits oil from Eurasia into Western Europe, calling it vital to the continent's energy security. Ukrainian forces have hit the route three times in August alone.

One of the world's longest energy networks, Druzhba spans roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), carrying oil from Russia and Kazakhstan to refineries in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. Passing through Ukraine, it remains the primary route for deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia.

“The EC is in contact with the Ukrainian side and calls on all parties of the conflict to ensure the security of critical infrastructure,” spokeswoman Eva Hrncirova said, responding to whether the Commission had urged Kiev to refrain from striking the pipeline.

She added that the pipeline is “an important asset for EU energy security,” but emphasized that according to the Commission's assessment, the latest strikes have not affected the bloc's energy security.

Kiev's most recent attack nearly a week ago effectively halted Russian oil deliveries to Slovakia and Hungary, prompting the two EU countries to demand action from the Commission.

On Wednesday, Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova said the pipeline was back online after a week-long disruption caused by Ukrainian strikes. Hungarian oil group MOL, which operates refineries in Hungary and Slovakia, confirmed that oil supplies had been restored.

The attacks have been condemned by both the Hungarian and Slovak governments, which have often criticized EU support for Kiev. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said earlier this week that the attacks jeopardize Hungary's energy security and called it “outrageous that the EC keeps on claiming there is ‘no supply risk'.”

Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said the strikes not only directly undermined his country's national interests but also harmed Ukraine, noting that Kiev relies on diesel fuel supplies from Slovakia.

According to a letter shared by Hungarian officials, US President Donald Trump also expressed frustration over the attacks, saying he was “very angry” about them.

Moscow has consistently condemned Ukrainian attacks on civilian energy infrastructure as acts of terrorism.

BERLIN, August 28. /TASS/. The German government has no "final opinion" regarding the possibility of expropriating frozen Russian assets, Foreign Minister of Germany Johann Wadephul said at a press conference.

The possibility of using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine will be discussed at the forthcoming informal meetings of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen on August 29-30. "This will be one of the items for discussion at the informal ministerial meeting in Copenhagen. There is a need to shed the light on difficult legal issues and implications for the financial market stability," Wadephul said.

The EU is already expropriating revenues from refinancing of illegally frozen Russian assets, the minister noted. "We will continue discussions," he added.

The greater portion of immobilized Russian assets, slightly more than 200 bln euro, is blocked with the Euroclear depository in Belgium. The depository repeated spoke against the expropriation of assets, cautioning that it may entail the seizure of European or Belgian assets by Russia through courts in other parts of the globe.

Russia attacked a Ukrainian Navy vessel, killing one crew member and injuring several others, Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk confirmed for the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 28.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Other details of the attack, including the time and location, have not yet been disclosed.

Earlier in the day, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that a Russian naval drone hit the Ukrainian medium reconnaissance ship Simferopol near the mouth of the Danube River, alleging that the ship had sunk.

Simferopol is a Ukrainian Navy reconnaissance ship of the Laguna-class. It was launched in 2019 and officially joined the fleet two years later.

The vessel is designed for radio, electronic, radar, and optical reconnaissance, and was armed with a 30 mm AK-306 artillery system.

While Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia's Black Sea Fleet, reports of Ukrainian naval losses are extremely rare.

Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has targeted multiple civilian vessels in the Black Sea, including foreign ones.

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.



The Aug. 28 call came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial strike on Ukrainian cities overnight.

At least 18 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

This marks the first time a vessel carrying fuel from the blacklisted facility has entered a Chinese import terminal.

The attack on the junction station occurred around 5 a.m. in Tver, a Russian city northwest of Moscow.



Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles.

Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker.



"This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."



"No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles, among them two Kh-47 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Toronto-Dominion Bank TD-T reported a higher third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates but also booked restructuring charges as the bank works to shore up deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls and adjust to a cap on U.S. retail assets imposed by regulators. 

TD earned profit of $3.34-billion, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31. That compared with a quarterly loss in the same quarter last year after U.S. regulators hit the bank with a US$3-billion fine over serious lapses in its programs to prevent money laundering. 

Adjusted to exclude that one-time charge, TD said it earned $2.20 per share, which was higher than the $2.05 consensus estimate among analysts. 

The quarterly earnings were affected by $262-million incurred from TD's moves to restructure its U.S. balance sheet, which has included selling loans to stay under the regulatory asset cap. 

TD now has US$386-billion of assets in its U.S. business, which is below the US$434-billion limit. TD also took a $333-million restructuring charge in the quarter as part of a previously announced plan to spend $600-million to $700-million over several quarters to reduce its overall staffing by 2 per cent and eventually save $550-million to $650-million annually, before tax. 

A bright spot in TD's third-quarter results was its Canadian retail banking division, which reported profit of $1.95-billion, up 4 per cent from last year. The division has lagged rival banks in recent quarters, but has emerged as a key point of emphasis as the bank's ambitions to grow in the U.S. have been curbed for the time being.

Profit from U.S. retail banking was $760-million, compared with a loss in the same quarter last year. Loans were down 7 per cent because of asset sales, and the division had higher governance and control costs.

Wealth management and insurance profit was $703-million, up 63 per cent from a year ago. And profit from wholesale banking was $398-million, up 26 per cent year over year. 

“We are well positioned to build on this momentum as we compete, grow and build our bank for the future,” chief executive officer Ray Chun said in a statement. 

TD set aside $971-million in provisions for credit losses, or money earmarked to cover loans that may default. That was lower than the second quarter and well below the $1.2-billion analysts anticipated, according to LSEG.

TD's common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its resilience in times of stress, is 14.8 per cent. 

TD plans to hold an investor day presentation on September 29 to unveil its updated strategy under Mr. Chun to analysts and shareholders.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that TD earned profit of $3.37-billion in the third quarter. The bank earned profit of $3.34-billion. This version has been corrected.

Editor's note: The story was updated to include additional comments from Ukrainian and Hungarian officials.

Hungary has decided to ban the commander of a Ukrainian military unit responsible for the latest attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline from entering the country and the Schengen Area, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Aug. 28.

In recent weeks, Ukraine carried out at least three attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily disrupting operations. 

Though Szijjarto did not name the commander hit by the ban, Balazs Orban, the Hungarian prime minister's political director, confirmed for Hungarian news outlet 444 that the measure targets Robert Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces.

Brovdi, who is of Hungarian descent and known by the call sign "Madyar," has confirmed that his branch was responsible for the drone strikes against Druzhba, including the latest one carried out on Aug. 21, which targeted the Unecha pumping station in Bryansk Oblast.

The Hungarian foreign minister described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."

"Ukraine knows very well that the Druzhba pipeline is vital for Hungary's and Slovakia's energy supply, and that such strikes harm us far more than Russia," Szijjarto said on X.

Brovdi dismissed Budapest's decision and said the Hungarian leadership shares responsibility for Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities by "filling their own dirty pockets with sanctioned cheap raw materials."

"I am Ukrainian, and I will arrive in my father's homeland after you," the commander said on his Telegram channel. "There are enough true Hungarians in Hungary, and one day, they will be sick to death of you."

In his statement, Szijjarto made no mention of the Russian overnight mass drone and missile attack on Kyiv on Aug. 28, which killed at least 18 people, including four children, and injured almost 40 others. 

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Budapest "is on the wrong side of history."

"Peter, if the Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed by Russia this morning, this is moral decay," he wrote on X.

"If Hungary has indeed closed entry into Hungary and the entire Schengen zone to one of Ukraine's military commanders, who is an ethnic Hungarian and a citizen of Ukraine, this can only cause outrage," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to clarify the issue and "respond accordingly."

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest, carries Russian oil directly to Hungary and Slovakia — the only EU countries still buying Russian crude through the system. In July, they imported $232 million and $196 million worth of oil, respectively.

Hungary, widely seen as the most Russia-friendly government in the EU, has repeatedly opposed Brussels' attempts to fully halt Russian energy imports and threatened to block Ukraine's path to EU membership.

Kyiv regularly carries out attacks on military and industrial facilities in Russia, targeting Russian oil infrastructure to undermine Moscow's revenue streams and weaken its ability to wage war in Ukraine.

The chief of America's top public health agency is refusing to quit after she reportedly clashed with Robert F Kennedy Jr over vaccine policy.

Lawyers for Dr Susan Monarez have said she can only be fired directly by Donald Trump himself, even though the White House on Wednesday said she had been kicked out.

The stand-off comes less than a month after she was confirmed by the senate to lead the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and days after Mr Kennedy Jr reportedly tried to push her out.

Four other senior scientists also quit the agency, reportedly in apparent frustration at Mr Kennedy's leadership and sceptical stance on vaccines.

Sources told CNN that Dr Monarez had clashed with Mr Kennedy over vaccine policies, including an upcoming announcement that could draw links between immunisations and autism.

Another source also told The New York Times that the pair had been at odds over vaccine policy.

Mr Kennedy Jr's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Dr Monarez was “no longer” director, less than a month after her senate confirmation.

Hours later, her lawyers responded that she had “neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired”.

A statement warned of the “the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts and the dangerous politicisation of science”.

“The attack on Dr Monarez is a warning to every American: Our evidence-based systems are being undermined from within,” it said.

The White House late on Wednesday announced that she had been fired.

Kush Desai, the White House's deputy press secretary, said Dr Monarez was not “aligned with the president's agenda of Making America Healthy Again”.

Because she had “refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC”, he added.

Dr Monarez refused to back down however, with her lawyer, Mark Zaid, saying: “As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her.

He went on: “For this reason, we reject notification Dr Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House counsel of our position.”

Mr Kennedy Jr, widely known as RFK, has a long track record of questioning the efficacy and safety of vaccines. He has denied that he wants to take vaccines away, but has pushed discredited claims that vaccines cause autism.

Dr Monarez said during her confirmation hearing that she had not seen evidence of such a link.

In June, Mr Kennedy Jr dismissed all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations.

The CDC has also been targeted for hefty budget cuts as part of Donald Trump's campaign to cut back federal spending.

Recommended

Earlier this month a man opened fire on the agency's Atlanta headquarters, killing a policeman.

Detectives later said the shooter had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal.

The union representing CDC workers said the incident “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect and vilification that CDC staff have endured”.

Dr Debra Houry, the CDC chief medical officer, and Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases, also resigned.

Dr Houry wrote in her resignation: “Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.”

Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say

As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside.

Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspected, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.

The shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but failed as the doors had been locked when mass began, Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara told NBC's Today show on Thursday morning. As a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn't get into the church “likely saved countless lives”, O'Hara said.

Online posts indicate that Westman's mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021. O'Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation.

“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.

“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noem said.

He said the incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets were fired through the windows.

“Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a gymnasium.

The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school.

Many knew each other well in a community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a suburb better described as a small town.

“I'm just asking [God]: ‘Why right now?' It's little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon.

Pope Leo XIV, who is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured in the “terrible tragedy”.

Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian. That request was granted in January 2020.

A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O'Hara said, adding it was believed they acted alone.

He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging from Donald Trump to antisemitic statements to gun rights.

As police continue to search for a potential motive, O'Hara said on Thursday that investigators were trying to obtain electronic search warrants to go through the shooter's devices. “Everything that we've seen so far is really a classic pathway to an active shooter,” he told NBC's Today show, but nothing specific had emerged yet in terms of motive for targeting this particular church.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”, but O'Hara declined to be drawn on the motive at news conference on Wednesday, restating only that investigations into a motive were ongoing.

At a briefing, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, said: “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.”

Later, Frey added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place of love for our kids. This is about them.”

One of the documented victims in the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.

The GoFundMe notes that Forchas's younger brother was also inside the school during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically injured.

Shooter tried to enter church to carry out attack but failed since doors had been locked when mass began, officials say

As Minneapolis grappled with the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school church in which two children were killed and 17 people injured, police said “countless lives” had been saved by the church doors being locked as the shooter had not been able to get inside.

Two children, aged eight and 10, were killed in the church pews during morning mass at the Annunciation Catholic school church. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were also injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to survive. Three adults, parishioners in their 80s, were also injured. Police said the suspect, Robin Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church.

As investigators continued to sift through evidence and search for a motive, they found Westman had a “deranged fascination” with mass shooters and wanted to gain notoriety, the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O'Hara, told a news conference. He said the shooter had expressed hate toward “almost every group imaginable” in writings they left behind. The acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson, added that they were “obsessed” with the idea of killing children.

Westman's mother worked at the church in the south of the city until 2021 and O'Hara confirmed that Westman had attended school and mass there, but said police had not identified a triggering event or a specific grievance against the church.

It also emerged on Thursday that the shooter had tried to get inside the church to carry out the attack, but had failed as the doors had been locked when mass began. O'Hara told NBC's Today show on Thursday morning that, as a result, they had fired through the windows, and the fact that they couldn't get into the church “likely saved countless lives”.

The shooter had visited the church several weeks ago, under the pretext of wanting to reconnect with the Catholic faith, as part of the planning for the attack, CNN reported on Thursday, citing a senior law enforcement official. Investigators believe that from that visit, Westman created the detailed, hand-drawn diagram of the church's interior that was shown on a video they scheduled to publish on YouTube around the time the attack began.

Adding to the likelihood that Westman intended to carry out the shooting from inside the church is a video in which they show wooden boards with smoke canisters attached, which they intended to place through the door handles of the emergency exits so students would be trapped inside. Had Westman been able to enter the church, victims who fled to the emergency exits would have found them blocked and filled with orange smoke, the official told CNN.

O'Hara also pointed to Westman's attempt to barricade doors using two-by-fours, telling CNN on Thursday that it seems to indicate “the shooter did intend to get inside”.

“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,”O'Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.

The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, called Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday.

“This level of violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noem said.

Stephanie Smyth, former television and radio journalist, is now an MPP for the Ontario Liberal Party, in the riding of Toronto-St. Paul's.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

In the early days of Doug Ford's first term as Ontario Premier, Stephanie Smyth says she used to get phone calls from him, voicing his displeasure about the news coverage on her TV channel, CP24.

As CP24's anchor and managing editor, she said she would always take the Premier's calls to hear what he had to say.

“Everybody thought, ‘Oh, Doug loves Steph.' And, ‘Oh, Steph's going to do what Doug wants.' And Steph didn't do what Doug wants,” she said.

“All you say is, ‘I will take a look.' And he'd be satisfied.”

After Ms. Smyth left journalism, she hadn't spoken to Mr. Ford in several years – until she found herself in the legislature this spring.

Ms. Smyth was one of five new Liberal MPPs elected in the February provincial election, returning the once-ruling Liberals to official party status for the first time since 2018. But the party still faces an uphill battle, with leader Bonnie Crombie failing to win a seat and the party remaining in third place in the legislature.

As the representative for the midtown riding of Toronto-St. Paul's, Ms. Smyth now sits across the aisle from the Premier, facing the man she has watched transform into a national public figure.

“I still look every day across and go, ‘Wow,'” Ms. Smyth said recently during an interview at a Mediterranean restaurant in her riding.

“What could be next? You know that no matter what, he's a master politician.”

Ms. Smyth, who hails from Toronto and studied journalism in London, Ont., made the leap into politics after more than three decades in broadcasting, first in radio and then TV.

Now 61, she said she lost her spark for news after the COVID-19 pandemic had receded, but she still felt curious about the world. After working in communications, she helped with Toronto councillor Brad Bradford's unsuccessful 2023 mayoral bid, as well as with Ms. Crombie's winning of the Ontario Liberal leadership.

Ms. Smyth describes herself as a centrist and said she has been approached by others to run for politics, although never by Mr. Ford.

“I've heard, ‘I always thought you were a Conservative. I thought you were a Liberal.' I was one of the, nobody really knew,” she said.

In her heart, she says, she follows “Liberal values.” 

She decided, after helping with Ms. Crombie's leadership, to run in St. Paul's in the February election, wresting the traditionally Liberal seat back from the NDP's Jill Andrew, who had held it since 2018. 

Ms. Smyth credits her win to a combination of hard work and timing. While she heard criticism of former prime minister Justin Trudeau at the doors, the Israel-Hamas war also played a role. The riding has a large Jewish population, and Ms. Smyth said many residents expressed concerns about the NDP's position on the conflict and the keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian resistance. 

“I think that was a real issue for the Jewish community,” she said.

Ms. Andrew was removed from the legislature last year after holding up the keffiyeh to her chest, in defiance of a ban on political attire issued by Ontario's then Speaker in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. (She also held up a tallit, a Jewish prayer cloth.)

In an interview, Ms. Andrew said she was against the ban, as she viewed it as an attack on Charter and human rights, adding that there were many Jewish people in the riding who supported her and that she has always stood up against antisemitism. 

For her part, Ms. Smyth said she is looking at introducing a private member's bill focused on provincial rules for bubble zones, the controversial measure adopted by several municipalities that bars protesters close to schools and religious institutions.

Despite not having spoken to the Premier in several years, Ms. Smyth said the two greeted each other warmly in the legislature this spring.

“He was very nice,” she said.

The former veteran broadcaster covered the Ford family for years. She first met the Premier's brother, the late Toronto mayor Rob Ford, in the early 2000s, when he appeared on radio to rail against the now infamous “gravy train” at city hall.

She recalls Doug Ford, then a city councillor, during an appearance on CP24 in which he criticized her colleague's coverage as Rob Ford faced a crack-cocaine scandal that dominated international headlines in 2013.

As Doug Ford walked off the set, Ms. Smyth said she swore at him for denigrating a fellow reporter. “He took it like a champ,” she recalls. (Mr. Ford's office declined to comment for this story.) 

But she says Doug Ford was always friendly to her at city hall and was easier to talk to than Rob Ford. “Rob and Doug were very different,” she says.

When she first came to Queen's Park in April, Ms. Smyth says she was intimidated by the legislature and the responsibility of being an elected official.

But despite the jitters, she says politics is not unlike her former profession.

“Even campaigning, you're doing like 1,000 interviews a day. So, transferable skills,” she said. 

Still, with only 14 MPPs, the Liberal caucus faces its share of challenges.

“It's tough being in opposition, I'm not going to lie, but you can fight for what you believe in, and you can fight for people who voted for you,” Ms. Smyth said.

As an early supporter of Ms. Crombie's leadership, Ms. Smyth thinks switching leaders at this point would be a mistake.

“I think it would be the worst thing if we had to bring in another person to kind of suddenly try to figure this all out,” she said.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) damaged a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.

According to the agency, during the operation, fighters from HUR's special unit "Prymary" damaged the ship's radar system using a drone strike, while special forces launched an attack directly on the missile carrier.

The missile ship, stationed in Temryuk Bay and ready to launch Kalibr missiles, was forced to retreat from its patrol zone after the attack, HUR said.

The agency published purported drone footage of the attack against the vessel.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

The Buyan-M-class ship, also designated Project 21631, is a small but heavily armed corvette capable of operating in shallow waters. The vessel was among the first Russian surface ships used to launch Kalibr missiles.

Repeated Ukrainian attacks using naval drones, missiles, and long-range drones have forced the Kremlin to reduce its naval presence in occupied Crimea.

Ukraine has destroyed several Russian vessels, including the Caesar Kunikov landing ship, the Sergei Kotov patrol ship, the Ivanovets missile corvette, and multiple high-speed landing crafts.

HUR also claimed on Aug. 21 that it had struck a Russian patrol boat in the Black Sea near the occupied town of Zaliznyi Port in Kherson Oblast, killing five crew members.

Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.



At least 18 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles.

Witkoff — a real estate mogul with no previous diplomatic experience — reportedly went to the meeting with Putin without a U.S. State Department notetaker.



"This Ukrainian film deserves greater international recognition, as it speaks on behalf of those who defend freedom and the right to live every single day," the Ukrainian Oscar Committee said.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described the strike as "an attack on Hungary's sovereignty," saying it "endangered our energy security and nearly (forced) the use of our strategic reserves."



"No diplomatic mission should ever be a target," top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said.

Russia launched 598 drones overnight, including Shahed attack drones and decoys, as well as 31 missiles, among them two Kh-47 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

"Efforts to address the aftermath of the attack are ongoing. The majority of the crew are safe, and the search for several missing sailors continues," Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

European and U.S. military officials have been increasingly concerned over the flights in the German state of Thuringia, even as Russian sabotage operations in Europe declined in 2025, the New York Times reported.

Among the 26 foreign heads of state and government expected to attend the parade in Beijing, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be the only leader of an EU country present.

Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) hit a Russian Buyan-M-class small missile ship, a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, near Russian-occupied Crimea in the Azov Sea on Aug. 28, HUR reported.

Ukrainian forces hit the Kuibyshev refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai overnight on Aug. 28, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

MOSCOW, August 28. /TASS/. Air defenses intercepted and destroyed 102 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

Drone fragments fell on the roof of a house in a village in the Rostov Region, and 89 people were evacuated from neighboring private houses due to the threat of detonation, Acting Governor Yury Slyusar said.

A fire covering an area of 200 square meters broke out in a forest after debris from a drone fell in Gelendzhik, the Krasnodar Region's operational headquarters said.

TASS has compiled the main information on the consequences of the attacks.

- Between 11:00 p.m. Moscow time on August 27 and 7:00 a.m. Moscow time on August 28 (between 8:00 p.m. GMT on August 27 and 4:00 a.m. GMT on August 28), air defenses intercepted and destroyed 102 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

- Twenty-two drones were intercepted and destroyed over the Black Sea, 21 over the Rostov and Samara Regions, 18 over the Krasnodar Region, 11 over Crimea, three over the Voronezh and Saratov Regions, two over the Volgograd Region, and one over the Azov Sea, the statement said.

- Drone fragments fell on the roof of a house in the village of Mankovo-Kalitvenskoye in the Rostov Region, Slyusar said.

- The fallen drone fragments damaged the electrical wiring, leaving the two-family house without power.

- Due to the threat of detonation of the warhead stuck in the roof, the residents of this house and 50 neighboring private houses were evacuated: a total of 89 people, including children, Slyusar specified.

- Most of the residents have temporarily moved in with relatives and friends, the acting governor noted, adding that 12 others are in a temporary shelter.

- Ten trains, including six passenger trains and four suburban trains, are delayed in the Samara Region, the Kuibyshev Railway said.

- Another three suburban trains have been canceled due to a drone crash near the Kryazh station, the statement noted.

- Fires broke out in a forest in the village of Krinitsa in Gelendzhik, the Krasnodar Region's operational headquarters said.

- Three fires covering a total area of 200 square meters were detected.

- Fourteen people and four pieces of equipment were involved in extinguishing the fires, the statement said.

- The headquarters also specified that the consequences of the drone attack are being eliminated in the Seversky district.

- In both cases, there were no casualties, and emergency and special services are working on site.

- At the Petrov Val station, debris from a drone caused a fire in a building unrelated to passenger infrastructure, the Volga Railway's Telegram channel said.

- According to preliminary information, there were no casualties.

- Several passenger trains were delayed.

- Train traffic through the Petrov Val station in the Volgograd region has now resume.

Activists and supporters of publisher Jimmy Lai gather for the national security trial in Taipei, Taiwan, on Aug. 24.ChiangYing-ying/The Associated Press

The case against Hong Kong newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai is “detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis” and rife with “Orwellian Doublespeak,” his lawyers said in their closing submission, as Mr. Lai's marathon national security trial wrapped up this week. 

Mr. Lai, 77, was arrested in 2020 amid a crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, after months of often-violent protests the year before prompted Beijing to impose a draconian national security law on the semi-autonomous territory. 

Since then, he has spent more than 1,600 days in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, and almost two months testifying on the stand, as prosecutors sought to paint him as a key instigator of the 2019 protests and a nefarious agent of the West. 

Facing charges of sedition and colluding with foreign forces, Mr. Lai's final act as a journalist has been to “speak truth to power” in his own defence, his lawyers wrote in a more than 380-page submission to the court. 

“It is not wrong to support freedom of expression. It is not wrong to support human rights,” said barrister Robert Pang. “Nor is it wrong to hope that the government would change its policies, whether through its own internal review or through suggestion or even pressure, whether from inside Hong Kong or out.” 

Opinion: As the democratic world lines up behind Jimmy Lai, Canadian leadership is badly needed

The national security law under which Mr. Lai has been charged has a more than 90-per-cent conviction rate, and most observers have long predicted the publisher of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper will be found guilty, with many alleging the case against him is predetermined – something the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly rebutted. 

Founded in 1995, two years before Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule, Apple Daily was by far the territory's most-popular tabloid before it was closed down in 2021. 

At its best a muckraking investigative outlet that pulled few punches, at its worst a celebrity and scandal-focused pioneer of paparazzi snooping, Apple Daily was always a strident advocate for greater democracy in Hong Kong, cheering on multiple protest movements and holding China's government to account for promises it made in assuming control over the former British colony. This stand made both the newspaper and Mr. Lai a bête noir for Chinese officials and state media.

Hong Kong pro-democracy businessman Jimmy Lai was provided with medication and a heart monitor for the start of his final submissions in a landmark national security trial, following health concerns over heart palpitations.

Mr. Lai's son Sebastien has said he fully expects his father to be found guilty, and his focus is on securing some kind of compassionate release after conviction. The younger Mr. Lai has been lobbying Western governments to take up Jimmy Lai's case, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who this month promised Washington would “do everything we can” to help, even potentially raising his case with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. 

And yet, going on court proceedings alone, Mr. Lai's conviction could feel like less than a done deal. The national security law is not retroactive, and prosecutors have struggled to make their case that an alleged conspiracy by Mr. Lai and others to lobby for international sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials – a crime now but not before July, 2020 – continued beyond the legislation being enacted. 

“In August, 2019, it was not possible to have a ‘conspiracy' in the relevant sense,” Mr. Lai's lawyers wrote in their submission to the court. “An agreement to carry out a lawful act is not a criminal conspiracy.” 

Indeed, they said, the “sheer quantity of evidence” relied upon by the prosecution from before passage of the national security law “serves only to highlight the paucity of evidence” from when the legislation was in force. 

“Faced with the discrepancy between the evidence and the prosecution case, the prosecution has dug its heels deep in its closing,” Mr. Lai's lawyers said. 

“Its allegations keep getting wilder, detached from any legal, logical, and factual basis. Bold conclusions are asserted without any attempt to justify them. ... Mr. Lai's last act as a journalist is to speak truth to power against this Orwellian Doublespeak.”

Prosecutor Anthony Chau argued last week that Mr. Lai had an “unwavering intent” to solicit sanctions through collaborations with foreign officials that were “long-term and persistent,” and extended beyond the passage of the national security law. 

The panel of three judges overseeing the case, all hand-picked by Hong Kong leader John Lee to handle national security trials, have at times seemed skeptical of the prosecution's case, though they have also forcefully challenged Mr. Pang on several occasions. 

Last Friday, Justice Esther Toh pointed to recent arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States and Britain to dismiss Mr. Pang's assertion that Mr. Lai's criticisms of China were legally protected speech, arguing all countries had limits on what could be said. 

“So it's good to say, la di da, freedom of expression, it's not illegal,” Justice Toh said. “Well, that's true, but it's not absolute.”

As well as the national security charges, which carry a potential life sentence, Mr. Lai is also accused of breaching a colonial-era sedition law – in force since 1938 – which has been resurrected and widely used by prosecutors since the 2019 protests. His maximum conviction under that law is three years. 

During a lengthy back-and-forth with Mr. Pang on Tuesday about the crime of sedition, Justice Toh blamed the media for seeking to “whip the common people into a frenzy” in 2019. Her fellow judge, Alex Lee, also suggested criticisms of the government by Apple Daily from that time could be crimes under the sedition law, the scope of which has been greatly expanded by several recent cases. 

Serious questions have been raised about Mr. Lai's health after his long incarceration, and proceedings were delayed earlier this month so he could be fitted with a heart monitor. Waving and smiling at supporters in court this week however, he seemed healthy and energized. 

Final procedural matters are due to wrap up by Thursday, but a verdict may not come for weeks, if not months.

Redistricting based on race is unconstitutional, Louisiana's attorney general told the Supreme Court on Aug. 27 in a preview of arguments that the state will make in an important upcoming election law case.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her state has long argued that the Supreme Court's “redistricting jurisprudence needs to be drastically changed or overruled.”

Weston Halsne was sitting next to the windows of the Church of Annunciation when a volley of bullets suddenly shattered the stained-glass panes.

As gunfire continued to tear through the Minneapolis church, the ten-year-old ran and hid under one of the wooden pews facing the altar and covered his head.

As he cowered in terror away from the gunfire, his friend Victor lay across him. He credits him with saving his life.

“He laid on top of me, but he got hit,” he said. “He was really brave”.

Moments before gunfire sprayed the hall, Annunciation Catholic School pupils had been filing into the church, filled with the excitement of the first morning Mass of the school year.

Monday had been the first day back at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy neighbourhood about 5 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.

But as the children took their seats, just before 8.30am (2.30pm UK) on Wednesday, transgender shooter Robin Westman was stalking the building outside.

Dressed in black and camouflage and armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun, Westman barricaded church doors with wooden planks before firing his rifle at the children through the side of the building, their heads bent in prayer.

Within seconds of the first bullets piercing the glass, staff desperately tried to move the pupils under the pews in an effort to shield them from the onslaught.

Two children, aged eight and ten, were struck and killed by the torrent of gunfire.

Another 14 children aged six to 15 were injured, two critically. Three parishioners in their eighties were also hurt, although all the injured victims were expected to survive.

Among those rushed to hospital, where medics frantically moved patients out of rooms to make way for the victims, was Victor, who Weston says he thinks is “okay”.

While officers had still not confirmed the number of bullets fired during Westman's rampage, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the number of rounds was “in the dozens”.

“The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Mr O'Hara said.

“Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. “These kids were literally praying.”

Ellie Mertens, a youth pastor at Annunciation Catholic School, had also been sitting in a pew next to a window when Westman opened fire.

“It was an automatic gun and I was near kids and we all got down,” Ms Mertens told NBC News.

One parent who was inside the church during the attack said a police officer tried to run after the gunman as bullets were being fired.

Shea McAdaragh told CNN the officer came into the church during the shooting and then ran off to try and find the shooter.

“He was just a normal, every day beat cop. No special equipment, no special helmet or anything and he just immediately ran toward the direction of the shooter,” Mr McAdaragh said.

After carrying out his twisted attack, Westman shot himself dead in the car park, according to the Minneapolis police chief.

Officers found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene. Fox News reported the device was scrawled with the words “Jew gas”.

Before going on his killing spree, Westman had posted a series of YouTube videos showcasing his manifesto and large arsenal of weapons.

Westman's mother Mary is believed to be a retired employee of the school.

In one video, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, along with a pistol, shotgun, and a semi-automatic rifle, which were later used to carry out the massacre, were strewn over Westman's bed.

A notebook shown in one of the clips, which have now been removed, included a drawing that appears to be a map of the Annunciation Catholic Church.

As the shooting unfolded, dozens of officers descended on the church to provide first aid and rescue children who had been hiding throughout the building.

Many of the first responders were “deeply traumatised by what they saw”, Mr O'Hara said.

Hours later, terrified parents stood outside the reunification area, waiting for information about their children.

Amid a crowd of heavy law enforcement later that morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school.

Tearful students from neighbouring high schools that had been on lockdown began arriving in search of news about their friends and siblings who had been inside the church.

Those who were reunited with their loved ones embraced their children before rushing them away from the scene.

Others were not so lucky.

Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senator, said one of her staff members' children had to tell her friend's father his daughter had been struck.

“These kids are doing an all-school Mass and had to watch several of her friends get shot — one in the back, one in the neck,” Ms Klobuchar told MSNBC.

“And they all got down under the pews and she, her daughter, of course, was not shot, but her daughter ended up being the one to tell one of the dads of one of the other kids that his daughter had been shot.”

Lisa Elm, a resident in the area for more than 20 years, told The Telegraph the area is a “quiet, sweet community”.

“It's a neighbourhood where people come together”, she said.

Outside Westman's home, a quiet apartment complex just a 20-minute walk from the school, neighbours described being shocked a killer had been living next door.

Aicha Kallo, a mother who lives in a neighbouring building to Westman, told The Telegraph: “It's just so scary, you know, to have a shooter next door to you, and you have a kid. And those innocent children, they don't deserve to die like that”, she said.

She added: “Living in a neighbourhood you think you're safe and the next thing you have something like this. My heart goes out to the parents and those innocent kids.”

As the community continued to grapple with the tragedy, Weston's grandfather, Michael Simpson, said the violence left him questioning why God had not been watching over the dozens of children.

“I don't know where He is,” Mr Simpson said.

An Israeli official accused of trying to meet a 15-year-old girl for sex outside Las Vegas has been ordered to appear via video link next week after he missed his arraignment hearing on Wednesday, local media reported.

Tom Alexandrovich, a senior cybersecurity official with the Israeli government, was one of eight people arrested as part of a multi-week operation by Nevada and federal authorities targeting “child sex predators,” according to an August 15 statement from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

He was due to be at a court in Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, on Wednesday for a felony arraignment hearing, according to court records.

Local media, including the Las Vegas Review-Journal and local news station KLAS-TV, said he skipped the hearing. The Review-Journal quoted his lawyers as saying they had agreed with the district attorney's office that Alexandrovich did not have to appear in person.

The judge was quoted by the newspaper as saying the district attorney's office had no authority to make that agreement and ordered his appearance next week. The outlets said Alexandrovich's lawyers arranged for him to appear remotely via Zoom.

Messages left by Reuters with the district attorney's office were not returned. The court docket showed that a new arraignment hearing had been set for September 3. Alexandrovich's lawyers said in an e-mail that their client “will appear by Zoom as permitted by the Court.” Attempts to reach Alexandrovich have been unsuccessful.

Alexandrovich was arrested in Henderson after arranging to meet a decoy posing as a teenage girl, according to a police report cited by local media. He quickly posted bail and returned to Israel, drawing international scrutiny and raising questions over whether the U.S. or Israeli governments had exerted any pressure to speed his release.

In comments to the local media, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, whose office has jurisdiction over Las Vegas and Henderson, called the bail conditions “standard” and said there had been no special treatment. The U.S. State Department has said the American government had no involvement in the case.

DENVER (AP) — 

The U.S. Education Department said Thursday that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX protections against sex-based discrimination in education by creating all-gender bathrooms and allowing students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.

The finding followed an unprecedented probe of Denver's East High School that marked a sharp departure from the department's investigations under former Democratic President Joe Biden. It's part of a push by President Donald Trump's Republican administration against local and state policies that make allowances for transgender students. 

The investigation in Denvber began after the school district converted a girl's restroom into an all-gender restroom while leaving another bathroom on the same floor exclusive to boys in January. The school district has said that was done as a result of a student-led process and the bathroom had 12-foot (3.6-meter) tall partitions for privacy and security.

The school district later added a second all-gender restroom on the same floor which it said was meant to address concerns of unfairness. At the time it said that students would also continue to have access to gender-specific restrooms and single-stall, all-gender bathrooms.

The Education Department said it offered the school district a chance to voluntarily make changes, including converting multi-stall, all-gender bathrooms back to ones designated by gender, within 10 days or risk unspecified enforcement action.

It also wants the district to use biology-based definitions for the words “male” and “female” in all policies and practices related to Title IX and to rescind any policies or guidance allowing students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex.




“Denver is free to endorse a self-defeating gender ideology, but it is not free to accept federal taxpayer funds and harm its students in violation of Title IX,” Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights, said in a news release.

Denver Public Schools officials said they had received the results of the investigation and were “determining our next steps.”

The Trump administration has launched about two dozen investigations of transgender policies in schools, including access to sports, locker rooms and bathrooms, according to data compiled by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit news organization. Roughly half of the investigations focus at least in part on who gets to use bathrooms in some K-12 school districts in Virginia, Kansas, Washington state and Colorado.

Trump signed an executive order in February to block trans girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Supporters said the move restored fairness in athletic competitions, but opponents called it an attack on transgender youth.

Federal officials in June determined that California's Department of Education violated civil rights law by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams. Officials under Trump also have sued Maine over the participation of transgender athletes in girl's sports and last month launched an investigation into Oregon's Department of Education, following a complaint from a conservative group about transgender girls on girls sports teams.

Police said Thursday that the shooter who killed two Catholic school students and wounded 18 other people inside a church idolized mass killers. The shooter fired 116 rifle rounds into the church on Wednesday morning. (AP video by Mark Vancleave).

The shooter who killed two children and injured 18 worshippers attending Mass at a Minneapolis Catholic school was quiet and seemed to resent school as an eighth grader there seven years ago, a former classmate said.

Officials identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23, and said Thursday that Westman was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School. The ex-classmate recalled Westman once hid in the bathroom to avoid going to the all-school Mass. YouTube videos allegedly posted by the shooter suggest Westman experienced depression and expressed admiration for at least a dozen other acts of mass violence, but didn't spell out any specific ideology.

Armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol, Westman approached the side of the church at Annunciation Catholic School and fired more than a hundred rounds through the windows just before 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. Westman was found dead in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot. 

Westman legally purchased the weapons, had no arrest history and acted alone, the chief said. 

In response to a request for any records of police contact with the shooter in the last decade, the Eagan Police Department, southwest of Minneapolis, sent two heavily redacted documents. The first from 2018 is listed as a mental health call for a welfare check for a child with parents Mary Grace Westman and James Westman, but the case narrative was redacted. A second report from 2016 involving a criminal complaint was entirely redacted.

Officials have recovered hundreds of pieces of evidence from the church and three associated residences in the area, including additional writings and electronic devices, O'Hara said. Authorities also were scouring the videos, now removed from public view, and other online content.




The FBI is investigating Wednesday's shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, officials said.

Lily Kletter, 22, couldn't figure out why Robin Westman's face looked so familiar until she looked back at a photo from the Annunciation Class of 2017.

“I didn't know them super well, but they were in my grade,” Kletter said of Robin Westman, known to classmates as Bob. 

Their class was small, about 50 kids, most of whom had known each other since they were little, Kletter said. Robin Westman came in at some point in middle school, she said.

Kletter remembered Westman from a few classes, saying Westman would sit in the back and “kind of skulk around.” Westman had a couple of friends, but Kletter remembers often seeing Westman sitting alone during their short, 15-minute lunch break.

“I remember they had a crazy distaste for school, especially Annunciation, which I always thought was pretty interesting because their mom was on the parish board,” she said. “I remember this one time, like, them hiding in the bathroom for a really long time because … they didn't want to go to Mass.”

An August 2021 post on the Facebook page for the Church of the Annunciation celebrated the retirement of Mary Grace Westman after five years working there.

Kletter remembers Robin's mom, Mary Grace, even more. She worked in the front office at school and in the parish. Kletter said their school curriculum included confirmation, one of Catholicism's seven sacraments, often seen as the “sacrament of maturity' where young people declare their faith. Mary Grace Westman led some of the classes on how faith could be weaved into their lives, Kletter said.

Robin Westman was in that class but didn't participate and was not confirmed, Kletter said. “They sat in the back quietly,” she said. 

A phone call and text message to a cellphone number listed as belonging to Mary Grace Westman was not answered Wednesday afternoon. Officials also have not yet successfully reached the shooter's mother, O'Hara said on Thursday.

Associated Press reporters unsuccessfully attempted to reach the shooter's father at an address listed as his residence. Phone calls and text messages to numbers associated with Robin Westman's siblings also were not answered.

Police have not yet identified any particular grievance or triggering event with the church, O'Hara said.

Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned anyone who would use the shooting to villainize the transgender community.

Westman's gender identity wasn't clear. In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman's mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”

Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, told The Associated Press he barely knew Robin Westman — the youngest child of one of his sisters — but was watching coverage of Wednesday's tragedy.

“I wish he had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer added.

A spokesperson for RISE, a medical marijuana dispensary company, confirmed that Westman worked at one of its Minnesota dispensaries for “several months this year,” but said Westman was not employed with RISE at the time of the shooting. 

Police said they were aware of videos and writings that may have come from the shooter. On a YouTube channel titled “Robin W” there were at least two videos posted before the channel was taken down by site administrators. The videos never show the face of the person speaking.

On display throughout the videos are specific references to more than 15 different perpetrators and episodes of mass violence in the U.S. and abroad, both recent and from before the shooter was born.

In one, the video pans across a cache of weapons and ammunition and the person filming picks each up and shows it off to the camera. The weapons and magazines were tagged with graffiti showing a fascination with people who had committed acts of public violence and included things like, “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?”

During the video, the person filming sings the word “tomorrow” and says, “I'm sorry to my family... that's the only people I'm sorry to.” 

The video also shows a letter written to the person's family, apologizing for what the shooting will mean for them, expressing love for them and saying to change their name and “move on.” The letter noted that they long felt depression and had suicidal thoughts and have thought about doing this for a long time, but only recently decided to carry out the shooting.

A second, almost 20-minute-long video shows nearly 200 pages of two different journals mostly written in what appears to be the Cyrillic alphabet. 

The second journal had a last entry dated Aug. 21 and had a sticker on the inside cover depicting a semiautomatic AK-style rifle on top of a trans equality pride flag. During the video, the person flips to what appears to be a drawing of the layout of a church, pointing to two outside windows and then stabbing the illustration with a knife.

A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration's effort to remove Michael Abramowitz as director of Voice of America was “plainly contrary to the law.”

United States District Judge Royce Lamberth handed down a decision stating Abramowitz cannot be removed from his position without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board, which President Donald Trump dismissed in January. 

After starting his second term, Trump dispatched Kari Lake to target the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a government-funded media outlet encompassing VOA. The Trump administration believes USAGM and VOA are corrupted institutions that have strayed from their founding mission and become partisan arbiters of biased information. 

Abramowitz, along with hundreds of other VOA employees, was placed on administrative leave earlier this year after Trump issued an executive order seeking to trim USAGM to its “minimum presence and function required by law.” Lake has sought to fire hundreds of USAGM employees since Trump took office, as she has become the president's top henchman in seeking to root corruption out of the media department by essentially shutting it down. 

Lamberth's ruling on Thursday comes after Abramowitz sued Lake, arguing that her move to fire him was illegal. 

The judge ordered Abramowitz's reinstatement, saying the director must remain in his role until he can be lawfully removed by the broadcaster's board, which suggests Trump could be forced to reinstate all the members of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board he fired in January.

“To the extent the Board's current lack of quorum institutes a practical barrier to removing Abramowitz, the Broadcast Act gives the President a straightforward remedy: replacing the removed members,” Lamberth wrote. 

JUDGE BLOCKS KARI LAKE AND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM PULLING RADIO FREE EUROPE FUNDING

In a separate ruling on Monday, Lambirth ordered Lake to submit to questioning under oath regarding accusations she is violating mandates not to dismantle VOA. 

In turn, Lake has blasted the Washington, D.C., judge, saying she's “got a judge who's threatening me with contempt of court, throwing me in prison, if I don't produce more of the propaganda that he wants me to produce.”

Senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports the latest on the feud between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as the administration contemplates federal action to curb violence in the state.

There is no reason for Americans to live in fear as President Donald Trump floats mobilizing National Guard troops to other cities to address crime like he has in Washington, the White House insists. 

While Illinois leaders, including Gov. JB Pritzker, have made it clear they aren't interested in receiving National Guard troops in Chicago, the White House said it would welcome requests from Republican and Democratic leaders for additional law enforcement support to reduce crime in American cities. 

"This is our message to Americans in Democrat-run cities nationwide: decline is a choice," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday. "You don't have to live in constant fear of being robbed, raped or murdered. Your leaders are lying to you, and they have been failing you for decades.

"Governor Pritzker should spend less time demonizing the police, more time trying to recruit more police and more time trying to call the president of the United States to get crime in his city under control," Leavitt said. "The president wants to allow law enforcement, whether it's state, local, federal, to do their jobs, to arrest criminals, to put them behind bars and to remove public safety threats from American communities. He'll continue to do that." 

Pritzker, a Democrat who hasn't ruled out running for president in 2028, has pushed back against the possibility of National Guard troops arriving in Chicago to address crime and said Monday the move would be "unconstitutional" and "un-American." 

"Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish its dissidents and score political points," Pritzker said. "If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is — a dangerous power grab."

Meanwhile, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement Friday that crime is down in Chicago and said the city in the past year has reduced homicides by more than 30%, robberies by 35% and shootings by almost 40%.

But the White House has continued to point to local reports that Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city for the past 13 years, as of the most recent 2024 data.

"For 13 consecutive years, Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city," Leavitt said Thursday. "This is JB Pritzker's legacy, by the way."

"He should put politics aside," Leavitt said. "He should pick up the phone and call this president, who would be more than happy to do right by law-abiding American residents in the city of Chicago. And we hope that he will." 

Chicago does not have the most murders per capita and isn't listed in the top five cities for murder per capita in compilations of 2024 FBI data. 

Trump disclosed plans Aug. 11 to mobilize troops from the D.C. National Guard and to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital. Since then, Trump has indicated he might dispatch National Guard troops to other cities in the U.S., including Chicago. 

"We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less," Trump told reporters Monday morning. "But within one week we'll have no crime in Chicago, like no crime in D.C."

Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) slammed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday, telling him to “shut up” for suggesting that psychiatric drugs taken by children could be connected to school shootings, including the shooting in Minneapolis on Wednesday. 

A gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School, killing two children and injuring 17 other people. 

“I dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don't kill kids, antidepressants do,” Smith said on X. “Just shut up. Stop peddling bull****. You should be fired.”

There are 400 million guns in this country. More guns than people.In America, we are ten times more likely to be shot in a school or playground than any other developed nation.

RFK Jr. appeared on Fox & Friends on Thursday, where he suggested serotonin reuptake inhibitors could be to blame for school shootings. 

Fox & Friends cohost Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if his agency is examining possible connections between mass shootings and “drugs that are used in order to make that [gender] transition” happen. 

Robin Westman, the 23-year-old gunman in the Minnesota shooting, was born male and at 17 years old, applied for a name change to reflect a gender identity transition to female. 

“At [the National Institutes of Health], we're launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence,” Kennedy said. “Many of [the drugs] have black box warnings that warn of suicidal ideation and homicidal ideation, so we can't exclude those as a culprit.”

IN FOCUS FORUM: IS RFK JR. MAKING AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN?

Kennedy has long been a critic of SSRIs and pushed a similar theory last year when he told Tesla CEO Elon Musk during an X Spaces conversation that “prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events.” 

According to public health and medical researchers, SSRIs are prescribed for depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders, which are diagnoses common among transgender people. The drugs are not used to treat gender dysphoria specifically. 

Many researchers have pushed back on Kennedy's claims. Medical studies show that most mass shooters suffer from untreated mental illness, and that there is no evidence connecting psychiatric drugs to mass shootings. 

It is currently unknown if Westman took SSRIs or underwent hormone therapies. 

The shooting has stirred up national conversations around gun violence, with Democrats arguing that the real cause of mass shootings is easy access to high-powered firearms. 

“There are 400 million guns in this country. More guns than people,” Smith said in a follow-up post on X. “In America, we are ten times more likely to be shot in a school or playground than any other developed nation.” 

US MOURNS MINNEAPOLIS ANNUNCIATION CHURCH SHOOTING: ‘HUG YOUR KIDS CLOSE' 

Conservative commentators and influencers have focused on Westman's alleged gender change as a reason for the shooting, and fixated on Audrey Hale, a transgender person who killed six people at a Nashville elementary school in 2023.

A Violence Prevention Project report that analyzed almost 200 mass shootings between 1996 and 2004 found that only one was committed by a transgender person. The report defines a “mass shooting” as “four or more people shot and killed, excluding the shooter, in a public location, with no connection to underlying criminal activity, such as gangs or drugs.”

            President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that mandates all federal buildings “embrace classical architecture.”
    


            “In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture,” reads a White House fact sheet on the order, which specifically takes aim at brutalist architecture.
    


            The White House does not traditionally wade into architectural decisions, but the president — ever the real estate businessman — has initiated several renovations to impose his style on the White House complex.
    


            The order calls for the construction of federal buildings in a way that “uplifts and beautifies public spaces” and “commands respect from the general public.”
    


            The administrator of the General Services Administration will be charged with implementing the order, and the assistant to the president for domestic policy must notify the president of any construction that departs from “the preferred style” — including brutalist, deconstructivist or other modernist styles.
    


            “In the 1960s, the Federal Government largely replaced traditional designs for new construction with modernist and brutalist ones,” the fact sheet reads, arguing that those styles were “often unpopular with Americans.”
    


            Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, whose organization helped the White House with drafting Thursday's executive order, told CNN that he is “overjoyed” by the president's order.
    


            “The president is to be commended for requiring that new federal buildings be noble, beautiful and admired by the general public, as the executive order recognizes, and as our organization has long been advocating,” Shubow said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Classical public architecture is time honored, timeless, and the mode most associated with our national values and a form of government is quite simply, the architecture of American democracy.”
    


            Trump has already applied his aesthetic vision to the nation's capital, overseeing White House renovations that include paving over the grass in the Rose Garden and installing yellow-striped umbrellas to mimic the patio at Mar-a-Lago. The president also oversaw the installation of a pair of gigantic flagpoles on the White House lawn that fly large American flags.
    


            Construction is also set to begin in September on a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, fulfilling the president's 15-year ambition to construct an event space on the White House grounds that expands the building's entertaining capacity — but also resembles the gilded spaces of his private clubs. Renderings provided by the White House depict a vast space with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, gold floor lamps and a checkered marble floor.
    


            And inside the White House, the Oval Office itself has been adorned with lashings of gold decoration, which Trump ordered up from a craftsman in Florida who'd worked on his Palm Beach estate, people familiar with the matter said.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida taxpayers could be on the hook for $218 million the state spent to convert a remote training airport in the Everglades into an immigration detention center dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz.”

The center may soon be completely empty as a judge upheld her decision late Wednesday ordering operations to wind down indefinitely.

Shutting down the facility for the time being would cost the state $15 million to $20 million immediately, and it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if Florida is allowed to reopen it, according to court filings by the state.

The Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the airport suitable for a detention center, a state official said in court papers.

Built in just a few days, the facility consists of chain-link cages surrounding large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. 

An Associated Press analysis of publicly available state spending data showed that Florida has signed at least $405 million in vendor contracts to build and operate the facility, which officials had initially estimated would cost $450 million a year to run. A previous AP review found that as of late July, the state had already allocated at least $245 million to run the site, which opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

The center has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system. 




It's also facing several legal challenges, including one that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled on late Wednesday. She denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations, after agreeing last week with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe that the state and federal defendants didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

The Miami judge said the number of detainees was already dwindling and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.” That's despite Department of Homeland Security lawyers saying the judge's order would disrupt that enforcement.

When asked, the Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say how many detainees remained and how many had been moved out since the judge's temporary injunction last week.

“DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities,” the department said Thursday in an emailed statement.

Environmental activist Jessica Namath, who has kept a nearly constant watch outside the facility's gates, said Thursday that fellow observers had seen metal framing for tents hauled out but no signs of the removal of FEMA trailers or portable bathrooms. 

“It definitely seems like they have been winding down operations,” Namath said.

Based on publicly available contract data, The Associated Press estimated the state allocated $50 million for the bathrooms. Detainees and advocates have described toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, although officials dispute such descriptions.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees as of last week, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to a rabbi about chaplaincy services.

Funding is central to the federal government's arguments that Williams' order should be overturned by an appellate court. 

Homeland Security attorneys said in a court filing this week that federal environmental law doesn't apply to a state like Florida, and the federal government isn't responsible for the detention center since it hasn't spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of the detention center.

“No final federal funding decisions have been made,” the attorneys said.

Almost two dozen Republican-led states also urged the appellate court to overturn the order. The 22 states argued in another court filing that the judge overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system.

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.”

Hollywood stars, employees accused talk show host of having a toxic work environment. Fox News' Carley Shimkus reports on the accusations against Ellen DeGeneres.

Ellen DeGeneres faces renewed criticism after fresh accusations surfaced this week about her alleged toxic behavior on her long-running daytime talk show.

A former cameraman on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" accused the television host of fostering a hostile workplace where staffers lived in fear and sometimes had to give up family commitments.

According to staffers, DeGeneres, 67, disliked male employees and allegedly turned cold when they interacted with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, 52. Crew members also recalled what insiders called the infamous "Ellen gaze."

One former staffer described the look as "a queen searching for her next execution," adding, "She was terrifying."

De Rossi was described as "nice" and approachable with the crew, but employees said their jobs felt at risk if DeGeneres saw them chatting with her spouse.

"You just hoped and prayed you weren't seated by her wife, so you didn't get her attention," the ex-staffer told the Daily Mail Tuesday. 

"We went through a lot of male employees," the former staffer continued, alleging that DeGeneres once burned through nine stage managers in a single season.

"We had a feeling she really didn't like guys."

Celebrity guests also faced difficulties on the set of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," according to former employees.

ELLEN DEGENERES BLAMES TRUMP FOR HER US EXODUS

The insider claimed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment in which he embarrassed DeGeneres by saying she used rancid meat during a demo.

"He gave her some quip. They were doing a food test together, and Ellen offered him a sample first," the former employee recalled. "As soon as he bit in, he said, ‘This is rubbish. This is disgusting.' She didn't like the reaction. It was about eight seasons before he came back."

Comedian Greg Fitzsimmons, a former "Ellen" writer, reinforced the claims, labeling his ex-boss a "control freak" who oversaw a toxic environment.

"A lot of crying in the hallways," he alleged during a podcast appearance.

The latest allegations revive the backlash that hit DeGeneres in 2020, when several ex-employees accused the show of racism, intimidation and retaliation.

DeGeneres apologized on-air at the time, saying she had been unaware of the environment.

The uproar led to an internal investigation. In July 2020, BuzzFeed News reported that current and former employees blamed three producers for creating a culture of fear.

Warner Bros. told Fox News at the time it "takes the recent allegations around the show's workplace culture very seriously" and conducted interviews with staff to assess conditions.

In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. 

She referenced the allegations in her 2024 comedy special, "Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval." There, she said, "I got kicked out of show business for being mean. Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown.

"I used to say, ‘I don't care what people say about me.' Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity. I am many things, but I am not mean."

By 2025, DeGeneres had moved to the U.K. countryside, claiming she was the victim of "misogynistic" backlash after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election.

Reps for DeGeneres did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

President Donald Trump has fired one of two Democratic members of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to break a 2-2 tie before the body considers the largest railroad merger ever proposed.

Board member Robert E. Primus said on LinkedIn that he received an email from the White House Wednesday night terminating the position he has held since he was appointed by Trump in his first term. The vacancy would allow Trump to appoint two additional Republicans to the board before its decision on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger though the Senate would have to confirm them.

Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific's acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition. He was named Board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Board member Patrick Fuchs to Chairman.

This follows Trump's previous firings of board members at the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Reserve, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are all supposed to be independent agencies.

“Robert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.”

Primus said he doesn't think the firing is valid because the White House didn't offer any cause for it, and he plans to fight. He also rejected their explanation for the move because he has long tried to encourage railroads to serve every industry better and help them grow, but he has already been removed from the STB website.




“I've been pro growth across the board in terms of encouraging growth in the freight rail network, which in turn will grow our national economy. So if that's not being in line with America first, then I don't know what America he's saying is first,” Primus said to The Associated Press.

He said the firings at all these agencies threaten their independence and credibility. Primus said in his tenure the STB always strove to be impartial and apolitical. 

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who serves on the Commerce Committee, said it's clear that “Donald Trump is trying to stack the deck so the federal government rubberstamps the merger as a huge favor for Wall Street and wealthy railroad owners.” She said Primus has been a fair regulator who worked hard to make sure railroads delivered for their customers and focused on safety.

Every rail worker union and the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association also quickly condemned the firing.

“The explanation provided for this decision — that his position has been “eliminated” — is nothing short of outrageous. Appointed bodies established through federal code are not designed to be erased at the whim of powerful corporate interests,” said the SMART-TD union that represents concductors. “This action is unprecedented, unlawful in spirit, and reeks of direct interference from hedge funds and the nation's largest rail carriers.”

The board is set to consider Union Pacific's $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern in the next two years before deciding whether to approve the nation's first transcontinental railroad and reduce the number of major freight railroads in the U.S. to five.

Primus said the biggest problems in the industry are the lack of growth and poor service after all the deep cuts railroads have made over the last decade in the interest of efficiency and improving profitability. He hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal, but he doesn't think mergers will necessarily improve competition.

“We don't need to merge to increase competition. We need to understand that we have to grow,” he said.

NEWBERN, Ala. (AP) — The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after white residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve.

Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent's 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government that drew national attention.

“The people came out and spoke and voted. Now, there ain't no doubt what they want for this town,” Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night.

The election Tuesday was the town's first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's “hand-me-down governance” and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.

Newbern's residents number just 133 people. A library, the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Selma. 

What the town had been without is elections. 

Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held “hand-me-down” positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others. The result was an overwhelmingly white government in a town where Black residents outnumber white residents 2-1.

Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the non-partisan position of mayor, and since was the only candidate, he became the mayor-elect without an election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. 




But the locks were changed at the town hall and Braxton was denied access to the town's financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and “fraudulently re-appointed themselves as the town council.”

“I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,” said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle. 

Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was “invalid.” 

The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025. 

Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, credited “Mayor Braxton's refusal to allow his constituents to be disenfranchised.” The group endorsed Braxton in the race.

Braxton had one challenger this time — a white auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole. 

The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any “doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.”

“It feels good the second time,” Braxton said.

NEW YORK (AP) — About 780,000 pressure washers sold at retailers like Home Depot are being recalled across the U.S. and Canada, due to a projectile hazard that has resulted in fractures and other injuries among some consumers.

According to a Thursday recall notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is recalling certain models of its Ryobi-branded electric pressure washers because the products' capacitor can overheat and burst, “causing parts to be forcefully ejected.”

That poses serious impact risks to users or bystanders. To date, the CPSC notes, the power tool and equipment company has received 135 reports of capacitors overheating in the U.S. — including 41 reports of explosions that resulted in 32 injuries and/or fractures to consumers' fingers, hands, face and eyes. A corresponding notice from Health Canada noted that no additional incidents were reported in Canada.

Consumers in possession of the now-recalled pressure washers are urged to stop using them immediately and visit Ryobi's recall website to learn about how to receive a free repair kit, which includes a replacement capacitor.

The Ryobi washers under recall have model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM. About 764,000 were sold in the U.S., in addition to 16,000 in Canada.

In the U.S. these products were sold at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024, the CPSC notes, for about $300 to $400 in stores and online.




TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is a subsidary of Techtronic Industries (TTI). The Associated Press reached out to the company for further comments on Thursday.

Beyond Thursday's pressure washer recall, TTI also recalled Ryobi-branded mowers and hedge trimmers earlier this year — due to fire and laceration hazards, respectively.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

CHICAGO (AP) — The Trump administration asked a military base outside of Chicago for support on immigration operations this week, offering a clue of what an expanded law enforcement crackdown might look like in the nation's third-largest city. 

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles. 

Although details of the administration's plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don't want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don't want to create any speculation around what's going on.” 




City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn't contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn't received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization. 

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago's homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we're not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don't have people running scared and it doesn't create chaos on our streets, we're willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he's trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump. 

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago's long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration. 

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren't capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network. 

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday's White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics. 

“This is JB Pritzker's legacy, by the way,” she said. 

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities -- St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia -- had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor's blessing, the armories aren't available for use.

Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on the reaction to the Minneapolis school shooting that left two children dead and several other injured. Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham also weighs in on the aftermath during 'America's Newsroom.'

Vice President JD Vance slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Thursday after she criticized prayer in the aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota. 

In an X post, Vance defended prayer in the wake of the tragedy and demanded to know why the former White House press secretary would attack the practice when the children who were killed the day before were praying.

"We pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know God listens. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action," Vance said, adding, "Why do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?"

In a follow-up post, Vance wrote, "Of all the weird left wing culture wars in the last few years, this is by far the most bizarre. ‘How dare you pray for innocent people in the midst of tragedy?!' What are you even talking about?"

Police have identified the shooter responsible for opening fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, when they said two children were killed and 17 others were injured during morning Mass.

Vance's remarks came in direct response to Psaki's Wednesday post slamming people for offering thoughts and prayers in response to the tragedy.

She wrote, "Prayer is not freaking enough.  Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school.  Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers."

In a separate post, Psaki also used the tragedy to criticize the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. 

"When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy."

            The surge in federal law enforcement in Washington, DC, has “enhanced” the capacity of local police officers and led to fewer crimes, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said this week while adding that it had also contributed to a “break in trust” between police and residents.
    


            The mayor's comments – which come nearly three weeks after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the capital city's police department – were criticized by local politicians, and the mayor added a day later that her “north star” is protecting the city's autonomy.
    


            “Since the beginning of this federal surge of officers, it has always been my focus on – we didn't ask for any federal officers, we're driving crime down – but while they're here, how can we most strategically use them to accelerate the work that MPD has done?” Bowser said.
    


            Earlier, Bowser highlighted that the increase in federal law enforcement contributed to “an extreme reduction in carjackings” and a decrease in gun crimes and homicides.
    


            “We think that there's more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior,” Bowser said at a press conference Wednesday.
    


            She continued, however, to criticize certain aspects of the administration's law enforcement surge and police takeover, saying that it led to a “break in trust” between police and the community. Bowser added that states sending their National Guard members to DC – like six Republican-led states have done so far – has “not been an efficient use of those resources.”
    


            Experts have estimated, as CNN reported, that the ongoing National Guard deployment is costing roughly $1 million per day.
    


            Bowser also criticized the presence of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the district and noted the need for more police officers, prosecutors and judges as well as boosted investments in violence intervention programs, homeless services programs, mental health services and a “new residential youth treatment center.”
    


            According to the city's official database, there has been a 44% decrease in violent crime during the three weeks since the federal surge compared to the same three-week period last year, and a 28% decrease compared to July 17 through August 6 of this year – the three-week period before the surge started. That includes a 44% decline in homicides compared the same time period last year and a 38% decrease relative to July 17 through August 6 of this year.
    


            CNN reported last week that in the first week of the White House's federal takeover of DC, the city saw a moderate drop in reported crime and a larger surge in the arrests of immigrants.

            The mayor's positive review of the surge in law enforcement Wednesday came under fire by local politicians, with one DC councilmember, Zachary Parker, for instance, saying in a social media post on X that city leaders should be “unequivocal” that the federal surge and National Guard deployment are wrong.
    


            Bowser added Thursday, “Our north star is protecting Home Rule and the district's autonomy, in all things, especially during this last eight months where it has been clear our autonomy has kind of been in the crosshairs.”
    


            The DC mayor has often tried to communicate multiple messages at a time. Her initial reaction to Trump's executive order was to blast it as “unsettling and unprecedented,” while adding that the increase in law enforcement “may be positive.”
    


            Meanwhile, polling has shown that DC residents feel less safe after the federal takeover. A Washington Post-Scar School poll released last week found that 79% of DC residents opposed Trump's actions, with 65% saying that they don't think the moves will reduce the amount of violent crime in the city.
    


            A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday also found that just 36% of Americans support “federal officials bringing the Washington, DC local police under federal control citing a public safety emergency,” and only 38% of Americans support “deploying National Guard troops from other states to Washington, DC, for law enforcement efforts.”

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley said she would have taken the New York Knicks head coaching job if it had been offered.

Staley, 55, interviewed for the position before the Knicks hired Mike Brown in July.

"I would have had to do it. Not just for me. For women. To break (that door) open," Staley said on the "Post Moves" podcast. "I would have had to. It's the New York Knicks. I'm from Philly. But it's the freaking New York Knicks."

Staley was one of many candidates the Knicks interviewed for their head coaching vacancy. The Knicks also interviewed former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, former Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori.

Staley said she thought she did well in the interview but questioned whether she hurt her chances by asking the Knicks how they would handle the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach.

"How, if you hired me as the first female head coach in the NBA, would it impact your daily job? Because it would," Staley said. "You're going to be asked questions that you don't have to answer if you're a male coach. There's going to be the media and all this other stuff that you have to deal with that you didn't have to deal with and don't have to deal with when you hire a male. That got them to thinking, ‘Maybe she's right.'"

She said she felt the energy change after her questions.

"So, I shot myself in the foot by being inquisitive and asking all those darn questions," Staley said.

Authorities are working to learn the motive of the shooter who fired into a Minneapolis Catholic school's church during Mass, killing two children and injuring 17 worshippers.

Officials identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23, and said Thursday that Westman was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School.

Westman was found dead in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot.

“Everything we've seen so far is a classic pathway to an active shooter,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on NBC's “Today” show Thursday morning. But “nothing that we have seen specific to trigger the amount of hate that occurred yesterday.”

Officials have recovered hundreds of pieces of evidence from the church and three associated residences in the area, O'Hara said, and are seeking search warrants to search electronic devices.

Authorities also were scouring content Westman allegedly scheduled to be released on YouTube and has since been removed from the platform.

The FBI is investigating Wednesday's shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, officials said.

The shooter — armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol — approached the side of the church at Annunciation Catholic School and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews during Mass just before 8:30 a.m.

O'Hara said Westman used all three weapons, fired dozens of rounds and tried to barricade the doors on one side of the church.

Westman legally purchased the weapons, had no known criminal history and acted alone, the chief said.

O'Hara said Thursday that authorities did not find additional firearms.

An August 2021 post on the Facebook page for the Church of the Annunciation celebrated the retirement of Mary Grace Westman after five years working there. A church newsletter from 2016 announced her hiring as a new administrative assistant in the business office and said she was a member of Saint Agnes Church in St. Paul.

A phone call and text message to a cellphone number listed as belonging to Mary Grace Westman was not answered Wednesday afternoon.

Associated Press reporters attempted to reach the shooter's father at an address listed as his residence, but nobody answered the door Wednesday afternoon. Phone calls and text messages to numbers associated with Robin Westman's siblings also were not answered.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese declined to answer questions when approached at the church Wednesday.

Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned anyone who would use the shooting to villainize the transgender community.

In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman's mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”

Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, told The Associated Press he barely knew Robin Westman but was watching coverage of Wednesday's tragedy.

When reached by phone, after a long pause, Heleringer initially said, “I don't know what to say.”

“I wish he had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer added.

Heleringer said Westman is the youngest child of one of his sisters. He said he last saw Westman at a family wedding several years ago but has not had contact with Westman since then.

Police said they were aware of time-released video and writings that may have come from the shooter. On a YouTube channel titled “Robin W” there were at least two videos posted before the channel was taken down by site administrators. The videos never show the face of the person speaking.

In one video that was about 10 minutes long, a cellphone camera pans to show a cache of weapons, ammunition and loaded magazines with sayings written on them including “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” Some were written in Cyrillic.

During the video, the person filming sings the word “tomorrow” and says, “I'm sorry to my family... that's the only people I'm sorry to.” Also, “I regret everything. I didn't ask for life. You didn't ask for death.”

At one point, the person holds up a smaller firearm from the cache and says, “This one is for me. In case I need it.”

The video also shows a letter written to the person's family, apologizing for what the shooting will mean for them, expressing love for them and saying to change their name and “move on.”

A second, almost 20-minute-long video shows two different journals. The first is more than 150 pages, all written in what appears to be the Cyrillic alphabet. The second journal had a last entry dated 8-21-25 and was more than 60 pages and also written entirely in Cyrillic.

The second notebook had a sticker on the inside cover depicting a semiautomatic AK-style rifle on top of a trans equality pride flag. Next to it was a sticker for the band KMFDM. One of the shooters in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting posted the band's lyrics on his website prior to the rampage.

The German industrial band has issued statements repeatedly condemning violence and school shootings. But in several high profile shootings since Columbine, shooters have had shirts, stickers or other references to the band as a reference to the Columbine shooting.

During the video, the person can be heard mumbling and breathing heavily. “I'll probably just upload a video on the day,” the person says before flipping to what appears to be a drawing of the layout of a church, pointing to two outside windows and then stabbing the illustration with a long knife.

O'Hara said Thursday that more of Westman's writings have been found.

The president of Argentina is blaming a recent attack by protestors on the ideology of his predecessor and political adversary.

Argentinian President Javier Milei was pelted with rocks during a campaign stop on Wednesday during a campaign stop at the Lomas de Zamora district of Buenos Aires.

Rocks, bottles, and other projectiles were lobbed by the protestors as the president was greeting locals from the back of a pick-up truck. 

Security was forced to cover the leader and whisk him away from the scene. He left the area without being harmed.

Milei later took to social media to blame the scuff-up on his rival, former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.

“Civilization or barbarism,” he said on social media with a photo taken at the scene showing a rock flying towards him. “Kirchnerism never again! End.”

The president spent the subsequent hours retweeting messages of support and admonishments of “Kirchnerism” from political allies.

Milei's sister, Karina Milei, is currently facing accusations of corruption related to an alleged kickback scheme.

Audio recordings have emerged in which Diego Spagnuolo, head of the country's disability agency, alluded to Karina Milei accepting bribes. 

The president and his sister have fiercely denied the reports and have expressed intent to take Spagnuolo to court over the remarks in the recording.

“Everything he says is a lie,” Javier Milei said of Spagnuolo in comments to the press on Wednesday. “We're going to take him to court and prove he lied.”

NOAM ADMITS ARGENTINA BACK INTO VISA WAIVER PROGRAM

La Libertad Avanza, Milei's libertarian party is holding a significant lead in the polls ahead of the midterm elections set to be held in October.

A survey conducted by AtlasIntel for Bloomberg News found just under 39% of respondents planned to vote for Milei's party, compared to just 28% intending to vote for its main rival, Union por la Patria.

The president's libertarian policies have resulted in noticeable drops in poverty and inflation, while unemployment remains a hurdle.

ROME (AP) — An internet site which showed photos of thousands of Italian women without their consent and attracted obscene and explicit comments was forced to shut down on Thursday after a backlash.

The site, which featured prominent women, including Premier Giorgia Meloni and European Parliament member Alessandra Moretti, also included posts which idealized violence against women.

The online forum, which took its name from slang for female genitalia, has been around for at least two decades but it only drew national attention after Moretti formally lodged a complaint with police after finding her photo displayed without her permission.

It displayed unauthorized photos and videos of hundreds of public figures, along with unsuspecting actresses, influencers and ordinary women. The images were often lifted from TV or social media profiles. It counted 200,000 users and displayed pictures identified by names or certain themes. 

“They have been stealing photos and clips from TV shows I've appeared on for years, then altering them and feeding them to thousands of users,” Moretti said.

She said the site was among many that operate “with impunity” even though previous complaints have been filed against them.

“This type of site, which incites rape and violence, must be shut down and banned,″ she said.

Following the comments by Moretti, and complaints by dozens of other women, the site's administrators posted an online statement on Thursday saying “with great regret” it was being shut down.




They attributed the “toxic behaviors” to a “wrong use of the platform, which damaged its original spirit.”

Italian women, from ordinary workers and housewives to top politicians, are fighting back against a proliferation of websites displaying their photos without their consent, often accompanied by obscene language. 

Their efforts gained national prominence when activists earlier this summer denounced a Facebook page dubbed “Mia Moglie” (“My Wife”), where men posted unauthorized photos of their spouses and succeeded in getting it taken down.

Some men said their wives had agreed to their images being posted, but no female comments were visible on the site. 

Experts said websites that display images of women without their consent were “the other face” of physical and sexual violence.

“Digital tools became not only a way for men to exercise control over women, but are increasingly used to offend, humiliate and attack them,” Sabrina Frasca, activist with anti-violence group Differenza Donna, told The Associated Press. 

“Mia Moglie,” had around 32,000 members before it was shut down last week by Facebook -owner Meta, which said it acted against the site “for violating our adult sexual exploitation policies.”

Italy has been struggling with how to prevent and address gender-based violence, as femicides — the killing of women because of their gender — has emerged as a systemic problem deeply rooted in Italy's patriarchal culture. A series of violent incidents has reignited national debate over how to confront these crimes. 

“Women have always been the arena on which men challenge each other and measure their virility,” said feminist author and activist Carolina Capria. “It's a game in which women are merely a commodity that adds value to the man who possesses them.”

Italy's government approved a draft law in March that for the first time introduces the legal definition of femicide into the country's criminal law and punishes it with life imprisonment. The bill still needs final approval in the lower house to become law.

While the center-left opposition welcomed the move, it stressed that the new law only tackles the criminal aspect of the problem, while leaving economic, educational and cultural sources of misogyny unaddressed.

A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — An immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz ” must keep moving toward shutting down operations by late October, a judge has ruled, even as the state and federal governments fight that decision.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams late Wednesday denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations at the facility, which has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman about chaplaincy services at the facility, implying there would soon be no need.

The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a little-used training airport, where chain-link cages now surround large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that Williams' order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws. 




But the judge in Wednesday night's order noted that the detainee population already was dwindling at the facility, and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.”

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Williams said in last week's order that she expected the population of “Alligator Alcatraz” to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring any new detainees onto the property. 

State officials said shutting down the facility for the time being would cost them $15 million to $20 million and that it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if they ultimately are allowed to reopen the facility. They also said that the Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the training airport suitable for a detention center.

“Alligator Alcatraz” has been targeted by several lawsuits, ranging from its impact on the Everglades to civil rights concerns. 

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit and moved the suit to another court district for procedural reasons. 

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.” The suit alleges detainees were being held for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from ICE's online detainee locator, and no one at the facility was making initial custody or bond determinations.

The groups want a federal court in Fort Myers to issue a restraining order and a temporary injunction that would bar Florida agencies and their contractors from holding detainees there. 

Since immigration is a federal issue, the rights groups say Florida agencies and the state's private contractors have no authority to operate the facility. The rights groups want their lawsuit to be certified as a class action.

Meanwhile, almost two dozen Republican-led states urged the appellate court reviewing Williams' order to overturn it. The 22 states argued in a court filing that she overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

George and Amal Clooney joked "one day" their twins would care that their dad is a star.

Hollywood star George Clooney, 64, skipped a string of major appearances at the Venice Film Festival, as he battles a sinus infection, his rep confirmed with Fox News Digital. 

"George has been diagnosed with a sinus infection and is under doctor's orders to cut back all activities today," Clooney's rep said Thursday. 

Clooney was a no-show at a press junket for "Jay Kelly," his latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, and missed a high-profile dinner with co-stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern.

The "Ocean's Eleven" actor was reportedly seen boarding a water taxi at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday as he quietly left the Hotel Excelsior to rest up — skipping nearly every major press obligation for the day.

His absence extended into the next day, as Clooney also missed the official press conference for the Netflix release.

At the event, the press conference moderator addressed his absence.

"As you may know, George Clooney is not going to be here because he has a bad sinus infection. We really hope, and I think he should be on the red carpet tonight. But he is very sorry he cannot be with us."

Director Baumbach lightened the mood, and quipped, "Even movie stars get sick." 

Clooney arrived in Venice on Tuesday with his wife, Amal.

The couple arrived by boat in elegantly coordinated Italian Riviera–inspired ensembles.

Amal stunned in a chic light-yellow dress, with a halter top and gold belt cinched at the waist. She accessorized with gold earrings and a white mini-purse, as the Hollywood couple walked hand in hand through the Venice streets. 

The Oscar winner stepped out in a fitted black polo, beige slim-fit pants and brown suede loafers, completing the look with a matching belt and sunglasses. 

Clooney rocked his natural gray hair color during his visit to Italy.

The Hollywood actor had briefly gone dark, ditching his silver fox look and dyeing his hair for his role in Broadway's "Good Night, and Good Luck."

"It's bad. It's still dark on top, but it's gray at the bottom," he said during an appearance on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" where he wore a hat to "hide" the growth. Clooney admitted he hadn't dyed his hair in two months, since the beginning of the production.

"So you get that really nice-looking grow-out of gray," he said.

Clooney proposed to Amal in April 2014, and the couple married five months later in Venice, Italy. Three years later, in 2017, they welcomed twins Alexander and Ella.

The mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday has triggered a renewed fight over responses to mass shootings.

Many on the Left have long criticized offering “thoughts and prayers” in response to tragedies as a shallow expression that distracts from implementing concrete solutions, such as gun control. Many on the Right have bashed the Left for its perceived insensitivity to religious beliefs, and counter that offering prayers is a kind and impactful way to provide comfort and express solidarity. The debate was first sparked after the Sandy Hook shooting in 2011, and has arisen after nearly every mass shooting since.

The current round of debate began when Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey appeared to dismiss the effectiveness of prayer in his first press conference after the shooting.

“Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now: these kids were literally praying … They were in a church,” he said, though he trailed off without making his intentions explicit.

The remarks were quickly interpreted by many on the Right as an attack on prayer and the faithful.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki was more overt in her attack, dismissing thoughts and prayers altogether.

“Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers,” she said in a post on X.

Prayer is not freaking enough.  Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school.  Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers.

Her post drew extensive backlash, with almost as many comments as likes. Most of the comments were negative, with Federalist CEO Sean Davis comparing her to a demon.

In an appearance on CNN, conservative commentator Scott Jennings said, “I think it's wrong, frankly, to vilify or attack people of faith. You said, ‘thoughts and prayers ring hollow.' I think thoughts and prayers are the most solid on days of tragedy for people who live their faith every day.”

“And I think on a day like today, particularly in a church community, there are probably people praying harder for comfort today than they have ever prayed in their life. And so I think, and I've heard others on the left today go down this line of attack against people of faith, sort of denigrating the idea that they might want to pray today. And so I think his statements were misguided,” he added.

Jennings also argued that prayer is a good way to increase empathy and understanding for victims' families, urging people to spend 10 seconds in silence to think about the Minneapolis victims and their families.

He elaborated on his podcast, saying he “couldn't believe it” when he heard Frey's comments.

“I really don't know what to say to Mayor Frey. People of faith turn to prayer in times of tragedy, and to decry their prayers, to belittle their faith, to angrily attack those whose faith fortifies them in their own lives, especially on days like today, I just don't know what to say to Mayor Frey,” Jennings said.

“Perhaps, sir, you're trying too hard to please a political base. My advice, offered humbly, is to shut up for a few hours and try not to offend anyone else as they grieve and recover from this tragic moment,” he added.

Vice President JD Vance also chimed in, disputing the basis for arguments against offering prayers in response to a tragedy.

“It is shocking to me that so many left wing politicians attack the idea of prayer in response to a tragedy. Literally no one thinks prayer is a substitute for action. We pray because our hearts are broken and we believe that God is listening,” Vance said.

Left-wing social media personality Brian Krassenstein made a similar post to Psaki, disputing the effectiveness of prayer. He went a step further to argue that it is the problem.

“Praying is the problem here, not the solution. People use prayer instead of action. If prayer worked, a house of prayer wouldn't have just experienced this tragedy,” he wrote, drawing a similarly negative reaction.

CNN host Dana Bash also dismissed prayer in an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

“Forget about thoughts and prayers. These kids were literally praying when they were murdered through a church window,” Bash said, with Klobuchar audibly agreeing with her.

MSNBC host Michael Steele gave similar remarks, though he more openly attacked prayer by calling it a “lie” in an interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).

“I agree with the mayor. The thoughts and prayers. I'm so beyond that nonsense. The lie of that,” he said, arguing that those praying are standing in the way of solutions.

Some right-wing commentators accused the Left of double standards, arguing that it only felt emboldened to attack prayer because it is Christians who are concerned.

“Imagine if Muslims were murdered while saying their prayers. Do you think any Democrat would be trashing prayer in the aftermath? They have no fear demeaning Christians, though, and that's a problem,” RedState writer Bonchie said.

Non-Christians also chimed in to defend prayer at a time of tragedy. Jewish columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon voiced outrage at Frey's comments, comparing his rhetoric with that of the shooter.

“I am just gobsmacked that in their effort to immediately politicize a horrific tragedy in which children were murdered at prayer, the line that Democrat after Democrat seems to have chosen is ‘Where is your God?' — which, incidentally, the murderer wrote on the magazine of his gun,” she said.

Outside of politics, faith leaders also defended prayer in a time of tragedy.

Pope Leo XIV sent a papal telegram to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis, expressing his “heartfelt condolences and the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.”

He commended “the souls of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God” and “prays for the wounded as well as the first responders, medical personnel, and clergy who are caring for them and their loved ones.”

The Orthodox Church was also affected by the shooting, with one of the critically wounded children belonging to the St. Mary's Greek Orthodox Church in Minneapolis. In a statement, Daniel Brum, Orthodox Church of America's archbishop of Chicago and the Midwest, expressed his condolences and defended prayer.

“Many dismiss the phrase ‘thoughts and prayers,' but as Christians, we know prayer is essential. Still, prayer alone is not enough. Christ sends us into the world to confront evil and to work for peace. Today, as we mourn, let us also commit to action so that all children of God may live together in the peace that comes only from Christ,” Brum said.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MINNEAPOLIS ANNUNCIATION CATHOLIC CHURCH SHOOTING

The Catholic Franciscan University responded to Psaki's comments directly, arguing for the necessity of prayer.

“Prayer is not an escape from reality. It is the very place we meet Christ, who Himself was unjustly slain. We will continue to pray, not because we are passive, but because we know only God can bring true justice, healing, and peace. Evil wants us to stop praying and to despair. We will not. We cling to Christ, who has conquered death,” it said in a post on X.

President Donald Trump has the "upper hand" over Democrats on crime politically, Politico's Rachel Bade said during an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump is considering holding a Republican National Convention ahead of the midterm elections, he announced Thursday.

Trump did not offer any details about where the convention would take place, or what would happen there, but he touted various statistics that have been beneficial for the Republican Party this year. The GOP is fighting to maintain control of both the House and Senate in 2026.

"The Republican Party is doing really well. Millions of people have joined us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA, GREAT AGAIN. We won every aspect of the Presidential Election and, based on the great success we are having, are poised to WIN BIG IN THE MIDTERMS," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"We have raised far more money than the Democrats, and are having a great time fixing all of the Country Destroying mistakes made by the Biden Administration, and watching the USA heal and prosper. The results are incredible, a record pace!!! In that light, I am thinking of recommending a National Convention to the Republican Party, just prior to the Midterms. It has never been done before. STAY TUNED!" he added.

4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY

Historically, midterms have been tough elections for the party controlling the White House, typically losing roughly 25 seats in the House. Trump and the Republicans lost 41 House seats in the 2018 midterms.

POLITICAL ANALYST SAYS DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE 'BIG PROBLEM' OF WINNING BACK VOTERS FOR 2028

Trump's talk of a national convention comes amid a war over redistricting across the country.

Texas passed a new congressional map eliminating five Democratic seats earlier this month. Blue states exploded in response, however, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom is working to adopt a map that eliminates five Republican seats in his state.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and other Democratic state leaders have also vowed to pick up the redistricting war, further confusing predictions for where 2026 could land.

Trump has also argued that crime will be a major focus in the midterm cycle, a theme he has hit heavily in recent days to drum up support for his controversial "federalization" push in Washington, D.C.

"The Republicans are the party that wants to stop crime," Trump said. "We're against crime."

"The Democrats like crime," he continued.

The president touted the success of his efforts in the nation's capital on Tuesday, telling reporters, "If I were a Democrat — governor or mayor or anybody — I'd call up President Trump and say, 'President Trump, we need your help. We saw what you've done in D.C. in a period of 12 days.'"

"This is 12 days. We haven't even started. This is going to be so safe. It'll be the safest place on Earth," he added.

            The Department of Veterans Affairs has transferred nearly $2 billion in funding for its health care system to pay for care from private providers, the agency told CNN.
    


            The reallocation represents a transfer of nearly 5% of the VA's total budget for money allocated to private care.
    


            It is the largest single move to private sector health care the VA has made in several years, according to a congressional source familiar with the process. Unusually, it was made without a formal request for approval from Congress, as is the normal procedure followed by previous administrations, including during the first Trump administration.
    


            The money shift comes amid a larger trend to increase private care options for veterans, which has drawn mixed results for the VA and the veterans it serves, and has added fuel to long simmering political tensions between Democrats and Republicans over management of the vast agency that provides health care to millions of American veterans.
    


            Democrats called the $1.83 billion transfer a massive move away from core medical services provided by the VA, and warned that it would erode care and unravel the agency.
    


            Richard Blumenthal, the ranking member of the Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee, said he feared it would lead to “increasing costs and losing critical accountability.” Rep. Mark Takano, ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, called the move “restructuring by another name,” adding that the unusually large transfer “confirms what we have been warning about: (VA Secretary Doug Collins) is bleeding the VA from the inside out.” He warned that it was a step towards privatizing the VA.
    


            The VA disputed the characterization of the move in funding as out of the ordinary and called the warnings about privatization of the VA, “a far-left canard that has been thoroughly debunked by the VA's massive growth over the years.”
    


            Ultimately, though, the changes in how the VA funds and shapes care delivery affect veterans, who have long had divided views on services.
    


            Congress was notified of the VA's intent to make the change in a letter to members in early July. The transfer occurred in early August, according to the VA.
    


            “The transfer of funds will not have an adverse impact on Veterans' care in VA health care facilities, and will improve Veterans' care by expanding access through VHA's community partners,” said VA Secretary Doug Collins in the letter, which was seen by CNN.
    


            VHA refers to the Veterans Health Administration, the medical arm of the VA that oversees all of the agency's hospitals and clinics and almost every aspect of veterans' health care.
    


            The funding move puts more money into a system that's already in place in the VA, where VA doctors send some veteran patients to private facilities if the VA cannot offer certain services, or does not have facilities within certain distances of veterans' homes. Once treated at a private facility, the private provider sends a bill to the VA for the service, and the VA pays the bill, explained Suzanne Gordon, Senior Policy Analyst with the Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute.
    


            Peter Kasperowicz, the VA spokesman, called the transfer of funds “routine” and said that the Biden administration had made a similar shift of $1.5 billion.
    


            However, critics in Congress noted that transfer had to do with a shortfall at the end of a fiscal year, and that any move of money over 1% of an appropriated category requires congressional approval, which was sought and given in the case of the Biden transfer.
    


            In the case of the move this August, the VA did not seek approval. Asked why, Kasperowicz said Collins's letter “should speak for itself”.
    


            “VA-purchased care,” which civilian medical care for VA patients is known as, has grown as a proportion of the VA's budget every year since 2015 and now accounts for about 25% of the VHA's current fiscal year budget.
    


            For some veterans, using private care could mean more choices in services or shorter wait times. “Better-funded community care means veterans get greater choice for the care they've earned,” said John Byrnes, Strategic Director for Concerned Veterans for America, in a statement to CNN.
    


            A spokesperson for Rep. John Carter (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Appropriations, said: “These resources are needed to support care provided by community partners.” The move “will not affect VA care at VA facilities,” she added.
    


            But critics - like Gordon - are worried about potential drawbacks. The private health care system in the US is already under strain, she says, and an influx of hundreds of thousands of veterans could add to the burden. “America is suffering from a shortage of primary care providers, which are absolutely key to providing care, and they are the backbone of the kind of care veterans get in the VA,” Gordon says.
    


            Liam Rose, a health economist at Stanford University who receives grants from the VA, said: “The difficult part for VA is that as it becomes more generous with access to private providers, it sees increased costs both from individuals that would not have had access and from individuals that can now use VA as the payer for care they would have received otherwise.”
    


            When CNN recently visited several Veterans' halls near Washington, DC, and in central Virginia, opinions were divided over the quality of the VA system.
    


            Chelbi Cole, a Navy veteran, said she has seen many benefits to being referred to private care. “It makes life easier. You can be seen more often.  Definitely, if you have an immediate issue, you don't have to wait,” she said.
    


            However, she said she could see how the system could be confusing for veterans who are less tech-savvy, she said, for example, because the VA's alerts for appointments with private providers are sometimes not clear on specifically where the patient should go.
    


            Many veterans who spoke to CNN in recent months said that while the VA health care system can be somewhat unwieldy, and can take a frustratingly long time to be admitted into, once someone is in the system, the care is very good.
    


            According to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a national non-profit group for veterans, less than a third – 31% – of its members who had experience with VA community care felt that private community care providers understood their medical needs, and only 14% said they had confidence that private and VA teams coordinated properly.

A man accused of killing his wife in California and fleeing to Peru with their three young children is in custody.

Peru's National Police said on Wednesday that Jossimar Cabrera Cornejo surrendered at Interpol's Lima headquarters. He was the subject of an active Interpol "red notice," according to Peruvian authorities, which alerts law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a suspect pending extradition.

Police released video showing Cornejo in handcuffs and wearing an Interpol vest.

CALIFORNIA WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN NATIONAL FOREST, HUSBAND SEEN DRAGGING SOMETHING IN LARGE TARP

Cornejo is accused of killing his wife, Sheylla Lisbet Cabrera, whose body was found in the Angeles National Forest on Aug. 16, just days after she was reported missing, according to Fox 11. The outlet also noted that Cabrera's friends said she was in an abusive relationship and allegedly asked Cornejo for a divorce, causing him to snap.

The Montrose Search and Rescue Team reported discovering an object over the side of an embankment in the Angeles National Forest, Fox 11 reported. Investigators later determined it contained Cabrera's body. She died from multiple stab wounds.

PARENTS OF 7-MONTH-OLD BOY MISSING FOR NEARLY 2 WEEKS ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER

The search and rescue team recognized the object as being similar to one that Cornejo was seen carrying out of the couple's Lancaster apartment complex.

Cornejo has been charged with one count of murder with allegations of using a knife as a deadly weapon. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a press release announcing an extradition warrant for Cornejo. If convicted, Cornejo could be sentenced to 26 years to life if convicted of the charge.

"The allegations against this man are horrific, and we will do everything possible to bring him back under our jurisdiction to be held accountable," District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. "Domestic violence creates chaos in our communities and shatters families. My office is committed to bringing stability back into the lives of those who have been victimized."

Cornejo and Cabrera's three children were found safe in Peru and taken into protective custody.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez's lawyers rejected her firing by the Trump administration, arguing that only President Donald Trump himself could fire her.

Monarez surprised many earlier on Wednesday when her lawyers rebuffed reports that she had resigned, saying she would not do so. Later that evening, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that Monarez was “no longer” head of the CDC after a protracted disagreement with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. The move came after days of pressure from Kennedy and other administration officials over whether she would support rescinding certain approvals for COVID-19 vaccines, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post.

In a statement early Thursday morning, Monarez's lawyers once again rebuffed the White House after it said she had been “terminated.”

“Our client was notified tonight by White House staff in the personnel office that she was fired. As a presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself can fire her,” her lawyer Mark Zaid said in a statement on Bluesky.

“For this reason, we reject notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our position,” he added.

Zaid is a longtime critic of Trump, representing many disaffected staffers suing the administration during his second term.

Trump nominated Monarez to lead the CDC, and she was confirmed to the position in July. She feuded behind the scenes with Kennedy for some time, but their disagreements came out into the open over her attempted ousting. Her lawyers argued she was being targeted for refusing “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives.”

Monarez had sent a note to CDC employees on Aug. 12, shortly after a shooting targeting CDC headquarters, warning that the “dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.”

The Trump administration sought her resignation on Wednesday, though she refused to do so. Her attorneys said Wednesday night that she “has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”

White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner roughly an hour later that Monarez had been terminated.

“As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,” he said. “Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position.”

Kennedy's unorthodox approach to public health has led to a slew of resignations at the CDC, including Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's chief medical officer; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Dr. Daniel Jernigan, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; and Dr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology.

"Special Report" with Bret Baier dives into Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser admitting President Donald Trump's crackdown has significantly decreased crime in the nation's capital.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser initially expressed fear of President Donald Trump's plan to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, but its clear success made her change her mind.

After Trump announced his plans to deploy National Guard troops and assume oversight of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to tackle rising crime in Washington, D.C., Bowser warned such a crackdown would be "unsettling and unprecedented."

However, the mayor admitted at a press conference on Wednesday that the federal surge has made a noticeable impact on one of America's most famously dangerous cities.

At the briefing, Bowser displayed a chart crediting the influx of FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Park Police and Capitol Police with bolstering MPD's efforts and declared, "We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD has been able to do in this city."

She pointed to one dramatic example, saying, "For carjackings, the difference between this period, this 20-day period of this federal surge and last year represents an 87% reduction in carjackings in Washington, D.C. We know that when carjackings go down, when use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer. So, this surge has been important to us for that reason."

Bowser offered further examples of Trump's new surge driving results.

"This is what we think in just a couple of weeks of experience has worked," she said. "Having more federal law enforcement officers on the street — we think having more stops that got to illegal guns has helped. We think that there is more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior. We know that we have had fewer gun crimes, fewer homicides, and we have experienced an extreme reduction in carjackings."

Bowser also cautioned that not every tactic has been successful, citing "a break in trust between police and community, especially with new federal partners in our community."

She criticized the use of masked ICE agents in neighborhoods and said relying on out-of-state National Guard troops was inefficient. The mayor added the city still needs more local police officers, prosecutors, judges and prevention programs while maintaining local control.

When later prompted by a reporter, Bowser argued that Trump seizing greater control of Union Station would be a "good thing."

"The Union Station is owned by the Department of Transportation and it will be a good thing because that station has suffered from needing, some say $12 billion, but let's call it at least $8 billion worth of investment in the renovation. And that is not something that the district will be able to support," she said. "It is an important regional asset, it is an important asset for the Eastern Seaboard. It's an important asset for the nation. So, it is appropriate, in my view, for the federal government to make the necessary investments in the transformation of Union Station."

Brandishing his loyalty to President Donald Trump and keeping retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) at arm's length has proven to be an early, lucrative campaign fundraising tactic for Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) in his quest to replace the former Senate GOP leader.

“I don't just talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr, serving his seventh term, told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “I'm doing it every day.”

But despite his close relationship with the president and backing from a string of MAGA allies in Congress, Barr remains in pursuit of the coveted Trump endorsement.

So too are the two men with whom he's locked in a bitter primary challenge for Kentucky's open Senate seat next year, being vacated by McConnell: former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and wealthy businessman Nate Morris.

Discussions with Trump or those in his orbit are to remain “private conversations,” Barr said. But in between rattling off Trump's policy wins over the years that he's played a hand in, the Senate hopeful projected confidence that he'd be the obvious choice for an endorsement. That is, should the president choose to weigh in.

“There's politicians who like to talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr said. “There's politicians who like to talk about the One Big, Beautiful Bill. I have to write it. I have to pass it. And I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative.”

Although limited independent polling on one of the nastier Republican Senate primaries of the 2026 midterm elections, surveys earlier this year suggested Cameron had a commanding double-digit lead. Barr's campaign said an internal poll taken earlier this month and provided to the Washington Examiner shows positive momentum for Barr after months of crisscrossing the state with nearly 60 events, despite being outspent by Morris on the airwaves.

Among 600 likely Kentucky GOP primary voters and a margin of error of plus or minus four points, Barr had a net positive image rating of 16 percentage points from respondents compared to Morris's net negative rating of four percentage points.

Still, Cameron appeared to be leading the pack, thanks to his broader name recognition from holding statewide office. His net positive rating was 40 percentage points.

In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Morris condemned Barr as a phony MAGA loyalist, citing episodes like donating through his leadership PAC to now-former House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and accused him of flip-flopping on issues now that he's running for higher office. 

“Andy Barr blamed Donald Trump for January 6th. He backed the members of Congress who tried to throw Trump out of office. Barr tried for years to sabotage President Trump's tariff agenda. He spent millions of taxpayer dollars on DEI nonsense,” Morris said. “Barr even called people who want to deport illegals ‘nativists' and funded Congress's latest attempt at mass amnesty. If Andy Barr is MAGA, then so is Hillary Clinton.” 

Opponents have criticized Morris for a 2021 campaign donation to former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, who went on to run for president against Trump, and his past promotions of DEI as a former CEO.

Similar to Morris, the Cameron campaign accused Barr of realigning himself with conservatism for the primary and referred to him as “McConnell's handpicked candidate,” though McConnell has declined to get involved in a contest where its participants are all clambering to be the least associated. Cameron was once considered his protege, and Barr previously referred to him as a “mentor.”

“He's a creature of D.C. who spent decades shaking down Big Banks and Big Pharma for checks to fund his re-brand from moderate RINO to whatever this is now,” Cameron Campaign Manager Taylor Zanazzi said in a statement.

Analysis by Govtrack.us, an independent Congress tracker, rates Barr as skewed the farthest politically right among his House colleagues from Kentucky. There is no direct comparison available for Cameron and Morris. 

The Republican trio has sought to tap into their most conservative ideologies while keeping a safe distance from McConnell, who has a prior relationship with all three from his decades atop Kentucky GOP politics. 

Morris has went a step further in seeking to keep distance from McConnell. A former McConnell intern who held a fundraiser for him a decade ago, Morris now refers to him as “the nastiest politician in the history of America.”

An establishment figure with an icy relationship toward Trump, McConnell has proven to be a political liability in a modern-day Republican primary, even if that race is for the very seat he's vacating.

“I've been asked for 13 years, as a member of Congress from Kentucky, are you a Rand Paul Republican or a Mitch McConnell Republican? I'm neither,” Barr said. “I'm an Andy Barr Republican, and I'm proud to have supported President Trump in both his first four years, and I'm the strongest supporter in the House.”

The ability to raise funds may not tell the whole story, as polling has shown Cameron, despite his campaign coffers, vastly trailing Barr. But it offers a window into where supporters and potential voters are most eager to put their money, and it could play a role in who other influential Republicans choose to back.

Fundraising data available through June showed that Barr raised a hefty $6.1 million, compared to Cameron's roughly $530,000.

Morris presents a wildcard factor in the fundraising fight. Since entering the race, he's yet to face a filing deadline, and he has the financial ability to self-fund his campaign. He launched a seven-figure ad buy just days after declaring his candidacy in July.

BARR LEADS CAMERON IN FUNDRAISING IN KENTUCKY GOP SENATE PRIMARY

McConnell has shown no desire to get involved in the chaotic three-way contest. But his establishment donors apparently feel otherwise. Wealthy party donors linked to McConnell and other GOP leaders have already put millions of dollars into kneecapping Morris's candidacy.

“I don't know about McConnell donors. What I do know about are my donors,” Barr said. “I know about people who are supporting me, and they're supporting me because they know, No. 1, that I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative who believes in limited government, free enterprises, strong national defense.”

At an Oval Office signing ceremony on Aug. 8 with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, President Trump was asked about recognizing Somaliland.

President Donald Trump is reportedly working on a move that would give the U.S. a new military and economic foothold in Africa, counter China and Russia, and strike a blow against Islamist terrorists in the region. And now a leading senator has told Fox News Digital this goal can be realized by recognizing the breakaway Somaliland as an independent state.

Somaliland, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991. Its government is said to be offering the U.S. a new air and sea base close to the entrance of the Red Sea, and directly across from Yemen and the Houthis, if the U.S. formally recognizes it. Thirty percent of the world's container ship traffic is reported to pass through its waters en route to or from the Suez Canal.

In the Oval Office on Aug. 8, Trump told reporters, "We're looking into that right now," when asked about the recognition of Somaliland and the possible resettlement of Gazans there, adding, "We're working on that right now, Somaliland."

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., told Fox News Digital, "There is a very real opportunity that President Trump will recognize Somaliland during this administration."

Cruz added, "President Trump is bringing a new era of clarity in American national security, after four years of the Biden administration rewarding our enemies and punishing our allies, and recognizing Somaliland should be part of this new era.

"Somaliland has been a reliable ally to the United States, is integrating itself with us and our allies globally, and is committed to helping us counter efforts by China to undermine the safety and prosperity of Americans," he said.

The White House did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

But Somaliland, 99% Muslim, has allegedly eliminated radicalism and has aligned itself with the U.S. and Israel, leading Cruz to tell Fox News Digital, "They're a Muslim country, in a very dangerous part of Africa, showing real courage. I will continue to push for deepening the U.S.-Somaliland partnership, including through the Africa Subcommittee in the Senate, and I expect that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will be receptive to doing so."

Earlier this month, Cruz wrote to President Trump about Somaliland, stating, "it requires the status of a state. I urge you to grant it that recognition."

Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, is optimistic, telling the British Guardian newspaper on May 30, "Recognition is on the horizon." He added, "It's a matter of time. Not if, but when."

Somaliland's port at Berbera is the jewel in any Washington deal. Analysts say it is in such a strategic position that both Russia and China have tried to acquire it. Right next door to it is one of Africa's five longest runways, offering the U.S. the possibility of both a sea and air base that can strike Houthi rebels to the north and Al Shabaab terrorists to the east.

In his letter to the White House, Cruz wrote, "Somaliland has emerged as a critical security and diplomatic partner for the United States, helping America advance our national security interests in the Horn of Africa and beyond. It is strategically located along the Gulf of Aden, putting it near one of the world's busiest maritime corridors. It possesses capable armed forces and contributes to regional counterterrorism and piracy operations. It has proposed hosting a U.S. military presence near the Red Sea along the Gulf of Aden."

The U.S.'s largest military base in Africa is just up the coast in Djibouti. But there are security and surveillance issues at the Camp Lemonnier U.S. base where the Chinese and other nations have opened their own bases and monitoring stations nearby.

Somaliland is also offering the White House access to rare earth minerals essential for high-tech industries, such as lithium and silicon quartz.

The U.S. has described Somalia, with large numbers of both ISIS and al-Qaida-linked operatives, as a terrorist safe haven. Now the increasing presence of China and military forces from countries such as Turkey is reportedly leading some in Washington to be increasingly unhappy with its "one Somalia" policy, where Somaliland continues to be recognized only as a part of Somalia.

For now, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital the official position: "The United States recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, which includes the territory of Somaliland. The State Department is not in active discussions with Somaliland's representatives about a deal to recognize Somaliland as a state."

But, Somaliland's foreign minister worked Washington's corridors and politicians in April, and several African sources, including the influential Horn Observer news outlet, have reported that President Abdullahi is expected to come to D.C. "soon". U.S. officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Somalia, Richard Riley, are said to have been to Somaliland to meet with the president at least three times this year.

The weird lie animating the right-wing womanosphere.

Earlier this month, Katie Miller launched her new podcast with a specific origin myth. Miller, a former Trump administration official and wife of Stephen Miller, declared that by creating a lifestyle podcast for conservative women, she was filling a hole in the media ecosystem.

“For years, I've seen that there isn't a place for conservative women to gather online,” Miller said in a video posted to X. Her caption added, “As a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn't a podcast for women like myself.”

This claim happens to be deeply untrue. Conservative women have arguably never had more places to gather online and talk about their lifestyle concerns — especially when it comes to motherhood and wellness. This media ecosystem has recently been dubbed the “womanosphere,” and it is booming.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Conservatives can go to Evie, the right-wing answer to Cosmopolitan, which has attracted plentiful mainstream media attention. They can get their celebrity gossip with a healthy strain of reactionary conspiracy theories from Candace Owens. They can get anti-feminist cultural commentary from YouTubers like Brett Cooper. They can get MAHA-inflected health care advice from Alex Clark's Culture Apothecary talk show. They can hear anti-trans sports commentary on Riley Gaines's Gaines for Girls. They can watch the agrarian fantasies of tradwives like Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman. And they can listen to conservative women's lifestyle podcasts, like Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey's Relatable. Many of these women, by dint of their jobs as full-time content creators and podcasters, are also working moms, as they are happy to discuss at length in their content.

Still, the sense that Miller is operating from a defensive crouch, grabbing for access to a feminine frivolity she feels she has been denied, suffuses her new show, The Katie Miller Podcast. “We're gonna do something for all the girls out there,” Miller tells her guest, conservative sportscaster Sage Steele, on the second episode before the beauty segment of their interview. “Conservative women never get asked these questions,” Miller adds. It's hard to know what exclusion Miller is referring to exactly (what is Ivanka Trump's brand if not being a conservative woman with beauty secrets?), but the idea that it might be true seems necessary to Miller's conception of her project.

In the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow.

She's not alone in that. A transgressive posture is one of the characteristics of the womanosphere: an implication that they are saying hard truths and asking tough questions about things the liberal elites don't want women to know, that they are reclaiming their due from the cultural gatekeepers who didn't want them to have it. All conservative media these days tends to operate under similar assumptions, but in the womanosphere, the prizes are stranger and more feminine — the hard-won right to do a Get Ready With Me and tell the world all about the beauty properties of beef tallow. (Sage Steele is a fan.)

As the womanosphere booms, it's taken on an odd, fraught position. Republicans claim that they are the party free from liberal scolds, that will let hot girls be hot, but also that elites have gatekept them away from all that is frivolous and fun about girlishness. Listening to (or watching) Miller's podcast isn't interesting because of the beauty secrets divulged; it's revealing because of the glimpse it gives us into Republicans' current vexed relationship with femininity.

To give Miller her due, it's true that there are few spaces these days for conservative women in traditional media, like old-school glossy magazines. Lifestyle media for women has long been inherently conservative-leaning, with its focus on dieting and man-catching and home-building, but the post-Jezebel generation of women's media took on an explicitly feminist lens. The 2010s saw an explosion of progressive so-called ladyblogs, like The Hairpin, The Cut, and Slate's Double X, while magazines like Teen Vogue took on a left-wing activist perspective. Even the flagship Vogue, which generally dedicates a cover to the sitting first lady, declined to feature Melania Trump during Donald Trump's first term and, so far, his second as well.

The emergent conservative womanosphere, like its manosphere counterpart, has been largely coming up outside the boundaries of traditional media, among podcasters and YouTubers and lifestyle influencers, where the money for high-performing contributors is better and the editorial oversight is lower. Miller's podcast fits neatly into the flourishing new ecosystem.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression.

Part of the worldbuilding of this universe is to claim that the rest of the universe does not exist: There is no womanosphere, according to these influencers. There is no feasible way to build a lucrative career out of being an anti-woke woman, and failing to land a feature in Vogue is censorship at its finest.

The womanosphere is not the only part of the conservator ecosystem to embrace an underdog narrative and build a mythology around the idea of liberal oppression. The tendency has been so widespread among Trump Republicans in his second term that in February, the pseudonymous blogger Scarlet gave it a name: the “soy right.”

“The Soy Right is being oppressed and they want you to know it,” she wrote. “They're scared to take the subway, they're offended that you called them white or cis, they're upset that you didn't think they were cool in high school, they want to call the manager because there's less boobies in video games. … While the right is winning cultural and political victories nonstop lately, that's not enough. They also need you to like them. Why don't you like them?!”

These grievances power the worldview of Miller and her ilk, and gives them a reason to create their podcasts and YouTube channels and magazines. They're calling the manager because they don't think they personally have gotten enough credit for being conventionally hot, raising kids, and having high-powered careers. Creating a new podcast is a way for Miller to give herself that credit. Meanwhile, harping on the false idea that there's a hole in the marketplace allows her podcast to take on a sense of heightened importance. If the world were fair, Miller implies, someone else would have asked her to describe her beauty routine a long time ago.

This idea that Republican women are never given credit for their beauty stands uneasily next to recent Republican attempts to claim the existence of beautiful women as a win for their own side. Over the past two years, the right has variously claimed Sydney Sweeney, Hawk Tuah Girl, and sorority rush videos as cultural phenomena that are by their nature Republican-coded and surely infuriate the left. (The left shows no sign of being infuriated, but that doesn't stop the narrative.) The story goes that the left is too woke, too PC, too ideologically hamstrung to celebrate the existence of conventionally attractive white women, so the right must step in.

In the manosphere, the obsession with hot girls shades into raunch culture, a performative, overwhelming ocean of sleaze in which the supposed celebration of hot girls also runs right alongside an attitude of degradation. The nascent womanosphere, however, tends towards purity culture, an obsession with Christian virtue and righteousness that is the mirror image of raunch culture.

Miller makes much of her status as a wife and mother. Her fellow womanosphere podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey calls out listeners for watching movies about “hot and heavy sinful romance” rather than focusing on “the Biblical marriage that God has called you into.” Brittany Martinez, the founder of Evie magazine, says she started her publication after watching the traditional glossies “encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications.”

As I've discussed extensively before, while purity culture and raunch culture might appear to oppose one another, they're two sides of the same coin, united by a shared premise that women's sexuality should always exist in service to men. They are also a trap: The raunchy cool girls get called sluts. The respected pure women get called prudes. The only way to play the game and win is to somehow be both raunchy and pure at the same time, an impossible status that was only ever held, very briefly, by a young Britney Spears before the world crashed down around her.

The womanosphere is animated by a sense of a broken promise: that these women were told they would receive attention and credit that never came. The Katie Miller Podcast says it's an attempt to rectify that broken promise. In reality, however, it's just one more entry into a crowded conservative media landscape, powered by the same old warped sense of victimization.

            Just when Manchester United fans thought it couldn't get any worse, up steps fourth-division side Grimsby Town to plunge the once-great club even further in the mire.
    


            The League Two minnow – sitting three divisions below Manchester United – was well worthy of its League Cup win on Wednesday, beating Ruben Amorim's team 2-2 (12-11) in a marathon penalty shootout that came after a rollercoaster game at Grimsby's Blundell Park.
    


            The host, by far the better team in the first half, led its Premier League opponent 2-0 heading into the final 15 minutes of the match. Two late goals from the Red Devils, though, looked to have denied Grimsby a historic victory, but the underdog bit back in an astonishing shootout which United manager Amorim couldn't bring himself to watch.
    


            And while the night should be remembered for the Grimsby Town celebrations at full-time – it is arguably the greatest result in the club's history – it's hard not to question what on earth is going on at United.
    


            The scene looked all the more bleak after a mammoth thunderstorm drenched the ground in the second half, with the image of a soaking-wet Amorim frantically consulting his tactics board serving as the perfect metaphor for the club's current state.
    


            “I just want to apologize to our fans,” a furious Amorim told ITV Sport after the humiliating defeat.
    


            “You can feel it. Something has to change. I don't know what to say anymore to our fans. It's hard to face.”
    


            He later added to reporters: “We were completely lost and it's hard to explain and that's why I think they spoke really loud.
    


            “I know the best team won today. The best players lost – because when you are a team you can win any game. It was really fair the football today.”
    


            The Portuguese manager has now been at Manchester United for nine months and pressure to get results is looming larger than ever – he has so far overseen just 16 wins in 44 games.
    


            Given he arrived part-way through last season and told fans he would need time to implement his style of play, many gave him some leeway for the team's disastrous 15th-place finish in the league.
    


            But after an entire preseason schedule and backing in the transfer market – the club has signed an entirely new frontline in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Šeško and Matheus Cunha – there is very little credit left in the bank.
    


            To put it simply, there is still so much wrong with the team which has picked up just one point from its first two Premier League games of the new season.
    


            The goalkeeper situation, for one, has become untenable. Both André Onana and Altay Bayındır have been used in the three games this season and both have made blunders that have led to conceded goals.
    


            The defense, certainly against Grimsby, looked incredibly unsure of itself and the attackers are struggling to convert the very few chances they are creating.
    


            Both new signings, Cunha and Mbeumo, missed vital penalties in Wednesday's defeat. New star striker Šeško also opted to be the last outfield player to take a spotkick.
    


            “It was obviously not good enough today,” United defender Diogo Dalot told ITV Sport. “We cannot give up, whatever the situation but, like I said, it's not good enough and I think its something we need to look deeply into ourselves.
    


            “Tomorrow is a new day, we need to fight back and show to ourselves that, to be at this club, we need to do more much.”
    


            There is also the sticky situation about the team's formation.
    


            Amorim was praised on his arrival at the club for having a distinct style of play. The 3-4-3 formation had worked so well at his former club, Sporting CP, and many felt a strong identity was exactly what a rudderless Manchester United needed.
    


            But Amorim's dedication to his system, which was once deemed a strength, is now turning into a weakness. Even if it's not working, or if the players are struggling to adapt, the manager is seemingly not changing his mind.
    


            Last season, the Portuguese boss said things would get worse before they got better. United fans, though, are running out of patience, despite some brief signs of improvement during spells of matches this season.
    


            “It's not about the formation,” Amorim insisted again on Wednesday. “The system is not important. We can play with three defenders, four defenders, five defenders, that doesn't matter.
    


            “What matters is that we need to be different, and that's the job of the coach, and you can see that nothing has changed.”
    


            There is still a week left in this summer's transfer window and Manchester United will likely be busy – perhaps more so with outgoings.
    


            There are still several players, including Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, who are seemingly surplus to requirements at United, as Amorim looks to freshen up a team which has been thrown from one disaster to the next in recent years.
    


            The clear out, which has seen the likes of Marcus Rashford leave the club on loan, was supposed to usher in a new era of positivity at the 20-time top-flight champion.
    


            The club's new minority owner, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has backed the need for change, investing in a renovated training center and promising to build a new world-class stadium.
    


            Already, though, this ‘new' Manchester United has lurched into its latest calamitous chapter.
    


            Next up for the team is a Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Nothing but a comfortable win will ease the growing pressure on Amorim and his job as manager of the Red Devils.

Taylor Townsend let out a roar after upsetting No. 25-ranked Jelena Ostapenko, 7-5, 6-1, in her second-round match at the U.S. Open on Wednesday. 

But a face-to-face confrontation between the two competitors at center court was the biggest story coming out of Court 11. 

Townsend said that Ostapenko, a Latvian native who has a French Open title under her belt from 2017, said she has "no class" and "no education."

Townsend, who is Black, was asked by a reporter if Ostapenko's comments at the net had racial undertones. 

"I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth," Townsend replied. 

"So, whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on. The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament."

Ostapenko wasn't asked by reporters, but she posted on Instagram about the confrontation, specifically talking about "how many messages I received that I am a racist."

"I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world," Ostapenko posted. "For me, it doesn't matter where you come from."

During the verbal altercation at the net, Ostapenko said something inaudible to Townsend as she went to shake the chair umpire's hand. It clearly irked Townsend, who had an exasperated expression on her face before things got a bit more heated. 

Ostapenko was seen waving her finger at Townsend while they jawed back and forth. 

"It's competition. People get upset when they lose," Townsend, who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said after the match.

Townsend added that in past matches against Ostapenko there was never any issues. 

"There's no beef on my side," she said. "She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the U.S. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that."

Townsend's social media post began by saying she felt Townsend was "disrespectful" after not apologizing for the net cord helping her secure a point in the match. 

"There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour," Ostapenko said. "If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants."

Ostapenko also didn't like that Townsend warmed up before the match at the net instead of at the baseline. Townsend said she's been doing the routine for years and it has never been an issue.

Townsend is a star in WTA doubles, but in singles, she is ranked No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past Grand Slam champion at a major since Kristie Ahn, who just so happened to beat Ostapenko at the 2019 U.S. Open. 

Townsend has a tough third-round matchup against, as she will face No. 5-ranked Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old phenom, on Friday.

            The ongoing National Guard mission in Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in the city, is costing roughly $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN.
    


            Kate Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that rough calculations show the mission is likely costing more than $1 million a day, when taking into account the pay for more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed, housing, travel, food, fuel, and other logistical needs. That estimate is drawn from costs from the 2020 mobilization of roughly 5,000 National Guardsmen to DC, which was estimated to cost more than $2 million a day.
    


            Retired Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously served as the chief of force structure and investment division at the Office of Management and Budget, also told CNN the estimated cost comes to roughly $1 million a day. Those estimates don't include the costs from other federal law enforcement agencies involved in the mission.
    


            The Pentagon and National Guard did not provide cost estimates for the mission, despite having been able to do so for a similar mission just two months ago.
    


            “We won't know the total cost until the mission concludes,” a defense official told CNN on Wednesday. The official referred CNN to the White House after follow-up questions about the daily $1 million estimate. Questions to the National Guard about the cost of the mission were referred to the Pentagon.
    


            The Intercept was first to report the level of estimate on the cost of the National Guard mission.
    


            It's not unusual to not have a firm idea of the final price tag for a mission like the one ongoing in DC, as logistical needs can adjust over time, and it remains unclear if service members' orders will be extended or not. But multiple US officials who spoke to CNN said the reluctance to provide a number is also due to the involvement of senior levels of the Pentagon and the White House in the mission, and a tight grasp on the flow of information about it.
    


            Two US officials told CNN there was likely a rough estimate available for the DC mission, or one being calculated, but that only the most senior levels had permission to speak about it due to the political nature of the mission and the White House's involvement. Communication about the cost, one of the officials said, is typically approved at much lower levels than the current mission. Because the mission is being funded federally, one of the officials said, the money is coming from the departments of the Army and the Air Force.
    


            “We know that funding is made available, we just don't know the estimate or who's approving it or how much is available,” the second US official said, adding that “everybody wants to have their hands in” communication surrounding the mission due to the White House's interest in it.
    


            A third US official said it's likely a mixture of both — that a cost estimate is generally still being calculated, but that until senior levels of the Pentagon or White House determine they want to release that information, it won't be shared.
    


            Still, the Pentagon was able to give a cost estimate for the LA mission in June just three days after roughly 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized to assist law enforcement.
    


            “The current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,” Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense and official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense, told Congress on June 10. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing the first batch of 2,000 Guardsmen on June 7.
    


            As of Tuesday morning, there were 2,254 National Guard troops in DC — more than 1,300 of them from the six states who sent personnel to support the DC National Guard. While some troops are stationed through the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, soldiers and airmen have also begun helping with “beautification projects,” doing things like picking up trash, replanting grass, and spreading mulch.
    


            In addition to the service members' pay during the mission while they are on orders, the total cost of the mission also includes basic logistical needs like hotel rooms for out-of-state troops, food and water, fuel for vehicles, laundry service, and more.

The president's tacky aesthetic is a window into his quest to become the single most enduring symbol of America.

In 1990, Playboy published an interview with Donald Trump in which the future president offered his thoughts on foreign affairs, the death penalty, and why he puts his name on everything. He also reflected on the meaning — or, perhaps, meaninglessness — of life. “Life is what you do while you're waiting to die. You know, it is all a rather sad situation,” he said. “We're here and we live our 60, 70, or 80 years and we're gone. You win, you win, and in the end, it doesn't mean a hell of a lot.”

It's no secret that every president cares about how they'll be remembered. But that pithy, 35-year-old quote explains a whole lot about Trump, his rise to power, and how he governs today. He doesn't only want a legacy, be it good or bad. Even winning the presidency twice doesn't suffice. What Trump really wants is to — in some way or another — live forever, and he's only just getting started.

By now, Trump's imprint on the world is indelible. His ability to wiggle out of legal consequences for his corruption and lawlessness has ushered in a new era of presidential immunity. His inability to admit defeat in 2020 nearly resulted in a coup d'etat and seriously undermined voters' faith in American elections. And his harsh immigration crackdowns, his fixation on birthright citizenship, and his censorship of speech have challenged the very ideals of what it means to be an American.

But to fully understand Trump's broader political project and how he has successfully transformed America, you have to recognize that he isn't only a political figure, but something much bigger: a cultural icon in the crudest sense.

It's that side of Trump that begins to explain one of the weirdest aspects of his presidency: his focus on aesthetics and how aggressively he is forcing his particular style and taste onto America. Whether it's making the White House look more like his private residences or turning the arts into his own pet project, Trump is trying to fundamentally change how America's government is perceived. Put another way, when we look at the government's buildings and institutions, Trump wants us to see only him — even after he's gone.

It's not entirely accurate to say that Trump has always sought fame. Because what Trump has really been chasing his entire adult life has been omnipresence. Celebrity status, untold fortune, and television success were never going to be enough; he wants to be everywhere. For a big chunk of his New York business years, Trump was completely obsessed with the idea of having the biggest and tallest buildings in the world. He injected himself into the American zeitgeist decades ago, giving tabloids enough gossip to fill their pages with scandal after scandal since the 1970s. His real estate career, his offensively lavish lifestyle, and his eventual rise as a reality TV star made him, in many ways, a caricature of American capitalism's excesses.

That never-ending pursuit of omnipresence has shaped Trump's political career and presidencies, perhaps more than anything else. After all, from a political standpoint, Trump has been all over the place: He has been a Democrat, independent, and a Republican. He sought to befriend Hillary Clinton — donating to her Senate campaigns and the Clinton Foundation — before eventually running against her in 2016. And while there are some policies and ideas that Trump has long been committed to, like tariffs or racist conspiracy theories, he has always been more devoted to himself than any policy agenda.

His true desire, it seems, wasn't to simply become the president of the United States, but to become the single most enduring representation of America itself.

Trump's political project, in other words, is to rebrand America. He's seemingly not so desperate to eke out wins for the Republican Party so much as he is trying to remake America in his own image. Gone are the days where America is promoted as an idea — a nation of immigrants or an unfinished project that every generation of Americans strives to improve — because in his eyes, America is Trump.

To understand Trump's aesthetics, you have to go back to the 1980s lifestyles of the rich and famous in New York, the time and place that defined Trump's rise in American culture. A lot of what Trump values today — real estate, television ratings, Time magazine covers — can be traced back to that era, when all of those things, at least to Trump and those running in his circles, were markers of clout.

That period was defined by greed and ostentatious displays of wealth. And Trump relished that environment. In the Playboy interview, Trump was specifically asked about why he feels so comfortable showing off his riches, especially given how much poverty could be seen on the streets. “There has always been a display of wealth and always will be,” he said. “And let me tell you, a display is a good thing. It shows people that you can be successful. It can show you a way of life. Dynasty did it on TV. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

Trump's quest to own the famed Plaza Hotel in New York City, which he bought for $400 million in 1988, ended in spectacular failure, with the hotel filing for bankruptcy just a few years after the purchase. But for Trump, acquiring the Plaza Hotel wasn't merely about making money; it was about achieving status. “To me the Plaza was like a great painting,” he said, recalling the whole ordeal in an interview in 2015. “It wasn't purely about the bottom line. I have many assets like that and the end result is that they are always much more valuable than what you paid for them.”

Just like that venture, Trump's vision for America today is remarkably shallow. It doesn't matter how functional America's institutions or even economy actually are. The only thing that matters is what America looks like on the outside. And a shiny veneer that flaunts wealth and military might — be it through a gilded White House or a B-2 stealth bomber flyover — is perfectly adequate, even if it's entirely hollow or bankrupt on the inside.

So naturally, Trump has dedicated a decent chunk of his presidency to imposing his style and aesthetic onto America.

In both terms, he has issued executive orders to change the look of federal buildings, discarding new architectural styles and instead promoting grand neoclassical buildings that mimic ancient empires. He has been in a long-simmering feud with Boeing since his first term over the new Air Force One — the iconic aircraft that carries the president across the country and around the world — and has been deeply involved in the design of the plane, which looks suspiciously similar to his own private jet. And he has completely redecorated the White House, decking out the Oval Office in gold, turning the Rose Garden into a patio that resembles his Mar-a-Lago club, and announcing plans to build a $200 million ballroom extension to the East Wing.

But Trump's fixation on rebranding America's image goes deeper than giving the Office of the President a makeover. Upon returning to the White House earlier this year, Trump purged the board of the Kennedy Center and appointed a new board that elected him to be the chair — an unusual role for the president of the United States to take on. The move showed how invested Trump personally is in the culture wars, so much so that he wants to be directly involved in decisions about what kind of art Americans should enjoy.

Trump is now even planning on hosting the Kennedy Center Honors this year, saying he was “very involved” in selecting the honorees. He also said that he vetoed “a couple of wokesters” who were in the running. And, according to the New York Times, Trump has considered giving posthumous awards to Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth.

He is also targeting the nation's museums and historical displays in an attempt to recast America's history in a much more favorable light that sweeps all the bad parts under the rug. For instance, he issued an executive order that discourages the Smithsonian Institution from putting up displays that portray America and its past negatively. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said in a recent social media post. “We have the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.”

To be sure, the United States has always been deeply invested in how it is perceived, both domestically and abroad, and has always projected itself as the “shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan often liked to say. And while there's no shortage of big egos among presidents, they often, at the very least, tried to gesture that America was bigger than just them.

What is different about Trump is that he is not so interested in the idealistic vision of America — or in presenting America as an idea, a neverending endeavor of creating a more perfect union. He's only interested in grandeur and the authoritarian tendency to so thoroughly intertwine himself with his country that the two can't be separated. And whether it's the Oval Office redesign, the Kennedy Center takeover, or — in quintessential dictatorship fashion — banners of Trump's portrait cropping up around the nation's capital, the message Trump is sending is clear: We are changing how America is perceived, we will aggressively flaunt our power and wealth, and we will iconize Trump so that he becomes just as much of a symbol of the United States as its own flag.

On the one hand, Trump's fixation on aesthetics can seem inconsequential — moves that can be easily undone by a future administration. On the other hand, they're a window into Trump's broader political project. After all, the way Trump is imposing his style and taste onto the American public is a projection of his ideals, and an attempt to change not just America's politics but its culture, too.

There are two major components of Trump's attempt to rebrand America. The first is to establish new American norms — changing the perception of what the average American way of life looks like.

Take Trump's desire to reinforce gender norms and project a certain type of hypermasculinity, all of which permeate his entire aesthetic. Some parts are less subtle than others: Kicking off his Kennedy Center takeover, for example, Trump announced on social media in February that he would “immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” That vision, apparently, had a lot to do with drag shows. “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” the president wrote. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” he added in another post.

Trump also likes to promote traditional images of strength as a representation of both himself and America. His now-famous photo after he was almost assassinated last year — with his fist pumped in the air and blood dripping down his face as he yelled, “Fight, fight, fight” — was turned into a painting that replaced a portrait of Barack Obama in Trump's White House. And his social media channels often promote photoshopped images of Trump as a superhero or with a muscular build.

The Department of Homeland Security in particular has been fond of sharing nostalgic paintings — like John Gast's “American Progress,” representing the imperialist manifest destiny doctrine, or Thomas Kinkade's “Morning Pledge,” depicting American schoolchildren gathered around the US flag in an idyllic suburb — with not-so-subtle captions like “Protect the Homeland” or “Remember your Homeland's Heritage.” (In a recruitment ad for Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS also posted on X, “Defend your culture!”)

All of this imagery, from the gaudy Oval Office overhaul to the kitsch paintings being shared on social media, tries to hark back to an old-fashioned idea of what America is supposed to look like. What Trump is really selling is the notion that the America that elected Barack Obama — the multiracial and cross-class coalition that formed a decisive majority in 2008 and 2012 — never really existed. And there seems to be an everlasting nostalgia for a whiter America in Trump's White House, even in rhetoric articulated by top officials like Stephen Miller. “Why is it that Democrats are so insistent that unlimited numbers of illegals from countries that are incapable of managing their own affairs come here?” Miller said earlier this summer. “Countries like Somalia, countries like Haiti, countries that have no history of successful self-government, and they want unlimited numbers of illegals from those countries and refugees from those countries to come here.”

Ultimately, this is all reflected in Trump's policy agenda. His mass deportation campaign, his executive order on birthright citizenship, and his attack on fundamental rights of immigrants, including free speech, underscore how one of his principal goals as president is to redefine what it really means to be American.

This is the kind of America that, as noted above, Miller and DHS are trying to promote. It's also the America that Trump feels comfortable being associated with. After all, this is the same Donald Trump who, along with his father, was sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for keeping Black tenants out of their buildings.

The second and final component of the rebrand is for Trump to personally embody that America — to transform himself into the ultimate figure to aspire to. And that part has to do with reviving the old American ideal of individualism and self-reliance, the false notion that the most successful Americans are somehow self-made, and that there is no collective ideal worth pursuing more than one's own individual success. Trump's whole aesthetic, and the way he's specifically projecting his style onto American government, is a celebration of that philosophy. It's all an ode to himself, not the American people or the generations before him that made his own fortunes possible in the first place.

That individualistic philosophy is why Trump is so invested in remodeling the White House, the Kennedy Center, and even museums in his own style — to exhibit his image as the greatest marker of success. It's why, on the right, there's such an overwhelming cult following around a single individual. There's an obsession with personifying America, and Trump desperately wants to be that personification.

The America Trump wants to project, in other words, is not the Statue of Liberty welcoming “huddled masses yearning to breathe free” or a country of shared collective interests, but one that adheres to the concept of the survival of the fittest. And Trump seems to believe — or at the very least wants to convey — that he's the fittest of us all.

Much of what has informed Trump's whole philosophy is his simplistic idea of success: that his many failures aren't necessarily a reflection on him, but that his success and wealth were achieved solely because of him. So the aesthetic Trump is trying his very best to push onto Americans — displays of sheer rugged strength, of vast wealth, of supposed success — points to a picture of an individualistic society that doesn't really care about its past sins. Because in Trump's world, so long as you amass an enormous amount of wealth and power (as both he and America have), then it's all worth showing off.

It's like he told Playboy back in 1990: “Let me tell you, a display is a good thing…It's very important that people aspire to be successful. The only way you can do it is if you look at somebody who is.”

That's why Trump doesn't just want to be a political or historical figure, but a cultural icon that can represent American greatness long after he's gone. He wants the whole world to forever look at him.

• A shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis Wednesday, killing two children. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            • The shooter, now dead, was identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman. Westman shared a “manifesto” on social media that is being investigated, police said. The shooter graduated from the school in 2017.
    


            • The attack is the latest in a string of deadly shootings in Minnesota. It is also the 44th school shooting in the US this year, according to a CNN analysis. It has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control.
    


Our live coverage of the Minneapolis school shooting is now here.



            The attack at a Catholic school in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning was the fourth deadly shooting the city had seen in roughly 24 hours, according to CNN affiliates KARE and WCCO.
    


            Speaking before the attack on Annunciation Catholic School, police chief Brian O'Hara called the level of gun violence in the city over the last day “deeply unsettling,” according to KARE.
    


            The first was at about 2 p.m. on Tuesday in south Minneapolis, when a shooter killed one person and wounded six others, KARE reported, citing police.
    


            At around 8 p.m. in another location, a shooter killed one man and injured another.
    


            Then at around 2 a.m. Wednesday, a shooter approached a group on a sidewalk and started shooting, killing one and wounding another, WCCO reported.
    


            Minneapolis Police said Wednesday they did not know if the three shootings were connected.
    


            The Democratic National Committee abruptly ended the final day of its summer meeting in Minneapolis on Wednesday after getting word of the deadly school shooting at the nearby Annunciation Church.
    


            DNC chair Ken Martin announced the shooting had occurred “no more than 10 minutes from where we are now” and urged anyone with medical training to help if they could.
    


            The DNC meeting's closing session, which was scheduled to last three hours, ended after less than 12 minutes. Martin, a native of Minnesota, began the shortened session by saying, “We are heartbroken.”
    


                    “This is the first week of school for students at Annunciation. These families woke up this morning to celebrate milestones in their children's lives,” Martin said.
                





            After a short prayer, the committee voted to unanimously approve all committee reports and adjourn early.
    


            The DNC leader told attendees that Wednesday's shooting came “on the heels of a tragic year where we already lost our dear friends Melissa and Mark Hortman,” referring to the former Democratic speaker of the Minnesota state House, who was assassinated along with her husband at their home in June.
    


            Democratic leaders opened this week's summer meeting by honoring Hortman's legacy. Many Democrats are renewing calls for new gun control measures in the wake of Wednesday's shooting.
    


            Em Paulson, a paraprofessional at a Minneapolis-area elementary school, told CNN Wednesday's shooting at Annunciation Catholic School hits close to home.
    


            “It's so riveting hearing about any school shooting no matter what profession you're in, but when you work in a school, it hurts just a little bit more,” they said.
    


                    “My teaching community is constantly reminded about how, one day, we may need to stand in between these children and violence,” Paulson added.
                





            Paulson shared video from one of several vigils were held across the Twin Cities Wednesday evening. The video, from Minneapolis' Lynnhurst Park, shows residents standing in silence and holding candles while music plays over loudspeakers.
    


            Vincent Francoual, a prominent Minneapolis chef, told CNN's Laura Coates his daughter, who was in Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, is traumatized after surviving the deadly shooting.
    


            There have been 44 US school shootings this year, according to a CNN analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.
    


            That number is one higher than the number of school shootings, 43, that had happened at this point in the year in 2024.
    


            The years since the pandemic have seen a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008, when CNN began tracking such events across public and private K-12 schools and colleges/universities across the United States.
    


            Of the 44 shootings in 2025, 22 shootings have been reported on K-12 campuses and 22 on university and college campuses.
    


            An uncle of the Minneapolis shooter has called today's attack at a Catholic school Mass “an unspeakable tragedy,” according to the Associated Press.
    


            Bob Heleringer, who is a former Kentucky lawmaker, told the AP the shooter was one of his sister's children. He said he did not know the shooter, Robin Westman, well and last saw his relative at a family wedding several years ago.
    


            “I wish (Westman) had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer said.
    


This post has been updated with more information from AP.



            The family of former Democratic Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, who were killed in June during a series of attacks, said today's shooting was a “senseless act of violence” and called on elected officials to act on “common-sense measures.”
    


                    “Mark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that families should be safe in their homes,” the statement says.
                





            “We hope this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common-sense measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.”
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said locked doors during Mass may have helped prevent an already “unthinkable” tragedy at Annunciation Catholic Church from becoming even worse.
    


            “A number of the doors had been locked once Mass began, which is part of their normal procedure,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. “We believe that this step also played a part in ensuring this tragedy did not become that much worse.”
    


            Children also described getting down,  taking cover and helping others take cover, as they had practiced before during training drills, O'Hara said. The Annunciation Catholic School handbook notes it conducts three lockdown drills during the school year.
    


            The police chief described law enforcement responding to a difficult scene, with the first officer running in “not wearing a helmet, not with any rifle or SWAT gear” and quickly heading in the shooter's direction.
    


                    “First responders that came here this morning just walked into this unthinkable, unthinkable act of violence,” the police chief said. “This is one of those scenes that's just deeply, deeply traumatizing.”
                





            In a rare statement on X, first lady Melania Trump highlighted “the need for pre-emptive intervention in identifying potential school shooters.”
    


            Trump wrote that early warning signs “are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions.”
    


                    “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society — beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer,” Trump wrote in her post.
                





            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara gave an update on the status of the injured children tonight.
    


            Two children died in the shooting. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School.
    


            O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins the remaining victims are expected to survive and that some of the children have been released. “A number” of them still remain at the hospital, the police chief said.
    


            “They had a range of injuries. One, I believe, was like a graze wound from a gunshot,” O'Hara said. “All the way to some very, very serious and life-threatening injuries that thankfully they are expected to survive from.”
    


            Three firearms recovered from the scene of the Minneapolis shooting had been legally purchased by the shooter, who had recently been issued a permit to purchase firearms, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.
    


            “I don't have information about where specifically those weapons were purchased, but they were purchased lawfully,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


Context: In Minnesota, a permit is needed to purchase firearms and also to carry the firearms in public. The state doesn't differentiate between open and concealed carry.
    


            Local and federal investigators searching for a motive in the deadly Minneapolis shooting have conducted four search warrants at several locations, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara.
    


            “One is the church, and then there are three residences in the Twin Cities metro that are associated with the shooter,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins tonight, adding that at least one scene is still being processed.
    


            The FBI is helping the Minneapolis Police Department sort through documents that have been retrieved from the scene.
    


                    “What we've seen so far is just a variety of hate,” said O'Hara. “Right now, we don't have a clear motive to establish why (the shooter) did this at the church today, we're obviously open to every possibility, and we're hopeful that once we are able to go through the scene and all of the evidence that's collected, that we'll be able to be able to better provide answers for our community.”
                





            Earlier Wednesday, O'Hara said the shooter, Robin Westman, released a “manifesto” on YouTube that “included some disturbing writings.”
    


            The 23-year-old had a personal connection to the church and school, O'Hara told CNN.
    


            “We believe that the suspect, at some point, was a student here, or a member of the parish, and that a family member here also worked for the church,” O'Hara said.
    


            It was just before 8:30 a.m. when young children were attending Mass at a beloved Catholic school in Minneapolis to mark the first week of classes. Moments later, those students and their families' lives were forever changed after a shooter killed two praying children and injured more than a dozen other people.
    


Here's what you should know:



CNN's Tori B. Powell, Aditi Sangal, Chris Boyette, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Chelsea Bailey, Andi Babineau, Morgan Rimmer, Jill Martin, Samantha Waldenberg, John Miller, Mark Morales, Holmes Lybrand, Barbie Latza Nadeau, Michael Rios, Emma Tucker, Matt Lait, Taylor Romine contributed reporting.



            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett about the mass shooting that killed two Catholic school children attending mass in Minneapolis, calling for love rather than hatred in the wake of this tragedy.
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed gratitude for Annunciation Catholic School staff, who he said “threw their bodies on top of children” to protect them as a shooter opened fire this morning.
    


            “They did the right thing to protect what could have been so many more children dead,” Frey said of school faculty tonight at a vigil in the community.
    


            He went on to thank law enforcement and first responders across the state “who ran towards danger when so many of the rest of us could have ran in the opposite direction.”
    


            Attendees of the vigil held this evening in Richfield for the victims of the shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis spoke with CNN about the impact of the tragedy on the small and connected community.
    


            Annunciation Catholic School alumni Kailee Poling, 27, said she was attending the vigil with her husband and daughter. Poling, who attended the school from first through eighth grades, spoke through tears as she said, “you never think it's going to happen in your community.”
    


                    “Being a parent, I just can't imagine what those kids went through this morning,” she said. “Annunciation is such a tight knit community that when I heard the news, I was just really impacted knowing it's so close to home and knowing it's a community I've been a part of for so long.”
                





            Paul Hartzheim, 48, said he attended the vigil to be connected to his community in Minneapolis where he's lived his entire adult life. “This hit me different today… When it's in your own backyard, it's different,” he said.
    


            Vigil attendee Rhonda Miska, 45, serves at another Catholic parish said she came to support her fellow Catholics after the tragedy.
    


            Miska said the line into the vigil was wrapping around the building when she arrived, adding: “Clearly this is a testament to the need that we have as human beings to not face challenges alone and to be in community.”
    


            Laura Pueringer, 31, from Richfield, went to Annunciation's sister school and said she was reflecting on the moments she learned about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and 9/11 after today's shooting, which propelled her to attend the vigil to call for change.
    


            “We are demanding change. Enough is enough at this point,” she said.
    


            US Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN tonight that a former staffer's daughter witnessed two of her friends get shot — one in the neck and the other in the stomach — during the shooting this morning at Annunciation Catholic Church.
    


            The senator said the girl was at the church with her siblings when the shooting took place.
    


                    “The kids were crawling under the pews and then she ran out,” Klobuchar said. “She was the one that told the dad of one of the kids that his child had been shot.” 
                





            While describing the horrific scene, Klobuchar said there was also incredible bravery and kindness in the moment as older kids made sure to protect the younger children, she said.
    


            Klobuchar said this is a crucial moment for change, saying that children praying during a new school year shows how desperately it's needed.
    


            “These kids praying in a church, packed into the pews, joyful about their first week in school, their new teacher, and then getting shot through church windows. If that isn't enough to move people that we have to make some changes in this country, I don't know what is,” she said.
    


            A vigil for the victims of the Minneapolis school shooting is underway in Richfield, Minnesota, with a line of people spilling out onto the sidewalk wrapping around the building.
    


            The vigil is taking place at the gymnasium of Academy of Holy Angels High School, which was seen packed with people in attendance.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar are present at the vigil.
    


            One mother, whose two kids survived the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School today, expressed relief that her children were not hurt, but anger at the long trend of gun violence in schools.
    


                    “I have such mixed feelings right now, so many of them. But I am just incredibly grateful that this school did and had been preparing and also just incredibly sad and angry that this has to be a thing in any school,” Carla Maldonado told CNN, getting emotional.
                





            The school has active shooter drills “very often,” her husband, Pedro Maldonado, said. About two years ago, Carla Maldonado said she was volunteering and was there when the school had a “lockdown drill.”
    


            Carla Maldonado said when they arrived to the church earlier today, her husband began yelling for their two children.
    


            They were able to reunite with their 7-year-old daughter in the parking lot and later found out their 11-year-old son was sheltering in the basement of the building.
    


            Carla Maldonado said school shootings and gun violence in classrooms is starting to feel like a “broken record.” The mother pointed out that she's not the first parent to have these kinds of feelings and fears.
    


            “The lives that were lost is too much. One is too much,” Maldonado said. “It's not OK.”

            The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it is planning to reclaim management over Washington's Union Station, a move that comes after President Donald Trump's escalated deployment of troops in the nation's capital.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the train station “has fallen into disrepair,” in a statement. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.”
    


            The transportation department is renegotiating an agreement with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation – the nonprofit organization that oversees the station – and Amtrak, and expects “a formal action” confirming its renewed control by September.
    


            The announcement comes after an executive order signed in March titled, “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,” directed “coordinated beautification plan” for facilities, monuments and parks in DC, the removal of graffiti, and to “ensure the cleanliness of public spaces.”
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN that the transportation department wants to “restore (Union Station) has a transportation hub that benefits our nation's capital.”
    


            He added: “President Trump pledged to Make DC Safe & Beautiful Again, and under Secretary Duffy's leadership, the Department of Transportation is taking historic action to reinvest in Union Station.”
    


            It's the latest move by a Trump administration to exert more control over DC, including a federal takeover of the city's police department and deploying the National Guard. Trump said last Friday he will also be asking Congress for $2 billion to make DC “beautiful.”
    


            Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was supportive of the president's efforts to improve infrastructure in the district, adding that if it takes on a larger role in Union Station, it could “be a very significant and good investment for the region.”
    


            “If it's about what Union Station needs for its total transformation, that would be an amazing initiative for the federal government to take on,” the Democrat said at a separate news conference. “It has suffered from not being able to get the money that it needs for the renovation.”
    


            The department of transportation has owned Union Station since the early 1980s but its control has been gradually reduced under various agreements and leases. The Union Station Redevelopment Corporation has controlled the parking structure but received little revenue, according to the transport department.
    


National Guard troops in Washington, DC, begin carrying weapons



            Last year, Amtrak took over management and operations of the station under a sublease from the nonprofit. The company is a federally chartered corporation, which means the federal government is its majority stockholder. Its board of directors, which includes the US Transportation secretary, is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
    


            The announcement Wednesday comes partnered with the debut of Amtrak's new Acela trains that will travel along the Northeast Corridor, cutting down time for passengers.
    


            In recent weeks, members of the National Guard have been seen deployed around Union Station as part of the president's anti-crime agenda in the capital. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week authorized members of the National Guard deployed to the capital to begin carrying weapons, marking a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon that previously indicated National Guard members could be armed if circumstances warranted.
    


            National Guard troops on the DC mission are also expected to begin assisting more with the “beautification” piece of the mission. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites specifically they'll be assisting with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.

            Kyiv was bombarded overnight by Russia's second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with at least 19 people killed, including four children, according to officials.
    


            Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
    


            Among those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.
    


            Ukraine's air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
    


            Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”
    


How Russia's drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide



            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow is still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia's way of describing the war, “continues.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in a post on X.
    


            “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
    


            Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine.
    


            The mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
    


            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
    


            “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
    


            The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in a post on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
    


            The bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.
    


            A British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Putin is “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
    


            London has summoned the Russian ambassador, British foreign secretary David Lammy said in a post on social media, adding: “the killing and destruction must stop.”
    


            Later Thursday, the Spanish foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy's charge d'affaires in protest of the “unacceptable attack.”
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
    


            The White House's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes, writing on X that “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
    


            Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
    


            The couple were getting ready to go to their building's bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
    


            “I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
    


            “As of now, my wife hasn't been found. Her phone doesn't respond. She's not listed anywhere. I don't know… we're still searching,” Protsiuk added.
    


            Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
    


            Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
    


            The major attack on Ukraine's capital comes just over two weeks after Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
    


            But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
    


            On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia's defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
    


            A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
    


            Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
    


            Ukraine's outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
    


            “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
    


            In his analysis of Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
    


            Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
    


            Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
    


            Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

            Kyiv was bombarded overnight by Russia's second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with at least 21 people killed, including four children, according to officials.
    


            Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
    


            Among those killed are children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.
    


            Ukraine's air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
    


            Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”

            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow is still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia's way of describing the war, “continues.”
    


            Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in a post on X.
    


            “These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
    


            Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine.
    


            The mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
    


            European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
    


            “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
    


            The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in a post on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
    


            The bloc is summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels in response to the attack, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said.
    


            Trump is “not happy” but “not surprised” by the strikes, the White House said Thursday, adding that he was watching the developments “intently.”
    


            Trump, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, wants the war to end, but both Putin and Zelensky “must want it to end as well.” She said the president would
    


            A British Council building in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes, according to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said that Putin is “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
    


            London has summoned the Russian ambassador, British foreign secretary David Lammy said in a post on social media, adding: “the killing and destruction must stop.”
    


            Later Thursday, the Spanish foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy's charge d'affaires in protest of the “unacceptable attack.”
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
    


            The White House's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes, writing on X that “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
    


            Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
    


            The couple were getting ready to go to their building's bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
    


            “I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
    


            “As of now, my wife hasn't been found. Her phone doesn't respond. She's not listed anywhere. I don't know… we're still searching,” Protsiuk added.
    


            Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
    


            Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
    


            The major attack on Ukraine's capital comes just over two weeks after Trump held face to face talks with Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
    


            But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
    


            On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia's defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
    


            A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
    


            Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia's Robert Fico.
    


            The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
    


            Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops had captured two villages in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
    


            Ukraine's outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
    


            “Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
    


            In his analysis of Russia's latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
    


            Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
    


            Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
    


            Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

US Open opponents Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko got into a face-to-face argument on the Court 11 sideline right after Townsend won their second-round match 7-5, 6-1 on Wednesday.
    


            Townsend, an American who is ranked No. 1 in doubles, said Ostapenko, a Latvian, who won the 2017 French Open, told her she has “no class” and “no education.”
    


            A reporter asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to those comments.
    


            “I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded.

            “So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on,” Townsend said. “The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”
    


            Ostapenko later posted on social media about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”
    


            “I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she wrote.
    


            After the two players met at the net for a postmatch handshake, they stayed near each other instead of going their separate ways, as usually happens. The 25th-seeded Ostapenko wagged a finger at Townsend as they spoke.
    


            “It's competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”
    


            When they finally stopped talking, Townsend went over to the stands and egged on the partisan crowd, waving her arm overhead and the noise from spectators only grew louder.

            She and Ostapenko have faced each other before in both singles and doubles.
    


            “There's never been any history. I don't know how she feels about me, but there's no beef on my side,” Townsend said. “She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US. I said, ‘I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that.”
    


            Ostapenko went on social media to post what she called, “Just a small update about the match.”
    


            She wrote that Townsend was “disrespectful” for not saying “sorry” after being helped by a net cord during a point.
    


            “There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”

            Ostapenko also complained that Townsend began warming up before the match up at the net, instead of back at the baseline. While most players do begin at the baseline, Townsend noted that she has started with volleying for years.
    


            Ostapenko has gotten into kerfuffles with opponents during matches before, including in 2021 when she lost to Alja Tomljanovic at Wimbledon. Tomljanovic accused Ostapenko of lying about needing to leave the court for a medical timeout to address an abdominal issue.
    


            Townsend recently moved to the top of the WTA doubles rankings. But this is her first time reaching the third round in singles at a grand slam tournament since 2023.
    


            In singles, Townsend is No. 139. She is the lowest-ranked American woman to beat a past grand slam champion in singles at a major since Kristie Ahn defeated – guess who? – Ostapenko at the 2019 US Open.
    


            “The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important,” Townsend said Wednesday. “She's packed up and she's gone.”

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a new order from a Utah judge, who ruled that the state's congressional map must be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections, was “absolutely unconstitutional.”

“How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress, and we want to keep it that way,” he added. “The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED, and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!”

Utah's congressional delegation, comprising Reps. Blake Moore (R-UT), Celeste Maloy (R-UT), Mike Kennedy (R-UT), and Burgess Owens (R-UT), is entirely Republican.

United States District Judge Dianna Gibson took issue with Utah's all-Republican House delegation, saying the Republican-controlled state legislature illegally overruled a 2018 ballot measure designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering.

“Redistricting is not a mere exercise in political line-drawing; it strikes at the very heart of our democracy,” Gibson wrote in Monday's order.

“The way district boundaries are drawn determines whether the right to vote is meaningful, whether equal protection is honored, and whether the fundamental promises of our state and federal constitutions are upheld,” she continued. “How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices, and weaken the rule of law.”

The judge ordered Utah state lawmakers to revise the congressional map within 30 days using guidelines approved by voters in the 2018 ballot measure.

UTAH CONGRESSIONAL MAP MUST BE REDRAWN FOR 2026 ELECTIONS, JUDGE RULES

Utah, a predominantly Republican state, backed Trump by more than 20 points in the last presidential election. However, Salt Lake County remains a Democratic stronghold that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last November. Adopted in 2021, the current congressional map divides the county among the state's four GOP-leaning districts.

Redistricting has triggered an intense battle between Republicans and Democrats over who can constitute the House majority. Texas started aggressively redistricting to strip Democrats of five seats, followed by California's efforts to raise the issue for a popular vote this fall. Other states, such as Maryland and New York, are considering similar plans.

U.S. equity futures were little changed on Thursday evening, after the S&P 500 registered a fresh record driven by renewed optimism around the artificial intelligence trade.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 62 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures pulled back 0.07%, while Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.09%.

Investors also parsed fresh corporate earnings in extended trading. Shares of Ulta Beauty advanced about 3% after hours following a strong full-year outlook, while Autodesk stock gained more than 10% thanks to better-than-expected guidance. Shares of Dell Technologies slipped 5% following a soft outlook for the current quarter.

Stocks are coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.3% at 6,501.86 — the first time above the 6,500-mark. Earlier, the broad-based index set an all-time intraday high. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up about 0.2%. The Dow's 45,636.90 finish was also a new record.

Better-than-expected quarterly earnings from Nvidia helped solidify investor confidence in the health of the AI trade. Although Nvidia's earnings initially sparked some concern tied its data center business and only slightly better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, the report helped lift peer chip stocks that initially pulled back. Nvidia stock ultimately ended the day down less than 1%.

"I think if someone is trying to ring the bell at the top for AI, they're underestimating how quickly penetration grows. We're probably in the first quarter or first third of that cycle for AI," Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder and head of research Tom Lee told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Thursday.

Investors will now turn their attention to fresh inflation data to cap off the final trading day of August with the personal consumption expenditures index. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that the PCE reading for July will show an increase of 0.2% for the month and 2.6% for the year.

With all three major indexes at or near record highs, the gains for the month have been solid. The 30-stock Dow is up 0.01% week to date, but it has logged a 3.4% advance in August. The S&P 500 has tallied a 0.5% increase week to date, and is up 2.6% so far this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added about 1% this week, which has helped boost August's gain to 2.8%.

The token tied to Solana on Thursday rose as high as $216.87, its highest level in six months. It's up more than 7.5% for the week, compared to bitcoin and ETH's week-to-date declines of 3% and 6%, respectively. The move also pulls SOL's month-to-date gain (22%) above ETH's (20%).

The token has been climbing since VanEck last Friday filed to launch a staked Solana ETF in partnership with the decentralized finance platform Jito. Adding to that momentum was a Bloomberg report earlier this week that Galaxy and Jump are seeking $1 billion for a SOL treasury vehicle.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission headquarters in Washington.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken a step that could make it easier for some overseas crypto exchanges to legally offer derivatives to American traders, a move that could reopen a path back into the US for firms like Binance Holdings Ltd.

The agency issued an advisory clarifying how foreign platforms can register as so-called foreign boards of trade, provided they are fully licensed to offer derivatives in regulatory regimes that the CFTC deems comparable to US levels of oversight.

The Trade Desk has a target on its back — shaped like an Amazon logo.

Earlier this month, The Trade Desk's stock cratered almost 40%, with analysts blaming intensifying competition from Amazon and uncertainty about whether Wall Street's once-favorite adtech darling could fight back.

It was The Trade Desk's largest-ever one-day stock decline. But behind the scenes, Amazon's gut punch had been building for years.

In 2022, Amazon's advertising unit set a big, hairy goal: Overtake Google and The Trade Desk to operate the world's No. 1 demand-side platform. A demand-side platform, or DSP, is a sophisticated piece of adtech software that allows advertisers to automate their ad buys and target audiences across a range of websites, apps, and other platforms like TV.

Google is the world's biggest advertising player, which means The Trade Desk was the most immediate in Amazon's line of sight.

At that time, Amazon had already cemented itself as a major advertising player. A year earlier, it brought in $31 billion in ad revenue, behind only Google and Meta, as the third-biggest digital ad seller worldwide. Its ad business was fueled primarily by Amazon sellers jockeying for prime real estate as shoppers search Amazon.com for diapers and dog food. Beyond search, it brought ads to all corners of Amazon — from its delivery packaging to its "Thursday Night Football" telecasts and within its Whole Foods stores — attracting endemic (brands that sell on Amazon) and non-endemic advertisers alike.

Amazon knew there was a bigger opportunity to apply its valuable trove of shopping data beyond its own walls to the wider internet of sites and platforms it doesn't own. But while the Amazon DSP had existed in some form for more than a decade, the tech was clunky, and it hadn't been a priority internally.

Amazon's DSP is now a far more important part of its advertising arsenal, thanks to a series of strategic moves. Amazon made a raft of high-profile hires from companies like Google, Meta, and Roku. The team fixed bugs and helped connect the DSP with other important pieces of tech, like the Amazon Marketing Cloud, which had previously been siloed. It aggressively undercut competitors on fees. And it opened up the TV advertising floodgates by bringing ads to Amazon Prime Video — exclusive inventory competitor DSPs don't have access to — and signing big partnership deals with Disney and Roku.

The strategy appears to be working.

At its peak in 2024, The Trade Desk had a market cap of around $69 billion. It's now trading at around $25 billion, despite posting 19% year-on-year quarterly revenue growth. Meanwhile, Google's adtech business's growth has been hobbled by two recent antitrust rulings that could soon force it to divest assets like its Chrome browser and ad exchange or agree to other remedies.

Current and former Amazon staffers, ad buyers, and other industry insiders said they think Amazon's quest for global DSP domination is only just getting underway. Once considered a sleeping giant of the ad business, Amazon's advertising services segment — of which the DSP plays a small role — accounted for its largest-ever share (9.36%) of the company's total revenue in its most recent quarter, and grew by 23% versus last year.

"We see them gaining tremendous share in the adtech universe since few companies in the world can replicate their value proposition at this point," said Ashwin Navin, CEO of Samba TV, a TV analytics company.

Amazon and Google declined to comment. The Trade Desk didn't respond to requests for comment.

Amazon began laying the groundwork for its big DSP play in 2021. Over 18 months, it hired key players who had helped build some of the most important architectural pieces in adtech history.

The bolstered DSP crew set about reengineering Amazon's ad buying tech to better meet the needs of advertisers, who had become accustomed to the slick interfaces of Google's DV360 and The Trade Desk.

The feedback from agency ad buyers on Amazon's DSP compared to The Trade Desk and Google was "wow, this is complicated and too hard," said Brian O'Kelley, the adtech veteran who founded AppNexus and now runs the adtech startup Scope3. The system was buggy, and there often weren't sufficient media quality controls, O'Kelley said. But over time, Amazon began to fix these, he added.

Analysts at Lightshed Partners said this month that while it previously took brands upward of 75 clicks to set up a campaign within Amazon's DSP, it now takes just 4.

Amazon is famed for operating the "two-pizza rule" — teams small enough to be fed by two pizzas — dedicated to certain projects. It's a concept designed to speed up efficiency and ward off needless bureaucracy. But Amazon's new adtech brain trust found that this sometimes hindered the DSP. Teams that worked on improving the DSP's ability to win bids in advertising auctions needed to better align with the teams tasked with improving the value of Amazon's audience data, for example.

A big leap forward was Amazon's work to better link its DSP with Amazon Marketing Cloud, a move advertising insiders said began to take shape around 18 months ago. Launched for use by all advertisers in 2021, AMC is what's known as a data clean room. That means it connects the dots between Amazon's data and a brand's data to help give advertisers a clearer picture of how their campaigns are driving sales.

Advertisers in the US can target more than 8,000 different audience segments using the DSP, said Daniel Wallis, CEO of VOW, an Amazon Ads partner that helps mid-market brands run campaigns on the Amazon DSP. Amazon Marketing Cloud can help filter that pool down to find people who have added a product to their cart but didn't purchase it, and identify new audiences based on an individual customer's data and the advertiser's campaign objectives.

"That is untouchable," Wallis said. "AMC is a massive, massive, massive, massive win for Amazon, and it's only just starting."

Amazon used to keep a low profile at major industry events like Cannes Lions, the big advertising schmoozefest held in the south of France each June. But it notably upped its presence over the past three years, building a massive "port" to host meetings, panels, and concerts to woo ad buyers.

This year, the DSP team boasted big new partnerships with Roku and Disney. These allow advertisers to reach tens of millions of streaming TV viewers in the US, and use Amazon's data to target specific audiences and measure whether campaigns are driving sales.

The deals bolstered Amazon's already solid position selling ads on smart TVs, which was kicked off by its decision last year to switch on ads by default for all Prime Video users. Morgan Stanley analysts predicted in July that Prime Video would overtake YouTube to become the leading seller of ads on smart TVs in the US by 2027.

Amazon Prime Video's entrance on the advertising scene upended the ad-supported streaming landscape. Its competitive ad prices forced other platforms like Netflix to lower their CPMs, the cost to buy a thousand impressions.

The fees Amazon charges advertisers to use its DSP are also turning heads.

Amazon's DSP fees tend to fall between 4% and 8% on average, according to seven ad buyers and other insiders with direct knowledge. Fees can vary depending on how much a particular agency or advertiser is spending. In some cases, Amazon's DSP free can even drop as low as 1% or free, some of those people said.

Even at the upper end, Amazon still undercuts the industry average DSP platform fee, which often falls more in the 10% to 20% range, buyers said.

"Clients and agencies are under significant amounts of pressure, and I think Amazon identifies an opportunity," said Rhys Williams, managing partner of the media agency The7Stars. "Who else has the clout to make the investments and then who can afford, on the flipside, to undercut the rest of the market?"

While there isn't an available resource that denotes DSP market share, the advertising insiders interviewed for this article estimated that Amazon had quickly gained ground.

Not that The Trade Desk's founder and CEO, Jeff Green, will concede that.

"Amazon is not a competitor and Google really isn't much of a competitor anymore either," Green said on The Trade Desk's August earnings call. "We're trying to buy the open internet, leveraging technology that values media objectively. We don't have any media, and we don't grade our own homework."

But traffic on the open web is declining, thanks in part to the rise of AI features that reduce the need for users to visit websites. Advertisers are looking for adtech partners that can provide them with unique audiences and demonstrable results. Amazon conveniently has it all under one roof.

For years, Green has built a narrative around The Trade Desk's independence, positioning his company as the antidote to the "walled gardens" of Big Tech that are incentivized to direct advertiser dollars to their own platforms rather than the rest of the internet. O'Kelley said the rise of Amazon's rounded offering could force The Trade Desk to rethink that strategy, and perhaps consider acquiring media and data companies in order to better compete.

Right now, "The Trade Desk isn't even playing in the same ballgame," O'Kelley said.

President Donald Trump is fundraising off of checks from the government that he's unlikely to send.

In recent months, Trump's political operation has sent several fundraising emails that mention either the "DOGE Dividend" or tariff rebate checks, both of which theoretically involve sending checks to some Americans worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

In the case of DOGE checks, tax-paying Americans would receive checks of up to $5,000 based on purported savings from DOGE. With tariff rebate checks, some of the revenue from tariffs would be sent primarily to lower-income Americans.

While Trump has said publicly that he's considering pursuing both ideas, he has neither committed to nor made any concerted public push for either.

And even if he did, Trump would have to seek approval from Congress, where Republicans are overwhelmingly against both ideas.

That hasn't stopped the president's campaign from using both concepts — sometimes simultaneously — to solicit donations.

A fundraising email sent by his leadership PAC on Thursday included the subject line, "Do you want a DOGE check?"

But the body of the email included a "Rebate Check Poll."

"Should bonus revenue from tariffs go back to the American People VIA CHECK SIGNED BY TRUMP?" asks the email. "My team tells me that gathering ONE MILLION RESPONSES TODAY is the best way to send these so-called "representatives" a message they won't be able to ignore."

Two large buttons in the body of the email — labeled "QUESTION #1" and "RESPOND TO TRUMP" — send recipients to a donation page.

Trump's political operation has sent at least two other emails about tariff rebate checks this month. One email sent on August 3 asks recipients: "SHOULD BONUS REVENUE FROM MY HISTORIC TRUMP TARIFFS GO BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE VIA REBATE CHECK SIGNED BY TRUMP?"

Before Thursday, Trump had most recently mentioned DOGE dividends in an early June email, with the subject line: "I've got a $5,000 question for you."

"Would you take a DOGE dividend check signed by yours truly?," asks the email. "RESPOND IMMEDIATELY."

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has not floated the DOGE checks idea since February, and DOGE has so far resulted in a much smaller cut to government spending than initially predicted.

Meanwhile, the president said on Wednesday that while there's a "concept" of tariff rebate checks, he "primarily" wants to put additional revenue from tariffs toward paying down the debt.

Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's artificial intelligence models to power AI features in its key products. It's trying to lessen that dependence.

The software company said Thursday that it's begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. The MAI-1-preview model is being tested on LMArena, a website where people can conduct evaluations.

"We will be rolling MAI-1-preview out for certain text use cases within Copilot over the coming weeks to learn and improve from user feedback," Microsoft said in a blog post. The company has published a form where developers can request early access.

Meanwhile, Microsoft remains a key backer of OpenAI and strategic partner to the AI startup that's now valued at about $500 billion. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, which in turn relies on cloud infrastructure from Microsoft to run its models.

Microsoft draws on models from OpenAI to power features in Bing, the Windows 11 operating system and other products. 

But the companies are clearly moving into competition in various ways. Last year, Microsoft added OpenAI to the list of competitors in its annual report. It's a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta.

And in recent months, OpenAI has turned to other cloud providers, such as CoreWeave, Google and Oracle, to meet heavy demand. The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week.

On LMArena, Microsoft's new model was ranked 13th for text workloads on Thursday, below models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, Mistral, OpenAI and xAI.

Microsoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips.

"We have big ambitions for where we go next — model advancements, an exciting roadmap of compute, and the chance to reach billions of people through Microsoft's products," said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft's AI unit, in a post on X.

Microsoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi.

MAI-1-preview represents "our first foundation model trained end to end in house," Suleyman wrote on X. 

Suleyman used to compete with OpenAI at startup Inflection. Last year, Microsoft hired him and many of his Inflection colleagues. Before that, Suleyman was a co-founder of DeepMind, an AI research startup that Google bought in 2014.

Suleyman's group inside Microsoft has been expanding, with about two dozen people coming from Google's DeepMind AI lab in recent months.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against Donald Trump challenges his ability to remove her from office, but only briefly addresses the central accusations that she committed mortgage fraud.

One part of the documents filed in the suit suggests that the issue at hand regarding documents Cook submitted for home loans may have been caused by a "clerical error" on her part and asserts that even if a mistake was made it does not rise to an offense that would justify removing her from office.

The complaint mostly focuses on rules outlined in the Federal Reserve Act that state Fed officials can only be removed for "cause," a legally nebulous condition that may have to be determined by the Supreme Court.

Cook maintains that the fraud allegations do not meet the standard and instead are subterfuge for Trump's efforts to stack the Fed Board of Governors in his favor so that he can get the interest rate cuts he has been demanding.

"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual," the suit states. "This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook's Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven. This allegation is not grounds for removal under the" act.

The document calls the fraud allegation "unsubstantiated and unproven" but does not go into detail about why that is the case.

Whether Cook did in fact lie on the applications will be the focus of establishing the legal standard for cause to remove her.

Trump and other officials, most notably Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have alleged that Cook provided false information about her primary residence when obtaining federally backed mortgages.

The complaint said that even if Cook did make a mistake on the applications, it still wouldn't rise to cause.

"Even if the President had been more careful in obscuring his real justification for targeting Governor Cook, the President's concocted basis for removal — the unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook 'potentially' erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation — does not amount to 'cause' within the meaning of the FRA and is unsupported by caselaw," stated the complaint from Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell.

Moreover, the suit says that "the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional. Even if Governor Cook had committed the infractions that the President alleges— which she did not—the President would lack 'cause' to remove her" under the law.

In a statement to CNBC, Pulte noted that Cook did not attempt to refute the claims against her.

"In her filing, Ms. Cook does not deny that these are her mortgage documents, so one has to wonder why she, or [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell, would want this to be a part of the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to have preeminent integrity and which is critical to the safety and soundness of the U.S. Mortgage Market," Pulte said in a statement to CNBC's Scott Wapner.

However, avoiding the specifics in this type of case is far from unusual as doing so would give credence to the allegation, said Robert Hockett, a professor of law and public finance at Cornell Law School.

"You don't want to play his game, or legitimize his game by playing it," Hockett said. "'I'm not surprised at all that the lawsuit wouldn't include paragraph after paragraph providing the details of her mortgage applications. Because, that would, in effect, be conceding that there's something legitimate about what Trump is doing."

Markets have been relatively unbothered by the battle between Cook and Trump, though that could change as the case escalates.

Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said markets are too focused on the conflict between the two and not enough on the bigger picture of what he calls the "Trumpification" of the Fed.

"We have no privileged knowledge of the legal facts, but believe if it were established Cook committed even accidental mortgage misrepresentation, she would have to go," Guha said in a note earlier this week.

If Trump is successful in removing Cook, it would give him a 4-3 edge on the board in terms of appointees should Stephen Miran get through Senate confirmation to fill an empty seat. That could be extended to 5-2 if Powell chooses not to fill out his term as governor after his run as head of the central bank expires in May 2026.

Pure Storage shares jumped 32% on Thursday and closed at a record after the data storage management vendor reported quarterly results that topped estimates and lifted its guidance for the year.

Wall Street was particularly enthused about the early success of the company's deal with Meta.

In March, Pure announced it had secured an agreement with Meta to be the social media company's "key storage provider." That came three months after Pure teased a new contract with an unnamed "top four" AI hyperscaler. The deal was viewed as a huge win for Pure, as internet giants search for ways to meet their burgeoning storage needs due to artificial intelligence with greater cost and energy efficiency.

Pure started recognizing revenue from its Meta deployments during its second quarter, the company said on its Wednesday call with analysts. The company had expected to deploy 1 to 2 exabytes with Meta by the end of the fiscal year, and said Wednesday that "we are now increasingly confident about the assumption," adding that it could go further. An exabyte is equal to 1 billion gigabytes.

"Our relationship with Meta continues to advance," finance chief Tarek Robbiati, who was named to the post in June, said on the earnings call. Robbiati added that the company is seeing "increased interest from other hyperscalers" looking to replace their traditional storage with Pure's technology.

For the second quarter, Pure reported revenue growth of 13% to $861 million, topping the $846.9 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents exceeded the 39-cent average analyst estimate.

Pure raised its revenue guidance for the year to between $3.6 billion and $3.63 billion from $3.52 billion.

Pure CEO Charles Giancarlo, a former top executive at Cisco who joined the storage company in 2017, said on the earnings call that the rollout with Meta is "right on time and on target."

And in an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" ahead of the call, Giancarlo said that while the company has been selling to the enterprise since its founding about 15 years ago, it's more recently been targeting the hyperscalers.

"We believe that will continue to scale in the years ahead," he said, regarding the new business. Giancarlo said the key is Pure's ability to more efficiently manage space, power and cooling.

"With power being at such a premium, the ability to use less power on storage and therefore be able to use more power for things such as AI becomes very, very interesting" he said.

Pure's rally on Wednesday, its sharpest ever, lifted its market cap to $26 billion, and boosted its stock to a record high, surpassing its prior peak in January. The stock had its third-best day on record in December, when it jumped 22% after the company announced, alongside earnings, that it had landed its first hyperscaler customer.

Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill's efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. 

The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike's corporate staff. It's unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike's EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. 

"As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we're making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE," the company told CNBC in a statement. "This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can."

Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill's efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. 

Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women's, men's and kid's as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. 

Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike's innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. 

Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a "small number" of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.

In a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.

Staff will learn if they're impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.

"To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader," the memo said.

Since taking the helm of the world's largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. 

When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that's now starting to materialize. 

"Instead of a men's, women's and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve," said Hill.

Hill said the company would organize into "sport-obsessed teams" which would "drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands."

The European Union formally proposed Thursday to remove tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key element of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement and ensuring that lower automobile tariffs will be retroactive to the beginning of August.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement that the removal of duties on industrial goods, along with providing "preferential market access" for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, would "ensure tariff relief by the US for the vital EU automotive sector starting retroactively from 1st of August."

"These steps contribute to restoring stability and predictability in EU-US trade and investment relations, to the benefit of business, workers and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic," it added.

The proposal, which now needs to be approved by the European Parliament and Council, was first outlined last week in a joint statement from the two trade partners. In it, they said the United States "expects the European Union's legislative proposals will be ... enacted by the necessary legislatures."

It said tariffs on autos would be reduced from the first day of the month when the EU's legislative proposal were introduced — which means the duties should be cut from Aug. 1.

The U.S. and EU announced they had reached a trade deal — after weeks of tense negotiations — at the end of July. U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal would see a 15% tariff imposed on most European goods to the U.S., including cars.

The rate came as a relief to the United States' largest trading partner after Trump previously threatened it with duties of 30%. Under the deal, the EU also committed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest at least an additional $600 billion in the U.S.

The traditional approach to investing in the energy sector going back decades has often come down to making sure a portfolio has exposure to the "majors" — integrated oil and gas stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have also paid reliable dividends.

There are times when it hasn't worked well in recent history — such as during the peak existential fears over the past decade about an oil industry on the way out as a global source of power — but it has done reasonably well since that panic ended. Over the past five years, whether it's the market performance of Exxon Mobil, or the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), returns have been strong after bottoming out.

But this year, even as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and energy stocks as a category have produced positive returns, they have not been the big winners for investors playing the energy theme of the future, according to Paul Baiocchi, head of fund sales and strategy at SS&C ALPS Advisors.

He pointed to year-to-date outflows among investors in XLE of roughly $7 billion, the largest and most liquid energy market ETF. Some of that may be related to fears that the global economy will slump as a result of President Trump's trade war, and as oil prices remain under pressure, the shares of oil and gas stocks will face greater headwinds.

But it's also a sign of a broader change in how investors think about ways to gain energy exposure.

"It speaks to the fact that advisors and investors are starting to think about energy more in terms of power than just crude oil and natural gas," Baiocchi said on this week's CNBC "ETF Edge."

"The conversation about energy is evolving beyond simply, 'I have to own the large majors,'" he said.

His firm has long offered a way to play a more concentrated bet within the broader energy sector, led by its 15 year-old Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and has seen net inflows this year. 

But the story behind the flight from XLE has a lot to do with the expectations for big changes in the power generation sector in the U.S., and decades of transformation ahead for the electric grid as demand surges, spurred by factors such as AI data centers. Some of Trump's policy priorities play into this trend as well, including support for U.S. artificial intelligence development in a new tech arms race against China, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and the promotion of nuclear power.

"We're talking about incorporating nuclear in a way we haven't in decades," Baiocchi said. "The mix of what generates electricity is evolving and the way investors play energy is evolving."

Jack Clark, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, said at a recent summit where big tech companies met with energy leaders that it estimates 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors.

While XLE has seen outflows this year, its utilities sector comp the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has seen inflows near $3 billion and has tripled the performance of XLE, up roughly 12% this year versus 4% for the broader energy sector.

According to Malcolm Dorson of Global X ETFs, who appeared alongside Baiocchi on "ETF Edge," the investor thinking on energy is changing as power generation becomes central to "all the technologies of tomorrow" and a huge surge in demand begins.

"Not only AI, but electric vehicles and large factories, and the big picture is that the U.S. is sort of not ready for all of this," Dorson said. Global X has launched an ETF focused on the theme, the Global X U.S. Electrification ETF (ZAP). "The U.S. needs to produce about 45% more electricity than it produces today by 2040, after almost two decades of stagnant demand," he said.

And that demand will also mean higher prices paid by electricity consumers, which are expected to continue to outpace general inflation in the years ahead, as they have since 2022. Electricity prices have nearly doubled the inflation rate for all goods and services in 2025, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026.

The ETF experts also weighed in on the impressive performance run for international stocks in 2025, sleeper markets like Argentina and Greece, whether it's time to take some profits, and where to place overseas bets next. You can review that debate in this week's full ETF Edge show.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't.

Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05.

Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company.

Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region.

Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added.

"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said.

Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion.

Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country.

"We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

"It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market."

Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong.

"Everything's sold out," he said.

Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close.

Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play.

In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid.

"Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out."

Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note.

"The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote.

On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up.

"This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote.

David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable."

"I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said.

In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed."

Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI.

Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024.

Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips.

He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals.

Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026.

"Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference.

"We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China.

He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market.

Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China.

Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of.

"It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market."

CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI.

"Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools."

Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year.

"And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly."

Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving.

"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.)

Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says.

While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell.

Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion.

CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks.

She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues.

A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter.

Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks.

Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030.

"The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says.

CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts.

"Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat."

"And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added.

In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year.

It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024.

Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D.

Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business.

For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance.

It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter.

"In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter."

CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call.

The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high.

The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia.

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs.

All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants.

Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending.

William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion.

Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China.

Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology.

Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings.

Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further.

Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth.

During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned.

Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology.

— Brent D. Griffiths

In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports.

The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers.

CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access.

Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips.

The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported.

President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region.

Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though.

Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said.

Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions.

Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner.

Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips.

"They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel."

Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline.

Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call.

Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note.

Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September.

"The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday.

Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside.

In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference.

The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress.

Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter.

The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack.

"We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday.

Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock.

Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million.

Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions.

— Ana Altchek

Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips.

"The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote.

They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name."

Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside.

Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises."

Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models.

"NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index.

Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Walgreens on Thursday named retail veteran Mike Motz as its chief executive officer after the U.S. pharmacy chain was taken private by Sycamore Partners, marking a fresh chapter for the company that has been struggling to keep pace with rivals.

The management shake-up came on the heels of Sycamore's roughly $10 billion acquisition of Walgreens Boots Alliance, completed earlier in the day.

Motz, previously the CEO of office supplies chain Staples' U.S. retail business, will succeed Tim Wentworth and steer the ailing pharmacy operator as it shifts its focus back on core retail and pharmacy operations. He had also worked as the president of Canadian pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart.

Walgreens has struggled to expand beyond its pharmacy business and diversify into broader healthcare services, even as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turned to lower-cost options from Amazon and Walmart for their prescriptions and toiletries.

Wentworth, who took the helm in 2023, spearheaded a turnaround at the company through cost cuts, including the removal of multiple mid-level executives and store closures. Wentworth will continue to serve as a director, Walgreens said.

The company also appointed John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a senior adviser to Sycamore, as executive chairman.

Global popstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce are officially engaged — with a large diamond ring to prove it. But Swifties hoping to emulate the style may find it challenging to do so, experts say.

After a two-year relationship, Swift and Kelce announced their engagement through an Instagram post on their official accounts on Tuesday.

In the photos of their social media post appears a hard-to-miss diamond on Swift's finger, a style that's known as an old mine brilliant cut, Tree Paine, Swift's publicist, told The Associated Press. The ring was designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry in New York City.

"It looks to be upwards of 10 carats, and it might be a vintage stone given the cut," Paul Zimnisky, a New York-based diamond industry analyst, said via email. "Given the quality of the diamond and the size, it could easily be worth hundreds of thousands." 

Jared Jewelers told CNBC through a written statement that the ring could cost approximately $250,000 to $500,000.

However, "no one knows for sure," said Amanda Gizzi, senior vice president of corporate affairs at industry group Jewelers of America. 

It's "a lot of speculation at this point," she said.

While Swift's ring was designed for her, it wouldn't be unusual to see replicas or similar styles appear across the market, said Zimnisky. (The trend-setting Swift's engagement moved several stocks this week, including names related to jewelry and apparel, amid fan interest in her ring and engagement dress.)

A comparable diamond, meanwhile, may be harder to come by.

Old mine diamonds have a "distinct elongated shape with curved edges" and go back to the time when diamonds were cut, shaped and polished by hand, according to Sarah Hanlon, celebrity and entertainment editor of The Knot, a bridal site.

"Due to their rarity, true old mine diamonds can be harder to source," Hanlon said over email.

What's more, the larger carat weight a stone is, the rarer and more expensive it's likely to be, Gizzi said, "especially when we're talking about natural diamonds versus a lab-grown."

According to Zimnisky, lab-grown diamonds can be found for almost 90% less than the cost of a natural diamond. 

However, experts say the elongated style of the singer's ring has already been popping up among engaged couples — or as a song by Swift goes, "It's been a long time coming."

"This style is very much on trend for what we've started to see, which is elongated cuts like hers, as well as a return to natural diamonds and then also this idea of antique cuts," Gizzi said. 

According to Jared Jewelers, "this ring aligns to recent trends in bold gold looks, fancy cuts, and oversized elongated stones."

In fact, elongated shapes like marquise have been selling for a premium this year due to high demand, said Zimnisky.

Couples inspired by Swift's ring can find more affordable versions with less expensive gemstones, said Zimnisky.

While old mine diamonds are rare and can be more costly, diamond shapes like cushions, emeralds and Asschers are easier to come by, said The Knot's Hanlon.

Couples can also look into the vintage jewelry market, experts say. 

"There's no wrong way to go about it," said Gizzi. "The inspiration is definitely something that can be found in different price points."

When shopping for engagement rings, start off by defining your budget. While costs can range widely, the average couple spent $5,200 on an engagement ring, according to The Knot's 2024 Jewelry and Engagement study.

Instead of rules of thumb like spending "three months' salary," your budget should come down to what you're looking for in a ring, experts say.

When shopping for natural diamonds, the four C's – the color, carat, clarity and cut – determine the feature of the diamond as well as the price. 

Lab-grown diamonds will no longer follow the same rules. In June, the Gemological Institute of America, the organization that designed the widely used grading system, said it will instead use descriptive terms to determine the quality of lab-grown diamonds and classify the gems as either "premium" or "standard."

The new grading system will be on the market on Oct. 1, said Stephen Morisseau, a spokesperson for the GIA.

Still, when looking at either lab-grown or natural stones, you want to understand the stone's dimensions, its brilliance, the shape and the weight, said Gizzi.

The U.S. economy grew at a pace that was faster than expected in the second quarter as consumers and businesses held up against tariff volatility.

Gross domestic product rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the April-through-June period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its second estimate for the most encompassing measure of economic activity. The reading was better than an initial 3.0% estimate as well as the 3.1% Dow Jones consensus forecast.

Consumer spending, which rose by 1.6% compared with an initial 1.4% estimate, helped push the number higher.

Importantly, a measure called final sales to private domestic purchasers jumped 1.9%, up from the previous figure of 1.2%. Federal Reserve officials watch that metric closely as an indication of demand and sales that focuses on activity within U.S. borders, an especially important measure considering the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The GDP number also reflected the unusual impact of the tariffs as they related to trade numbers.

Imports, which subtract from GDP, tumbled 29.8% in the quarter after companies stockpiled ahead of Trump's April 2 "liberation day" announcement. The figure was a bit less than the previous estimate of 30.3%.

At the same time, exports, which add to GDP, fell by 1.3%, compared with the previous estimate of -1.8%. Taking the figures together, net exports added nearly 5 percentage points to the Q2 total.

For the first half of the year, GDP has grown about 2.1%, or an average of a little more than 1% per quarter. The economy contracted 0.5% in the first quarter, largely due to the impact of the import rush.

"The good news is consumption came in higher than previously thought. Americans are continuing to spend despite the tariffs and uncertainty, albeit at a slower pace than past years," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "Going forward, the economy is likely to stay in this slower speed mode with spending and growth around 1.5% as the tariffs become more visible to American consumers."

With the first months' data mostly in the books, the economy is growing at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure.

Inflation-related estimates were little changed from the initial reading. Core personal consumption expenditures prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5%, unchanged from the prior figure, while the headline PCE price index edged lower to 2%, in line with the Fed's inflation goal.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

Hello, this is Spriha Srivastava, CNBC International's Executive Editor for Digital, writing from London. This week, I take a closer look at India's tightrope walk — tariffs from Washington, oil from Moscow, and an uneasy handshake with Beijing. Let's dive in.

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Picture this: you're at a dinner party with three friends who are struggling to get along. One is picking fights with everyone, another is slipping you secret notes under the table, and the third is that old frenemy you'd rather avoid but can't ignore. Awkward, right? 

That is where India finds itself. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is keeping India's energy bills in check with cheap oil, and Beijing, despite a bruised relationship, is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week. India's juggling act on the world stage has never looked more complicated, or more consequential. 

Trade with the U.S. has become a flashpoint. Washington has imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, followed by another 25% penalty tied to India's Russian oil purchases. That leaves duties on some Indian exports as high as 50%. The U.S. is India's single largest export market, worth about $87 billion a year, nearly a fifth of its total merchandise trade. Key Indian sectors such as diamonds, garments and seafood are especially exposed.

Think of what that means on the ground. Diamond polishers in Gujarat, garment workers in Tirupur, and seafood processors in Kerala all depend on U.S. orders. Electronics and pharma are spared for now, but other sectors — which employ millions — are suddenly exposed. 

The tariff fight comes even as the two countries deepen strategic ties. On a number of fronts, the U.S. and India are cooperating; the two countries are expanding defense cooperation, for instance, working together in the Quad, and advancing semiconductor supply chain talks. 

Major U.S. firms, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, have increased their investments in India in recent years. Yet trade frictions complicate the relationship, raising the question in Delhi: does Washington view India as a true partner, or simply another trading problem to manage?

Now, let's turn to Russia. India is the world's third-largest oil consumer, burning through more than 5 million barrels a day, so cheap energy isn't a luxury — it's a necessity. In 2021, just 1% of India's crude came from Russia. Today it's more than 35%, around 1.75 million barrels a day, saving Delhi over $17 billion since early 2022, according to analyst estimates. Those discounts have kept inflation in check and given Modi breathing space at home. 

But there's a second layer here. India is walking a geopolitical tightrope, with Pakistan tensions threatening to boil over. In that context, Russia is a vital security partner and central to India's defense procurement, making it difficult for Delhi to pull away without weakening its security posture.

The catch? Washington isn't impressed. U.S. officials including Peter Navarro and Scott Bessent argue Delhi is "profiteering" by paying above the G7's $60 price cap on Russian oil and exporting refined fuels back to Europe.  

Then comes Beijing, which represents perhaps the trickiest relationship of all. Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and stand alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing says the event is a display of solidarity, tensions between India and China remain unresolved.

Border clashes in 2020 killed at least 20 Indian soldiers, prompting a freeze in high-level engagement. Since then, India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, tightened foreign investment rules, and promoted self-reliance in key sectors. Yet trade between the two countries still hit $118 billion last year, with India importing far more than it exports. This imbalance frustrates Delhi but also underscores why cutting ties is not realistic.

Analysts say Modi is unlikely to secure a major breakthrough when he visits Tianjin. But showing up is a signal in itself — that India is willing to keep lines of communication open, even while deepening defense ties with Washington and buying cheap oil from Moscow. 

Step back, and India's position looks clearer. The U.S. is its biggest customer but also its harshest critic. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore. Delhi calls its approach "strategic autonomy." It has worked for decades, but today the balancing act is under more pressure than ever.

Which brings us back to that dinner party. India wants all three guests to remain seated, however awkward the conversation may be. The real test is whether Modi can stop someone from banging the table, throwing down their fork, and storming out. 

Richard Rossow, Senior Adviser and Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that a deal between the U.S. and India is "still very much possible" as the South Asian country puts forth substantial sweeteners.

Arnab Mitra, India consumer analyst at Goldman Sachs, said there could be a mass consumption revival in India driven by rural demand and upcoming GST reforms.

Meera Shankar, former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said India will not be able to entirely open up its agricultural sector because of domestic political sensitivities.

Trade negotiations between India and the U.S. still ongoing. India's Foreign Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that India has "some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended." He added that "it is our right to make decisions in our 'national interest'."

India and Russia reaffirm plans to boost bilateral trade. The two countries have vowed to expand their trade ties in a move indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil are unlikely to impact their partnership.

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor urges India to reassess Russian oil purchases. Raghuram Rajan said that Trump's hefty tariffs send New Delhi a clear "wake-up call" to reduce its dependence on a single trading partner. He added that it is now important for India to "ask who benefits and who is hurt."

People on the street are looking at China and comparing it to India. People who have been away from the Chinese markets think it's time to move back. But, I do think this is a relatively short-term thinking. India is still going to do very very well from a longer-term perspective.

As the AI talent war sweeps across Silicon Valley, Amazon has largely sat on the sidelines. A confidential internal document, and accounts from people familiar with the matter, reveal why.

The company has flagged its unique pay structure, lagging AI reputation, and rigid return-to-office rules as major hurdles. Now, the tech giant is being pushed to rethink its recruiting strategy as it scrambles to compete for top talent.

The document, from late last year, was written by the HR team covering Amazon's non-retail businesses, including Amazon Web Services, advertising, devices, entertainment, and the newly formed artificial general intelligence team.

"GenAI hiring faces challenges like location, compensation, and Amazon's perceived lag in the space," the document noted. "Competitors often provide more comprehensive and aggressive packages." Business Insider obtained a copy of the document.

Amazon's absence from recent splashy AI hires underscores those concerns. Meta has pulled in high-profile talent from ScaleAI, Apple, and OpenAI. Google and OpenAI continue to be top destinations for AI experts, while Microsoft has even drafted a wish list of Meta AI employees it hopes to recruit.

Amazon's spokesperson initially told BI that the company continues to "adapt our approach to remain highly competitive, maintaining flexibility in both our compensation packages and work arrangements to attract and retain the best AI talent in this dynamic market."

Hours later, the spokesperson updated the statement, saying the premise of the story was "wrong," without providing any specifics.

"We continue to attract and retain some of the best people in the world and they're building and deploying GenAI applications at a rapid clip. Our compensation is competitive, but we also want missionaries who are passionate about inventing things that will make a meaningful difference for customers — for those kinds of people, there's no better place in the world to build."

Amazon is famously frugal. One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos still using door desks today.

This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation.

The internal document described compensation as one of the "hotly debated topics" among Amazon recruiters, citing the company's strict use of fixed salary bands for each role. Amazon's "egalitarian philosophy" on pay leaves its offers "below par" compared with top rivals, it added.

"The lack of salary range increases for several key job families over the past few years does not position Amazon as an employer of choice for top tech talent," the document warned.

For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is limited, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field. Indeed, Amazon has yet to find a blockbuster AI product like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, although its Bedrock AI cloud service has made progress.

Amazon's pay structure has been a long-standing source of tension.

Several people who spoke to Business Insider cited the 2020 departure of Amazon robotics VP Brad Porter as evidence of the company's frugal approach hampering talent recruitment and retention. Porter left in part after Amazon refused to raise his pay band.

Amazon's stock vesting schedule is also heavily backloaded, a structure that can be less attractive to new hires. The policy extends even to top executives, who generally receive no cash bonuses.

In addition to highlighting Amazon's "perceived lag in the AI space," the internal document said generative AI has further intensified the competition for specialized talent, particularly individuals with expertise in large language models.

An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling.

"Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave," Reyes said. "Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet."

Some investors share that view. On Amazon's earnings call last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pressed CEO Andy Jassy on Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI and fears of losing market share to rivals. Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call.

Amazon intends to tackle these concerns. According to the document, the company will refine its "compensation and location strategy" and host more events designed to highlight its generative AI capabilities. It also intends to set up dedicated recruiting teams for generative AI within business units like AWS to boost efficiency.

Another point of contention is Amazon's aggressive return-to-office mandate, which has already caused logistical issues.

The company's new "hub" policy — which requires employees to relocate to a central office or risk termination — has further limited its access to "high-demand talent like those with GenAI skills," according to the internal document.

"Hubs constrain market availability," it stated.

Amazon is exploring ways to allow for more "location-flexible" roles, the document added.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company is "always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations."

Amazon hasn't been entirely on the sidelines. Last year, it brought on Adept CEO David Luan as part of a licensing deal with the AI startup. Luan now heads Amazon's AI agents lab. But the company has also seen departures, including senior AI leaders like chip designer Rami Sinno and VP Vasi Philomin, who worked on Bedrock.

One Amazon recruiter told Business Insider that a growing number of job candidates started declining offers last year because of the company's RTO policy. Even if a competitor pays less, people are open to taking the job if they can stay remote, this person said.

"We are losing out on talent," this person added.

Indeed, Bloomberg reported recently that Oracle has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past two years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier.

The internal Amazon document dates to late last year, leaving open the possibility that the company has since adjusted its compensation approach to make exceptions for top AI talent.

Still, multiple people familiar with the situation told Business Insider there haven't been any formal updates to internal pay guidelines. One current Amazon manager said it remains almost impossible for the company to enact sweeping changes, given its long track record of sticking to the existing system. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.

"Based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from changing an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades," Amazon wrote this year about executive compensation in its annual proxy statement.

Of course, the AI talent war may end up being an expensive and misguided strategy, stoked by hype and investor over-exuberance.

Some of the high-profile recruits Meta recently lured have already departed.

The Governor of the South Korean Central Bank says Seoul is planning to use its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to pay over 110 trillion won ($79.3 billion) in government subsidies.

The South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported that the Bank of Korea (BOK) chief Rhee Chang-yong said the payments would be made as part of a new “digital currency pilot project.”

Rhee was speaking during a press conference held in central Seoul on August 28 following a Monetary Policy Committee meeting earlier in the day.

The move has come as something of a surprise in Seoul. The BOK announced in late June this year that it was putting CBDC testing on hold in favor of developing stablecoin-powered alternatives.

Rhee said the subsidy move was part of the greater Han River Project, the country's wider CBDC pilot.

The media outlet said that the new CBDC move was the brainchild of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.

The ministry thinks that CBDC-powered subsidies will help prevent fraudulent use and improve fiscal policy efficiency. Rhee explained:

“This is part of the second Han River Project pilot. Using digital fiat to pay subsidies will let principal contractors better manage subsidies when entering into agreements with subcontractors.”

The BOK and the ministry plan to issue contractors with CBDC tokens instead of bank transfers or vouchers.

The parties think that blockchain technology will help trace funds and ensure they are not being misused. Rhee added:

“During his recent visit to the BOK, Koo Yun-cheol, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, said he thinks this will increase the efficiency and transparency of subsidy payments.”

On August 22, Deputy Prime Minister Koo Yun Cheol attended the joint ministerial briefing on the new government's economic growth strategy and delivered a statement at the Government Complex Seoul. pic.twitter.com/RfSVzp8o0n

The BOK was keen to point out that the new project would differ from the “first” pilot, which wrapped up in the first half of this year.

While the first pilot focused largely on commercial banks and their customers, the subsidy-focused pilot will be private sector-led.

Many of the banks that took part in the first pilot expressed their displeasure with CBDC launch plans.

They complained that they thought it unfair that they should shoulder the burden of making infrastructure investment costs.

But Rhee left the door open to the banking sector, suggesting the BOK is happy to partner with lenders who are still keen on CBDC business. The Governor said:

“Considering the scale of the project, at 110 trillion won, I believe this be attractive for banks. We plan to focus on working with banks with a strong willingness to invest [in the project].”

The South Korean won strengthened after Bank of Korea Governor defended its foreign exchange interventions as efforts to stem the decline and said it is part of talks with the US government https://t.co/jUTgYGUiNh

Rhee also suggested that Seoul's stablecoin pivot has not sounded the death knell for the BOK's CBDC plans.

Indeed, the Governor explained that once lawmakers have finalized the creation of new crypto and stablecoin legislation, the BOK plans to “accelerate” the Han River Project. Rhee said:

“We have discussed upcoming [crypto and stablecoin] legislation with the ministry. The BOK has also exchanged practical opinions with the [regulatory] Financial Services Commission. We hope that the BOK's views will be well-reflected in these deliberations.”

The BOK has previously said that it wants to see a phased CBDC and stablecoin adaptation process. It wants this to begin with traditional financial institutions, such as banks.

Institutions like these are that are subject to strict BOK supervision, Hankook Ilbo remarked.

South Korean financial and crypto chiefs are growing restless, however. They have complained that progress on stablecoin legislation has “slowed to a standstill.”

This is because lawmakers cannot agree on the matter of whether or not tech firms should be allowed to issue KRW-pegged stablecoins.

Conservative voices have urged Seoul to restrict issuance to the commercial banking sector. But progressive opponents say such a move would stifle innovation.

 The change is part of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's “crypto sprint,” an initiative to overhaul regulations in response to proposals from the Trump administration. 

The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a US financial regulator, announced on Thursday that offshore crypto exchanges now have a pathway to legally serve US-based clients by registering under the Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) framework.

US-based clients have had the right to trade on registered offshore platforms since the 1990s under the FBOT registry, and the framework works for all asset classes, acting CFTC Director Caroline Pham said in a statement. Pham said:

Allowing offshore exchanges to serve US residents can potentially increase liquidity in the crypto markets and remove the silos that have kept crypto trapped within regions. 

Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, is currently inaccessible to US residents. Instead, it operates in the country through a separate entity, Binance.US, which is not available in all states. This keeps US residents in a walled garden of crypto companies eligible to do business in the United States.

The CFTC has been overhauling its crypto policies as part of the “crypto sprint,” an initiative to pass comprehensive crypto regulations in the US.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to bring crypto companies back to the country to establish leadership in digital assets.

The lack of clear regulations caused an exodus of crypto companies from the US between 2021 and 2024, and led to a majority of crypto trading volume occurring on offshore exchanges.

Edwin Mata, an attorney and CEO of tokenization platform Brickken, told Cointelegraph that ambiguous regulations have fragmented the policy landscape in the US.

The attorney told Cointelegraph that clear rules of the road would reduce the legal burden on crypto companies, allowing them to do business in the US without fear of legal reprisal and regulation by enforcement.

The CFTC is accepting public feedback for its crypto policies to craft regulations that will protect financial market participants without creating an undue burden that drives innovative projects offshore.

In the financial industry, security has always been about staying one step ahead of attackers. For years, firms relied on perimeter defenses: firewalls, intrusion detection, layered passwords. But as the industry has discovered, most breaches do not come from the outside, they come from the inside. Insider threats, compromised credentials, and lateral movement within networks continue to be among the most challenging risks to manage.

That is why zero-trust security has become a standard in digital infrastructure. Instead of assuming that anyone inside a network is trustworthy, zero-trust architectures require continuous verification of each user, device, and action. This requires fine-grained access controls, maintaining constant authentication, and following the principle of least privilege.

However, even zero-trust has limitations, particularly in environments that process massive volumes of sensitive financial data. Managing dynamic access policies at scale is challenging, and insider threats persist as a risk when administrators themselves hold too much centralized power. Now, new research suggests that blockchain may help solve those problems by embedding zero-trust controls directly into distributed ledgers like Ethereum.

The migration of financial services to API-driven ecosystems has accelerated both innovation and vulnerability. Open banking and open finance require banks to share customer data with third parties through APIs, which can number in the thousands across a large institution, with each API call representing a potential attack surface.

Zero-trust approaches aim to manage this sprawl by authenticating every request in real-time, regardless of its origin. Yet in practice, most implementations rely on centralized systems and policy engines. If an insider or attacker compromises that engine, they can y bypass or even rewrite the rules. For fintech firms, that is an unacceptable risk.

The research suggests a new approach: using Ethereum smart contracts as the access control layer in a zero-trust environment. Instead of a centralized server managing policies, the rules are codified in immutable smart contracts deployed on a blockchain.

Some of the key elements of this approach would include:

By embedding zero-trust principles into blockchain infrastructure, fintechs could create a system where security policy is enforced by software and guaranteed by cryptography and consensus.

The fintech sector is especially vulnerable to insider risks. Employees at payment processors, digital banks, and crypto exchanges often have access to transactional data, customer KYC documents, or even private keys. High-profile failures, such as rogue employees at exchanges siphoning funds or misuse of this data in open banking, have made regulators wary.

Embedding zero-trust controls into blockchain could assuage these risks in three key ways:

Of course, the blockchain-zero-trust hybrid is not a silver bullet. Several challenges stand out:

These are non-trivial hurdles, bit if they can be addressed, the potential payoff is significant.

Industry Momentum Toward Blockchain Security

This research is timely as fintechs are already experimenting with blockchain in adjacent security domains. For example:

In this context, blockchain-based zero-trust is less a radical departure and more a natural extension of where the industry is already heading.

As fintech matures, security can no longer be treated as a bolt-on feature. It must be built into the infrastructure and embedded in the systems that move money and store data. Zero-trust was the first step, shifting the mindset from “keep attackers out” to “verify everything, always.” Blockchain may represent the next step, transforming security from a matter of policy enforcement to a matter of mathematical guarantee.

If adopted, this could reshape the economics of fintech. Today, firms spend billions on overlapping security solutions, audits, and compliance. A shared blockchain-based access control layer could reduce redundancy, streamline regulatory reporting, and standardize best practices.

Zero-trust is already a best practice. Blockchain is already core to fintech innovation. Combining the two may feel ambitious today, but it could quickly become necessary as data sharing explodes with open finance, embedded payments, and tokenized assets.

The research is still experimental, but the concept is clear: Ethereum-based smart contracts could anchor a new generation of transparent, auditable, tamper-resistant access control systems for fintech. That would mitigate insider threats and elevate customer and regulatory trust in an industry that depends on both.

In a sector where reputations can be lost overnight after a breach, that kind of trust may prove to be the most valuable asset of all.

Coinbase's Layer-2 network, Base, has become one of the most active blockchain ecosystems by NFT trading volume, surpassing Solana and Abstract.

DappRadar's blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a recent research report that Base has become a popular place for creators, thanks to cheap mints, creator-friendly tools, and “speculation around a potential airdrop.”

“Base NFTs hit $122M in trading volume and 6.7M sales in 2025, with June marking a breakout moment (+336% MoM volume),” Gherghelas noted.

The surge has been fueled by top collections such as DX Terminal, Onchain Gaias, Oracle Patron, Based Punks, and Get Based, blending retro-futuristic art, interactive gameplay, and, in the case of Onchain Gaias, the ability for holders to train AI-enabled agents across Web3 ecosystems.

The main driver behind Base's NFT boom is Zora, an open-source NFT protocol that lets creators launch low-cost NFTs and drops on Base for less than one U.S. dollar, while also offering an ERC-20 layer for creator tokens.

“Since July alone, Zora on Base has recorded 1.6 million tokens minted, generating $470 million in trading volume and $3.4 million in creator royalties,” Gherghelas wrote.

Data from DefiLlama shows that starting in July, Zora's revenue jumped to $4.7 million, marking a more than 312,000% increase compared to Q4 2024. On the marketplace front, OpenSea has emerged as the leader on Base, with Gherghelas attributing this to the fact that the marketplace was an early Base supporter.

Amid the recent uptick in NFT activity, OpenSea has overtaken Blur over the past 90 days, with trading volume of $389 million, compared to Blur's $312 million, according to Token Terminal.

Oops, something went wrong

Michael Saylor's high-stakes Bitcoin strategy is facing a sharp market backlash, as shares of Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) formerly MicroStrategy have fallen 15% this month. Once celebrated as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company's premium over its Bitcoin assets has eroded to 1.57, down from 3.4 after Donald Trump's re-election. The pullback comes despite an ongoing crypto boom, raising doubts about the sustainability of Saylor's corporate-treasury model. A key pressure point stems from tepid demand for Strategy's newly issued preferred stock, which raised only $47 million, falling short of expectations and forcing a return to common-share issuance despite earlier promises to limit dilution.

The model Saylor popularized borrowing and raising equity to accumulate Bitcoin has inspired other treasury-focused firms that now collectively hold more than $108 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, or roughly 4.7% of its supply. But as Strategy issues equity into a falling multiple, investor confidence could weaken further, potentially creating a negative feedback loop. Analysts note that the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has intensified competition by offering direct exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage, or share dilution. Nearly one-third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings, leaving smaller players especially vulnerable due to liquidity constraints and heavier reliance on convertible debt.

Investor sentiment is also shifting toward alternative digital assets, with Ether-focused treasuries committing more than $19 billion as attention diversifies. While Bitcoin prices remain supported by institutional allocations, many newer entrants have bought at levels above $100,000 and lack the business fundamentals to withstand volatility. Critics warn that if Bitcoin's price were to fall sharply, enthusiasm for treasury-style strategies could fade quickly, compressing valuations across the sector. Supporters of Strategy, however, argue that maintaining capital flexibility may still benefit the company, particularly if it secures inclusion in the S&P 500 or if Bitcoin rallies strongly again.

Aug. 28 (UPI) -- Buenos Aires has allowed certain local taxes, vehicle registrations, driver's licenses and fines to be paid with cryptocurrency for the first time as part of an effort to position the Argentine capital as a leader in using digital currency.

"The goal is for the city to be a global leader in crypto. We already have the human capital, and now we are creating the tools by reducing bureaucracy to make compliance easier for taxpayers and to support the arrival of new companies setting up here," said Jorge Macri, chief of government of Buenos Aires, at the launch of the project.
The initiative, called Buenos Aires Cripto, includes measures to modernize the tax system, promote foreign investment and position the capital as a regional benchmark in the field.
"The digital economy requires us to update and adapt with a government that is modern, agile, efficient and smart," Macri said. He added that new tax measures are being introduced to give businesses a friendlier regulatory framework, including simpler tax filings and changes in how some taxes are calculated.

The shift reflects the fact that both companies and individuals use cryptocurrencies in daily life, including to receive payments from abroad.
As of 2024, about 10,000 Argentines were receiving salaries from abroad through crypto, PayPal or Brazil's central bank payment system, PIX. Buenos Aires also has more than 10 million crypto accounts, representing 22% of those opened in Latin America.
"The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Argentina is not new," said Carlos Torres, lead partner of the Payments Practice at consulting firm EY. He explained that the trend has been growing for several years as a result of Argentina's economic troubles.
"It has been driven mainly by inflation, economic instability and currency volatility, where cryptocurrency was seen as a refuge in the national context," he said.
Exchange platforms such as Binance and Lemon are widely used in Argentina, with Bitcoin leading as the main investment alternative.
Francisco Diaz, director of the business school at Universidad Mayor in Chile, said restrictions on the foreign exchange and international capital markets pushed Argentines to seek creative solutions for using foreign currency.
"Cryptocurrencies, particularly the more stable ones -- stablecoins -- have been widely adopted in recent years as a means of payment, a tool for receiving funds from abroad, for transactions and as a way to save in assets less exposed to inflation. That has expanded awareness and acceptance and fueled the growth of an ecosystem of entrepreneurs and companies tied to the crypto world," he said.

Analysts say the outlook is favorable for Buenos Aires to become a leading city in crypto.
"Given this context, I believe Argentina has all the conditions to expand the use of crypto, especially now that it has the regulatory framework launched in 2024," Torres said.
Argentina recorded the highest number of cryptocurrency users in Latin America in 2024, receiving $91.1 billion in assets, a 6.7% increase from 2023, according to the State of the Crypto Industry 2024 report by Lemon.
Globally, India ranked first, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines, according to the 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.
"India stands out because of the size of its population, its widespread knowledge of technology and the broad use of the Internet and mobile devices, which create favorable conditions for developing this ecosystem," Torres said.
The use of virtual currencies brings benefits but also opens the door to crimes such as money laundering.
"The use of cryptocurrencies reduces transaction costs and makes it easier to create new financial instruments, but it also increases the risks of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering," Diaz said.
Recently, Argentina's Office of Economic Crime and Money Laundering reported a rise in the use of digital assets and virtual platforms to launder illicit funds or justify profits, mainly from drug trafficking.

The problem, Diaz warned, is that innovation is moving faster than regulation.
"It is the responsibility of governments and regulatory institutions, such as central banks, to create a framework that ensures transparency, traceability and cybersecurity. Digital technologies such as blockchain can facilitate traceability," he said.

Oops, something went wrong

Four crypto whales have scooped up over $350 million of Ethereum's native token, ETH, in the past two days, raising questions about what it means for its price. Whale is a moniker for large investors with the capacity to allocate huge sums, which can often directly influence the market's direction.

Precisely, an Arkham Intelligence analyst spotted four addresses with similar patterns and time schedules purchasing $357.24 million of ETH from FalconX, an “institutional crypto prime brokerage,” as described by the company itself.

The identified patterns suggest these addresses could belong to the same entity, or at least to entities connected with each other. Responding to these signals, the analyst questions whether these whales are “buying the bottom,” in the sense that they probably expect—and could somehow influence—Ethereum's price to go up from here.

On a similar note, inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have skyrocketed to a total of $1.83 billion during the last five trading sessions, as Coinspeaker reported earlier today. The institutional activity is not only around ETH but also on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all with significant purchases in what looks like a bottom. For example, Smarter Web Company purchased 45 BTC at around $111,000 each, and Bitplanet will deploy $40 million into Bitcoin, becoming South Korea's first institutional BTC treasury.

Regarding Ethereum , technical indicators and historical price action corroborate the idea of a potential bottom for ETH and other cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum is currently changing hands at $4,747 per token, testing a potential support level. If this price support holds, ETH could bounce back up, consolidating the thesis of a potential bottom marked by large institutional and crypto whale purchases.

Interestingly, Ethereum could have indeed formed a bottom on August 26—since Arkham spotted the four whales that started buying—at around $4,320. Before that, we saw two other likely bottom formations, pushing the ETH price up on August 20 and 21, at $4,070 and $4,215, respectively.

The current price action happens really close to the 50-period exponential moving average in the four-hour chart (4H50EMA), which is an important indicator for the cryptocurrency. Whether a bottom will form at these levels is yet to be seen, but crypto whales and institutions apparently believe this will be the case.

The crypto market is buzzing as investors notice that Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price are showing weakness while a new project called Remittix is stealing the spotlight. With over $21.6 million already raised from more than 623 million tokens sold at $0.0987, Remittix is drawing serious attention. Traders are asking the question: are SHIB and DOGE slipping because capital is rotating into what could be the next big altcoin breakout?

Source: TradingView

Shiba Inu has long been a crowd favorite, but its chart suggests hesitation. Trading around $0.00001250 currently, SHIB has developed a Cup and Handle pattern that can accelerate to $0.0000239 in case the resistance at $0.00001710 is breached. The average daily trading volume increased by 118 percent to $361 million signaling that there are still buyers out there.

However, not everything is bullish. The $0.0000103 support level is weak, and any fall below this value will negate the bullish case. According to analysts, whale wallets have been dispensing rather than hoarding tokens, which is a burden to long-term growth. While optimism remains in pockets of the community, some holders are already diversifying into Remittix, which promises more than speculative rallies.

The Dogecoin price is also facing turbulence, consolidating around $0.22 and testing the crucial $0.20 support. Technical charts show a symmetrical triangle forming, with $0.25 as the ceiling that must be broken for DOGE to rally higher. Failure to do so could push the token down to $0.19 or even $0.17.

Futures data highlights increasing risk. Open interest in DOGE contracts dropped 5 percent to $3.26 billion, while $19 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours. This sharp decline reflects weak conviction among traders. Despite Dogecoin's resilience as a top meme coin, investor capital is clearly rotating toward alternatives offering real-world utility, with Remittix emerging as the standout choice.



While Shiba Inu and the Dogecoin price wobble, Remittix has become the headline story in crypto. Raising over $21.6 million already, the project is being hailed as one of the strongest ICOs of 2025. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is building real utility, enabling cross-border payments and providing a mobile-first experience. This has positioned it as more than just hype, it's a working PayFi solution that institutions and individuals can both use.

These drivers explain why many investors believe Remittix could deliver 100x returns, similar to Shiba Inu in its early days, while also offering real-world use cases that DOGE never achieved.



The story unfolding here is about market rotation. As traders grow cautious about the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu's ability to sustain momentum, Remittix is emerging as the alternative with substance. By combining viral growth with genuine utility, it has managed to attract not just retail speculation but also early institutional curiosity. If this continues, it could set a new standard for how PayFi tokens dominate the next cycle.

Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) demonstrated resilience during the last 24 hours, staging a rally that lifted the token nearly 3% to $5.13. 

The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. This accumulation phase marked the turning point, as buying pressure mounted through the early session.

Momentum built steadily before culminating in a decisive breakout late in the period. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend.

Cryptocurrencies such as ICP appear to be drawing fresh interest as alternative asset classes gain traction. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based on Fibonacci extension levels.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates, August 28th, 2025, Chainwire

The ECM Blockchain has set a new milestone as the first blockchain project initiated by Bangladeshi entrepreneur Tanvirul Islam Prince with global reach. Often described as Bangladesh's 1st blockchain initiative on a global scale, ECM Blockchain is being developed as a next-generation distributed ledger network designed to deliver fast, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure for real-world applications. Unlike many pilot initiatives in the country, ECM Blockchain is preparing for a full mainnet launch in Q4 2025, supported by an ecosystem of live projects already in place.

Bangladesh's Growing Role in the Global Tech Industry

Bangladesh has steadily built a reputation as a source of dynamic digital and technological talent. Over the past decade, the country has become one of the fastest-growing IT outsourcing hubs, with thousands of skilled developers, engineers, and digital professionals contributing to projects worldwide. Its young, tech-savvy population has embraced areas such as software development, fintech solutions, mobile applications, and digital entrepreneurship, earning recognition on the global stage.

Bangladesh has also seen several blockchain-related initiatives in recent years:
		



While these reflect Bangladesh's interest in blockchain, they have largely been pilot projects, academic programs, or localized applications. None have yet positioned Bangladesh as a global player in blockchain technology.

The ECM Blockchain marks a turning point - standing as the first blockchain project from a Bangladeshi founder with true global reach, already deploying live projects and preparing to launch a full-scale blockchain network.

How ECM Blockchain Can Benefit Bangladesh

Though ECM Blockchain is designed as a global network, it also holds significant potential benefits for Bangladesh:

This positions ECM Blockchain not only as a global innovation but also as an enabler of Bangladesh's digital transformation journey.
		



An Ecosystem With Global Intent

The ECM Blockchain is represented in the global blockchain industry through the ECM Ecosystem, a suite of interconnected projects that showcase its real-world utility. This ecosystem demonstrates how a Bangladeshi-founded blockchain can scale globally by powering diverse applications across finance, commerce, and digital innovation.

The ECM Ecosystem already includes live and operational projects, which prove the project's delivery capability even before the blockchain mainnet launch:

In addition, several upcoming projects are positioned to expand ECM's global reach:

All of these projects are designed to run on or integrate with the ECM Blockchain mainnet, scheduled for launch in Q4 2025. This combination of live applications and future projects positions ECM as one of the first blockchain networks from Bangladesh to demonstrate adoption and readiness on a global stage.
		



Supporting the ecosystem's development, BlockVerse Solutions, a Bangladeshi-founded technology company headquartered in Dubai, provides the core technical support for ECM Blockchain - ensuring the network's growth is backed by both local expertise and global infrastructure.

Security and Transparency

The ECM Blockchain is being developed with a focus on transparency, scalability, and security. Independent audits, milestone-based releases, and a robust consensus mechanism will ensure trust for enterprises, developers, and users. Its architecture is designed to support high transaction throughput, low latency, and reliable performance, making it suitable for applications ranging from e-commerce to supply chain and financial services.

ECM Coin and ICO

The ECM Coin will serve as the utility token for the ECM Blockchain and its ecosystem. The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is currently live, with 48 million tokens available at $1.20 each out of a total supply of 200 million ECM.
		



Proceeds will be directed toward the development of the ECM Blockchain, ecosystem expansion, and integrations across industries.

As cryptocurrency trading and ICOs are not permitted under current Bangladeshi regulations, the ECM ICO is being conducted internationally only, targeting global investors and markets outside Bangladesh.

Full ICO details, including tokenomics and roadmap, are available at ecmcoin.com. Investors can participate directly through mycoinpoll.com.

The ECM ICO is live now.

In-depth analysis uncovers the secrets behind market moves.

- U.S. government publishes GDP data on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, endorsing crypto technology under Trump's administration.

- The initiative adds blockchain as a data verification channel without replacing existing methods, led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

- Trump's crypto-friendly policies include dismissing BLS head over data disputes and expanding family-backed crypto ventures like World Liberty Financial.

- Global blockchain adoption grows as crypto industry becomes a political force, with $133M+ spent on pro-crypto election campaigns in 2024.

- Commerce plans to expand blockchain use across government departments, reflecting Lutnick's vision for decentralized data distribution.

The U.S. government began publishing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on public blockchains on Thursday, marking the latest move by the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry.

Officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce stated that this initiative will add a new channel for releasing economic data but will not replace existing methods.

By adopting blockchain technology to host some of its most critical and market-moving economic data, the Department of Commerce is effectively placing a "seal of approval" on the technology. Today, blockchain applications extend far beyond their origins in cryptocurrency and are increasingly used for trading various assets, including money market funds and stocks.

In its initial phase, this U.S. government initiative will cover nine blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The plan involves storing "cryptographic hashes" of the data on these blockchains—essentially a tool to verify data integrity.

Officials from the Department of Commerce mentioned that the administration, led by President Donald Trump, plans to expand the scope of this initiative in the future.

Shift in Government Policy

This policy shift comes just weeks after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that job growth in recent months was significantly lower than previously announced figures. Subsequently, Trump dismissed the head of the BLS and, without providing evidence, suggested political manipulation of the data.

Department of Commerce officials stated that the blockchain initiative is unrelated to the dismissal of the BLS director.

Officials revealed that the driving force behind pushing data onto the blockchain is Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Earlier this year, Lutnick also proposed revising the methodology for calculating GDP to exclude the impact of government spending on the figure. GDP data is published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which operates under the Department of Commerce.

Governments worldwide have been exploring blockchain applications for years: some have used public networks to test central bank digital currencies, while others have considered using the technology for issuing digital credentials.

For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has adopted the Avalanche blockchain—one of the nine blockchains included in the Department of Commerce's data release initiative—to digitize vehicle ownership credentials. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has also explored using the technology to streamline airport security screening processes.

Earlier this year, spurred by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration's "Department of Government Efficiency" also looked into using blockchain to reduce costs and increase government transparency.

The "Crypto President"

Lutnick previewed this change during a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, telling Trump that departmental statistics would begin to be released via blockchain "because you are the 'crypto president.'"

Trump, once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now become a supporter of the industry—during his 2024 campaign, he pledged to reduce regulatory burdens hindering its development.

Upon taking office, he quickly took action to fulfill some of these promises: for instance, the Trump administration has established Bitcoin reserves and accumulated cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana; appointed crypto-friendly agency heads who have terminated enforcement investigations against companies like Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange; and signed a stablecoin regulatory bill—stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value pegged to underlying fiat currencies.

The Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency has also expanded significantly, spanning businesses such as Bitcoin mining and stablecoin issuance. Next week, a cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial, a company backed by the Trump family, will begin trading on centralized exchanges.

This stands in stark contrast to the administration of former President Joe Biden, whose regulatory agencies generally maintained a skeptical stance toward the cryptocurrency industry in recent years.

Cryptocurrency as a Political Force

The U.S. government's adoption of blockchain technology also reflects the evolution of the cryptocurrency industry itself. Years ago, many commercial attempts to deploy blockchain technology failed because they focused on applications using private blockchains—operated by companies that often had policy disagreements, leading to higher costs and greater implementation challenges.

However, under Lutnick's push, the Department of Commerce chose to utilize public blockchains like Ethereum, maintained by computers around the world and updated by volunteer programmers.

Officials stated that cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are all participating in the Department of Commerce's initiative. The Department purchased cryptocurrencies (i.e., "gas fees") required to publish transactions on the blockchain through these exchanges. Kraken and Gemini are planning to go public in the coming months.

The cryptocurrency industry has become a political force to be reckoned with: investors and corporate executives exert influence through well-funded political action committees, similar to how traditional financial industries like banking wield power in Washington.

The industry has provided significant financial support for Trump's reelection campaign and has backed multiple crypto-friendly lawmakers in Congress. According to data analyzed by OpenSecrets, the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase, contributed over $133 million to three super PACs supporting "pro-crypto" candidates in the 2024 election.

Companies like Kraken and Coinbase also donated $1 million each to Trump's inauguration in January.

Lutnick hinted earlier this week that the potential applications of cryptocurrency extend far beyond publishing economic indicators.

During a meeting with Trump and other federal agency leaders on Tuesday, Lutnick said, "We will integrate GDP data into the blockchain to demonstrate its role in data distribution. Subsequently, we will open this capability to all government departments, enabling all of you to adopt this approach."

Home > Economy > Morocco's Digital Currency Revolution: Expert Analysis of the e-Dirham Initiative

Morocco's e-Dirham initiative represents far more than simple currency digitization.

Rabat — As the world is undergoing a massive digital monetary transformation, Morocco is looking to establish itself as a regional and continental model of financial modernization, inclusion, and sovereignty.

Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), the country's central bank, recently introduced its plan to develop a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also dubbed the “e-Dirham,” with the goal of accelerating the transformation of the Moroccan financial landscape.

In an interview with Morocco World News (MWN), economist expert Aicha El Alaoui, a Professor at Sultan Moulay Slimane University in Beni Mellal, provides crucial insights into this transformative project that could reshape Morocco's economic future.

The strategic vision behind e-Dirham

At a recent seminar of the African Central Banks Association (ABCA) in Rabat, BAM Governor Abdellatif Jouahri confirmed that the central bank has already conducted its first pilot focused on peer-to-peer retail payments. 

BAM is now preparing for a new phase of experimentation centered on cross-border payments, particularly in partnership with the Central Bank of Egypt, with support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the governor explained.

This measured approach reflects Morocco's commitment to prudent yet ambitious modernization of its national payment system, with financial inclusion as a primary objective.

Strategic benefits: a multi-dimensional impact

Financial inclusion revolution

According to El Alaoui, the e-Dirham could serve as a strategic lever for modernizing Morocco's monetary system with far-reaching implications. “With the emergence of the digital economy following the fourth industrial revolution, implementing a CBDC could constitute a strategic tool for modernizing the Moroccan monetary system,” she explains.

The most immediate beneficiaries would be Morocco's unbanked population. The e-Dirham would offer a secure and accessible alternative for people without traditional bank accounts; a simple mobile phone would suffice for transactions.

This democratization of payments would, El Alaoui said, particularly benefit various categories of workers and employers, including those in the informal sector, small businesses, and cooperatives, as well as different territories across the country, including rural, mountainous, and Saharan areas, while reducing dependence on cash usage.

Monetary sovereignty in the digital age

In an era where private cryptocurrencies and digital dollarization pose threats to national currencies, the e-Dirham represents a crucial defense mechanism.

“The e-Dirham would constitute a bulwark against competition from private crypto-assets and the risks of digital dollarization,” El Alaoui notes.

By anchoring digital transactions within BAM's scope, Morocco would preserve the primacy of the dirham while strengthening control over financial flows, including those from the informal sector.

The expert clarifies that this approach contributes to maintaining macroeconomic balance and mitigating the impact of external shocks on the national economy, a particularly relevant consideration given global financial volatility.

Cross-border payment transformation

Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect lies in international transactions. The expert envisions a scenario where transfers between Morocco and other countries, particularly African nations, would become faster, less costly, and more transparent.

This transformation would significantly impact diaspora remittances and regional trade.

She further forecasts that the partnership with Egypt, supported by the IMF, could pave the way for creating intra-African digital corridors. This, coupled with the North African country's strategic location, would boost commercial exchanges and consolidate Morocco's position as a strategic financial hub between Africa and Europe.

Navigating the risk landscape

Cybersecurity and privacy challenges

Despite its promise, the e-Dirham faces significant challenges that require rigorous management.

El Alaoui identifies the centralized nature of the e-Dirham as a potential vulnerability, making it a target for sophisticated cyberattacks that could compromise financial system stability in the case of major security breaches.

While facilitating fraud prevention, complete traceability of transactions raises important privacy concerns.

“This requires a delicate balance, such as establishing limits for anonymous transactions similar to China's e-yuan,” she suggests.

Systemic economic risks

On the economic front, systemic risks are equally concerning. Massive bank disintermediation, with deposits transferring to BAM, could reduce banks' credit capacity and slow investment.

Additionally, the instant convertibility of deposits to CBDC could, during crises, amplify panic movements and accelerate digital “bank run” phenomena.

To mitigate these risks, El Alaoui advocates for a prudent approach combining measures such as capping e-Dirham amounts, maintaining commercial banks' role in distribution, and strategic investments in resilient infrastructures, leveraging Moroccan expertise in fintech and cybersecurity.

Distribution strategy: balancing innovation and stability

The choice of distribution model represents a strategic balance between monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

While a direct model where BAM would manage citizens' digital wallets would allow optimal money supply control and homogeneous technological implementation, it carries three major risks: disproportionate operational burden for the central bank, accelerated banking disintermediation, and limited innovation capacity in financial services.

El Alaoui favors a hybrid model, already proven in China and the Bahamas, which seems better suited to the Moroccan context. 

By relying on commercial banks and authorized payment service providers (PSPs) to distribute the e-Dirham, Morocco could leverage their existing infrastructures and customer expertise.

This approach offers two major advantages: preserving the banking ecosystem while deposits remain on banks' balance sheets, allowing them to maintain their role in financing the economy, and accelerated innovation, with institutions able to develop hybrid services combining traditional dirhams and e-Dirham.

African integration: a continental vision

Strategic interoperability

Morocco's reopening to Africa offers a strategic opportunity to integrate the e-Dirham with other African CBDCs and platforms like PAPSS (Pan-African Payment and Settlement System).

This integration could support major continental projects, including the Atlantic Project and the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline, while facilitating intra-African trade within the AfCFTA framework.

“By reducing dependence on the dollar and euro, decreasing transaction costs, and accelerating diaspora fund transfers, this initiative would strengthen Morocco's position as a continental financial hub,” El Alaoui explains.

Geopolitical implications

In a geopolitical context marked by Sino-American rivalry and the emergence of a multipolar economic order, developing autonomous monetary infrastructures has become imperative for Africa.

The interoperability of the e-Dirham with other African systems would constitute a major advance toward deeper financial integration and greater economic independence.

Building the supporting ecosystem

Leveraging existing initiatives

BAM's existing initiatives provide a solid foundation for successful e-Dirham deployment.

The Morocco FinTech Center could play a key role as an experimentation platform, enabling digital currency testing in collaboration with local startups and adapting solutions to Moroccan market specificities.

Advanced technologies like electronic signatures and biometrics could guarantee secure authentication, fundamental for establishing user confidence.

Meanwhile, Open Banking development would facilitate seamless e-Dirham integration into existing banking and financial applications.

Addressing the digital divide

For inclusive and equitable adoption, the expert believes that several major challenges must be addressed.

First, improving access to affordable, reliable internet across the Moroccan territory, particularly in rural and mountainous areas.

Second, strengthening digital skills among populations and local professionals is essential for creating an ecosystem capable of supporting this innovation.

As El Alaoui notes, referencing King Mohammed VI's latest Throne Speech: “There is no place, neither today nor tomorrow, for a Morocco advancing at two speeds.” Developing a resilient and balanced FinTech ecosystem at the country's regional scale is crucial to avoid digital disparities and ensure inclusive, balanced, and fair growth.

More than digital currency

Morocco's e-Dirham initiative represents far more than simple currency digitization, with BAM hoping it will quickly start a comprehensive transformation tool for the country's financial landscape.

The success of this economic milestone will depend on a careful balance between innovation and stability, inclusion and security, national sovereignty and international cooperation.

As Morocco prepares for this digital monetary revolution, the expert analysis suggests that with proper implementation, the e-Dirham could become not just a digital currency but a genuine tool for equitable development and financial emancipation for all Moroccan citizens.

Yet, as El Alaoui conceded, the journey ahead requires navigating complex technical, regulatory, and social challenges.

With Morocco's established expertise in fintech, a measured approach to implementation, and a clear focus on inclusion, the e-Dirham could indeed position the country as an African pioneer in decentralized finance, while serving as a model for other emerging economies embarking on similar digital transformation journeys.

ust when whales thought they had gobbled up all the TOKEN6900 (T6900) ICO issuance in the nick of time, the team behind the latest ‘Murad coin' has announced a final chance to buy. 

The newly added final stage runs until the token claim goes live next Wednesday, 2pm UTC on 3 September. Even better, the T6900 token stays at the previously advertised presale end price of $0.007125. So far, the presale has raised an incredible $3 million.

It means there are now an additional six days of FOMO ahead before the token is claimable by presale buyers and tradable on exchanges.

If you are looking for belief-driven, community-powered value, in what crypto influencer Murad Mahmudov identifies as the meme-led supercycle for crypto, you might do well to follow the example of one whale who has just ponied up $19k in the T6900 ICO.

Presale ended. Final chance.

Earlier today a whale got in big with the T6900 token, which now has astute traders wondering aloud if famed meme coin booster Murad, credited with taking SPX6900 to escape velocity, is buying too.

Murad is not just a meme coin bull; he is a massive SPX6900 shiller, which accounts for 94.34% of his known crypto wealth. Now market watchers are asking if Murad could be rotating some of that wealth into a rival ‘index' coin, TOKEN6900?

The wallet holding his SPX has been inactive since 24 July 2024. But it is likely that he is using an as-yet-unidentified wallet to make his most recent speculative meme coin trades.

Still, whatever else he is buying, Murad is still very much a SPX6900 believer. He thinks it will eventually reach a market cap of $1 trillion to become “the biggest crypto since bitcoin”, even though he has nominally lost $1.23 million on the coin in the past seven days alone. At one point, his portfolio was valued at more than $70 million – today it is $38 million.

But if SPX6900 is struggling to keep its market cap head above $1 billion, never mind $1 trillion, it could make sense to start allocating to its best-known cousin, TOKEN6900. 

It may be only a matter of time before Murad alerts those among his 740,000 followers on X who don't already know about the ticker T6900.

After all, T6900 takes the same irreverent and satirical approach to the financial markets as SPX6900. And like SPX, T6900 is all about virality and community. 



Murad reckons that utility coins are passé. The future is with no-fundamentals meme coins that can generate zeitgeist real estate by harnessing the power of decentralized networks. 

Meme coins crystallize the otherwise latent or unrealizable values of what used to be called brand power. But now, with social media, brands are easily subverted and undermined by online communities – yes, we're looking at you, Cracker Barrel.

T6900 takes this ethos and runs with it as exit liquidity for late capitalism. T6900 is your elector seat to escape the financial ancients' régime.

Vibe liquidity stands at the center of the T6900 world. This crypto shouts to the market: “Cometh to me, you huddled masses; there is liberty and wealth for those brave enough to seize it. T6900 is your ultimate brain-rot finance for the new American financial revolution.”

There's no AI hype machine or flash website promising to revolutionize legacy industries. Instead, T6900 is the product of the collective hallucinations of terminally online traders.

Suffice to say, T6900 is the ultimate trading vehicle – the dream coin and object of desire of degen traders everywhere. And in an America where the President puts crypto first, you would be a fool to bet against T6900.

Crypto YouTube rising star Borch has told his 92.1k subscribers that T6900 could be in store for 2,000% gains because of its viral potential and leveraging of the SPX6900 mindspace.

Borch does not hold back: “This could be one of the most exciting early opportunities in the crypto space right now. In this video, I'll break down everything you need to know about TOKEN6900, why people are hyped, and how you can get in before the big pump.”

In six days' time, when T6900 claiming and trading go live, there will be some who look back and say, “Why didn't he buy some of that 69 action”, and subsequently live to regret not being the second-coming of Murad.  



Actually, it's not quite true that T6900 has no fundamentals because it does offer staking, allowing token owners who deposit into the staking smart contract to earn 33% per annum rewards. 

That's the sort of passive income that legacy finance can't match in an environment of falling interest rates. Once claiming is live, earned rewards will vest over 30 days.

You can purchase TOKEN6900 on the presale site and start staking today. Alternatively, you can buy T6900 directly from the website or in Best Wallet, which is one of the best crypto and bitcoin wallets. 

Best Wallet was recently awarded WalletConnect certification and can be downloaded from Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Finally, Coinsult and SolidProof have audited TOKEN6900's smart contract, and no critical issues have been found.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, led by Bill Pulte, took an unusual step by reducing the number of Federal Home Loan Bank board director seats at most of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks, with the steepest reductions at institutions located in heavily-Democratic cities. 



Efforts under the Trump administration to roll back certain regulations and engage with the industry in less confrontational ways will be an opportunity for banks, but it's unclear just how much benefit they'll see.



A federal jury in Puerto Rico on Tuesday convicted Oluwasegun Baiyewu, 37, of Richmond, Texas, in a money-laundering conspiracy stemming from wide-ranging wire, mail and device fraud schemes that funneled illicit funds to Nigerian transnational organized crime groups through car part auctions.



The European Central Bank is considering a central bank digital currency powered by public blockchain, which would enable EU issuers to compete with U.S.-issued stablecoins. Europe's Central Bank recently released a progress report on a pending CBDC, saying more than 70 organizations are testing payment use cases, and ways to integrate a digital euro with mainstream payment systems.

Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. His work has appeared in...

A new “WEB3” token presale has come under heavy scrutiny after blockchain investigator ZachXBT warned that the project may be tied to individuals behind some of the most notorious scams in the NFT space, including the failed Squiggles collection and alleged scammer “Raichu.”

The project, called WEB3, announced its token presale this week through its official X account. The post instructed users to send SOL to a specified wallet address in exchange for $WEB3 tokens, which would later be airdropped to contributors. 

According to the announcement, the WEB3 price will be determined by the amount of SOL raised divided by the total supply. The team also noted that the presale could end at any time and emphasized that participants should not send funds from exchange wallets.

Reportedly, the project raised $500k in 3 hours, and it has less than 12 hours left. 

While the project framed the offering as a step toward fairness and transparency, ZachXBT quickly raised concerns. “Community alert: @web3 is linked to a team member of the Squiggles NFT rug and Raichu, who I previously posted about,” he wrote on X.

The alarm comes amid resurfacing evidence of the Squiggles scandal in early 2022, when the project drew more than 230,000 Twitter followers and over 360,000 Discord members ahead of a highly anticipated NFT drop. 

memorieshttps://t.co/XJ1KnjVXKL

Investigations at the time by YouTuber Coffeezilla and others suggested the collection's founders were frontmen for a group of serial scammers known as “NFT Factory LA.” The group was linked to multiple failed projects, including League of Sacred Devils, Lucky Buddhas, and Sinful Souls.

Coffeezilla's reporting revealed that Squiggles' team allegedly manipulated sales volume using “shadow wallets” to create the appearance of demand. 

A single account reportedly spent over 800 ETH, more than $2 million, across hundreds of wallets that each purchased three Squiggles NFTs before relisting them on secondary markets. 

Hours after the drop, OpenSea delisted the collection, effectively ending the scheme before it could reach its full $20 million target.

The same network of individuals has been tied to Raichu, also known as Ryan, a promoter who connected NFT projects with celebrities and influencers. 

1/ Ever wonder who connected projects with the celebrities and influencers that promote crypto scams? Here's a breakdown on one of the people doing it known as Raichu (Ryan). pic.twitter.com/uzrEZ1pAvX

ZachXBT documented Raichu's role in several rug pulls, including Baller Ape Club, which raised $2.6 million before its founder was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, and Crazy Lemur Club, which disappeared with $320,000. 

He also linked Raichu to Ancient Cats Club, which allegedly stole $1.7 million, before its team moved on to launch other scams like Bored Bunny and Rich Dwarves Tribe.

In light of this, WEB3's presale announcement has sparked skepticism. The project itself acknowledged in a statement that it anticipated controversy, referencing comparisons to previous hype-driven launches like $YZY, $Libra, and other tokens.

The team claimed it had initially pursued a private fundraising round involving prominent investors but later refunded those contributions, insisting it wanted to “level the playing field” through a public presale.

“When building @web3, we knew what the broader Crypto Twitter community would say about us,” the team wrote. “Our mission is to let the people thrive, build with core DeFi principles, and create a culture that can sustain anything. It's time to believe in something again.”

Despite the reassurances, ZachXBT's warning has amplified doubts, especially given the project's links to figures previously accused of orchestrating multimillion-dollar rug pulls. 

While WEB3 positions itself as an attempt to “Make Crypto Fair Again,” critics argue that the involvement of known actors from past scams raises serious red flags.

At press time, the WEB3 presale remains active, though questions about its legitimacy continue to grow across social platforms.

The project is calling the claims “FUD” and outlining steps it says prove legitimacy. In a public statement, the team argued that suggestions the token had launched before were “blatantly false,” urging critics to “check the chain.”

The group also distanced itself from an individual named Arsalan, accused of trying to raise funds in its name. 

Hello all – we are seeing various FUD in our comment section and thought we should take some time to address it. We understand that the public presale process is unorthodox, so bare with us as we push through here.1. There are claims that this token has been launched before,…

According to the statement, the team terminated the associated member, refunded the “extremely small” amount collected, and later returned the entirety of its private sale funds. 

The project insisted its founders had privately doxxed and described its goal as building “the largest index / media outlet in all of crypto.”

The dispute comes against a backdrop of rising crypto crime. PeckShield data shows hackers stole $142 million in July 2025, up 27% from June. India's CoinDCX lost $44.2 million in an insider-assisted attack, while DeFi protocol GMX suffered a $42 million exploit before negotiating a white-hat recovery.

In total, $2.2 billion vanished in the first half of the year across 344 incidents, with wallet hacks accounting for $1.7 billion and phishing scams another $410 million.

ZachXBT himself has tracked several high-profile frauds. In June, he unmasked New Yorker Christian Nieves, who posed as Coinbase support staff to steal $4 million from users before gambling the funds away.

More recently, on Aug. 13, he exposed a ring of five North Korean IT operatives who allegedly forged identities to secure developer jobs at crypto projects. Breached device data revealed fake IDs, Upwork and LinkedIn accounts, and stolen credentials.

The latest presale controversy shows how even high-profile projects remain vulnerable to reputational damage amid a widening climate of crypto fraud.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Another stablecoin startup has raised serious cash. M0, a company that develops stablecoin infrastructure, announced Thursday that it had raised $40 million in a funding round led by the crypto venture capital firm Polychain and the fintech investor Ribbit Capital. 

Other participants included the Endeavor Catalyst fund and existing investors like Pantera and Bain Capital Crypto. Luca Prosperi, cofounder and CEO of M0, declined to specify his startup's valuation. The Series B round was for equity and locked stashes of the startup's cryptocurrency, or tokens that can only be sold after a set time period. M0 has raised almost $100 million in capital so far.





“We cannot have 1,000 different Tethers and Circles,” Prosperi told Fortune, referring to the two largest issuers of stablecoins. “So what we did is create a layer where different issuers can come and connect and just ensure interoperability, liquidity among themselves.”





M0 is the latest startup to rake in funding from venture capitalists hungry for exposure to one of the buzziest sectors in crypto. 





Over the past year, the once niche asset, which is a cryptocurrency pegged to underlying holdings like the U.S. dollar, has become one of the shiniest objects in Silicon Valley. In June, Circle, the second largest stablecoin issuer next to Tether, went public in a blockbuster IPO that netted the company a market capitalization of now just over $30 billion. And in July, President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law, a bill that regulates and defines rules for the burgeoning stablecoin industry. 




The buzz has become so loud that Big Tech companies like Meta and Airbnb as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their businesses.





“Stablecoins are proliferating,” Josh Rosenthal, a general partner at Polychain, told Fortune. “This is one of the hotter areas within the market—within all of fintech, frankly,”





Proponents hope that the tokens will become the base layer of financial infrastructure and usher in cheaper, faster payments than bank wires or the international transfer system SWIFT. 





That ambition is partly why Prosperi called his startup, which aims to build what he calls the “layer zero of money,” M0. (That's not to mention that anything to the power of zero is one—just like the dollar value of one stablecoin, he said.)





A longtime finance industry veteran who worked at Morgan Stanley, among other institutions, Prosperi took a deep dive into stablecoins when he started advising MakerDAO, a project that issues a stablecoin controlled by a group of crypto investors, rather than a single entity. (Maker has since rebranded to Sky.)




In 2023, he teamed up with his cofounder Gregory Di Prisco, who also worked at MakerDAO, to launch M0. Their startup develops technology lower on the stablecoin tech stack than, say, the stablecoin company Bridge, which was recently acquired by Stripe.





M0 is building a network on which stablecoin issuers can deploy their tokens and not worry about the nitty gritty software decisions that go into transferring assets across blockchains like Ethereum or Solana or changing, say, Circle's token into PayPal's.  





For the time being, Prosperi isn't focused on making his company profitable. Just like Uber, which first expanded its operations across the U.S. before it paid attention to revenue, M0 aims to onboard as many stablecoin issuers onto its network as possible. That includes the crypto wallet MetaMask, which recently announced the launch of its stablecoin in partnership with M0.





“My mandate as a CEO in the next two to five years is to scale this network as much as possible,” said Prosperi. “This is the obsession.”

What is the best crypto narrative of 2025? While mainstream attention focuses on established players, several overlooked sectors are quietly gaining momentum. Real-world asset tokenization projects, emerging layer 1 platforms, and select meme coins are beginning to capture serious investor interest. These under-the-radar opportunities may hold the key to surprising growth stories in the months ahead. This article explores why these asset classes could become standout performers in the next market cycle.

LINK floated between $23.52 and $28 this week, inching up 3.93% while staying above its 10-day average of $24.34. Buyers kept nudging the token higher, but the bid keeps stalling two dollars under the 30 ceiling. The 56 RSI and a mild MACD uptick hint that bulls still have energy, though no one is ready to chase at any cost.

Zoom out one month and the picture looks brighter. LINK has added 27.55% in 30 days and 61.95% in six months, soundly beating most large-cap rivals. The 100-day average sits at $24.82, almost level with the shorter trend line, so momentum is steady rather than overheated. Volume spikes have been modest, suggesting the move is driven by gradual accumulation instead of frantic hype.

If momentum holds, a clean break above $28 puts $30 in play. A push through that mark would open a path to $35, about 25%-35% above today's midpoint. Failure to clear $28 could send LINK back to $21.21, roughly a 15% slide, with a deeper dip toward $16.73 wiping out about 35%. Right now the bias leans upward thanks to recent gains and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, but traders need to see a daily close over $30 to confirm the next leg higher.

HBAR trades in a narrow $0.23-$0.26 band after a 4.90% weekly lift that trimmed part of last month's 16.70% slide. Even with that short-term dip, the token still shows a 21.40% gain over the past six months, keeping it above both its 10-day and 100-day simple averages at $0.24.

Momentum looks steady. RSI sits at 57, Stochastic at 69, and MACD edges above zero, all hinting at mild buying drive rather than overheated action. The nearest ceiling is $0.27; clearing it could open a sprint to the next barrier at $0.31, roughly 15%-20% above the current upper band. Support rests at $0.21, then $0.18. A slip to the first floor would shave about 12% from the current midpoint, while a drop to $0.18 would erase around 30% of recent gains.

Given the modest upward bias, a break toward $0.27 looks more probable than a plunge to $0.21. If buying volume grows, HBAR could test $0.31 within weeks, adding up to 20%. Failure to hold the $0.24 average would flip sentiment and drag the coin back to the $0.21 line, slicing near 15%. Traders watch that balance as the next move takes shape.

The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch.

The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.

XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow.



XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.”

Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it's working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value.

Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.005 by Stage 13, with over $15 million already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention.

Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends

Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.

One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that's just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse's commitment to expanding its utility. It's a big move that gives the community something to actually use.

As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem.

With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won't last forever—so if you're interested, now might be the time to take a closer look.

 

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity

SOL has sprinted 19.16% in the last 7 days and 11.33% in the past month. Stretch the lens to 6 months and the gain grows to 52.48%. The coin now shifts between $183.88 and $220.07, well above its 10-day average of $206 and its 100-day average of $200.09. Momentum is hot, but the pace is starting to look stretched.

Traders eye $234 as the next ceiling. If buyers clear that line, the chart opens toward $270.32, about 24% higher than the top of today's band. The main floor sits at $161.75; a slip there would point to $125.56, roughly 32% under the high side of the current range. Strength gauges back up the bullish case, yet both the 74.67 RSI and 94.62 Stochastic hint at overbought conditions.

The recent record says buyers keep winning, so an advance to $234 looks doable. A clean break could lift SOL another 15-25% in the short run. Still, the crowded long side could spark a quick shakeout toward $162, a dip of around 12%. Net take: trend up, but expect a breather before the next jump.

Ethereum pushed higher again. The coin trades between $4245 and $5136 after jumping 13.92% in the past week and 19.87% over the month. It sits near its 10-day and 100-day averages around $4620, showing the rally still has a base. Six-month gains now stand at 101.15%.

Market signals stay friendly. The strength index reads 59.86, in the safe zone. The fast oscillator is high at 85.31, flagging strong demand, while momentum adds 24.52. If buyers stay active, the first barrier sits at $5492.31. A clean break there points to $6383, about 30% above the current band.

Support rests at $3710.13 and deeper at $2819.04. A dip to the first floor would shave roughly 20%; the second would cut near 40%. Given fresh double-digit gains and positive momentum, the path of least resistance is up. A push toward $5500 looks likely, and a sprint to $6400 cannot be ruled out once the market catches its breath.

LINK, HBAR, SOL, and ETH offer solid upside in the ongoing 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) couples sports passion with meme energy, eyeing 20,000% gains through a community-led, media-backed roadmap.

28 August, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry, today announced plans to launch USD₮ on RGB, a next-generation protocol for issuing digital assets on Bitcoin.

RGB recently reached mainnet with its 0.11.1 release and has been designed to make Bitcoin more than just a store of value. By enabling private, scalable, and user-controlled issuance of assets, RGB opens the door for stablecoins to exist natively on Bitcoin. For Tether, this means USD₮ can be transacted directly on the world's most secure and decentralized network, bringing fast, private, and lightweight payments to billions of people globally.

By bringing USD₮ to RGB, Tether is helping to unlock a new frontier for money on Bitcoin. Users will be able to hold and transfer USD₮ alongside their Bitcoin in the same wallet, enjoy the benefits of private and sovereign transactions, and even send and receive value offline. This combination of Bitcoin's security and Tether's stability represents a major step toward making stablecoins truly native to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

“Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “With RGB, USD₮ gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future.”

This announcement underscores Tether's leadership in expanding the reach of stablecoins and its commitment to ensuring Bitcoin remains not only the original cryptocurrency but also the bedrock for global, everyday money.

22 August, 2025 – Tether, the largest company in the digital asset industry, and the City of Lugano today unveiled the line-up of renowned thought leaders who will gather in Lugano for the fourth annual Plan ₿ Forum on October 24–25, 2025.

A Sioux Falls hedge fund accused of bilking millions from investors in a cryptocurrency scheme is the subject of a multi-state criminal investigation being led by the FBI.

And earlier this month a federal judge presiding over an open civil case against Benaiah Holdings — and its principal officers, Benjamin Wiener and Christopher Hmielewski — froze the company's assets after finding merit in allegations it committed fraud with the allure of digital currency.

“The court has reviewed the facts and information provided to it and has determined that plaintiff has presented evidence of a potential fraud, that there is imminent danger of further dissipation of assets, and that Benjamin Wiener (“Wiener”) engaged in deceptive and misleading statements,” Federal District Court Judge Camela Theeler wrote in an Aug. 15 ruling that ordered the confiscation of Benaiah's assets.

Coinbase's Layer-2 blockchain Base has taken a big leap in the NFT market, securing the third spot in global 30-day NFT trading volume.

Over the last month, Base recorded $47.67 million in NFT trading volume, completing a 70% surge that pushed it past competitors like Immutable zkEVM and Solana, which now rank fourth and fifth, respectively.

The surge was largely driven by collections like Get Based, DX Terminal, and Based Style, which together accounted for nearly $25 million in volume. Beyond NFTs, Base has also become one of the busiest ecosystems overall: in the past 30 days, the network processed 27 million transactions and more than $16 billion in dApp volume.

Despite Base's momentum, Ethereum remains the NFT market leader, logging $408 million in trading volume in the same period. Blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks, Pudgy Penguins, Moonbirds, BAYC, and Lil Pudgys generated over $200 million in combined activity. However, this dominance comes against a backdrop of declining floor prices. 

Polygon continues to hold second place with $62.29 million in 30-day NFT volume, up 15% on the month. Interestingly, most of this growth came from Courtyard NFTs, a project tokenizing real-world assets like trading cards, which alone contributed $57.65 million, up 21%.

The competition among Ethereum, Polygon, and Base underscores the shifting dynamics of NFT adoption. With Base rapidly climbing the ranks and diversifying its ecosystem activity, analysts suggest it could continue to eat into Solana and Immutable's market share if growth remains steady.

Philippine Senator Bam Aquino said he intends to soon propose a bill seeking to place the country's national budget on a blockchain platform, local media reported.

During his appearance at the Manila Tech Summit on Wednesday, Aquino said he plans to file a bill in the next couple of weeks proposing to place government budgeting and transactions to a blockchain-based system for greater openness, local business news website BusinessWorld reported.

"No one is crazy enough to put their transactions on blockchain, where every single step of the way will be logged and transparent to every single citizen. But we want to start,” Aquino said at the conference, according to a report from local TV news channel Bilyonaryo.

In a separate Facebook post, Aquino noted that he talked about innovations at the conference, such as "blockchain-based budgeting to make every peso transparent and accountable."

"If we're able to do this, I think we'll be the first country to have our budget on the blockchain. Of course, I don't know what kind of support I will get," Aquino added.

The Block has reached out to Aquino's office for further information.

Aquino's remarks came after the Department of Budget and Management launched a blockchain-based document validation system on Polygon last month. At the time, Undersecretary Maria Francesca Del Rosario said the system could help combat AI deepfakes and prevent bad actors from falsifying government documents. It's unclear if Aquino's planned measure would be linked to the initiative.

Governments worldwide are exploring blockchain applications for public sector operations. On Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the department will begin publishing economic statistics on the blockchain, starting with GDP figures.

Meanwhile, Philippine Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte has proposed a bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, aiming to accumulate a total of 10,000 BTC over five years.

The cryptocurrency market has had a turbulent week, swinging between sharp pullbacks and brief rallies. After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole on Friday, Bitcoin staged a dramatic rebound, jumping from $110,000 to nearly $117,000 within hours. Ethereum also stole headlines by hitting a fresh all-time high at $4,900. But as quickly as momentum arrived, the market has cooled again, leaving traders trying to read the next move.

One development stands out: Bitcoin dominance is slipping. Currently hovering around 57%, this decline shows capital rotating into altcoins. The pattern is similar to earlier bull market cycles, where Bitcoin rallies first, stalls, and then altcoins take the stage. 

Historically, August has been a slow month for crypto markets. In 2021, momentum didn't return until late September.

The fall in Bitcoin dominance, combined with Ethereum's breakout, hints that altcoins may be on the verge of their own season. If history repeats, the next few weeks could see liquidity pour into a wider set of projects.

In a recent interview with Coinpedia, market analyst Lennaert Snyder outlined where he sees the greatest long-term opportunity beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. His focus is on Layer-1 blockchains with thriving ecosystems and Ethereum Layer-2 networks that enhance scalability.

He said that Arbitrum and Optimism are the two Ethereum Layer-2s poised for lasting success, with Arbitrum being his top pick thanks to its developer activity and adoption.

“I also believe ETH L2s will continue to play a major role in scaling Ethereum. That's why I see Arbitrum and Optimism as strong long-term plays, with ARB as my favorite,” he said.

On the Layer-1 side, Snyder pointed to Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), Tron (TRX), and Injective (INJ) as projects with solid fundamentals. Each, he argued, brings unique strengths, particularly in DeFi and stablecoin markets, making them stand out for long-term accumulation.

The e-rupee is already tiring. What does the US' pro-stablecoin stance mean for the RBI's pet crypto project?

 A weekly newsletter about how finance is getting supercharged by tech in India, and how you can make money work for you Subscribe here


 Good morning [%first_name |Dear Reader%], 

You are reading our subscriber-only newsletter Ka-Ching!—a weekly commentary on fintech and personal finance 

Enter your email address to receive a daily curation of our latest newsletters, stories, and podcasts. 

When was the last time you paid in e-rupees? 
Wait, let me amend that. When have you ever paid in e-rupees? 
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) pet CBDC—or central bank digital currency—has always been a rare beast on the ground, regardless of the fact that it was first launched as early as 2022. As of March 2025, India was purportedly running the world's second-largest CBDC pilot (after China), with around Rs 1,000 crore of e-rupees in circulation ($122 million)—a 334% jump from the previous year. But that, and the 5 million total users it has, are minuscule in the context of India's 1.4 billion population. Less, if you account for the fact that active users number only 400,000. 
About 17 banks and fintechs have so far launched e-rupee wallets for their users, but the enthusiasm seems to be fading before even the first leg is done. For instance, several users told The Ken that digital-rupee wallets on Cred, one of the fintechs that launched them, have now disappeared from the app. 
I can understand why few people have been interested in exploring the e-rupee. Why use them when you can transfer regular rupees from bank account to bank account just as easily, through UPI or bank apps or other wallets? Why keep track of all these different (albeit colourful) denominations?

Tim Draper, an American billionaire and venture capitalist who is one of the bigger crypto sector investors in the world, with a portfolio of over 50 crypto startups, did not hold back on his disinterest in CBDCs in a recent chat with me. “They are ridiculous,” he said, “China has one, and people hate it, too.” Instead, he touts stablecoins and bitcoins as the route to a great crypto economy. 
Setting aside Draper's own motivations, and interests, he isn't the only one who seems to be thinking along these lines. US President Donald Trump, too, has been openly betting on stablecoins over CBDCs for a while. 
In fact, his GENIUS Act, signed into law in the US in July, puts most global CBDC projects at risk—including India's. 
CBDCs vs Stablecoins

To get down to brass tacks, CBDCs are all issued by central banks, and are intended to serve as blockchain versions of regular currencies and function as legal tender.

I enjoy reading The Ken because it is informative, the articles are well researched, well written, without the spin and bias. I admire The Ken team for their dedication to getting closer to the true picture.

Hari Buggana

Chairman and MD, InvAscent

Transparent, Honest, Detailed. To me, The Ken has been this since the day I subscribed to them. The research that they put into each story and the way it is presented is thoroughly interesting. Personally, I've always had a great time interacting with the publication and reading the stories.

Harshil Mathur

CEO and Co-Founder, Razorpay

The Ken has proven naysayers wrong by successfully running a digital news publication on a pure-subscription business model in India. They have shown that discerning readers are willing to pay for well-researched, well-written, in-dept news articles.

Kiran Mazumdar Shaw

Executive Chairperson, Biocon Limited

As a designer, it's easy to get lost in the craft of building products. As a business owner however, keeping up with a rapidly changing landscape is key to saying relevant. The Ken doesn't just help me stay on top of what's happening in India(and beyond), but makes it fun to do so.

Bitcoin stalled, but leading altcoins rose on Wednesday, even as investors assessed Nvidia Corp. NVDA earnings.

Bitcoin was rangebound, oscillating between $112,600 and the early $111,000s. Trading volume fell 3.69% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum slipped below $4,500 overnight after a dash to $4,659 earlier in the day. 

Solana surged nearly 5% during the day, as data revealed that public firms and corporate treasuries jointly own nearly $1.68 billion in SOL.

Over $265 million was liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours, with nearly $156 million in longs wiped out.

Bitcoin's open interest dipped further by 1.24% in the last 24 hours. Over the last month, the funds locked in Bitcoin derivatives have fallen by 6.42%.

This week, Binance traders drastically cut their BTC long exposure, although the majority were still betting on a price increase, according to the Long/Short ratio. 

Top Gainers (24 Hours)

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3.85 trillion, falling modestly by 0.02% over the last 24 hours.

Stocks inched higher on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 147.16 points, or 0.32%, to end at 45,565.23. The S&P 500 climbed 0.41% to end at a record high of 6,481.40. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 0.21% to end at 21,590.14.

Artificial intelligence darling Nvidia reported second-quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday, with revenue and earnings beating analyst estimates. However, the stock tumbled 3.10% in after-hours trading, dragging down the futures.

Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at B2 Ventures, said in a note to Benzinga that the setup for altcoins primarily depends on ETH.

"If it eventually breaks $5,000, altcoins could have 20-30% upside in September. If ETH keeps stalling in the $4,400-4,900 range, we could expect sideways trading with only catalyst-driven moves," Azizov predicted.

The analyst added that if ETH falls below $4,400, even strong altcoins like XRP and Solana risk experiencing 10-15% drawdowns.

Widely followed cryptocurrency analyst Mayne said that Bitcoin's chart looked "totally fine," highlighting potential for a pump if the range lows are reclaimed.

The expert added that there was still plenty of support available. However, they asked to “reassess” if Bitcoin falls below the 2024 all-time high, which is somewhere around early $106,000.

Zhou Xiaochuan stresses need for vigilance to prevent digital currencies being used for excessive speculation

Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has urged a more measured tone amid a global surge of interest in stablecoins, calling for a “multidimensional assessment” of their genuine utility and the systemic risks they may pose.

The United States and Hong Kong are rolling out regulatory frameworks for the asset, and speculation has been growing about the likelihood of Beijing following suit by introducing yuan-backed stablecoins in a bid to further internationalise its currency.

“We need to be vigilant against the risk of stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, as misdirection could trigger fraud and instability in the financial system,” Zhou said at a closed-door China Finance 40 Forum (CF40) seminar last month, according to an article published on Wednesday by the think tank, whose membership includes senior Chinese regulatory officials and financial experts.

He warned that some industry players could leverage the hype around stablecoins to boost their valuations, focusing on cashing out rather than the profitability or sustainability of the stablecoin business, which would be “detrimental to the healthy development of the financial system” and could lead to the accumulation of “systemic risks”.

What's the hype about stablecoins?

The article, which compiled Zhou's comments at the seminar, said that some current discussions on stablecoins were based on a single perspective, and there needed to be a “multidimensional, multi-perspective assessment” instead.

Jackpot.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A ceramic pot turned into a jackpot for a woman on a walk in the Kutnohorsk Region of the Czech Republic. While out on a stroll, the woman happened upon a roughly 900-year-old stash of more than 2,150 medieval silver coins known as denarii.

While the ceramic pot holding the coins was mostly demolished, the coins themselves remain a rich collection. According to a translated statement, they are now being processed by experts from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, and the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora.

Dubbed one of the greatest finds of the last decade, institute archaeologist Filip Velímský believes the discovery is like winning a prize in the lottery—even if someone else was the loser. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he said. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.” 

Stashing coins in a ceramic container was meant to be a way of keeping them safe. And the container certainly did it's job, even if the owner was never able to return for them—the coins weren't recovered for another 900 years. 

According to the experts, that owner couldn't have been just anyone.“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, we lack data on the purchasing power of the contemporary coin,” Velímský said. “But it was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” 

The Kutnohorsk Region was known for frequent battles for the Prague princely throne, with the armies of individual rival princes repeatedly marching through the area, according to the institute. The experts claim that a large collection of coins found in such a place could mean that they were originally meant to pay wages for soldiers, or were some sort of “war booty.” 

Early analysis of the haul shows both that the coins were minted in several places throughout the Kutnohorsk Region, and that they were likely created under the rule of three different Přemysl leaders (likely between 1085 and 1107): King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. 

“The coins were most likely minted in the Prague mint from silver that was imported to Bohemia at the time,” Lenka Mazačová, director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, said in a statement. The coins are made from an silver alloy that included copper, lead, and trace amounts of other metals. The experts hope to figure out the exact composition of the coins to help determine the origin of the silver. 

While we may never know the true intentions—or provenance—of the coin collection, experts still plan to puzzle out as much as possible. Mazačová said that museum staff will now register all the pieces of the collection, clean and restore the coins, and subject them to X-ray imaging and spectral analysis to determine their specific material composition. The goal is to publicly display the collection in 2025, highlighting the 12th century history of the Czech Republic.

Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague. 

“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.

The dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time. 

Jane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England's most evocative historic monuments.” 

The Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country's Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds. 

The current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287. 

And since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower's previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you're buried closer to the church, you're more important, and if you're buried inside the church, you're much, much more important, and if you're buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.

Known burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.  

“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower's community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University's School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals' lives.” 

The analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time. 

The second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.

“I'm looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”

Along with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn't usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them). 

“At the moment we've got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it's going to be really exciting to see whether we've picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”

This Deep-Sea Worm Creates a Toxic Yellow Pigment Found in Rembrandt and Cézanne Paintings

A deep-sea worm that lives in hydrothermal vents is the first known animal to create orpiment, a toxic, arsenic-containing mineral that was used by artists for centuries

By Mohana Basu & Nature magazine 

Paralvinella hessleri accumulates microscopic particles of arsenic on its outer skin, which reacts with sulfide to form a microscopic armour of yellow orpiment.

A bright-yellow worm that lives in deep-sea hydrothermal vents is the first known animal to create orpiment, a brilliant but toxic mineral used by artists from antiquity until the nineteenth century. The findings were published in PLoS Biology this week.

The worm (Paralvinella hessleri) is the only creature to inhabit the hottest part of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Okinawa Trough in the western Pacific Ocean. The hot, mineral-rich water that shoots up from the sea floor contains high levels of toxic sulfide and arsenic.

Researchers found that the worm accumulates microscopic particles of arsenic on its outer skin cells as well as along its internal organs. This reacts with sulfide from the hydrothermal vent to form small clumps of orpiment, fashioning a microscopic armour around the worm that protects it from the toxic environment.

Orpiment is a naturally occurring arsenic sulfide mineral, often found in hydrothermal and magmatic ore deposits.

The findings came as a surprise to the research group. In the deep sea, creatures dwell in total darkness and are typically grey-ish white or adorned in hues of orange to dark red, says co-author Hao Wang, a deep-sea biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Qingdao. It “doesn't make any sense to make pigment in total darkness,” Wang says.

The team is yet to discover how arsenic is transported into the creature's internal organs.

Other deep-sea creatures are known to produce minerals as a protective armour. The scaly-foot snail (Chrysomallon squamiferum) for instance, hosts bacteria that detoxifies sulfide through the extracellular biomineralization of iron sulfides in its scales, says Narissa Bax, a marine scientist at Greenland Institute of Natural Resources in Nuuk.

“Paralvinella hessleri may intentionally combine toxins into a single, ‘safe', crystalline mineral within its own cells,” she says. It's ability to fight poison with poison in this way is remarkable, she adds.

But further research to confirm how this occurs will be challenging, owing to the extreme conditions in deep-sea vents, and difficulties studying such species outside their natural environments, she says. Cultivation of P. hessleri in a laboratory setting is currently not possible.

Travis Kelce engineered more than a proposal—he designed a tiny machine built to bend light.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

By now, the whole world knows about Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce—and that  ring. 

Yes, even we at Pop Mech care, because rings are tiny marvels of engineering: shaped, cut, and designed to balance beauty with strength. And this one is worth a closer look.  

So far, only one closeup photo of Swift's engagement ring has surfaced, but it's enough to confirm a few things: it's set with a cushion-cut oval diamond in yellow gold and mounted on an engraved band that Kelce designed in collaboration with Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry. The rest remains speculation. 

The Ring will likely show up in many more photos leading up to the Swift-Kelce wedding (whenever that is), but don't expect it to look the same in every shot. That's because diamonds bend, scatter, and reflect light in different ways depending on the angle of view and the quality of the lighting. How the diamond might appear from other points of view besides the classic hand pose can also be affected by factors like its cut, color, and size, which is predictably huge. All of which makes it a lot more complicated—and expensive—than a friendship bracelet.

“It's a very romantic cut because the original cushion cuts were made to capture and refract candlelight,” gemologist Ashley Fox recently told Forbes. “Diamond cutters don't cut stones like this anymore, so Travis would've had to find a rough-cut diamond and have it cut like this if it's not an antique.”

How diamonds reflect and refract light impacts how they appear at different angles. Refraction occurs when light changes direction as it moves between materials at different speeds. This results in the light bending away as it passes through a diamond, and is also what makes a straw look like it's broken in two if you stick it in a glass of water. 

Since diamonds are often cut into prisms, refracted light particles passing through can appear as a rainbow—white light is actually a conglomeration of all the visible colors on the electromagnetic spectrum. How light is refracted depends on the angle of the prism and where planes (each facet is a plane) on that prism are positioned at the moment.

Because different wavelengths of light are refracted more or less depending on their frequency (with violet refracting the most and red the least), those wavelengths will bend at different angles, and white light will separate into its rainbow of components. This is known as dispersion. Maximizing dispersion in a diamons requires a very specific cut that is neither too shallow nor too deep. 

A diamond as large as Swift's also has so many facets at which that dispersion process can begin, and is bound to scatter sparks of colored light. If future photos of Swift's engagement ring capture a shower of rainbow sparks, refraction and dispersion are working their magic. 

As if diamonds didn't glitter enough, they also dazzle with reflection. The atoms of a diamond are arranged in a crystal lattice structure. Light entering the gemstone will interact with the electrons in those atoms and cause some wavelengths of light to be absorbed and some to be reflected. Which wavelengths are reflected or absorbed depends on the cut of the diamond, and the rare old mine cut is intended to come alive in candlelight more than sunlight. Any impurities or defects could also influence its sparkle.

There's also internal reflection, or light passing through before it's bent and reflected internally by the diamond's facets. This can cause the diamond to look lighter or darker, depending on angle and lighting. The diamond in Taylor Swift's ring is a white diamond. But if it looks slightly darker in any photos leading up to her wedding day, your eyes aren't mistaken. (Gray diamonds exist, but Swift'sa is definitely white.)

Just wait for the oncoming barrage of ring photos—you'll have plenty of opportunities to compare how this diamond appears at different angles. As Swift once sang, “A diamond's gotta shine.”

Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the "workhorses" of life essential to nearly every living process. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In a new study, published in Nature, researchers chemically linked life's amino acids to RNA in conditions that could have occurred on the early Earth -- an achievement that has eluded scientists since the early 1970s.

Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: "Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. Understanding the origin of protein synthesis is fundamental to understanding where life came from.

"Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis.

"Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. This machine requires chemical instructions written in messenger RNA, which carries a gene's sequence from a cell's DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein.

"We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. The chemistry is spontaneous, selective and could have occurred on the early Earth."

Previous attempts to attach amino acids to RNA used highly reactive molecules, but these broke down in water and caused the amino acids to react with each other, rather than become linked to RNA.

For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. This activation involved a thioester, a high-energy chemical compound important in many of life's biochemical processes and that has already been theorized to play a role at the start of life*.

Professor Powner said: "Our study unites two prominent origin of life theories -- the 'RNA world', where self-replicating RNA is proposed to be fundamental, and the 'thioester world', in which thioesters are seen as the energy source for the earliest forms of life."

In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life.

The next step, the researchers said, was to establish how RNA sequences could bind preferentially to specific amino acids, so that RNA could begin to code instructions for protein synthesis -- the origin of the genetic code.

"There are numerous problems to overcome before we can fully elucidate the origin of life, but the most challenging and exciting remains the origins of protein synthesis," said Professor Powner.

Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: "Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin.

"Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life.

"What is particularly groundbreaking is that the activated amino acid used in this study is a thioester, a type of molecule made from Coenzyme A, a chemical found in all living cells. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building."

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said that the reactions they demonstrated could plausibly have taken place in pools or lakes of water on the early Earth (but not likely in the oceans as the concentrations of the chemicals would likely be too diluted).

The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules).

Notes

*The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a "thioester world" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters.

** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape. As part of their study, the research team showed how, once the amino acids were loaded on to the RNA, they could synthesize with other amino acids to form peptides.

The work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the Simons Foundation and the Royal Society.

Researchers found dietary changes may help improve cognitive health and stave off dementia.

A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk.

"One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial," said study first author Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad. "We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions."

Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.

One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (APOE), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease -- the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the APOE4 variant have a 3-to-4-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. People with two copies of the APOE4 variant (called APOE4 homozygous) have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's than those without.

To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.

Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.

They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.

"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," Liu said. "This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant."

A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.

In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. People often don't know their APOE genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.

"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," Liu said.

Small but noticeable changes in behavior make it possible to predict the flash of lightning that comes with new insight.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

What happens right before the proverbial lightbulb goes off, before an insight is revealed, before someone pulls an Archimedes and leaps from the bathtub at a revelation that just struck like a crack of electricity?

It turns out that there is a way to pick up on the slight behavioral changes that give away when a “eureka” moment is about to happen. To see if it was possible to catch an oncoming “eureka” in real time, psychologist Shadab Tabatabaeian from Georgetown University led a study that followed doctorate-level mathematicians as they struggled through seemingly unsolvable problems pulled from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. 

Watching hours of recorded footage—most of it taking the form of scenes of frustration at a blackboard—Tabatabaeian and her research team had a eureka of their own. There was always a noticeable shift in behavior just minutes before the mathematicians would finally see where an answer was hiding. Movements that had been repeated ad nauseam suddenly changed, and new connections were made between things that were seen as unrelated before. When they were on the edge of solving a problem, their behavior would become less predictable. 

“These moments were often accompanied by sudden movements and emotional exclamations, not unlike Archimedes running naked through the streets of ancient Syracuse yelling ‘eureka,' though admittedly less dramatic,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the journal PNAS.

This stretches beyond math. Since behaviors associated with being on the brink of a discovery should be universal, Tabatabaeian thinks they would likely show up in just about any discipline, as should initial reactions after a discovery. The mathematicians observed would often claim they were genuinely surprised when answers appeared to them, and when asked whether they could explain how they reached their conclusions, most were unable to explain why an insight hit them. It seems that the “sudden flash of lightning” feeling quoted by mathematician Carl Gauss is not an empty metaphor. 

Eureka moments land so abruptly that Tabatabaeian likens them to critical transitions, or “sudden shifts from one stable regime to another” that occur in anything that qualifies as a complex system—whether it is your own hand-eye coordination or something as vast as an entire ecosystem. Systems like this end up on the verge of a tipping point when they begin to become unstable. There are some early signals that indicate high risk of a segue into a new regime, and these signals have successfully predicted transitions in many systems.

When applying the idea of eureka signals to mathematicians, the researchers had to consider the system of a mathematician. For some reason, as they found, mathematicians often prefer chalk and a blackboard, so these are included in the system along with the actual mathematician and anything already written on the blackboard. There are some parallels to an ecosystem here—mathematicians create what Tabatabaeian terms “notational niches” for different parts of the problem. They will then go about figuring out the problem through writing, gestures, and glances from one niche in the system to another. 

Before that lightbulb flashed in their minds, the mathematicians showed changes in blackboard activity. There were sudden shifts from one written niche to another. As someone approached an insight, these shifts—the product of a new way of thinking versus the previous way—would increase until the moment of confusion turned to clarity. In the case of one mathematician, attention shifted to different niches than before, and links were discovered between elements of the problem that had previously not been thought to be connected.

It turned out that most pre-eureka behaviors were similar, though they may have differed slightly depending on the individual. Mathematicians who are just about to come to a solution tended to shift their focus from a niche on one area of the blackboard to another and make unprecedented connections. This indicated when insight was imminent.

“Old ideas can be rediscovered with a single glance,” Tabatabaeian said. “New connections can be discovered by accident as one's hands and eyes are drawn across the blackboard. The entire distributed system of situated activity may be the engine of […] insight.”

New Cell Transplant for Type 1 Diabetes Sidesteps Need for Immunosuppressants

Scientists treated a person's type 1 diabetes with genetically modified insulin-producing cells that evaded immune system attacks. This is the first therapy for the condition that does not require immunosuppressant drugs

People with type 1 diabetes must constantly rely on insulin injections or pumps, usually for the rest of their life after diagnosis. The autoimmune disease destroys the cells that produce the hormone, which is crucial to keeping blood sugar in check. But now research suggests a new therapy could finally allow people with type 1 diabetes to make insulin on their own.

A 42-year-old man who has lived most of his life with type 1 diabetes has become the first human to receive a transplant of genetically modified insulin-producing cells that can slip past the immune system's mistaken attacks. This marks the first pancreatic cell transplant in a human to sidestep the need for immunosuppressant drugs—and it might even lead to a future cure for the disease, researchers say.

“This is the most exciting moment of my scientific career,” says cell biologist Per-Ola Carlsson of Uppsala University in Sweden, who helped develop the procedure. The new treatment, he says, “opens the future possibility of treating not only diabetes but other autoimmune diseases.”

Scientists injected nearly 80 million genetically tweaked cells into the participant's forearm muscle, and 12 weeks later the cells were still alive and producing insulin. The recipient did require additional insulin injections—but the injected cells showed no signs of rejection, which the researchers say is a major step forward. The results were reported this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.

About two million people in the U.S. live with type 1 diabetes, which typically requires an intensive regimen of insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring. If their blood sugar runs amok, people face severe risks, including heart attacks, nerve damage, vision problems, kidney disease, and more.

For decades, scientists have struggled to develop therapies that can successfully replenish beta cells—the specialized insulin-producing cells that are found in the pancreas. Newly added functional beta cells are usually quickly destroyed because a type 1 diabetic immune system flags them as invaders. A few past attempts successfully transplanted donor islets—clusters of pancreatic cells that included beta cells—but these always ultimately triggered an aggressive immune response. And such a response requires recipients to take lifelong immunosuppressive drugs, which come with serious side effects, such as increased risks of infections and cancer. For example, at a conference in June, Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that 10 out of 12 participants who were treated with a stem-cell-based infusion during a clinical trial no longer required insulin injections a year after the therapy. But they may continue to need to immunosuppressants.

In the new study, Carlsson and his team looked for ways to dodge the immune response. First, they broke down a deceased donor's pancreatic islets into single cells. Using the common gene-editing technique CRISPR, the researchers inactivated in some of these cells two genes that control the expression of proteins called human leukocyte antigens, which direct the immune system to the foreign cells. Without those markers, the immune system can't easily recognize and destroy the donor cells.

To further evade immune system detection, the team made some cells express higher levels of a gene that discourages attacks by the body's natural killer cells and macrophages, two types of immune cells. Three months after the treatment, although the immune system attacked some cells in the graft, it left the cells that had the inactivated genes and overexpressed gene alone. Blood tests showed no measurable immune cell activation or antibody production in response to these cells.

Before the transplant, the participant had no measurable naturally produced insulin and was receiving daily doses of the hormone. But within four to 12 weeks following the transplant, his levels rose slightly on their own after meals—showing that the new beta cells were releasing some insulin in response to glucose. Four adverse events occurred, but none were serious or related to the modified cells.

The advance “is amazing,” says Laura Alonso, chief of the division of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. Unlike type 2 diabetes, in which people have poorly functioning beta cells, type 1 diabetes can destroy beta cells completely. Some people with type 1 diabetes may still have a small set of functional beta cells, but in more established cases, the immune system often whittles away all cells, Alonso says. For those established cases, she says, “cell-based therapy is where we need to go.”

Alonso adds, however, that even though the new study is promising, it involved just one participant and is therefore preliminary. And longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the therapy's safety before it can be offered to more people. She also notes that the injected cells produced only 7 percent of the insulin needed for a person to be fully independent of additional medication. The researchers supplied the recipient with insulin doses to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

“It's a relatively short but nonetheless important finding,” says Kevan Herold, an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine, who was also not involved in the study. Because the participant still required a substantial amount of insulin after the transplant and no others have received this treatment yet, Harold cautions that “the clinical significance is somewhat unproven.”

Carlsson says the team will continue to monitor the transplant recipient over the next year and will increase the dose of the modified cells if no adverse effects occur. In the meantime, he and his colleagues are developing a stem cell source that would be capable of producing large quantities of insulin-producing cells. “The combination of those two advances would create the possibility of a cure for type 1 diabetes,” he says.

While Herold thinks it's still too early to consider this approach for a cure, “these options are now here to change the disease in ways that have never been possible before,” he says. “There's tremendous hope.”

These Succulents Glow in the Dark—And They're Gorgeous

Houseplants become rechargeable night-lights after injection with tiny phosphor particles

By Katherine Bourzac & Nature magazine 

Researchers gave these succulents in the Echevaria genus a glow up by injecting them with luminescent particles.

Liu et al./Matter

University students might soon have something other than black-light posters to brighten their dorm rooms. Researchers have created glow-in-the-dark plants by injecting succulents with materials similar to those that make the posters light up. The fleshy plants shine as brightly as a night light, and can be made to do so in a wide variety of colours — a first for glowing houseplants, according to the team.

The researchers, led by Xuejie Zhang, a materials scientist at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, describe today how they produced the plants in the journal Matter. They have applied for a patent on the technology, which they hope will lead to decorative installations and living lighting.

The idea of making glowing plants has captivated scientists since the late 1980s, when researchers made the first bioluminescent plant by inserting a gene from a firefly (Photinus pyralis) into a type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). This work laid the foundation for the first genetically engineered luminescent houseplant to come on the market in the United States, last year. The biotechnology firm Light Bio in Sun Valley, Idaho, sells the petunia (Petunia hybrida), which glows a very faint green thanks to genes from a light-emitting mushroom.

Unlike the petunia, which emits light through chemical reactions in its cells, the succulent glows because of materials injected into its leaves. These materials — phosphor particles made of strontium and aluminium dosed with other metals — absorb energy from light at one wavelength, store some of that energy and then slowly re-emit it at a different wavelength for several hours. For instance, one material the scientists injected into their succulents absorbs ultraviolet and blue light, and re-emits it as green light.

This type of ‘afterglow' phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark toys and paints, and as an imaging tracer for laboratory animals. Whereas genetically engineered bioluminescent plants are, so far, limited in the range of colours they emit, afterglow phosphors span a wide variety of hues, including red and blue, and they can be combined to produce a white glow.

This video shows how the tiny phosphor particles spread through the succulent leaves after they are injected.

Liu et al./Matter

The researchers purchased phosphors containing strontium aluminate and ground them down to particles of various sizes before injecting them into an assortment of plants. They found that particles around 7 micrometres in diameter glowed more brightly than did nanoparticles in plants, and were able to fill up the interior tissues of succulent leaves for a stronger, more uniform glow. By contrast, plants with simple leaf structures, such as tobacco plants and pak choi, emitted a more patchy glow.

The plant favoured by the team is the succulent Echevaria ‘Mebina', a common houseplant that grows rosettes of dense, fleshy leaves. To make every leaf glow, the researchers had to inject each one with phoshor particles, a process that takes about ten minutes. The luminescence — which the team generated in hues of blue-green, blue-violet, green, red and white — lasted as long as 120 minutes after exposing the plant to tailored wavelengths of light or sunlight, and could be triggered again and again over the 10 days of the study.

The researchers estimate that the cost of materials to create one plant is about 10 yuan (US$1.40).

Co-author Shuting Liu, also at the South China Agricultural University, says that the team hopes to move away from injecting each leaf by using smaller particles, which can spread more readily throughout plants. But the team will need to overcome an obstacle: the smaller the particle, the dimmer the glow.

Keith Wood, chief executive of Light Bio, says it's not yet clear how these particles affect the health of the plants over their lifespan. Additionally, the researchers acknowledge that more safety testing is needed; in particular, they need to know whether a leaf full of particles would be toxic if accidentally ingested.

Wood is also sceptical that glowing plants will ever be a living lighting system, capable of replacing light bulbs. So far, researchers have fallen “spectacularly short of that objective”, he says. Instead, whimsy is the name of the game with these plants. “We're making something fun, enjoyable, magical,” he adds.

In the context of an increasing need for clinical assessments of foundation models, we developed EyeFM, a multimodal vision–language eyecare copilot, and conducted a multifaceted evaluation, including retrospective validations, multicountry efficacy validation as a clinical copilot and a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT). EyeFM was pretrained on 14.5 million ocular images from five imaging modalities paired with clinical texts from global, multiethnic datasets. Efficacy validation invited 44 ophthalmologists across North America, Europe, Asia and Africa in primary and specialty care settings, highlighting its utility as a clinical copilot. The RCT—a parallel, single-center, double-masked study—assessed EyeFM as a clinical copilot in retinal disease screening among a high-risk population in China. A total of 668 participants (mean age 57.5 years, 79.5% male) were randomized to 16 ophthalmologists, equally allocated into intervention (with EyeFM copilot) and control (standard care) groups. The primary endpoint indicated that ophthalmologists with EyeFM copilot achieved higher correct diagnostic rate (92.2% versus 75.4%, P < 0.001) and referral rate (92.2% versus 80.5%, P < 0.001). Secondary outcome indicated improved standardization score of clinical reports (median 33 versus 37, P < 0.001). Participant satisfaction with the screening was similar between groups, whereas the intervention group demonstrated higher compliance with self-management (70.1% versus 49.1%, P < 0.001) and referral suggestions (33.7% versus 20.2%, P < 0.001) at follow-up. Post-deployment evaluations indicated strong user acceptance. Our study provided evidence that implementing EyeFM copilot can improve the performance of ophthalmologists and the outcome of patients.

For patients attending ocular disease screening in the primary care centre where only low-cost examination technics are available, EyeFM can use its single modality and cross-modality ability to assist disease detection, followed with screening report writing assisted by its vision-question answering ability. Then, some patients will be referred to specialty care settings for further examination, where EyeFM can use its integrated modality disease detection or even zero-shot ability to facilitate further diagnosis. The image-report writing ability and vision-question answering can also assist to improve the efficiency of clinical report and patient letter drafting in specialty care settings.

a) The diagram of pretraining process for EyeFM. EyeFM was first pretrained for its image encoder with five modalities of images, then conducted vision-language joint pretraining. The image module includes one encoder and five decoders. The encoder comprises 24 Transformer blocks. Each decoder comprises two Transformer blocks. The linear projection layer is implemented with a single convolutional layer. In the vision-language module, the projection is implemented using a single linear layer, which serves to connect the image encoder with the language module. The language module is based on LLaMA 2 architecture with 7 billion parameters. b) The diagram of human-in-the-loop process for EyeFM. EyeFM human-in-the-loop utilized DPO and federated learning for distributed knowledge evolution.

First, we conducted retrospective validations, comparing EyeFM with prior benchmarks of medical foundation models. This step serves as the foundation for evaluating the model's performance and safety when progressing to clinical applications. Second, we conducted reader studies and real-world study prospectively to test the efficiency of EyeFM as a clinical copilot to assist ophthalmologists. This step bridged the gap between the performance of the model its own and its efficiency when applicated by clinicians. At last, we validated EyeFM with a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Colored chart, above, validation experiments and their corresponding relationship with the functions of EyeFM. The x-axis represents different tasks of EyeFM and y-axis represents validation experiments. Cells were coloured if the experiments have validated corresponding functions. Below, glossary table of the tasks, clinical scenario and experiments. RCT, randomised controlled trial.

a) For disease detection on CFP, the sample sizes and P values are: DR (n = 1501, P = 0.042), glaucoma suspect (n = 405, P = 0.533), AMD suspect (n = 370, P = 0.627), MMD (n = 643, P = 0.030). For disease detection on OCT, the sample sizes and P values are: ciDME (n = 523, P = 0.002), glaucoma (n = 412, P = 0.333), AMD (n = 379, n = 0.036). The sample size for cataract detection on external eye photo was 198 and the P value was 0.102. Error bars represent 95% CI. b)Segmentation dice similarity coefficient. The sample size for segmentation on CFP are: HE (n = 13), SE (n = 14), HM (n = 27) and MA (n = 27). The P value for haemorrhages was 0.083. The sample size was 759 for OCT segmentation. Error bars represent 95% CI. c) Cross-modality disease detection of ciDME that usually need to be diagnosed by OCT with CFP inputs only (left), the sample size was 405 and the P value was <0.001. Cross-modality disease detection of wet-AMD that usually need to be diagnosed by CFP with external eye photo inputs (right) the sample size was 332 and the P value was 0.583. Boxes indicate quartile values and whiskers indicate 1.5×the interquartile range. d) Image-report generation, model performance was evaluated by automatic metrics labelled as the x-axis. The sample size was 500. Boxes indicate quartile values and whiskers indicate 1.5× the interquartile range. e) Head-to-head comparison of answers generated by EyeFM and ophthalmologists, the measurement was summed score for quality, safety and empathy, ranged from 3–15 scores. Presented as Kernel Density Plot. The sample size was 300 for EyeFM and 1200 for ophthalmologists. P values were calculated with two-sided t-test between EyeFM and the better-performed reference model. *** denotes P < 0.001, n.s. represents P > 0.05. CFP, colour fundus photo; OCT, optical coherence tomography; EEP, external eye photo; DR, diabetic retinopathy; DME, diabetic macular oedema; AMD, age-related macular degeneration; MMD, myopic macular degeneration; MA, microaneurysms; HE, hard exudates; HM, haemorrhages; SE, soft exudates.

Source data

Participants included in the trial will first receive diagnosis and report by ophthalmologists by CFP, then receive additional OCT examinations for consultant-level reviewers to assess and revise the diagnosis and report. All diagnosis and reports before revision by consultant-level reviewers will be included in the analysis for correct diagnosis rate, correct referral rate and standardization score of reports. Only participants that are correctly diagnosed as ‘with fundus abnormality' will be included in the follow-up for patient compliance analysis. CFP, colour fundus photo; OCT, optical coherence tomography.

Light-responsive proteins play an essential role in all domains of life by sensing and responding to environmental light signals. However, the de novo design of light-responsive proteins with precisely defined structures and reversible responsive behaviours is an unmet challenge. Here we describe a computational approach to design protein–protein interactions regulated by non-canonical amino acids, focusing on the light-responsive phenylalanine-4′-azobenzene (AzoF). Using this approach, we designed light-responsive cyclic homo-oligomers and heterodimers, which only assemble in AzoF's trans configuration and disassemble when AzoF photoisomerizes to the cis configuration. Biophysical characterization confirms the light-responsive assembly and disassembly of these complexes, and the crystal structures match the design models with atomic accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of these light-responsive proteins in constructing light-responsive hydrogels and engineering synthetic ligand receptors to optocontrol cell signalling in mammalian cells. Our approach opens avenues for designing environmentally responsive protein structures and broadens the toolkit for optogenetics and optochemistry.

The protein complex structure was generated using a Monte Carlo docking procedure, guided by a scoring function that optimizes protein-protein interactions and AzoF incorporation. For the final docked structure, the neighbouring backbone positions were queried against the AzoF interaction field, and the residue position with a matching hit was used to install the corresponding AzoF rotamer. For symmetric structures, AzoF installation was propagated to the other chains at their respective symmetric positions.

Left, design models of LRO-C2-35 (a), LRO-C3-37 (b) and LRO-C3-64 (c). The AzoF residues are highlighted as stick representations. Right, the corresponding SEC traces of the designs under different light irradiation conditions. LRO-C2-35 showed a weak response to light, and its dimerization appeared to be more dependent on concentration, with a tendency to exist as a dimer at higher concentrations and primarily as a monomer at lower concentrations, as indicated by SEC (a, right). LRO-C3-37 predominantly dissociated into monomers following exposure to 340 nm light irradiation and formed non-specific aggregation complexes upon subsequent irradiation of the proteins with 420 nm light (b, right). Similarly, LRO-C3-64 also tended to form nonspecific aggregates when subjected to light treatment (c, right). A protein quantity of 0.3 mg was loaded onto the SEC column for LRO-C3-37 and LRO-C3-64, while two distinct loading quantities, 0.3 mg and 1.0 mg, were evaluated for LRO-C2-35.

Source data

Absorbance spectra indicated the photo stationary state of AzoF in proteins (grey) and the configuration transition of AzoF between trans and cis after 340 nm (cyan) or 420 nm (blue dash) light irradiation.

Source data

The circular dichroism spectra confirmed the helical structure of the designed proteins, and most (6 out 7) were stable at 95 °C (grey, 20 °C; red, 95 °C; blue dash, 20 °C followed by 95 °C).

Source data

a, Two different crystal forms were solved for LRO-C2-35. Left, Crystal form 1, crystallized under conditions comprising 200 mM lithium sulfate, 40% v/v PEG 400, 100 mM Tris hydrochloride at pH 8.5, aligned closely with the theoretical design model. In contrast, Right, Crystal form 2, grown in a solution containing 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 1500 and 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate at pH 4.5, displayed a marked deviation from the design model, featuring a chain that had rotated approximately 90 degrees. The design model was coloured in silver and the 2Fo − Fc omit electron densities of AzoF in the complex crystal structures are contoured at 1.5σ. b, The 2Fo − Fc omit electron densities of the four AzoF residues in the complex crystal structure of LRO-C4-13. The electron density contour is set at 1.5σ. Among the four AzoF residues, one (lower right) exhibited a configuration that diverged from the designed model. The designs models are shown as silver, and the crystal structures are shown with colours.

a, The vanilla protomers, fused with the monomeric green fluorescent protein mBaojin, were coexpressed with the AzoF protomers. Subsequent to various light irradiation treatments, the proteins were subjected to SEC analysis. The small peak, corresponding to the AzoF protomers, emerged post-340 nm light irradiation, which indicated the disassociation between the AzoF protomers and vanilla protomers. b, Size exclusion chromatography traces of vanilla and AzoF protomers expressed separately.

Source data

The successful designs feature AzoF residues that are deeply buried within the interface (small AzoF_sasa and large AzoF_neighbors), well-packed by neighbouring residues (AzoF_contact), interfaces with more hydrogen bonds (interface_hbonds), lower hydrophobicity scores in their unbound states (sap_score) and improved interface shape complementarity (sc_chA). See Methods for the detailed description for each computational metrics.

Source data

a, Schematic representation of the MBP-LRO-C5-1 construct (left) and the normalized size exclusion chromatography traces (right) of this protein under different light irradiation conditions. The MBP fusion notably enhanced the light responsiveness of LRO-C5-1 and exhibited almost complete switching between the pentameric state and the monomeric state. b, SDS–PAGE gel analysis the covalent cross-linking between SpyTag-MBP-LRO-C5-1 and Dimer-SpyCatcher. After hydrogel formation between the pentameric block and the dimeric block, the sample were dissolved in denaturing (SDS) running buffer and boiled before running on SDS–PAGE. Results show that upon covalent network formation through SpyLigation, the conjugated oligomers shift to higher position on the gel. c, Modulus changes of the gel during oscillation strain sweep from 1 to 100%, mean ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent samples), with individual data points overlaid.

Sample preparation remains a bottleneck for protein structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy. A frequently encountered issue is that proteins adsorb to the air–water interface of the sample in a limited number of orientations. This makes it challenging to obtain high-resolution reconstructions, or may even cause projects to fail altogether. We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism. Our experiments establish a set of tools for overcoming preferred orientation that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.

Since the resolution revolution, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has greatly expedited the process of protein structure determination1,2. Advances in instrumentation and single-particle analysis now routinely enable high-resolution reconstructions for a wide range of proteins and protein complexes3,4,5,6. However, sample preparation issues have remained a major bottleneck7. In particular, one common challenge involves preferred particle orientation8,9,10. When the sample solution is applied to the cryo-EM specimen support, the hydrophobic regions of the protein surface adsorb to the air–water interface, so that only a limited number of viewing directions are present after vitrification. Strong preferred orientation limits the resolution of a single-particle reconstruction along certain viewing directions and can even make it difficult to obtain a reconstruction at all11.

Although several strategies can address preferred orientation issues, no universal solution has been found. Tilting the sample provides a wider range of particle views, but usually results in larger beam-induced motion, an increased ice thickness in the viewing direction and a defocus gradient across the viewing area12,13. Preferred orientation can be reduced by covering the air–water interface with detergents or small proteins to block adsorption of the particles of interest14,15. Moreover, different specimen supports, such as graphene, graphene oxide or other functionalized surfaces, can prevent some particles from diffusing to the interface16,17,18,19,20. However, adopting such strategies often requires time-consuming reoptimization of the sample preparation procedure. Adsorption at the air–water interface can also be minimized by limiting the time between sample application onto the specimen support and vitrification21,22,23,24,25,26. Although this interval can be shortened to a few milliseconds, particles generally diffuse to the interface within a few microseconds. Substantially faster preparation speeds would therefore be required to prevent the majority of particles from reaching the interface. Finally, machine-learning techniques have been developed to guess missing views27,28,29. However, such approaches cannot replace actual experimental observations.

We have previously observed that flash melting and revitrification of cryo-EM samples with microsecond laser pulses reduces preferred orientation for some large, highly symmetric particles30,31,32. Flash melting seems to exert small forces on the proteins, altering their orientation and resulting in an uneven spatial distribution after revitrification, with particles clustering together in some areas30,32. High-resolution reconstructions suggest that the revitrification process preserves particle integrity and does not impose a fundamental limit on the obtainable spatial resolution30,33. However, the practicality of using flash melting to address preferred orientation and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we show that this effect extends to smaller proteins, as well as particles with lower symmetry. We also introduce two variants of the experiment that provide larger changes in preferred orientation for some proteins and that allow us to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

Our experimental approach is illustrated in Figure 1a (refs. 30,32,34,35). A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with 20-µs or 30-µs rectangular laser pulses, where the laser power is kept constant for the pulse duration (Fig. 1b). This causes some particles to detach from the air–water interface and change their orientation. Once the laser beam is switched off, the sample cools in just a few microseconds and revitrifies35,36, trapping the proteins in a non-equilibrium angular distribution (Fig. 1a). We performed in situ flash-melting experiments following previously described protocols, using a transmission electron microscope that we have modified for time-resolved experiments37,38. The sample is locally flash melted by aiming the laser beam (532 nm wavelength, 28-µm diameter spot size in the sample plane) at the center of a grid square of the holey gold specimen support (1.2 µm holes, 1.3 µm apart on 300-mesh gold). Typically, an area of 9–16 grid holes is revitrified. The samples are then transferred to a high-resolution electron microscope for imaging (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9–12 and Supplementary Table 1).

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse, which scrambles the orientation of the particles. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, trapping the particles in a non-equilibrium angular distribution. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape. c–f Reconstructions, with the applied symmetry noted in parentheses, and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), 50S ribosomal subunit (d), HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (e) and hemagglutinin (f). The SCF*, which is a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, as well as the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, as judged by the quality of the map.

Figure 1c demonstrates that flash melting reduces preferred orientation for a sample of the T20S proteasome. A reconstruction from a conventional sample is shown at the top, together with the angular distribution of the particles. It exhibits a series of maxima that arise from the T20S proteasome's strong preference to adsorb to the air–water interface on its side, resulting in sparse population of particles in the top views. Upon revitrification (bottom), the angular distribution broadens noticeably, with a larger fraction of the particles populating the less-favored views. At the same time, the sampling compensation factor (SCF*), a measure of the degree of preferred orientation, improves from 0.89 to 0.95. The SCF* takes values between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to a perfectly isotropic angular distribution5,39,40.

An even greater reduction in preferred orientation can be achieved for the 50S ribosomal subunit. Unlike the highly symmetric T20S proteasome (point group D7), the asymmetric 50S ribosomal subunit (C1) exhibits strong preferred orientation (Fig. 1d). In a conventional sample, the angular distribution features a small number of pronounced maxima, with many views absent altogether (white) and a low SCF* of 0.42. Upon revitrification, most of the missing views become populated, and the SCF* improves to 0.74. At the same time, the streaky artefacts that are visible in the reconstruction from the conventional sample and that are the result of preferred orientation disappear (Supplementary Fig. 5)41. Flash melting can also improve the angular distribution of much smaller proteins, such as the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (210 kDa), for which the SCF* increases from 0.89 to 0.99 (Fig. 1e). Among these examples, a noticeable gain in resolution is observed only for the 50S ribosomal subunit, the only protein for which the preferred orientation is so pronounced that many views are not populated at all. For the HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein, the resolution slightly decreases. This seems to be largely due to astigmatism in the micrographs recorded for the revitrified sample.

Laser flash melting seems to be less efficient at reducing preferred orientation for proteins that are more strongly bound to the air–water interface. Hemagglutinin (170 kDa) exhibits a preference for top and bottom views (Fig. 1f). Although revitrification depopulates particles in the bottom views, the overall angular distribution remains similar, with the SCF* slightly decreasing from 0.60 to 0.56. This suggests either that flash melting detaches only a few proteins from the interface or that detached particles return to their preferred orientation rapidly after diffusing to the surface. Both explanations indicate that there is a strong interaction between hemagglutinin and the air–water interface. For the proteins studied here, diffusion to the interface is expected to occur in just a few microseconds, which is shorter than the duration of the experiment (30 µs).

Experiments with shaped microsecond laser pulses provide clues about the mechanism through which the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. We have previously shown that cryo-EM samples partially crystallize during flash melting with rectangular laser pulses35,42. This led us to speculate whether the transient formation of crystallites, which preferentially form at the sample surface43, might exert small forces on the particles, leading to their detachment and reorientation30. We test this hypothesis by melting samples with shaped laser pulses that feature an intense 1-µs initial spike and ten times the laser power (Fig. 2a,b)44. This increases the heating rate during flash melting to about 2 × 108 K s−1, twice the critical heating rate of 1 × 108 K s−1, so that the sample does not crystallize44. If crystallization was the dominant mechanism for reshuffling the particle orientations, we would expect the angular distribution to barely change under these conditions. Contrary to our expectation, flash melting with such a shaped laser pulse decreases preferred orientation even more drastically for the 50S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). The SCF* increases from 0.18 to 0.90 in revitrified areas of the sample, and the map resolution improves markedly, from 4.1 Å to 2.9 Å. Of note, the angular distribution of the sample is different from that in Figure 1d, despite both being prepared using the same procedure. This suggests that the interaction of the particles with the interface is very sensitive to preparation conditions and can be easily altered.

a, A cryo-EM sample is flash melted with a shaped 30-µs laser pulse that features an intense leading edge. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies, and the angular distribution of the particles is reshuffled. b, Schematic of the laser pulse shape, which features an intense spike at its onset (1-µs duration with the laser power increased ten-fold). c,d, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the 50S ribosomal subunit (c) and hemagglutinin (d). The SCF* and the resolution of the reconstructions are shown below the maps. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

Clearly, transient crystallization of the sample cannot be the dominant mechanism for particle reorientation. Instead, the effect appears to intensify with increased heating rates, suggesting several possible mechanisms. Impulsive laser heating of a thin, suspended membrane, such as the holey gold film of the specimen support, induces drumming motions that typically persist on microsecond timescales45,46. With the larger initial heating power of the shaped laser pulses, such oscillations likely reach a larger amplitude and exert greater forces on the thin liquid film in which the particles are suspended. This could allow them to detach from the air–water interface more readily and reorient. The impinging laser beam also deforms the thin liquid film directly through the radiation forces47. Additionally, it is also conceivable that some particles detach from the interface owing to the evaporation of the liquid sample in the vacuum of the electron microscope42. Simulations indicate that, during the initial spike of the shaped laser pulse, the sample temperature briefly increases by about 25 K (Supplementary Fig. 15). Because the evaporation rate increases exponentially with temperature48, this could cause more particles to detach. However, there are also changes in preferred orientation when samples are revitrified at atmospheric pressure, under which evaporation is substantially reduced33,49. It is therefore unlikely that evaporation is the dominant effect that causes particles to detach from the air–water interface. For hemagglutinin, even shaped laser pulses cannot reduce the amount of preferred orientation, although they induce some changes in the angular distribution (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 14).

Our experiments suggest that the changes in the angular distribution induced by flash melting are the result of two opposing processes. First, particles must be successfully detached from the air–water interface to reorient. But given enough time, they can then diffuse back to the interface and return to their preferred orientation. A simple experiment allowed us to detach all particles from the interface before laser melting the sample, disentangling both processes (Fig. 3a). We deposited a 20-nm-thick layer of amorphous ice onto both sides of the sample by introducing water vapor into the volume surrounding the specimen in our modified transmission electron microscope50. After flash melting the sample with a rectangular laser pulse (Fig. 3b), the particles all began at a distance from the interface, having lost all memory of where they used to be located. The angular distribution obtained after revitrification then exclusively reflects the result of the particles' free diffusion.

a, A 20-nm layer of amorphous ice is deposited in situ onto the cryo-EM sample before it is flash melted with a 30-µs laser pulse. When the laser is switched off, the sample revitrifies with the particle orientations redistributed. b, Schematic of the rectangular laser pulse shape used. c–e, Reconstructions and angular distributions of conventional and revitrified samples (top and bottom, respectively) for the T20S proteasome (c), the 50S ribosomal subunit (d) and hemagglutinin (e). The sampling compensation factor (SCF*) and the resolution of the reconstructions are indicated. For hemagglutinin, the resolution appears to be overestimated, judging by the quality of the map.

When we revitrify a T20S proteasome sample after depositing a layer of amorphous ice, we obtain the angular distribution in Fig. 3c (bottom, Supplementary Fig. 3). The estimated rotational timescale of the particles (about 5 µs) is shorter than the timescale of the experiment, so one might expect that this should yield an isotropic distribution. Instead, the distribution closely resembles that obtained without prior deposition of amorphous ice (Fig. 1c) and notably features a preference for side views. This clearly indicates that the particles have diffused back to the interface, which occurs on an estimated timescale of only about 4 µs, and have partially settled into their preferred orientations. The striking similarity of the angular distribution to that in Figure 1c suggests that both are the result of the free diffusion and partial readsorption of the particles. It therefore appears likely that, even without prior deposition of amorphous ice, the laser pulse efficiently detaches the T20S proteasome particles from the interface.

Flash melting of a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit, following the deposition of amorphous ice, similarly results in a broad angular distribution with a small degree of preferred orientation, indicating that some particles have readsorbed to the interface (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6). The SCF* increased from 0.42 to 0.90. Curiously, however, the distribution substantially changed, featuring maxima at orientations that were previously only sparsely populated. This suggests that the interaction between the particles and the interface was altered in our experiments. As discussed above, the preferential orientation of the 50S ribosomal subunit varies, even in conventional samples prepared under otherwise identical conditions (Figs. 1d and 2c), suggesting that the properties of the interface are easily modified. Sample transfer and handling could have introduced traces of surface-active compounds, thereby modifying the chemical composition of the interface. Additionally, the interaction between the particles and the surface could have been affected by the dilution of the buffer during our experiment. At the laser powers used, less material is evaporated than has been deposited, so that the sample thickness slightly increases overall. As shown in Figure 3e, we obtain a similar result for hemagglutinin (Supplementary Fig. 13). After amorphous ice deposition and revitrification, the particles show a substantial amount of preferred orientation, indicating that many have readsorbed to the interface. However, the prominent top views have been largely depopulated, whereas the bottom views now dominate the angular distribution.

Our experiments yield a simple picture of the competing processes that occur during laser revitrification. Flash melting detaches some particles from the interface (Fig. 4a,b), a process that becomes more efficient as the heating rate is increased. As these particles rotate freely, their orientations are scrambled, resulting in improved angular distribution. In a competing process, particles diffuse back to the interface (Fig. 4c) before the sample is revitrified (Fig. 4d), allowing some proteins to efficiently readsorb in their preferred orientation. This process generally is more efficient for small proteins because of their shorter diffusion times. It could be possible to improve the angular distribution of such proteins by reducing the duration of the laser pulse to below the diffusion timescale (a few microseconds), so that the particles do not have enough time to reach the interface. In some experiments, proteins readsorbed in a different preferred orientation, such as when we deposited a layer of amorphous ice prior to revitrification. Apparently, our experiment has altered the interfacial properties, making adsorption in new orientations favorable. This implies that it should be possible to purposely modify the interface before flash melting, for example through vapor deposition of a hydrophilic compound onto the cryo-EM sample. Upon laser melting, all particles should then desorb and randomize their orientation. Such experiments are currently underway in our lab51.

a, In a conventional cryo-EM sample, particles adsorb to the air–water interface in preferred orientations. b, Flash melting detaches the proteins from the interface, so that they are able to rotate freely. c, While the sample is liquid, many particles diffuse back to the interface, where some adsorb in their preferred orientation. d, The sample is revitrified and the ensemble is arrested in a non-equilibrium angular distribution.

Our experiments also provide a practical toolbox for addressing preferred orientation, with some proteins showing dramatic improvements in their angular distribution. For example, revitrifying a cryo-EM sample of the 50S ribosomal subunit with shaped laser pulses improves the resolution by 1.2 Å under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 2c). To put this in perspective, 18 times as many micrographs of a conventional sample would be needed to achieve the same improvement. Reshuffling the particle orientations through laser flash melting can therefore provide considerable cost and time savings. Our method can be easily combined with other established approaches for addressing preferred orientation. Importantly, as a simple physical approach, flash melting does not require any time-consuming changes to the sample-preparation procedure, but can be easily integrated into existing workflows. As we have previously shown, cryo-EM samples can also be revitrified in an optical microscope equipped for correlative light and electron microscopy experiments33. This approach is technically less involved and might therefore be more accessible to other labs. It could also be integrated into vitrification devices, some of which already use an optical microscope to assess sample quality. Laser-melting experiments could be directly integrated into high-resolution electron microscopes at cryo-EM facilities. If a sample is found to exhibit preferred orientation during data acquisition, it could then be revitrified on the fly with little additional time.

Purified T20S proteasome (3.7 mg ml−1 in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM sodium chloride) and purified 50S ribosome52 (an optical density at 260 nm (OD260) of 40 per ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride) were gifts from A. Guskov, University of Gröningnen, and B. Beckert, DCI Lausanne respectively. The purified hemagglutinin sample (1 mg ml−1 in PBS pH 7.5) was purchased from MyBioSource (MBS434205). The cryo-EM samples of purified proteins were prepared by applying 3.5 µl of the sample solution to glow-discharged (0.25 mbar, 15 mA, 60 s) gold grids (UltrAuFoil, R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH). Surplus sample was removed by blotting for 2–4 s using a blot force of 10 in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, held at 20 °C, 100% relative humidity). The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (HIV-1 CH505TF Envelope SOSIP ectodomain)53 was generously provided by R. Henderson, Duke Center for HIV Structural Biology. The HIV-1 envelope ectodomain protein (5 mg ml−1 in 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol) was applied to glow discharged gold grids (Au-flat, 0.6 µm/1 µm hole diameter/pitch, 300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The sample was blotted with the minimum blot time that can be set (0 s). The conventional sample was blotted using a blot force of 10, whereas the revitrified sample was blotted using blot forces of 5 and 10. All samples were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen until experiments were carried out.

The revitrification experiments with rectangular laser pulses (Fig. 1) were performed in situ using a modified JEOL 2200FS transmission electron microscope equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS) and an in-column Omega energy filter38. The samples were loaded into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. The sample was melted and revitrified in the center of multiple grid squares (typically 80 – 100) through irradiation with microsecond laser pulses30,32,35. A 30-µs laser pulse was used for the 50S and HIV-1 samples, and a 20-μs laser pulse for the T20S sample. The hemagglutinin sample was revitrified with two 30-µs pulses with a 250-ms delay between the pulses. The laser pulses were generated by chopping the continuous output of a 532 nm laser (Ventus532, Laser Quantum) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic). The laser beam was focused to a spot size of 28 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum) in the sample plane, as determined by a knife-edge scan, and aligned to the center of the grid squares. The laser power was adjusted on the fly to keep the size of the revitrified region, typically 15–22 µm in diameter, approximately constant35. After revitrification, the grids were unloaded from the side entry holder and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection.

The revitrification experiments with shaped laser pulses (Fig. 2) were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)50,54,55. The plunge-frozen cryo-EM samples were inserted into the microscope using a single-tilt side-entry cryo-transfer holder (Elsa, Gatan) held at a temperature of approximately 100 K. Shaped laser pulses with an intense leading edge (1 µs initial spike at ten times the laser power) were generated by modulating the output of a continuous green laser (532 nm, Verdi Coherent) with an acousto-optic modulator (AA Opto-Electronic) that was controlled by an arbitrary function generator (Tektronix AFG1062)44. The laser beam was focused to a spot of 38 µm FWHM in the sample plane, as determined by imaging the beam with a CCD camera placed in a plane conjugate to the sample plane. The laser power required for laser melting was determined by using ordinary rectangular pulses. The initial spike was then added to perform the revitrification experiment.

The experiments in Figure 3, in which the sample was revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, were performed on a modified JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a TemCam-XF416 (TVIPS)42,50,54,55. Amorphous ice was deposited by leaking water vapor into the volume surrounding the sample through a gas dosing valve50. The vapor enters the microscope through a stainless steel tube that terminates inside of the cold shield, in close proximity to the sample. To obtain a well-defined thickness, the deposition rate was first determined with the following procedure. A multilayer graphene sample on a gold specimen grid (UltrAu Foil, 600 mesh, R2/1) was cooled to about 100 K in an Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan). While amorphous ice was being deposited on the graphene sheet, the diffraction patterns of the growing ice layer were recorded. During the deposition, the intensity of the molecular diffraction pattern of the amorphous ice initially increased linearly but then leveled off and plateaued once the ice film was so thick that multiple and inelastic scattering became important. From the characteristic curve shape of the diffraction intensity as a function of deposition time, the deposition rate was then determined (typically 0.3 nm s−1)42,50, and the deposition time was adjusted accordingly (typically 74 s to deposit about 10 nm on each side of the sample, 20 nm total).

To perform the deposition and revitrification experiment, the cryo-EM sample was loaded into the microscope with a second Elsa cryo-transfer holder (Gatan, approximately at 100 K). To begin the deposition, the shutter of the specimen holder was opened for the predetermined amount of time, before the shutter was closed to stop any further deposition of amorphous ice. The gas dosing valve was then closed, and the cryo shield surrounding the sample was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. Once the pressure in the microscope column had dropped to below 5 × 10−5 Pa, the shutter of the cryo-transfer holder was opened, and the revitrification experiment was performed using rectangular laser pulses, as described above.

The T20S datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G3i, equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded as tiff images in super-resolution mode and binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV. The data were collected using a 100 µm objective aperture at a nominal magnification of ×130,000 during a 1.3-s exposure with a defocus range of –0.6 µm to –2.0 µm and a total dose of 67 e− Å−2.

The datasets were processed in cryoSPARC v4.4 and v4.5 (ref. 5). For the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, 3,479, 6,105 and 3,641 micrographs were collected, respectively. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion-correction and patch contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation before manual curation on the basis of CTF resolution estimation, ice thickness and total full-frame motion. Particles were initially picked with a blob picker with a diameter of 100–200 Å from 1,519, 2,287 and 2,255 high-quality micrographs for the conventional sample, the revitrified sample and the sample revitrified after deposition of amorphous ice, respectively, and were then extracted with a box size of 512 px and down sampled to 128 px. After two rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classifications, the selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles assigned to the better resolved class were refined against the obtained volume in a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. The resulting volume was used to generate templates for template-based picking with a particle diameter of 150 Å. The particles were again extracted with a box size of 512 px, Fourier-cropped to a box size of 256 px, and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification. The selected particles were used for ab initio reconstruction with only one class, followed by homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and again directed into a homogeneous refinement with D7 symmetry. To ensure the comparability of the datasets obtained from the different experimental conditions, a low-pass-filtered volume (filtered to 30 Å) obtained from the conventional dataset was used as a reference input for homogeneous refinements for all the three datasets. Finally, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles.

The conventional, revitrified and deposited and revitrified 50S datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4 camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging facility in Lausanne, Switzerland. The videos were collected in eer format, with a 100 µm objective aperture inserted, at a nominal magnification of ×120,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.658 Å per pixel. Micrographs were collected with a defocus range of –0.4 µm to –1 µm using a total dose of 40 e− Å−2. The sample that had been revitrified with the shaped laser pulse and the corresponding conventional control were collected on a Titan Krios G3i, fitted with a BioQuantum energy filter and a K3 camera, at the Center for Microscopy and Image Analysis. The videos were recorded during a 1.2-s exposure at ×130,000 magnification, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.3255 Å in super-resolution mode. The data were binned on the fly to a pixel size of 0.651 Å per pixel. The energy filter slit was set to 20 eV and the objective aperture to 100 µm. The defocus used ranged from –0.4 µm to –1.6 µm, whereas the electron dose was 63 e− Å−2.

For the 50S datasets, 11,121, 6,174, 9,532, 7,416 and 7,725 micrographs were collected for conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified, conventional (control for shaped pulses) and shaped pulse revitrified, respectively. The micrographs were patch motion-corrected (40 fractions, no up-sampling), and patch CTF-estimated before being subjected to a manual curation in which low-quality micrographs, judged by CTF estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, were discarded. The selected 6,236, 5,870, 6,641, 3,485, and 5,227 high-quality micrographs were subjected to a blob picker with a particle diameter of 200–300 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 784 px and cropped to 392 px. After two rounds of 2D classification, selected particles were directed into an ab initio reconstruction with two to three classes. The particles from the best class were refined against the volumes from the best and worst class in one round of heterogeneous refinement. The selected particles from the heterogeneous refinement were directed into a homogeneous refinement with C1 symmetry. Subsequently, 50,000 particles were randomly selected, re-extracted at full box size and refined through homogeneous refinement using C1 symmetry and a low-pass filtered volume from the conventional dataset as a reference. Ultimately, an orientation diagnostics job in cryoSPARC was run to assess the angular distribution of the particles. Unlike the other reconstructions in this manuscript, the 50S ribosomal subunit maps were not sharpened to preserve the details in the flexible L1 stalk.

The HIV-1 datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G4 using a Falcon 4i camera at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were recorded in eer format using a magnification of ×96,000, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å per pixel. A total dose of 50 e− Å−2 was used and the defocus range was set to –1 µm to –2.4 µm.

For the conventional HIV-1 dataset, 2,614 micrographs were collected. For the revitrified dataset, data were collected from two different grids; from the first grid, 5,447 micrographs were collected; from the second, 5,081 images were recorded. All datasets were subjected patch motion correction, patch CTF estimation and a manual curation based on CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and the defocus range. Next, the particles were picked using a blob picker with a diameter of 100–150 Å. The particles were extracted with a box size of 480 px and down sampled to 240 px. The particles from the two revitrified datasets were combined before sorting in two rounds of two-dimensional classification. The selected particles were subjected to an ab initio reconstruction using two classes. Particles were further classified in three dimensions through two rounds of heterogeneous refinements, in which all selected particles from the first round of 2D classification were sorted against the good initial volume and five decoy classes, generated through the pre-mature termination of an ab initio reconstruction. The selected set of particles was then refined in a non-uniform refinement with C1 symmetry. Next, the particles were re-extracted at full box size, locally and globally CTF-refined before being directed into another non-uniform refinement, without dynamic masking and symmetry enforcement. Finally, 50,000 random particles were selected and again refined in a non-uniform refinement without dynamic masking using C1 symmetry and the filtered conventional volume as a reference, before being directed into an orientation diagnostics job.

The four hemagglutinin datasets were recorded on a Titan Krios G4 equipped with a Falcon 4i and a SelectrisX energy filter at the Dubochet Center for Imaging. The videos were collected in eer format at a magnification of ×165,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.732 Å. A total dose of 40 e− Å−2 was used for the conventional, revitrified and leading-edge revitrified and deposited and revitrified dataset, respectively. A defocus range of –0.8 µm to –2.5 µm and an energy filter slit of 10 eV was applied for all four datasets.

For the conventional, revitrified, deposited and revitrified and shaped pulse revitrified HA samples, 2,251, 6,476, 10,114 and 10,270 micrographs were collected. The micrographs were subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation. The micrographs were manually curated on the basis of their CTF resolution estimation, relative ice thickness and total full-frame motion, resulting in 1,651, 4,608, 7,982 and 8,590 high-quality micrographs. On 100 micrographs of each dataset, a denoiser was trained and subsequently applied to the curated micrographs. Particles were picked from denoised micrographs using a blob picker with a diameter of 80–140 Å. Next, the particles were extracted from the raw, non-denoised micrographs using a box size of 360 px, which was cropped to 180 px. The extracted particles were subjected to one to two rounds of 2D classification, followed by an ab initio reconstruction with two classes. The particles were then further cleaned up in one round of heterogeneous refinement using a decoy volume and the best-resolved ab initio volume as inputs. The sorted particles were then refined in a homogeneous refinement, before being re-extracted at full box size. Out of these, 50,000 random particles were selected and then subjected into a final homogeneous refinement with C3 symmetry, using the filtered conventional map as a reference, and an orientation diagnostics job.

The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and translocase of the inner membrane 23 (TIM23) complexes are coupled to control protein import across the outer and inner membranes, respectively. However, the mechanisms of protein recognition and sorting in the TOM–TIM23 pathway remain unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of a translocating polypeptide substrate captured in the active TOM–TIM23 supercomplex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the TOM complex, the polypeptide substrate adopts multiple conformations stabilized by hydrophilic residues from distinct regions of the Tom40 channel. In the TIM23 complex, the Tim17 and Mgr2 subunits create the translocation pathway, with a central restriction formed by four highly conserved hydrophobic residues. The substrate primarily interacts with hydrophobic residues along the Tim17–Mgr2 pathway. Substrate hydrophobicity modulates the association of Mgr2 with Tim17, enabling dynamic regulation of protein sorting toward either the matrix or membrane. These findings reveal a sophisticated translocation mechanism of the TOM–TIM23 supercomplex that ensures the efficient import of diverse mitochondrial proteins.

The use of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM) is highly prevalent among autistic individuals, with up to 90% reporting having used CAIM at least once in their lifetime. However, the evidence base for the effects of CAIM for autism remains uncertain. Here, to fill this gap, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism across the lifespan and developed a web platform to disseminate the generated results. Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework. This process led to the identification of 53 meta-analytic reports, enabling us to conduct 248 meta-analyses exploring the effects of 19 CAIMs in autism. We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research. To support evidence-based consideration of CAIM interventions for autism, we developed an interactive platform that facilitates access to and interpretation of the present results (https://ebiact-database.com).

Autism spectrum disorder, hereafter referred to as autism, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in communication and social interaction, as well as restricted, stereotyped and repetitive behaviours and/or interests, frequently associated with sensory differences, all of which interfere with quality of life1. Note that, recognizing the preference of most individuals with lived experience on the autism spectrum, this Article adopts identity-first language (for example, ‘autistic individuals'), which places references to the autism spectrum at the forefront of statements. We also acknowledge that some individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder prefer person-first language, which prioritizes mentioning the person before the condition.

Interestingly, although not specifically designed for autism, many autistic individuals utilize complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM)2. Several factors may contribute to this choice. For example, personal values, the perceived lack of efficacy of conventional interventions, and challenges in accessing or implementing traditional interventions may all encourage engagement with the use of CAIM3,4,5. Despite the absence of a universally accepted definition of CAIM, the Cochrane Collaboration has proposed a widely used operational definition, which uses three principal criteria for classification6,7. First, it considers whether the intervention originates from a medical system outside the Western allopathic model (that is, considered traditional), thereby including practices such as Chinese medicine. Second, it evaluates whether the intervention is regarded as a standard treatment for a specific condition within the Western allopathic framework. Third, the context in which the intervention is delivered is examined; interventions that are self-administered or provided by practitioners outside conventional medical institutions are more likely to be classified as CAIM. It is important to note that this definition does not incorporate scientific evidence about efficacy as a criterion, thus allowing for the possibility that a CAIM intervention may be supported by robust scientific evidence regarding its effects, although this is not currently the case in the autism literature as our work shows.

The median prevalence of use of any CAIM among autistic people is 54%, with some studies finding a lifetime prevalence as high as 92% (ref. 2). This high level of use is explained by a generally positive public perception of the safety and efficacy of CAIM8,9. However, many studies and international clinical guidelines indicate a lack of efficacy—and, in some cases, adverse events—for this type of intervention in autism10,11. In this perspective, parents of autistic children have identified challenges in navigating the scientific literature on the efficacy/effectiveness and safety of CAIM in autism. In particular, they have highlighted the need for a reliable resource that effectively disseminates this scientific information in an accessible manner, to make informed decisions about the use of CAIM12. Therefore, there is an urgent need to synthesize all available evidence on the efficacy and safety of CAIM for autistic individuals and to make this information easily accessible to the wider community, including health professionals, to foster evidence-based shared decision-making. The need for such a tool is reinforced by the positive outcomes of decision-aid tools developed in other fields13.

Currently, many meta-analyses on CAIM for autism are available, but it is not uncommon for them to show divergent results regarding the effect of the same intervention for the same clinical population14. These discrepancies, which can be caused by different inclusion criteria but also data analysis error or other methodological issues15, leave decision-makers, clinicians and individuals with lived experience alike facing conflicting information about the effects of the available interventions. Umbrella reviews are a form of evidence synthesis that addresses this issue by quantitatively synthesizing the information generated by all systematic reviews and meta-analyses on a broad topic, appraising their methodological quality and providing an assessment of the strength and/or quality of the evidence16,17. In other words, while the unit of inclusion of systematic reviews and meta-analyses consists of individual primary studies, the unit of inclusion of umbrella reviews consists of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Umbrella reviews can thus inform clinical decision-makers on the current best secondary, high-level evidence relevant to a specific topic.

In this Article, we conducted an umbrella review investigating the efficacy and safety of CAIMs in autistic individuals. Then, in line with the needs recently expressed by stakeholders12, we developed an open-access, interactive online resource (named Evidence-Based Interventions for Autism: Clinical Trials (EBIA-CT), freely accessible at https://ebiact-database.com/) allowing user-friendly access to the results of the umbrella review for each identified participants–intervention–comparator–outcome (PICO). This work adheres to the Umbrella-Review, Evaluation, Analysis, and Communication Hub (U-REACH) framework18. The evidence summarized on this website is intended for informational purposes only and should not be used as a replacement for professional medical advice. We strongly recommend that any discussion of these findings be undertaken in consultation with a qualified healthcare provider who is able to assess and appreciate individual clinical circumstances.

From our initial search, which yielded 7,051 potentially relevant publications (5,702 after removing duplicates), we selected 201 for full-text review and identified 72 meta-analytic reports that met our eligibility criteria (Fig. 1). We then excluded 19 meta-analytic reports: 7 lacked information necessary to replicate calculations, and 12 contained actual or probable data analysis errors. This resulted in a final set of 53 meta-analytic reports included in our analyses. These publications contained a total of 248 different meta-analyses, with each meta-analysis covering a specific combination of PICOs. For example, a single publication could contain several separate meta-analyses examining how the same intervention affects different age groups or different outcomes. Supplementary Information sections 9 and 10 provide full lists of the 53 included and 148 excluded publications.

Selection of the meta-analyses for the umbrella review.

The 53 retained meta-analytic reports examined the effects of at least one of the 19 intervention types (with descriptions of each of them publicly available at https://ebiact-database.com/interventions/) and on at least one of the 19 possible outcomes and were mainly (87%) published after 2018. The 248 meta-analyses synthesized the evidence of more than 200 controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and 10,000 autistic participants and explored 138 unique PICOs. A total of 53 PICOs (38%) were explored in several overlapping meta-analyses. The PICOs with the highest number of overlapping meta-analyses investigated the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on disruptive behaviours and social-communication impairment.

A total of 138 meta-analyses, derived from 27 reports, were finally included in the primary analysis after discarding overlapping meta-analyses. According to the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) scoring, 23 PICOs were evaluated by meta-analyses of high quality (17%), 87 by meta-analyses of low quality (63%) and 28 by meta-analyses of critically low quality (20%). The median number of clinical trials per meta-analysis was 3, and the median number of participants per meta-analysis was 152, with a median percentage of female participants of 14%. A total of 25 meta-analyses (18%) involved very young children, 85 (62%) included school-aged children, 17 (12%) involved adolescents and 11 (8%) focused on adults.

This section presents meta-analytic results for the primary and secondary outcomes, highlighting findings with a moderate Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating as well as those that exhibit statistically significant and large pooled effect sizes. The GRADE framework assesses the overall quality of evidence supporting meta-analytic estimates based on five criteria: risk of bias of included clinical trials, heterogeneity, publication bias, indirectness and imprecision19 (see details in ‘Assessment of the levels of evidence' section in the Methods). Higher GRADE ratings thus indicate better quality of evidence. Complete results are visually summarized in Figs. 2 and 3 and detailed in Supplementary Information section 11.

We found that oxytocin was the intervention with the highest levels of evidence (that is, the highest GRADE ratings) across all outcomes and age groups (Fig. 2). This intervention demonstrated negligible and not statistically significant efficacy for core autism symptoms across childhood and adulthood (all pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) ranging from −0.04 to 0.06, and all P values exceeding 0.05; all GRADE ratings: from ‘very low' to ‘moderate'), except for restricted/repetitive behaviours in adults, where a small effect size was found (SMD 0.404, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.166–0.643; GRADE: ‘moderate'). There were no significant concerns about the acceptability, tolerability or adverse events of oxytocin (all pooled risk ratios (RRs) ranging from 0.72 to 1.30, and all P values >0.05; all GRADE ratings: from ‘very low' to ‘moderate'). The only other effect supported by at least moderate levels of evidence for any of our primary outcomes was the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids in school-age children, which was not significantly associated with the occurrence of adverse events (RR 0.676, 95% CI 0.356–1.281; GRADE: ‘moderate') and did not yield large effects on core autism symptoms (all pooled SMD values <0.50; all GRADE ratings: ‘very low' or ‘low').

Notably, a number of interventions demonstrated large effect sizes (SMD ≥0.80) and reached statistical significance, but they were systematically supported by very low levels of evidence. In school-age children, these included music therapy (SMD 0.835, 95% CI 0.316–1.355), animal-assisted interventions (SMD 0.934, 95% CI 0.354–1.515) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (SMD 0.844, 95% CI 0.016–1.672) for reducing overall autism symptoms. In adolescents, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) appeared to have a large efficacy on restricted/repetitive behaviours (SMD 0.899, 95% CI 0.529–1.269). In adults, physical activity demonstrated potential benefits for social-communication (SMD 0.874, 95% CI 0.486–1.263). Importantly, acceptability, tolerability or adverse events were not evaluated for these interventions.

As illustrated in Fig. 3, no intervention presented statistically significant results supported by at least low levels of evidence for the secondary outcomes. Again, several interventions demonstrated large effect sizes with statistical significance, although supported by only very low levels of evidence. In school-age children, melatonin showed promise for improving sleep quality (SMD 1.124, 95% CI 0.349–1.898) and quantity (SMD 1.080, 95% CI 0.413–1.747), while in adolescents rTMS showed promise for reducing disruptive behaviours (SMD 0.940, 95% CI 0.570–1.310). Notably, no statistically significant increase risks in safety outcomes were observed among school-age children using melatonin (with RR values ranging from 0.84 to 1.75 and all P values exceeding 0.05; all GRADE ratings: ‘very low'), and safety was not assessed for rTMS use in adolescents.

Among the 53 PICOs that were explored by at least 2 overlapping meta-analyses, the median overlap of the 95% CI of the pooled effect sizes was 50% (Supplementary Information section 12). Only 33 (63%) of PICOs consistently achieved a similar GRADE rating, and only 35 (66%) consistently achieved a similar statistical significance status. Among the PICOs with statistically significant results in our primary analysis and at least one overlapping meta-analysis, we found that ten (62%) presented at least one overlapping meta-analysis with non-statistically significant results. Last, we found that eight PICOs presented a large discrepancy, which we characterized as a substantial difference in either (1) the magnitude of the overlapping estimated effects (that is, the existence of two pooled effect sizes varying by more than SMD ≥0.30 with different statistical significance status, or an average overlap of the 95% CI <20%) or (2) the GRADE status (differing by two points). On the EBIA-CT platform, we enable users to avoid these inconsistencies by systematically presenting the results of the best current scientific evidence, making this platform a convenient hub for the highest-quality scientific evidence.

We conducted a review of the effects of CAIM in autistic individuals, analysing 248 meta-analyses including 200 clinical trials involving over 10,000 participants. Based on this synthesis, we created an interactive user-friendly online platform aimed at disseminating scientific evidence in an accessible format to support healthcare professionals, individuals with lived experience and their families in making informed decisions about CAIM.

Among interventions with an efficacy supported by at least moderate levels of quality of the evidence, only oxytocin showed—for one outcome in one age group—a statistically significant but small effect (SMD <0.50). Several interventions (animal-assisted interventions, melatonin, music therapy, physical activity, rTMS and tDCS) presented statistically significant results with a very large effect size, but the quality of the evidence underpinning the estimation of these effects was very low. The two main factors responsible for these low levels of evidence were imprecision (namely the low number of participants included in a meta-analysis and/or a very wide pooled 95% CI) or limitations (namely the presence of studies at high risk of bias). This finding highlights the need to improve the methodological rigour in the field, to enable a more precise evaluation of the impact of CAIM interventions. In particular, further research on CAIM interventions requires adequately powered studies to precisely estimate their effects while implementing rigorous methodological controls to minimize potential sources of bias. For instance, although blinding may be challenging for outcomes based on daily life reports (for example, quality of life), emerging tools—such as the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change—are being developed to enable blinded assessments of key outcomes in ASD, addressing the limitations inherent in traditional instruments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. In addition to the generally small effect sizes and low levels of evidence supporting most CAIMs, a critical finding was that safety assessments were missing for most interventions, with less than half of identified CAIMs having any evaluation of acceptability, tolerability or adverse events. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning for interventions with potential adverse effects (such as secretin administration) and represents a major public health challenge given the high frequency of CAIM use in this population2. In our view, a key direction for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies will be to explore the safety of CAIMs in autism.

The findings of this study address a critical knowledge gap in the literature regarding CAIM interventions for autism by synthesizing evidence from a substantial body of research previously available in fragmented form only. Previous reviews have typically focused on specific intervention types and did not assess the quality of the generated body of evidence20,21,22. Our approach enables mapping of the evidence across the full spectrum of CAIMs. Notably, the umbrella review methodology used does not allow us to compare efficacy among included interventions (unlike network meta-analyses). However, our umbrella review does establish a unified evidence grading system that allows stakeholders to evaluate the state of evidence for each intervention using consistent, transparent and objective criteria. Moreover, the interactive platform developed addresses the needs from the autism community and the documented disparity between research production and knowledge translation identified by previous studies12,23,24. Clinicians and autistic people and their families can collaboratively use this resource to navigate the available evidence for each intervention, including its inherent limitations and the prevailing uncertainty regarding harms, to inform their perspectives about CAIM25. This facilitates informed decisions that are tailored to individual needs, preferences and circumstances26,27.

From a methodological standpoint, our study revealed a high prevalence of overlapping meta-analyses examining identical populations, interventions, and outcomes. While overlapping analyses can provide valuable independent replication, they often yield inconsistent results. This aligns with previous findings15,28,29,30 and underscores the challenge for healthcare professionals to stay abreast of the best evidence. These inconsistent results are primarily due to differences in the identification of primary studies and the choice of the outcome measure to estimate the effect sizes. Interestingly, our assessment of the quality of the meta-analyses indicated that incomplete searches (which may result in the identification of only a subset of relevant primary studies) and lack of preregistration (which may lead to arbitrary post-hoc decisions about the optimal outcome measure for measuring a given outcome) were among the most common biases observed in the meta-analyses. This suggests that improving key aspects of the meta-analytic methodology (namely adherence to standardized database search guidelines and the development of a protocol before conducting a meta-analysis) may be a promising way to reduce result variability across independent meta-analyses17.

The present work should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, a key methodological decision we made was to assess the levels of evidence using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework, departing from its original subjective approach. However, as the objective of our work is not to make recommendations, which require subjectivity and are context dependent, we elected to remove the subjectivity from our grading process. This decision aligns with previous large umbrella reviews31 and with the typical grading process in network meta-analyses32. The algorithmic GRADE assessment used in this Article—based on criteria established in previous studies and developed separately from the present work32,33,34—provides readers with a context-independent algorithmic evaluation of the quality of the evidence, synthesizing a substantial amount of information from each meta-analysis. Second, our analysis was limited to standard pairwise meta-analytic models, which precluded us from making statistical comparisons of the effects of different intervention on the same outcome, or of the effect a single intervention on multiple outcomes. Our choice of extracting clinical trial-level data could have theoretically enabled the use of more advanced meta-analytic models—such as multivariate meta-analysis or network meta-analysis. However, these approaches rely on the critical assumption of transitivity. The substantial methodological heterogeneity across trials in our umbrella review (particularly regarding comparator types, which included placebo, treatment as usual, non-therapeutic interventions and others) meant this assumption could not be reasonably met without proper experimental verification35. Such verifications typically extend beyond the scope of umbrella reviews. By maintaining a PICO-level analysis, we adhered to best recommended practices in umbrella reviews prioritizing transparency, interpretability and methodological rigour36. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that this approach has inherent limitations, particularly its inability to facilitate comparisons within or between intervention effects. Future research could build on our umbrella review dataset to explore methodological strategies for addressing comparator-related heterogeneity. Such efforts could ultimately inform the feasibility of applying advanced statistical models in this emerging field of evidence synthesis.

In conclusion, this study provides the community with accessible scientific evidence regarding CAIMs for autism, highlighting the current lack of adequate evidence supporting their efficacy and safety. Many studies have examined the effects of various CAIMs for autistic people, but the quality of the evidence generated by these studies is mostly poor. This may lead to imprecise and/or biased estimates of effects. The field requires well-designed, adequately powered RCTs using standardized outcome measures and incorporating comprehensive safety monitoring to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the benefits and harms associated with each CAIM in the context of autism. Our umbrella review and related platform will be updated on a regular basis to capture the evolution of the evidence in this field. To further enhance the content and features of this platform, future umbrella reviews will be conducted to complete the database (for example, an umbrella review of pharmacological interventions), and collaborative studies will be conducted with healthcare professionals and individuals with lived experience to ensure that the platform meets their needs. Ultimately, the impact of the platform on clinical decision-making will be tested in randomized studies.

The umbrella review, based on a publicly available protocol (PROSPERO CRD42022296284), was conducted and reported according to relevant guidelines16,17,36, including the U-REACH methodological guidelines18 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) reporting guidelines37. The PRIOR checklist is available in Supplementary Information section 1.

We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO with terms related to two constructs (‘autism' and ‘meta-analysis'), with no language, publication type or date of publication restrictions, up to 31 December 2023. The list of full search terms is reported in Supplementary Information section 2. Screening of the titles and abstracts, as well as study selection, was performed independently by the first author and several members of the team. Disagreements were resolved by the senior authors (R.D., S.C. and M.S.). References of included studies and Google Scholar were searched to identify additional eligible references, but all relevant reports found with these manual searches were already included in the database searches.

We included systematic reviews coupled with a meta-analysis of both randomized and non-randomized CCTs that assessed the efficacy of any CAIM on both core autism symptoms and key autism-related symptoms in autistic participants of any age. Contrary to what was envisioned in the protocol, we chose to include both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials, rather than including only randomized controlled trials. This choice was made because, in the field of autism, several promising types of intervention—such as long-term or intensive interventions—are difficult to assess in randomized trials. This choice ensures a complete and consistent mapping of the literature regardless of the intervention type. Even if less than 10% of studies were non-randomized studies in our primary analysis, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized clinical trials.

A review was considered ‘systematic' if it was identified as such by its authors and searched at least two scientific databases in combination with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The definition of autism followed that used by primary authors, typically in line with international classifications (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from 3rd to 5th editions, or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 or 10). Based on the mean age of the participants within each meta-analysis, we grouped the presentation of the results into four distinct age groups: (1) preschool children (mean age ranging from 0 to 5 years), (2) school-aged children (6–12 years), (3) adolescents (13–19 years), and (iv) adults (≥20 years). For each meta-analysis, we evaluated whether the average age of the participants from the different CCTs was homogeneous (see our exact criteria in Supplementary Information section 3).

In accordance with the standard classification of the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine6,7, we identified 19 CAIM types (see the list and complete description at https://ebiact-database.com/interventions/). The prespecified primary outcomes of interest were autism core symptoms (overall symptoms, social communication impairment, restricted/stereotyped/repetitive behaviours and sensory peculiarities) and CAIM-related safety (acceptability (risk of all-cause discontinuation), tolerability (risk of discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events) and adverse events (risk of experiencing at least one or any specific adverse events)). Secondary outcomes were language skills (overall language, receptive language and expressive language), functioning (overall cognitive functioning, adaptive behaviours and quality of life), disruptive behaviours and psychiatric comorbidities (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and emotional/depressive symptoms). We included sleep quality and quantity as post-hoc outcomes, given the significance of sleep for autistic individuals and their families that emerged from the screened papers38.

As described in detail in Supplementary Information section 4, we extracted information regarding the characteristics of clinical trials (for example, risk of bias), participants (for example, mean age) and interventions (for example, dosage) from meta-analytic reports. In instances where the age of the participants was not reported in the meta-analysis, we obtained this directly from the report describing the clinical trial. Similarly, when the estimated effect sizes of individual studies were deemed unplausible (for example, SMD ≥5), we conducted the necessary checks using the metaConvert R package (version 1.0.2)39 and excluded meta-analyses containing inaccuracies or errors. More details on data extraction and data quality checks are available in Supplementary Information sections 4 and 5.

In line with recommendations for umbrella reviews16,17,18,36, we obtained the quality of primary studies by extracting this information directly from the meta-analytic reports. We evaluated the quality of the meta-analyses using the AMSTAR-2 tool40. The AMSTAR-2 scoring was performed independently by the first author and several members of the team.

Following the identification of several overlapping meta-analyses, that is, independent meta-analyses that assessed the same PICO combination, the most recent meta-analysis with the highest methodological quality was selected for the primary analysis, rather than the largest meta-analysis (see more details in ‘Main deviations from the protocol' section). Then, we assessed the concordance of the results of overlapping meta-analyses, such as the percentage overlap of the 95% CI around the pooled effect size or the agreement on the GRADE ranking, in a secondary analysis. More details on the selection process for overlapping meta-analyses are available in Supplementary Information section 6.

When registering the protocol, we did not describe any specific system for assessing the levels of evidence regarding the effects of each intervention. This was because, at that time, there was no consensus on the best approach in umbrella reviews of RCTs, given that the traditional gold-standard framework for meta-analyses of interventions (the GRADE framework) becomes difficult to use when the number of comparisons to grade is high. In this Article, we chose to rely on the algorithmic version of the GRADE framework recently implemented in the metaumbrella R software. These criteria are inspired by standard guidelines for rating the levels of evidence in large evidence syntheses, such as Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA)32. For all meta-analyses, the levels of evidence started with a ‘high' ranking and could then be downgraded depending on the presence of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias (Table 1).

To tackle the recognized gap between scientific evidence about CAIM in autism and its accessibility for clinicians and both autistic persons and their families, we developed the EBIA-CT platform (https://ebiact-database.com/) to disseminate our results in a user-friendly manner. Building upon a preliminary version created during our prior work on psychosocial interventions15, we significantly enhanced the platform design and features during this project. This improvement process was informed by qualitative feedback from clinicians, stakeholders and researchers, ensuring the platform is user-friendly and effectively disseminates the findings of this umbrella review. Integrating the EBIA-CT platform into our umbrella review methodology allowed us to proactively adhere to the U-REACH guidelines, a framework specifically designed to promote the wide dissemination of umbrella review results. Furthermore, the platform is designed as a ‘living resource', with planned annual updates for 5 years, following our established methodology and aligning with living review principles. In terms of ethical considerations, no new primary data were collected for this umbrella review or platform development. Therefore, formal ethics committee consultation was not deemed necessary, as is standard practice for projects focused on synthesizing and disseminating existing research findings. The platform is organized into three main sections:

Interventions: This section provides comprehensive details about each intervention we identified, including the target population (for example, age range and cognitive functioning level), implementation guidelines and meta-analysis results across age groups. It serves as a valuable resource for autistic individuals and their families seeking information on specific interventions.

Preferences: In this section, users can explore age-specific intervention outcomes, providing an overall mapping of the efficacy and safety of all interventions. This section supports informed discussions between clinicians and autistic individuals or their families, facilitating evidence-based decision-making tailored to individual needs.

Database: This section provides an overview of the information stored in the platform, and grants access to the raw data from the umbrella review, enabling users to download datasets for external analysis. It is especially useful for researchers identifying knowledge gaps and for guideline developers formulating recommendations.

As described in more detail in Supplementary Information section 7, all analyses were performed in the R environment (version 4.1.1) using the ‘metaumbrella' package (version 1.1.0)41. We used the SMD as the main effect size measure for the assessment of efficacy, and the RR as the main effect size measure for the assessment of safety (that is, acceptability, tolerability and adverse events). Although we preregistered that the effect measure would be SMD only, we preferred analysing these safety outcomes on their natural effect measures, given their dichotomous nature. For meta-analyses of mean difference and OR, we converted this information for each trial to SMD (respectively RR) before conducting the calculations. Regardless of the metric used (RR or SMD), the direction of the effect was reversed when needed, such that a positive effect size (RR >1 or SMD >0) systematically reflected an improvement, that is, a symptom reduction, a competence improvement or a high safety.

We reran each meta-analysis identified in the review, to ensure consistent calculations and assessments of the level of evidence across meta-analyses. We systematically used a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator, or a Paul–Mandel estimator for τ2. The CI for the pooled effect size was based on the standard normal quantile method. The I2, Q statistics and τ2 statistics, as well as the 95% prediction interval, were used to assess heterogeneity. Egger's regression asymmetry, the excess of statistical significance bias test and the proportion of participants in studies at high risk of reporting bias were used to examine the presence of small study effects42,43. When meta-analyses contained dependent effect sizes, we removed this dependence using the standard aggregating approach proposed by Borenstein and colleagues44 (Supplementary Information section 8). Because we chose to include both randomized and non-randomized studies, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to randomized controlled trials. However, less than 10% of studies were non-randomized studies in our primary analysis, and the results of this analysis were very similar to those reported in the main manuscript.

We made two important changes to our preregistered protocol. Although we initially planned to select the largest meta-analyses in cases of overlap, we ultimately prioritized the meta-analysis with the highest methodological quality—in line with our willingness to prioritize high-quality evidence for clinical decision-making. In addition, because the methodological landscape of umbrella reviews was still evolving at the time of registration and there were no gold-standard methods for assessing the quality of a very large body of evidence coming from umbrella reviews of RCTs, we did not prespecify an evidence grading system in our protocol. Instead, we relied on recent algorithmic GRADE criteria that have been proposed independently of the current work and implemented in the main umbrella review software34. Although these departures were made to increase methodological rigour, they represent post-hoc decisions that should be taken into account when interpreting our results and reflect the recent nature of the field of umbrella reviews.

Plastics play a fundamental role in modern life, but their resistance to biodegradation makes them very difficult to dispose of. New research reveals how “plastivore” caterpillars can metabolically degrade plastics in a matter of days, not decades, and store them internally as body fat – but at what cost?

In 2017, a groundbreaking study demonstrated that the caterpillars of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella), known as waxworms, can degrade polyethylene plastic. Polyethylene is the world's most commonly manufactured plastic, with over 100 million tonnes of polyethylene produced globally each year. Polyethylene is chemically resilient, which makes it resistant to decomposition and can take decades or even hundreds of years to fully degrade.

While this plastic degradation process has been demonstrated by waxworms at a small scale, this ongoing research project is helping us to better understand the biological mechanisms at work, the impact of an all-plastic diet on the health of these organisms, and their viability as a sustainable solution to plastic pollution.

“Around 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire polyethylene bag in as little as 24 hours, although we believe that co-supplementation with feeding stimulants like sugars can reduce the number of worms considerably,” says Dr Bryan Cassone, a Professor of Insect Pest and Vector Biology in the Department of Biology at Brandon University, Canada. “However, understanding the biological mechanisms and consequences on fitness associated with plastic biodegradation is key to using waxworms for large-scale plastic remediation.”

Utilizing a suite of techniques spanning animal physiology, material science, molecular biology and genomics, Dr Cassone and his team have studied the interesting relationship between waxworms, their bacterial microbiome, and their potential for large-scale plastic biodegradation, as well as the possible impacts on waxworm health and survivability.

This research reveals that waxworms metabolically process the plastics down into lipids and store it as body fat. “This is similar to us eating steak – if we consume too much saturated and unsaturated fat, it becomes stored in adipose tissue as lipid reserves, rather than being used as energy,” says Dr Cassone.

While waxworms will readily consume polyethylene, this research also shows that this ultimately ends in a quick death. “They do not survive more than a few days on a plastic-only diet and they lose considerable mass,” says Dr Cassone. “However, we are optimistic that we can formulate a co-supplementation that not only restores their fitness to natural levels but exceeds it.”

Dr Cassone and his team have identified two ways in which waxworms could contribute solutions to the ongoing plastic pollution crisis. “Firstly, we could mass rear waxworms on a co-supplemented polyethylene diet as part of a circular economy,” he says. “Secondly, we could explore the re-engineering of the plastic biodegradation pathway outside the animal.”

As a bonus benefit, the mass production of waxworms would also generate a substantial surplus of insect biomass, which could represent an additional economic opportunity in aquaculture. “Our preliminary data suggests that they could become part of a very nutritious diet for commercial food fishes,” says Dr Cassone.

This research is being presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Conference in Antwerp, Belgium on the 8th July 2025.

The online discourse surrounding The Last of Us season two was entrenched in unwarranted outrage, sparked by outrage over the show's centering a gay love story and killing off the franchise's leading man. The trolling, which resulted in the show getting review bombed, of course, is weird considering that both these major plot aspects are also present in Neil Druckmann's series of Naughty Dog games.

Recently Bella Ramsey, the show's Emmy Award-nominated lead (alongside Pedro Pascal), discussed with The Awardist podcast their reaction to the reactive rage-baiters who took issue with Ellie's lesbian relationship.

“Because there's nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There's nothing that can be changed or altered. So I'm like, there's not really any point in reading or looking at anything,” Ramsey shared. “People are, of course, entitled to their opinions. But it doesn't affect the show; it doesn't affect how the show continues or anything in any way. They're very separate things to me. So no, I just don't really engage.”

Ramsey addressed how that vocal minority of vile-spewing can sincerely excuse themselves from engaging with season three, which will see showrunner Craig Mazin, helming solo after Druckmann stepped back, follow the show's antagonist Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who killed Joel (Pascal). The story twist has been around since it debuted in the game, but it still continues to divide The Last of Us fandom and shock casual show viewers during season two.

The shift in leading characters will delve into Abby's world to inform her worldview. How Ellie comes into play is under wraps but Ramsey affirmed that they hope haters steer clear if they won't approach the story with an open mind: “You don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. If you do want to watch it, hope you enjoy it.”

That said, I consider `just` very language-agnostic and useful because of that, and I consider mix pretty bad at any workflow needs that isn't directly concerned with BEAM.

The Trump administration seems intent on controlling Intel's ability to make key business decisions around its floundering foundry business unit.

According to reporting from the Financial Times, at a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, Intel's CFO David Zinsner shared new details about the company's recent deal with the Trump administration, which gave the U.S. government a 10% equity stake.

The deal was structured in a way to penalize Intel if it spins out its foundry business unit, which makes custom chips for outside customers, within the next few years.

Last week's deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. Zinsner said he expects that warrant to expire.

“I think from the government's perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn't want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said.

Zinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week's deal, according to Reuters. (That cash comes from the remaining grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.)

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that the deal was still being ironed out.

Intel declined to comment on the deal beyond Zinsner's remarks. 

This deal structure is clearly a testament to the Trump administration's desire to bring more chip manufacturing to the United States as many players in the industry turn to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's offshore manufacturing instead.

But this warrant also forces Intel to keep a business unit that is losing money. Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of $3.1 billion during the second quarter and has been a source of strife for the semiconductor business.

There have been calls from analysts, board members, and investors alike to spin out the struggling foundry unit, which looked like it might actually happen last fall, before Intel Foundry's architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, retired suddenly in December.

From searching your files to scheduling haircuts to supporting emergency response — it's been a heck of an entrepreneurial journey for Max Keenan and James Liu. 

The young founders just raised $14 million for Aurelian, a Seattle-based company that uses AI and voice technology to help 911 call centers respond to non-emergency calls.

Their path to Series A and product-market-fit has been a crash course in pivots and reinvention.

After graduating from the University of Chicago, Keenan and Liu raised a pre-seed round for a company called Needl in 2022 and joined the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator.

Needl aimed to build a personal search product to help people quickly find files, documents, or messages within their digital footprint. 

The company wasn't failing. But the co-founders weren't jazzed about the mission. “We just didn't love our customers,” Keenan said. 

They sat down and asked themselves: what are we really trying to do here?

“Our core framework for what we thought would make us happiest was if we were working with interesting tech for people who did meaningful work,” Keenan recalled this week in an interview with GeekWire. “That was the combination we wanted.”

So they went back to the drawing board in 2023 and explored ideas around conversational AI, a technology that was rapidly improving thanks to advances in large language models.

They started experimenting with salon booking — helping small businesses automate appointment scheduling and price quotes. “It's surprisingly a really difficult problem,” Keenan said.

But it was a different problem that led the entrepreneurs to 911 call centers.

Keenan was working with a salon owner who mentioned her frustration with a long stretch of cars in a school pickup line blocking the parking spots at her business. 

“She called the police department's non-emergency line and probably waited 30 or 40 minutes,” Keenan said. Then she hung up and called 911. 

“Can you make it so the police answer the phone?” she asked Keenan.

This was far from their area of expertise. But the founders recognized an opportunity to use software to help modernize a 911 call center industry that is struggling with staffing shortages and has been slow to adopt new technology.

“Most are still working with on-premises software, and very few have gone fully into the cloud for their core systems,” Keenan said. 

Call centers connect their existing phone lines to Aurelian's AI assistant, which answers calls, gathers information, and asks follow-up questions. It can fully resolve non-emergency calls (stolen wallets, parking violations, noise complaints) without a human dispatcher or re-route to an appropriate worker. The tech can also handle language nuance (“robbery” vs. “burglary”) and vague location data.

The idea is to help free up employees to address emergency calls with immediate needs while also reducing wait times for non-emergency requests.

Since launching in May 2024, Aurelian has more than a dozen agencies across the U.S. using its product, including seven in Washington state.

The technology is having immediate impact. Just a few days after Aurelian went live with Snohomish County, a huge “bomb cyclone” storm hit the Seattle region.

Aurelian was able to answer more than 500 calls about power outages in a 24-hour span. “We answered every single one of those calls instantly,” Keenan said. One call was from a woman who needed help with her husband's chair lift that was stuck halfway up the stairs.

“We took that call, transferred it immediately, and had it answered in five seconds instead of an hour,” Keenan said.

Aurelian is on track to automate more than one million calls each month. 

NEA led the Series A round, which included participation from several of the company's original investors — including Liquid 2 Ventures, Y Combinator, and Palm Drive Capital. “Kudos to the team for the incredible perseverance to find one of the best use cases for AI that we've seen in the past few years,” Cameron Borumand, general partner at FUSE, told GeekWire.

Keenan said he's learned to optimize for energy and excitement when it comes to building a business. 

“This was the first time we woke up every day excited to work with our customers,” he said. “That's what I indexed on more than anything.”

Fusion power startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised $863 million from a long list of investors that includes Nvidia, Google, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and more. 

“We're continuing our trend here of looking into the world and saying, ‘How do we advance fusion as fast as possible?'” co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard told reporters in a call this week. “This round of capital isn't just about fusion just generally as a concept, but it's about how do we go to make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor.”

The Massachusetts-based company has raised nearly $3 billion to date, the most of any fusion startup. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) previously raised a $1.8 billion round in 2021.

Fusion power has long been promised as a nearly limitless energy source, though it wasn't until recently that investors considered it a bet worth placing. As advances in computing and AI have quickened the pace of research and development, the sector has become a hotbed of startup and investor activity.

Inside a fusion reaction, atoms are compressed and heated until they form a fourth state of matter known as plasma. When the plasma reaches the right temperature and pressure, those atoms begin to fuse, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process.

CFS is currently building a prototype reactor called Sparc in a Boston suburb. The company expects to turn that device on later next year and achieve scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it. 

Though Sparc isn't designed to sell power to the grid, it's still vital to CFS's success. 

“There are parts of the modeling and the physics that we don't yet understand,” Saskia Mordijck, an associate professor of physics at the College of William and Mary, told TechCrunch. “It's always an open question when you turn on a completely new device that it might go into plasma regimes we've never been into, that maybe we uncover things that we just did not expect.”

Assuming Sparc doesn't reveal any major problems, CFS expects to begin construction on Arc, its commercial-scale power plant, in Virginia starting in 2027 or 2028.

The Sparc and Arc designs are both tokamaks, a type of fusion reactor that uses powerful superconducting magnets to confine and compress plasma. Tokamaks are well known among the research community. 

“We know that this kind of idea should work,” Mordijck said. “The question is naturally, how will it perform?”

Investors appear to like what they've seen so far. The list of participants in the Series B2 round is lengthy. No single investor led the round, and a number of existing investors increased their stakes, said Ally Yost, CFS's senior vice president of corporate development. 

Existing investors that increased their stakes include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Eni, Future Ventures, Gates Frontier, Google, Hostplus, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Safar Partners, Eric Schmidt, Starlight Ventures, and Tiger Global.

The new investors include Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Nvidia's NVentures, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation.

Such a broad base of investors may prove helpful as the company develops its supply chain and searches for partners to build its power plants and buy electricity from them. So far, the company has inked a deal with Google to buy 200 megawatts from Arc.

As the first of its kind, Arc is likely to cost more than subsequent power plants, Mordijck said.

And while Sparc will help prove the science is sound, it will do more than that for CFS, Mumgaard told TechCrunch. “That's very important. But it's also to know the capabilities that you need to be able to deliver it. It's also to have the receipts, know what these things cost.”

The new round will help CFS make progress on Sparc, but it will not be enough to build Arc, which will likely cost several billion dollars, Mumgaard said. At this point, the company doesn't know exactly what shape the funding for Arc will take. 

“The fact that it's a first of a kind technology is a wrinkle that then has a big impact on where the capital will come from,” he said. “We're not entirely sure, but we are pretty committed to doing this. And our investors are pretty committed to doing this.”

Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is switching to a reusable cup program facilitated by Bold Reuse, a Portland-based startup, in the venue's ongoing bid to eliminate waste at sports and entertainment events.

The new cups will debut Saturday during the Seattle Storm WNBA game. Fans will receive their drinks in durable cups that can be returned to collection bins throughout the stadium. The cups are collected, professionally sanitized and returned by Bold Reuse.

They will be used at all Climate Pledge Arena events, from Kraken hockey games to concerts and more, replacing the arena's use of recyclable aluminum cups.

Climate Pledge Arena has received accolades for its environmental efforts, and in 2023 became the first sports stadium in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from a nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings.

The arena is named after The Climate Pledge, an initiative founded by Amazon and Global Optimism asking global corporations to become net zero carbon by 2040. 

Bold Reuse initially launched as GO Box in 2011, providing reusable takeout containers. Co-founder and CEO Jocelyn Quarrell acquired the business in 2018, and rebranded it four years later. The company expanded into Seattle in February 2024 and opened a 9,000-square-feet dishwashing facility in the city's Chinatown-International District.

Bold Reuse launched a pilot program with material science company Avery Dennison in June in which RFID tags are being implemented to track the entire lifecycle of reusable cups — from distribution and return to wash cycles and end-of-life. 

The two-month pilot was live at the company's Portland wash hub as well as two of the city's sports venues: Moda Center and Providence Park.

Earlier this month, Bold Reuse announced a new partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs — the first NFL team to offer reusable cups stadium-wide for every event. 

Reusable cups from Minnesota-based r.World are used at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo ZooTunes concert events; SIFF Cinema Downtown, the former Cinerama movie theater; and WAMU Theater.

An overly broad age assurance law in Mississippi is leading to arguments about which platforms — Bluesky, Mastodon, or others — offer the best solution for avoiding crackdowns on internet freedoms.

The company that makes the Bluesky social app announced last week that it would block access to its service in the state of Mississippi rather than comply with the new age verification law. In a blog post, the company explained that, as a small team, it lacked the resources to implement the substantial technical changes required by the law, and it raised concerns about the law's broad scope and potential privacy implications.

The law, HB 1126, requires platforms to implement age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. Recently, the Supreme Court justices decided to block an emergency appeal that would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. This forced Bluesky to make a decision of its own: either comply or risk hefty fines of up to $10,000 per user.

Users in Mississippi soon scrambled for a workaround, which tends to involve the use of VPNs. 

However, others questioned why a VPN would be the necessary solution here. After all, decentralized social networking was meant to reduce the control and power the state — or any authority — would have over these social platforms.

On Mastodon, the decentralized social network running the ActivityPub protocol, founder Eugen Rochko responded to the announcement from Bluesky by taking a bit of a potshot at the rival social network.

“And this is why real decentralization matters,” he wrote. “There is nobody that can decide for the fediverse to block Mississippi.”

This prompted a response from Techdirt founder and Bluesky board member Mike Masnick, who said Rochko's statement was “potentially misleading.”

“Both because others can host their own views of the network,” he pointed out, but also will the largest instances, which you run, be willing to pay the $10k/user fines in Mississippi? Because the state can still go after instances, no?” (He's referring to the large instance, or server, called mastodon.social, which Rochko also runs.)

TechCrunch reached out to Mastodon to confirm whether it would comply with the law on the mastodon.social instance, and we didn't hear back by time of publication. But the law was written in a way that a Mastodon instance could seemingly become a target — as could a “message board,” “chat room,” “landing page,” “video channel,” or “main feed,” it states.

Rochko and Masnick then engaged in a rather spicy back-and-forth, as others chimed in, with Rochko accusing Bluesky of having all its infrastructure run by one U.S. company — meaning Bluesky PBC, the company behind the Bluesky social app. He also said that it was “interesting” that this was the only time someone from Bluesky had said anything to him about “working together” — i.e. to fight such legislation — since Bluesky's launch nearly two years ago.

“Well, I believe you have my e-mail address,” Rochko wrote. 

The truth, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the middle. 

Unlike Mastodon, which connects thousands of decentralized servers over the ActivityPub protocol, Bluesky uses a different protocol (AT Protocol or AT Proto for short), which focuses more on account portability and decentralized moderation. Instead of allowing people to run their own servers to create a community, Bluesky lets people run their own versions of the bits and pieces that make up its social networking infrastructure, like the PDS (personal data server), relay, moderation lists, or algorithm.

That said, Bluesky is still the largest entity to operate a PDS, given that the network is still fairly new. That means the majority of Bluesky's users are relying on its own infrastructure. However, a community called Blacksky recently spun up its own PDS, so things are progressing on that front. And there are others, as well as independently run relays and appviews, which are portions of Bluesky infrastructure.

In the meantime, these turf battles don't do anything to help the users of Mississippi who have been locked out of their preferred social networks. 

Without using a VPN, some users in the state report they've been able to access Bluesky through third-party clients like Graysky, Skeets, Klearsky, TOKIMEKI, Flashes, or forked versions of the Bluesky app, like Deer.social or Zeppelin.

Rudy Fraser, Blacksky founder, confirmed to TechCrunch that his community doesn't plan on blocking any users based on where they're located, anywhere in the world.

There's also a sideloaded version of Bluesky available, which was uploaded to the alternative app distribution platform AltStore. To sideload, first install AltStore on Mac or Windows with permissions and developer mode enabled. Then press the “+” button, type in “https://smanthasam.github.io/bskyms/alt.json” (without quotes), press the button next to “BlueskyMS,” and press add. This adds the source to your AltStore so you can browse to the sideloaded Bluesky app and install it.

For those in Mississippi in need of a read-only version of Bluesky, Anartia‘s search engine is available.

Still, these workarounds aren't necessarily permanent solutions, as the makers of the apps and clients have to decide for themselves whether they want to risk becoming a popular alternative for users in Mississippi that could catch legislators' attention. As it stands, the law broadly affects services that allow users to create profiles, post content, and interact with others on a social networking service — a broad definition.

If Bluesky client applications don't run their own PDS to host user data, it may perhaps be considered to be only offering clients — and therefore should not be affected. But explaining the intricacies of how a PDS works to a judge might prove difficult, too.

Mississippi is not the only state looking to add an age assurance layer to the internet. Other laws are in various stages in Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia. The latter is particularly challenging, as it includes a time limit for usage of social media sites.

In any event, the diaspora of social networking alternatives at least makes enforcement of this type of legislation a bit more difficult, compared with a traditionally centralized network like Facebook or Instagram. That's a step in the right direction for decentralization, regardless of your network of choice. 

But overly broad laws also advantage the larger centralized platforms, which easily have the resources to comply, while smaller services like Bluesky just have to opt out.

Tech Moves covers notable hires, promotions and personnel changes in the Pacific NW tech community. Submissions: tips@geekwire.com

— Marketing vet Brian Hall has left Google for a new, undisclosed position. 

Hall, who made headlines after he was sued by Amazon when he joined Google five years ago, shared hints about his new role on LinkedIn.

“I'll be working in AI — directly or helping build the platforms to take advantage of it,” he wrote. “This is so fun right now there is no way I'm getting out of the excitement!”

Hall worked at Amazon Web Services as vice president of product marketing for less than two years before joining Google Cloud in 2020 in a similar role.

Amazon filed suit against Hall, alleging that his new job violated his non-compete agreement and risked exposing competitive information to a rival. Hall countered that Amazon executives assured him the company would not enforce the non-compete provision of its confidentiality agreement. The two sides ultimately reached a confidential legal settlement. 

Hall began his tech career at Microsoft in 1995 as a product manager for Windows and Internet Explorer. He stuck with the company for about 20 years, leaving as corporate vice president of hardware and devices.

— T-Mobile is making big changes in its leadership roles, as disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the Bellevue, Wash.-based telecommunications giant.   

John Saw, the company's chief technologist, will take on the expanded role of president of technology, which puts him in charge of “all aspects of the company's network team,” according to the filing. Saw was with Sprint for nearly seven years when T-Mobile acquired the company in 2020. Prior to Sprint, he was CTO at Bellevue's Clearwire for a decade.

Saw is succeeding Ulf Ewaldsson, who joined T-Mobile in 2019 and was president of technology for more than two years. He was previously with Ericsson for 12 years, leaving the role of CEO advisor at the Stockholm-based company. 

Callie Field, T-Mobile's business group president, is stepping down after more than two decades with the company. Her resignation is effective on Sept. 30, and she will remain as a strategic advisor for six months. Field started her career with the company as a sales representative. 

“21 years ago I put on an Elf costume for my first day selling mobile phones at a temporary T-Mobile kiosk in Barton Creek Mall, Austin, Texas,” Field said in announcing her departure.

Board member André Almeida will become president of growth and emerging businesses on Sept. 1, overseeing T-Mobile's broadband, advertising, financial services, enterprise and government businesses. Almeida was previously with Deutsche Telekom, the parent company of the T-Mobile brand, for more than seven years.

— Warren Barkley, a past general manager for Microsoft, has taken a role at Nvidia as vice president of product management. He joins the company from Google, where he was head of product for multiple AI initiatives based in Seattle.

“I couldn't be more thrilled to join a company pushing the frontiers of AI and empowering an ecosystem of builders to realize their boldest dreams,” Barkley said on LinkedIn.

Barkley's career began as a Microsoft manager in 1996. He stuck with the company for 16 years before becoming the chief technologist at Seattle's SMART Technologies. Barkley held other leadership roles for Amazon Web Services, Clearwater Analytics and as a professor with Europe's BIMM University.

— Longtime Seattle leader Julie Averill has left her role as chief information officer at lululemon. Averill previously held technology leadership roles at Seattle retailers REI and Nordstrom, serving at the latter for more than a decade. She did not announce her next move.

“When I joined as CIO eight years ago, we were a $2B company bursting with potential,” she wrote on LinkedIn. “Leading the technology transformation that helped scale us to $10.6B taught me something I'll carry forever: sustainable transformation happens through people, amplified by technology, rooted in culture that outlasts any individual leader.”

The company announced that Ranju Das is joining as its first chief AI and technology officer. 

— Modern Hydrogen co-founder Max Mankin is now chief operating officer at Elve, a company providing faster internet connections. Mankin helped launch his startup, originally called Modern Electron, out of Seattle's Intellectual Ventures more than a decade ago. The company later pivoted its focus from heat-to-electricity generating devices to producing hydrogen fuel.  

— Maveron's Anarghya Vardhana is moving from partner to venture partner at the Seattle-based investment firm, and has also taken the title of investor-in-residence at Vanta, a San Francisco startup tackling corporate compliance, security, privacy and transparency.

Vanta is “shaping how the next generation of technology earns and keeps trust. As an investor, a technologist, a mom, and a human being, this is where I need to be,” Vardhana said on LinkedIn. 

— Daniel Narváez Zavala is the Washington State Department of Commerce's new chief operating officer. Zavala was previously executive director of Building Changes, a nonprofit organization serving youth and families experiencing homelessness in the Washington. Zavala, who holds a law degree from the University of Washington, worked on legal issues at Amazon for two years early in his career.

“[Zavala's] leadership will directly support our commitment to strengthen communities and grow Washington's economy. He will energize our executive leadership team and help the whole agency navigate tremendous national and statewide changes,” said Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn in announcing his appointment.

— Chetan Kapoor is stepping down as chief product officer of Seattle cloud infrastructure company CoreWeave. Kapoor was at Amazon Web Services for nearly 12 years before taking his role at CoreWeave last year. At AWS, he worked in multiple product manager roles.

— Patrick Ryan and Chris Kane joined Seattle-based industrial wastewater treatment startup Membrion. Ryan, vice president of sales, is a veteran water executive who was previously CEO at Hyperion Water Technologies. Kane, senior product manager, spent a decade at W. L. Gore & Associates.

— Guillermo Sandoval was named executive director at Micro Enterprise Services of Oregon (MESO), Portland-based nonprofit that helps under-resourced and excluded entrepreneurs. Sandoval was previously a community relationship manager at Native American Bank and a director at Umpqua Bank. He replaces Cobi Lewis, who is now COO at 1803 Foundation.

A new report from local venture capital firm Madrona features three Seattle-based startups among the top 40 private artificial intelligence companies globally.

The annual Intelligent Applications 40 (IA40) list provides an overview of the leading startups that are integrating AI into business solutions.

To compile the list, more than 70 VC investors from 54 firms nominated more than 340 private companies. These investors then voted on a short list of finalists, and the results were combined with PitchBook's “Venture Exit Predictor Tool” to produce the final ranking.

The ranking, co-authored by Madrona, features a significant turnover rate with 27 new companies on the list, reflecting a rapid pace of innovation. The list also highlights the concentration of AI startups in San Francisco, which accounts for a significant proportion of the honorees.

While California-based startups dominate the list, three companies from the Seattle area made the cut:

The IA40 list highlights a small-but-impactful group of Seattle companies alongside a much larger representation from the Bay Area, which includes major players like OpenAI and Anthropic. GeekWire recently reported on the lack of superstar AI startups in the Seattle region, despite its brand as a global AI hub.

Key takeaways from the IA40 report include the rise of next-generation user interfaces that are conversational and “agentic” — systems that can reason and execute autonomously. 

The report also highlights a multi-billion dollar opportunity in new AI tools for software development, along with the success of “service-as-software” business models. These trends are supported by the continued importance of the data layer and the maturity of the enabling infrastructure that powers these innovations, allowing for strong vertical momentum as companies build AI-native products for specific industries.

See the full list here and read Madrona's blog post here.

Framer, a Dutch company specializing in tools for automating web design, has secured a $100 million funding round that values the startup at $2 billion.

The investment was led by existing backers Meritech Capital Partners and Atomico, according to a statement released Thursday.

The massive capital infusion positions it to take on its largest rival, Figma, which also uses a community-based model to create websites and design. It went public in 2023 and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this summer and now holds a lofty market cap of $37.68 billion.

No-code websites teach users to create websites and apps without extensive programming knowledge. As the no-code and AI-driven design sector heats up, Framer's rapid valuation jump underscores investor enthusiasm for platforms that simplify web development using generative AI, making it a key player to watch as the industry continues to evolve.

Framer claims a user base of 500,000 active monthly users, most of whom are startups. The company aims to attract larger enterprise clients as it scales. The last funding round in 2023 was a $27 million raise, though the valuation at that time was not disclosed.

“Close to half of the latest Y Combinator batch launched with Framer, alongside global brands like Perplexity, Scale AI, Huel, Miro, Zapier, and Mixpanel,” Framer said in a statement. “Today, hundreds of thousands of sites run on Framer, with more than half a million people using the platform each month.”

Venture capitalists see significant potential in AI-powered tools that enable rapid website creation and design, especially following the September 2023 IPO of Figma, which soared 250% on debut and has become a benchmark for the sector. It has since seen a rollercoaster ride for its share price.

“Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said after Figma's IPO. “Because of this three-year bottleneck, tech IPO investors have been starved for new deals.”

That appetite has only grown. Venture capital firms invested approximately $162.8 billion across various deals in the first six months of 2025, according to data from PitchBook.

Notably, about 30% of this funding was allocated to late-stage startups, reflecting a continued appetite among investors for established companies preparing for or already pursuing IPOs and acquisitions.

Founded in 2014 in Amsterdam by by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk who had previously sold their company, Sofa, to Facebook, Framer initially focused on prototyping tools for website design. Over time, it expanded into web publishing and “no-code” development.

The funding underscores a broader trend among technology investors betting heavily on startups that offer no-code or “vibe coding” features, which rely on generative AI models from providers like OpenAI.

Framer markets itself as a simpler alternative to Figma and Squarespace, offering an integrated platform for web animation, marketing analytics, and publishing.

“We empower designers to publish websites without needing costly developers,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said in the statement today.

Other startups in the space, such as Anysphere, which produces the AI coding assistant Cursor, are reaching hefty valuations on relatively modest revenue. In July, Anysphere announced over $500 million in annualized revenue, valuing the company at nearly $10 billion.

Framer, on the other hand, generated around $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year and projects to double that figure in 2026, driven by growing demand for AI-enhanced design tools.

Lucasfilm just announced the cast of Star Wars: Starfighter, directed by Shawn Levy, which is now in production. Ryan Gosling stars, and he'll be joined by Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams.

“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said on the official Star Wars website. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”

Above, you get our first glimpse of the film, featuring Gosling and Gray. While there's still no official word on the plot of the film, that image certainly suggests the rumors about a mentor and mentee relationship are true. All the official site says is that it's “an all-new standalone adventure” and “an entirely original story set in a period of time never before explored in Star Wars.” That's referring to the time after the events of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.

In terms of the cast, Smith and Goth had been rumored, but several of the other names are brand new, and, among those, a few stand out. Aaron Pierre, who'll next be seen in the DC series Lanterns, is one. The talented Rebel Ridge actor is now also a DC and Star Wars guy. The other is multi-Oscar-nominee Amy Adams, who is also now a DC and Star Wars person. There's no word on who each is playing, but they are intriguing additions to the Star Wars universe.

With Starfighter now in production, it's locking in on its release date of May 28, 2027, which is almost exactly 50 years after the release of the first Star Wars.

Some CPUs will now no longer have a bundled cooler


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


 




Ever since the introduction of the Ryzen line-up, AMD has supplied a stock cooler in the box with most of its CPUs. These range from the basic Wraith Stealth units to the RGB-laden Wraith Prism, and the Wraith Spire which sits in between. While the Wraith line-up has existed prior to modern Ryzen processors, the Prism debuted with the Ryzen 2000 series in 2018, it is now retiring after seven years.

Spotted by @momomo_us, AMD has updated the OPN codes for some of its boxed Ryzen CPUs, with a new message highlighting the end-of-life status for Wraith Prism and Wraith Spire. Starting August, 2025, the cooler has been completely retired and will no longer come with processors such as the Ryzen 9 7900. There's no substitute either; there will simply be no stock cooler bundled with some AMD CPUs.

 




Alongside the Prism, even the Wraith Spire is being discontinued, with select units shifting to the lower-tier Wraith Stealth. AMD already moved away from including boxed coolers entirely with the Ryzen 9000 series, arguing that higher-end CPUs are paired with aftermarket solutions anyways. The only exception to this is the Ryzen 5 9600, which fittingly ships with a Wraith Stealth — so that's safe.

Of the Ryzen 9000 series, only the Ryzen 5 9600 gets a Wraith Stealth cooler, but the Ryzen 7000 series fairs better with a handful of CPUs coming with in-box cooling. These are the Ryzen 9 7900 (Prism), 7 7700, 5 7600, , 5 7500F and the 5 7400F which all come with Wraith Stealth coolers. The older Ryzen 5 series CPUs fair much better with 11 of the 26 CPUs coming with cooling.

The Wraith Prism itself is an upgraded version of the original Wraith Max coolers that AMD shipped with its FX CPUs. It's the most capable of the bunch (or was), rated for 140W TDP which means it should be able to cool even flagship 16-core SKUs from the Red Team. On the other hand, the Wraith Stealth launched with the original 1000-series Ryzen chips and they're essentially the same cooler, just with different sized heatsinks.

While these coolers are technically nothing special, they still lowered the barrier to entry to a new platform. People previously using Intel processors, or building their first-ever PCs wouldn't have to worry about yet another component, avoiding the compatibility checks often needed before buying and pairing PC parts with each other. Nowadays, both AMD and Intel seem to have largely moved away from this model, forcing people to exclusively rely on a separate purchase.

Director Yorgos Lanthimos has made a habit of collaborating with Emma Stone specifically on dark comedy dramas with light sci-fi themes, such as 2023's Poor Things and 2024's Kinds of Kindness. And the trailer for their latest team-up, Bugonia, contains much of the same eclecticism, setting up a paranoia thriller that's equal parts about environmentalism and extraterrestrials.

Bugonia, inspired by Korean director Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 sci-fi film, Save The Green Planet!, follows high-powered CEO Michelle (Stone), who is kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists who believe she's an alien tasked with destroying the Earth. While the trailer doesn't reveal much about the strange nature of Stone's kidnappers, the film certainly leans heavily into the sense of paranoia, all of which is paradoxically underscored by Chappell Roan's “Good Luck, Babe!”

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bugonia was initially developed by Hereditary and Midsommar director Ari Aster. As THR notes, this marks one of the rare instances in which Lanthimos will direct a film without having had a role in its early development. Despite not being involved in the initial work on the movie, Lathinmos said he felt drawn to its source material and screenwriter Will Tracy's fresh take on the tale. 

“I was immediately blown away,” Lanthimos said. “I felt it was so funny and entertaining but also extremely impactful and made you really think about things deeply. I immediately was interested in making it. It felt relevant then, three years ago, and even more relevant now, unfortunately.”

Lanthimos didn't have any qualms about the film's prescience when it came to Bugonia‘s environmentalism messaging, THR reports.

“Again, unfortunately, not much of the dystopia in this film is very fictional. A lot of it is very reflective of the real world,” Lanthimos said. “If anything, this film says this is happening now. Actually, it became more relevant as time went by. Humanity is facing a reckoning very soon. People need to choose the right path, otherwise, I don't know how much time [left] with everything that's happening in the world, with technology, AI, with wars, climate change, the denial of all these things and how desensitized we've become to all of these things. [The movie] is more of a reflection of our times and hopefully it will trigger people to think about what's happening today, all around the world.”

Stone described the film as “really fascinating and moving, funny and messed up, and alive.” And her co-star Plemons—another multi-time Lanthimos collaborator— noted that his role as the abrasive character Teddy might not be to everyone's taste. Still, he felt up to the task of making audiences understand and appreciate the character through his performance. 

“My personal belief is, yeah, for some people it might not be the right thing for them to see. Some people that don't like violence shouldn't see these things, but I also think we have an instinct in general to really close the book on things that are scary, that are hard to look at, hard to examine, hard to understand,” Plemons said. “For me as an actor, it is a way that I can try to make sense of some of these things and some of these people who are very difficult to understand. There's a risk in writing them off as being non-human, because they are and they exist.”

Given that the draw of Lanthimos' films is often that they are unsettling and occasionally uncomfortable while also being disarmingly funny, Bugonia is shaping up to be another return to form in a hat trick of sorts between its director and his muses.

Bugonia hits theaters on October 24

Billionaire entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban thinks America's healthcare industry is broken, and he's not mincing words about it.

“No one looks at the financial side of healthcare and says, ‘This is the way it should work,'” Cuban said on this week's episode of the Equity podcast. “When you go to the doctor and you get a prescription . . . you have no idea what the cost to you is going to be. You don't know if you can afford it or not.”

The former “Shark Tank” host and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team explained the root of the problem: Most drug prices today are set by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), or third parties that manage prescription drug programs. Cuban said drug prices are opaque by design.

That's exactly why he launched Cost Plus Drugs in 2022 — to pull back the curtain on drug pricing, bring down costs to the average consumer, and disrupt the traditional pharmacy industry. 

“They price to market; we price based off of cost,” he said. 

The difference is shocking. For example, a generic chemotherapy drug might cost thousands over the counter at a pharmacy, whereas it might cost “$21 from Cost Plus Drugs,” Cuban said. 

Cuban's approach is vastly different from how drugs are traditionally priced in the U.S. As its name suggests, Cost Plus Drugs sells meds directly to consumers at a transparent price — the manufacturer's cost, plus a 15% markup, plus a $5 pharmacy fee, plus shipping. 

“And we're adding the ability to pick it up in a local pharmacy,” Cuban added.

To understand why Cuban's model is disruptive, it helps to know why drugs cost so much in the first place. The industry has defended its practice of overcharging for medication in the U.S. — which is one of the only high-income countries whose government doesn't set or negotiate drug prices — by arguing that without the incentive of high profits, companies couldn't invest the billions of dollars needed to bring new drugs to market.

But critics argue that prices are set to maximize profit and aren't directly tied to R&D costs. One 2021 study found that revenue from the top 20 best-selling drugs alone was enough for companies to wring a return from their R&D costs with billions left over. 

Cuban also pointed out another reason that drug prices skyrocket in the U.S.: artificial shortages. “Believe it or not, in this day and age, there are things like pediatric cancer drugs, Pitocin, sterile water, [and] this long list of drugs I can't even pronounce right, that go in short supply because the manufacturers want them to go in short supply, because that's how they jack up the price,” Cuban said.

While there's limited direct evidence of intentional profiteering, it is true that during shortages, prices rise significantly.

His answer? Build his own factory. Cuban has a manufacturing plant in Dallas that's “all robotics driven.” 

“We created this factory where we can turn over a new drug in four hours and ship it out to hospitals,” he continued. “And so we're starting to attack those shortages.”

While shipping drugs to patients has razor-thin margins, other aspects of Cost Plus Drugs, like drug manufacturing, are more profitable and help the business work toward profitability. Manufacturing is also another way to challenge the drug supply chain.

But Cuban's strategy goes beyond just offering cheaper drugs — he says he's refusing to play by the rules entirely. “Everybody was saying . . . you can't fight these big companies, the insurance carriers, the PBMs,” he said. “I'm like, ‘Well, I just won't work with them. I'm not going to work the way they want to do it, because that's not what's best aligned for patients.”

Even Amazon, Cuban noted, fell into this trap. The tech giant has partnered with PBMs through Amazon Pharmacy, but that puts the big tech firm at a disadvantage because it's still “beholden to PBMs.”

His advice to founders trying to take down incumbents?

“Don't be dependent on them,” he said. “Because if I were 25 and starting this business, I probably would work through the pharmacy benefit managers because that's where the money is. All of healthcare is basically an arbitrage. How can I just get a small percentage of a $5 trillion market through technology, pricing, whatever it may be?”

“When I started out, somebody told me this: ‘When you run with the elephants, there's the quick and the dead,'” Cuban said. “You've got to be quick, or you're going to be dead, and so you've got to be lean, mean. You've got to be able to adapt. You've got to be able to zig and zag and always look for ways to just do better, because it's the whole Innovator's Dilemma thing for [the incumbents], right? They've got to protect their legacy businesses, but they can't move as quickly. They can't react as quickly, and so that's always going to give the founder an edge.”

Google is reportedly preparing to take a more proactive role in defending itself—and potentially other American organizations, U.S. infrastructure, etc.—from hackers.

CyberScoop reported that Google Threat Intelligence Group vice president Sandra Joyce recently revealed that the company is planning to form a "disruption unit" in the coming months. “What we're doing in the Google Threat Intelligence Group is intelligence-led proactive identification of opportunities where we can actually take down some type of campaign or operation,” Joyce said. "We have to get from a reactive position to a proactive one … if we're going to make a difference right now.”

Joyce's revelation arrived at an event hosted by the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law, which published a report titled "To Hack Back, or Not Hack Back? That is the Question … or is it?" in May. Unfortunately the report doesn't offer many answers of its own—it merely asks if the U.S. government should allow the private sector to engage in offensive cyber operations, if non-cyber retaliation would better deter the country's adversaries, and if the focus should instead be on improving cyber defenses.

It's clear in what direction the U.S. government is leaning: the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed in July earmarked $1 billion for offensive cyber operations even as the Trump administration enacted policies that undermined defensive efforts overseen by the likes of the U.S. Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency. That wouldn't necessarily allow companies like Google to contribute to offensive cyber operations, but it does show that such activity is a priority for this administration, at least.

The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" was followed by the Aug. 15 proposal of the "Scam Farms Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025," which, if passed, would "authorize the President of the United States to issue letters of marque and reprisal with respect to acts of aggression against the United States a member of a criminal enterprise or any conspirator associated with an enterprise involved in cybercrimes." (The full text of the bill is available on the official Congress.gov website.)

Modern technology is no stranger to nautical metaphors — illegally procuring digital media is broadly known as "piracy," after all, and we still refer to products as being "flagship." But the Scam Farms Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act would rely on a practice that is quite literally from the "Age of Sail," as Wikipedia puts it, in an effort to discourage international cybercriminals from targeting American organizations. The only thing missing is a provision allowing the use of muskets and cutlasses.

That doesn't necessarily mean that being more proactive in cyber defense (whether or not that includes participation from the private sector) would be ill-advised. The current approach clearly isn't working; cybercriminals regularly target U.S. organizations with ransomware, steal their intellectual property, and in some cases siphon off money used to fund weapons programs. Other nations, meanwhile, frequently target various aspects of America's critical infrastructure.

It seems the U.S. government is ready to change its approach to deterring those attacks, and now it's clear that companies like Google are prepared to support that shift, too. Good idea? Bad idea? We'll see. But either way this is a massive change from the status quo, and if I were the one behind the hopefully metaphorical Guy Fawkes mask, I wouldn't be keen to find out what it looks like when the U.S. government and the companies it's been telling not to "hack back" finally decide to let loose.

What happens when your first 10 hires aren't people at all? At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at San Francisco's Moscone West, we're digging into the new wave of startups replacing or augmenting early employees with AI agents. Think outbound sales, billing, and customer support — automated from day one.

This panel, hosted on the Builders Stage, features a mix of technical founders and seasoned operators who are actually doing it, debating where the line between human and machine should be drawn — and how far is too far.

Caleb Peffer, founder and CEO of Firecrawl, is helping over 350,000 developers (and companies like Shopify and Zapier) plug AI directly into the live web. His dev-first platform is already reshaping how AI agents interact with the internet and scale with clean data.

Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, founder and CEO of Artisan, made waves with his “Stop Hiring Humans” campaign — and he's serious. His company raised $35 million to build AI employees, starting with sales. Expect bold insights on replacing go-to-market teams with code.

Sarah Franklin, CEO of Lattice and former Salesforce president and CMO, brings hard-won wisdom on scaling companies with impact. She's built and led real teams at the highest level and knows exactly where AI helps — and where it hurts.

Whether you're already embedding AI into your stack or just testing prompts on your product team, this conversation is about more than hype. It's about getting real on ROI, trust, team dynamics, and what it means to build a business that moves faster than ever with fewer human hands.

This session is just one of hundreds featured across five industry stages, plus breakouts and roundtables. Grab your pass to Disrupt 2025 before prices jump in mid-September. Get your ticket now.

What appears to be a leaked shipping manifest may have given us the first glimpse at Intel's post-Arrow Lake ambitions.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Yesterday, @x86deadandback posted over on X, what appears to be a Nova Lake-S entry tagged as a pre-qualification sample with a surprising 28-core configuration. If accurate, that would mark a sizable jump over the current top Arrow Lake-S and even Raptor Lake-S parts, both capped at 24 cores. For now, take the news with the relevant dosage of salt.

 




The manifest simply lists a 28-core Nova Lake-S part. While the document doesn't break down the core types, earlier Nova Lake mobile leaks pointed to a potential eight P-core, 16 E-core, and four low-power LP-E core configuration, which could carry over to desktop. Though, this is of course unconfirmed.

While Arrow Lake's Core Ultra 9 285K sticks to the familiar eight P-core, 16 E-core layout, Nova Lake could tack on an additional cluster of efficiency-oriented silicon. The result would be a total of 28 cores (around 36 threads if hyperthreading holds), and a platform shift to a fresh LGA 1954 socket.

This suggests that Intel is moving faster than expected to bulk up its desktop core counts, possibly to counter AMD's Zen 5-based Ryzen 8000 line-up. Arrow Lake has been a solid step forward with Lion Cove and Skymont cores, but on paper, its flagship doesn't dramatically outpace Raptor Lake in raw core/thread counts. Nova Lake, with Coyote Cove and Arctic Wolf cores built on Intel 18A and TSMC's 2nm process, looks like a genuine leap.

Arrow Lake's 285K already brings updated Lion Cove P-cores and Skymont E-cores, but its overall positioning feels incremental. Nova Lake's additional cores, rumored cache upgrades, and next-gen node manufacturing look designed to reclaim ground in multi-threaded workloads, where AMD has pulled ahead.

There are caveats: A 28-core desktop SKU will likely still only carry 8 P-cores, meaning single-threaded gains may come mostly from architectural uplift. And while the leaked TDP tops out around 150 W, Intel's history suggests final turbo power could creep far higher.

Still, if this manifest holds up, Intel's 2026 line-up could be a very different beast from what we've seen in recent years, with Nova Lake representing a true generational leap.

It's always inconvenient to have a different charger for each device to travel with. Your computer desires one, your phone another, and all of a sudden your bag is so heavy it's like carrying a brick with frustratingly knotted cables and big blocks. That's why taking along one charger to do it all is such a relief.

Right now, the Ugreen 65W Nexode GaN charger is on sale on Amazon to a mere $25, its lowest price ever in its entire history compared to its usual $43 (40% off). That's a massive saving for something that will be capable of replacing several of your current chargers simultaneously.

See at Amazon

The best part about this charger is rather simple: instead of needing to carry multiple adapters, you simply need to carry this small block. It has a powerful 65W output so it's able to power more demanding devices like a MacBook and charge it to half in 30 minutes. That is a game-changer if you're rushed and only need to top up and go. For everyday phones like an iPhone, Galaxy, or Pixel, fast charging is expected to get you out of the worry mode about running out of battery sooner.

We also love this model because of the port array: With three USB-C ports and one USB-A, you can charge four devices at once without slowing them down. So, imagine charging your laptop, phone, tablet and wireless earbuds all at once and watching them all hike back to 100%. It's handy for anyone who has to work with multiple devices every day.

This Ugreen charger also uses GaN technology: while the term may sound like something out of the tech lab, the benefit is straightforward. GaN miniaturizes chargers to a smaller, more efficient, safer size compared to old-school silicon. It protects the charger from overheating, saves energy wasted, and prevents your devices from exposure to hazardous fluctuations.

Measuring just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches and with a foldable plug, it's easy to throw in a backpack or even a jacket pocket without worrying about carrying yet another bulky gadget. If you've ever struggled to fit multiple chargers into a power strip or crammed ones with awkward shapes into a small carry-on, you'll appreciate how neatly this block fits without hogging space.

This price won't last long, so it makes sense to grab it now while it's at its all-time low.

Credit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers' personal information.

In a filing with Maine's attorney general's office on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers' personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations.

TransUnion claimed “no credit information was accessed,” but provided no immediate evidence for its claim. The data breach notice did not specify what specific types of personal data were stolen.

In a separate data breach disclosure filed later on Thursday with Texas' attorney general's office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers' names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

When reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company's data breach, or say what types of customers' personally identifiable information were taken. 

TransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the financial data of more than 260 million Americans. It's the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting the insurance, retail, and transportation and airline industries. 

Several companies, including Google, insurance giant Allianz Life, Cisco, and HR giant Workday, reported data breaches of customer data stored in their Salesforce-hosted cloud databases. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters.

It's not clear who is behind the breach at TransUnion, or if the hackers made any demands to the company.

Updated with a response from TransUnion, and updated with additional details from the Texas state filing.

AMD details how it can sell multiple SKUs without the need for more silicon


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Graphics processing units (GPUs) are designed in a way that their performance can be scaled up or down during the design phase, or even after tape-out. AMD's 9000-series, built on RDNA 4 (also known as Navi 4), is no exception. AMD confirmed this during one of its Hot Chips 2025 presentations, and demonstrated how it can cut down the design of its GPUs to produce more SKUs.

All GPUs contain a massive number of similar components, including Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), caches, special-purpose hardware units, controllers, and physical layers (PHYs). So, if a defect occurs during production, the faulty part could be disabled, and the processor may still function correctly. However, it does not mean total flexibility. Some units reuse transistors between them, and others rely on data paths that are integral to neighbouring components. AMD claims it has designed RDNA 4 to be more adaptable than its predecessors, thanks to a feature it calls asymmetric harvesting.

By selectively disabling components, adjustments can be made to memory systems and asymmetric resource allocation. This allows the company to produce higher-end, mid-tier, and specialized GPUs from the same base design, or even the same die.

 




By using this strategy, AMD spawned a smaller Navi 44 (Radeon RX 9060-series) out of the bigger Navi 48 (Radeon RX 9070-series) design by reducing the number of shader engines (SEs), Infinity cache, GDDR6 controllers, and PHYs, but leaving things like the command processor, display engines, media engines, security processor, and other specific things intact. By reusing photomasks from Navi 48, AMD saved on manufacturing costs. In addition to this, AMD built the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 GRE from the full-fat Radeon RX 9070 XT by disabling certain elements, which essentially increased yields and enabled them to hit pricing targets. Such an approach also shortened the relevant GPU's time-to-market, as fewer unique silicon designs required tape out, validation, and production.

The most important element of this strategy is the way a Shader Engine (SE) can be harvested. An SE is a fundamental building block of the GPU, housing multiple Work Group Processors (WGPs), Compute Units (CUs), and fixed-function stages for geometry, rasterization, and rendering. On RDNA 4-based products, AMD allows entire shader engines to be disabled when defects are present or when a lower performance target is desired. In addition to this, AMD may disable specific WGPs, which provides a lot of additional flexibility.

 




Memory harvesting adds another dimension of flexibility. The RDNA 4 memory subsystem contains multiple GDDR6 controllers, linked through Infinity Fabric and cache structures. Each memory controller can be fused off individually, meaning that AMD can reduce the effective bus width in increments of 64 bits.

For instance, a flagship model such as the Radeon RX 9070 XT includes all four shader engines, each featuring 64 compute units (with 4096 stream processors that contain ALUs), and four 64-bit memory interfaces. Meanwhile, the lower-end Radeon 9700 GRE features only three SEs, resulting in 48 CUs and 3072 SPs, and three 64-bit memory arrays, resulting in a 192-bit memory interface.

In addition to whole shader engines, smaller harvesting steps are possible through the selective disabling of work group processors inside a shader engine. This fine control enables AMD to produce products with unusual compute unit counts, such as the 56 CU Radeon RX 9070. Using this method, the Radeon RX 9070 uses a certain number of CUs instead of the whole SE. But it also comes with all memory interfaces enabled, so the RX 9070 has a full-blown 256-bit memory bus.

The concept of asymmetric harvest extends further by enabling different ratios of compute to pixel resources, ensuring that products can be tailored to gaming workloads, multimedia tasks, or compute-centric usage without redesigning the core architecture or die.

For example, the Radeon RX 9070 XT maintains a full 256-bit interface with sixteen gigabytes of memory, while the RX 9070 GRE drops to 192-bit with twelve gigabytes. Mid-range models such as the RX 9060 variants shrink further to 128-bit buses, supporting either sixteen gigabytes or eight gigabytes, depending on the SKU. This granularity allows AMD to respond to memory pricing, availability, and positioning across markets while using the same baseline silicon.

 




At the SoC level, RDNA 4 integrates global L2 cache blocks, compression and decompression hardware, and Infinity Fabric links (operating at 1.5 GHz – 2.50 GHz depending on the load) in a modular fashion. Because these components can handle variable data flows regardless of how many SEs or memory channels remain active, the architecture sustains efficiency, even in harvested configurations.

Centralized compression saves bandwidth and power across workloads, with AMD reporting up to a 25% reduction in fabric traffic, and a claimed 15% uplift in certain rasterization scenarios. This design ensures that whether a die is partially disabled or fully enabled, the supporting infrastructure remains balanced throughout.

Security and reliability features are also embedded within the architecture, which makes the aforementioned flexible configuration possible. By providing robust error handling, AMD can confidently sell partially defective chips as lower-end SKUs without any compromises.

The commercial implications of AMD's asymmetric harvesting approach are significant: so far, the company has built a line-up of seven products for desktop PCs and inference servers using just two processors: the Navi 48 and the Navi 44. In theory, AMD could add four or more RDNA 4 GPUs for notebooks to its line-up, if it were interested in competing in that market.

 




Unfortunately, AMD decided not to pursue the high-end desktop GPU market with its RDNA 4 architecture. If it had developed a high-end RDNA 4-based GPU (by beefing up the command front end and L2 caches and attaching four more SEs, as well as two more memory interfaces), it would have been able to add at least three more products to the line-up and address a lucrative market, which it has seemingly left exclusively to Nvidia.

Nonetheless, asymmetric harvesting assists AMD on both the manufacturing and marketing fronts. By embedding harvesting at multiple levels — from shader engines and work group processors to compute ratios, and memory channels — AMD maximizes output from each wafer, builds products according to market needs, and sustains a consistent feature set across product lines. This makes AMD's GPUs slightly more lucrative for the company, as it helps keep costs manageable, since it increases the number of dies that can be sold.

AMD's successful implementation of its asymmetric harvesting capability will offer the company valuable experience for its next generation architecture, named UDNA. How this will impact RDNA 5 and UDNA 6 GPUs is something that remains to be seen, so stay tuned.

Nvidia and Carbon Robotics' tractor-pulled device is designed to kill large areas of weeds


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia has revealed a surprising partnership with an agricultural robotics company whose flagship product deals out instant laser death to fields full of weeds. The awe-inspiring Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2 packs in 24 high power lasers and 24 Nvidia GPUs to facilitate its claimed “10,000 weeds per minute” zapping performance. That's equivalent to 600,000 weeds per hour, or 167 weeds per second.

Though the claimed performance is amazing, we aren't talking about a compact, home garden-style device here. The flagship LaserWeeder G2 600 is a hulking tractor-pulled device spanning 20 feet. We note there are G2 models smaller than this flagship, but even the smallest G2 200 model is 110 x 85 x 127-inches and requires at least a 110hp tractor with 6,500 lbs lift capacity. The cut down size of the G2 200 reduces performance to 2,500 weeds per minute, which remains impressively rapid and equivalent to nearly 42 weeds per second.

Carbon Robotics is of course very positive about the qualities and performance of an AI and laser-powered weed control system. It highlights the trend of weeds becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides. It touts the sub-millimeter precision and identification accuracy of the Nvidia-accelerated ‘Large Plant Model' weed identification system, which ensures your crops don't fall to friendly fire. The robotics device is also a massive labor saver, outperforming “a hand crew of 75 people,” according to the product pages for the G2 600 model.

Interestingly, Carbon Robotics also aims to address the “global shortage of tractor drivers.” It is an autonomous retrofit for existing tractors, says the Nvidia blog. It can thus work long and ungodly hours. For extra safety, these autonomous tractors are said to be monitored via a remote operations center.

There are some downsides to devices like the G2, though. Such robotic machinery surely comes with a lofty price tag. Including the Nvidia GPUs and laser tech probably makes this tractor-pulled tech much more expensive than traditional farming machinery.

Also, those with experience of using devices which burn weeds will be aware that if a root survives, it sometimes doesn't take very long for it to spring right back up. Lastly, there is some added hazard here, due to the laser technology inadvertently injuring someone's eyes or skin. In arid areas, there may also be concerns about fires propagating from the fields to the surrounding countryside.

If you want to make a difference, try to communicate with someone from OEM companies. Google is making their phones inferior and they'll loose money and market share because of it.After this change, "I can install NewPipe and Ad blockers" will become a major selling point for Chinese phones among large and profitable segments of the population. And that high-end manufacturers might as well give up and let Apple take that part of the market. If OEMs can be made to understand that, that's going to be the end of this initiative.

You're correct, but for the wrong reasons. Privacy framings don't work because people who care about privacy are unusually politically nihilistic and/or lazy. I've worked on privacy legislation. I've also worked on other laws. Nobody calls or writes about the former. With the latter, it was almost trivial to demonstrate to the elected that there was real political capital in embracing the issue.

reply

The special interest of a particular group always result in far more intense support than any law that benefits the public at large. And privacy is usually a general concern.Also, am I the only one who finds the idea that you need to demonstrate the existence of political capital to elected politicians concerning? (As opposed to persuading them that it's the right thing to do.) I don't want to sidetrack the whole discussion, but this makes me doubt the future of western democracy in a hundred different ways.

Sure. OP didn't ever reject the developers' arguments. He's criticising their methods for activism. But, even if OP were attacking their arguments:OP doesn't reject the developers' methods (remember, their arguments are never contested) because of who is speaking, but how. To the extent it could be mistaken for ad hominem, it would be in tone policing, but that's not what you said and it is not true because OP was citing Apple's language, as evidenced by the quotes.Appeal to corporate omniscience is not a fallacy. (And OP doesn't cite Google as evidence for their arguments, so no appeal to authority.)Circular reasoning doesn't apply, even to your example, because complaints not mattering doesn't cause Google to expect them.False dichotomy does not apply because OP never argued any dichotomy. The closest they came was hyperbolic language (“perfectly” and “completely and fully”). But that's closer to modal scope than any dichotomy, possibly fallacy of necessity since it implies future limits.Arguments rarely require citing the formal or informal fallacy invoked. Instead, just respond to the argument. This is a great case of AI corrupting a discussion through derailment and false confidence.

Not really. You should have learned by now that jumping into a conversation on the internet with the wikipedia "list of logical fallacies" page open on the other half of the screen and then vaguely ascribing aspects of a comment to a cherry-picked list of fallacies basically only ever results in people making fun of you.I don't even think that would fly on reddit. People have been making fun of that style of response since IRC. If anybody is bad at anything, it's you at understanding how to have a productive conversation on an internet forum.

It's great to see that some more people who were previously complacent are outraged about this move. But let's look back a bit:In the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds started writing an OS kernel for 386-class PCs. He didn't need the approval of some corporation to allow him to run code on his own machine, or distribute it for others to run on theirs. The code didn't have to run as an "app" in some restricted sandbox under Microsoft's OS (not that back then, DOS or Windows were even in any way locked down the way modern operating systems are). Documentation for all the "standard" hardware like video, keyboard, hard disks, etc. was openly available, so it didn't have to rely on proprietary drivers.This is how it was at one time, and what should have remained the standard today, but instead it's turned into some utopian dream that those who grew up with "smart" devices can't even conceive as possible anymore.Google has taken what became of this code, and turned it into an "open" system that is pretty much designed to track every aspect of people's lives in order to more effectively target them with psychological manipulation, which is what advertisements really are. And you're not really getting "free stuff" in return for this invasion either, since pretty much everything you buy includes a hidden "tax" that goes to support this massive industry."A supercomputer in everyone's pocket"? Yes, but it's not yours, nor can you even know what it does. Even the source code that is available is millions of lines that you couldn't inspect in all your lifetime. Online 24/7, with GPS tracking your every move and a microphone that listens to what you say. Every URL you visit is logged. Your photos uploaded to "the cloud" and used to train AI.The only solution is to no longer accept any of this, even if almost everyone else does. Even if it means giving up some convenience.Google has to be destroyed.

The code didn't have to run as an "app" in some restricted sandbox under Microsoft's OS (not that back then, DOS or Windows were even in any way locked down the way modern operating systems are). Documentation for all the "standard" hardware like video, keyboard, hard disks, etc. was openly available, so it didn't have to rely on proprietary drivers.This is how it was at one time, and what should have remained the standard today, but instead it's turned into some utopian dream that those who grew up with "smart" devices can't even conceive as possible anymore.Google has taken what became of this code, and turned it into an "open" system that is pretty much designed to track every aspect of people's lives in order to more effectively target them with psychological manipulation, which is what advertisements really are. And you're not really getting "free stuff" in return for this invasion either, since pretty much everything you buy includes a hidden "tax" that goes to support this massive industry."A supercomputer in everyone's pocket"? Yes, but it's not yours, nor can you even know what it does. Even the source code that is available is millions of lines that you couldn't inspect in all your lifetime. Online 24/7, with GPS tracking your every move and a microphone that listens to what you say. Every URL you visit is logged. Your photos uploaded to "the cloud" and used to train AI.The only solution is to no longer accept any of this, even if almost everyone else does. Even if it means giving up some convenience.Google has to be destroyed.

I know it's hard to remember today, but in 2007, Apple was still the perennially-"beleaguered" underdog whose only big success story in marketshare terms was the iPod.If the public had not loved the iPhone, it never could have "normalized" anything.There are definitely aspects of the iPhone that it is fair to criticize Apple for. The rest of the world's wholesale embrace of its design—to the point of slavishly copying it, for several manufacturers at different points in time—can only be blamed on their lack of imagination and willingness to take risks, and on the public's unwillingness to give up the benefits of the iPhone just to get the much-less-obvious benefits of something more "open" or different.

Only because those alternative mobile OSes were, frankly, crappy in comparison to iOS and Android.I don't recall Google or Apple doing anything particularly anticompetitive to cause any of those OSes to fail to keep up in the market, aside from just plain "being the 800lb gorillas in the room". (Not saying they never do anything anticompetitive, just that those particular market failures can't be laid at their feet.)It would be great to have some really good alternatives to the mobile duopoly. Hell, if we had more fragmentation in the market, that would even lead to more impetus for interoperability and common standards—which we desperately need more of everywhere in tech these days. But those three, in particular? They lost because they were worse at being a good mobile OS for most people.

Under the CRA, smartphones are considered to be much more critical from a security standpoint and, by the end of 2027, will have to follow an enhanced set of “best practices” to be able to enjoy a presumption of conformity.  The best practices are due to be published by December of this year.  I think Google already knows that developer attestations will be on that list and want to appear proactive instead of reactive.The point still stands - the DMA does not exist in a vacuum.  Other EU laws affect how you interpret it, and you should assume that the EU will pass more laws in the future that also affect how you interpret it.

- The requirement, unless I'm mistaken, would tie a real-world identity of the developer to an app, who may wish to keep that separate from a pseudonym they may normally release things with.- Unwillingness to give Google PII or just not tie a particular pseudonymous identity to that PII on Google.- It puts absolute control in Google's hands for whether any app is allowed to run on most devices. There may be concerns about the types of decisions that may arise from this, not merely from recognized malware. Certain governments may ask Google to regulate apps allowed on such devices via this approach.- Once this globally rolls out in 2027 it will mean the audience for apps from devs who don't agree to this will shrink dramatically. Only those presumably with AOSP based custom ROMs will be able to use those apps which may have a knock-on effect for dev motivation.

You don't need an ID to find the person behind an IP address + timestamp. The line physically goes to a subscriber (yes, also with CGNAT: ISPs are required to keep logs for a reason).

The moment they use IPs to find devs and prosecute them , every malware dev will just use a vpn or Tor. or just use a compromised device to route their connection.

It's a nightmare scenario, our lives locked in to total corporate control. What do we get in return for that? Scammers won't be stopped by this, the key to grifting isn't technology but people. What you're suggesting is trading open platforms and open source and fortifying current marketplace monopolies for a marginal decrease in scams. For a while. Maybe. I suggest that is unbelievably stupid.

And if we're at it, we should maybe also put camera's and microphones in everybody's houses so we can see what everyone's doing all the time, because many children are being hurt in houses you know.But don't worry, if you don't want all of this you can just get this degoogled phone just around the corner and it works perfect you know, because everybody is using them and there's a big market for it and it's very easy to use.Or maybe not

When you sell physical goods, you have to have a business license right? To a small group of people you know, nobody cares. But to mass market goods or services, you need to give the government your id, and they need to be able to hold you accountable, in the event you decide to break the law and/or harm the public.I think this is something governments should have enforced long ago.

An accident report has revealed that a U.S. Air Force pilot spent 50 minutes on a conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers ahead of his plane plummeting to the ground and exploding in a fireball. Thankfully, the unnamed pilot ejected safely with just minor injuries, reports CNN, but the $200 million F-35 fighter jet was destroyed.

This incident took place on January 28, near Eielson Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. Investigations point towards the presence of water in hydraulic lines as the root cause of this military jet crash. But the investigator's report also suggests the pilot and engineering team's handling of the landing gear issue could have been better.

Shortly after take-off, the pilot ran into an issue with the F-35. The landing gear wouldn't retract correctly, so he sought to lower it again, but it then became locked at an angle, neither retracted nor correctly lowered… Running through operational check lists didn't remedy the situation.

Sensing the need for assistance, the pilot then decided to consult the experts. He managed to get a group of five Lockheed Martin engineers (the F-35's makers) to participate in a conference call. According to CNN's viewing of the incident report, five engineers were on the call: “a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three specialists in landing gear systems.”

We can't be sure of the advice given, but next in the chain of dramatic events was the pilot attempting two ‘touch and go' landings. During these procedures, the idea was to try and straighten out the landing gear. However, the nose wheel still couldn't be straightened.

Things actually got worse after the two dummy landing attempts. CNN notes that the left and right main landing gears also froze along with the nose wheel.

Now, flying the plane with multiple system errors was bad enough, but the plane then became “uncontrollable” as it started to operate in “automated ground-operation mode.”

Without proper flying mode power or controls, the pilot thus made the decision to eject. The pilot suffered a few minor injuries, but the $200m plane ended up in a fireball.

On inspection of the wreckage, the hydraulic system appears to have mistakenly been partly filled with water (a third of the fluid present). There should have been no water in these lines due to the extremely low temperatures aircraft endure at altitudes. CNN notes that on the day of the flight, the ground temperature was an already chilly -1 degree Fahrenheit (about -17 degrees Celsius).

Another F-35 at the same base was flown 9-days later, and suffered a similar hydraulic icing issue – but it was able to land safely.

Focusing back on the headlining fireball incident, and the Air Force's Accident Investigation Board concluded a mix of “crew decision making” and hydraulic fluid maintenance programs contributed to the crash.

This might seem harsh on the pilot and engineers. However, the engineers reportedly talked about a 2024 maintenance update during the conference call. If they had followed this updated guidance, then “they likely would have advised a planned full stop landing or a controlled ejection instead of a second touch-and-go,” says the report.

The world's largest living fish has plenty to fear from people. New research shows that a large proportion of whale sharks at a popular and protected tourism region bear scars caused by human activity.

A large group of marine scientists examined more than a decade's worth of whale shark sightings in the Bird's Head Seascape off Indonesia. Among other things, they found that over half of the sharks had injuries attributable to humans. Many of these injuries were preventable, the researchers say, and simple measures can be taken to ensure the safety of these gentle giants moving forward.

“[The] high percentage of injured whale sharks shows that even in protected zones, the whale shark interactions with fishing gear and tourism still pose risks to them,” study author Edy Setyawan, lead conservation scientist at the Elasmobranch Institute Indonesia, told Gizmodo.

Befitting its nickname, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is certainly hefty.

As adults, they commonly reach lengths between 30 and 40 feet (9 and 12 meters) and usually weigh around 18 tons; some get even larger. Despite their size, though, they're no ferocious sea monster. These slow-moving fish are filter feeders that suck up their meals from the surrounding water. Though they can eat large and small marine organisms alike, they typically stick to microscopic plankton.

Whale sharks can be found in warm and tropical waters all over the world, but their numbers have dwindled dramatically in recent decades, and they're classified as an endangered species. They face several human-made threats, including hunting, climate change, and bycatching (being unintentionally caught by fishing boats). And even with ongoing conservation efforts, their recovery has been slow, partly because it can take up to 30 years for the sharks to reach sexual maturity.

According to Edy Setyawan, previous studies looking at the population health of these sharks have been limited to short-term surveys or snapshots of a single location. In their new research, the team was able to analyze 13 years of sightings along the Bird's Head Seascape (2010 to 2023) from four regions of the area.

The seascape is well known for its diversity and is estimated to contain three-quarters of the world's coral species along with many other migrating species like the whale shark. The seascape is a popular destination for marine tourism and is covered by a network of 26 different Marine Protected Areas.

Though the researchers largely studied past data they themselves collected, they also relied on photos captured by tourism operators and citizen scientists. All told, they identified 268 unique whale sharks. Roughly 200 of these sharks sported visible injuries, they found. And of these, 80% had injuries determined to be human-caused (58.3% had injuries from natural causes, while some sharks had both).

On the positive side, severe injuries, including amputation, caused by humans were relatively rare (17.7%). The most common human-associated injuries were caused by sharks colliding into boats and bagans—floating platforms adorned with nets and lights used for fishing.

The team's findings were published Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science.

Fishing and marine tourism are important parts of the local economy, including whale shark sighting tours. And while the increasing popularity of these tours could lead to more injured sharks, the researchers argue this doesn't have to be inevitable.

They lay out simple steps that can greatly cut down on whale shark injuries, such as stricter regulations that would compel bagan fishers and owners to remove the sharp edges from their platforms. Tourism-related measures, like limiting boat traffic, enforcing slow-speed zones, and promoting responsible diving and snorkeling practices, would further reduce harm, Setyawan said.

Not all the team's findings are dire. They've learned a lot about these majestic aquatic beasts, including the main regions they reside within the seascape. Most of the sharks found there were also young juvenile males, suggesting the area is an important nursery habitat for the species.

They next plan to track the annual population trends of whale sharks living in the seascape via satellite tags, which should also help them answer important questions like whether these populations migrate elsewhere.

Researchers at Wayne State University are pursuing new therapies for treating chemical injuries to the eyes with the help of a two-year, $400,400 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, a research scientist in the laboratory of Dr. Ashok Kumar, professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences at Wayne State University's School of Medicine, has been awarded the grant, "Harnessing Immunometabolism to Ameliorate the Pathology of Ocular Chemical Injuries," to support innovative studies into developing novel therapies to enhance corneal nerve repair and promote wound healing after ocular chemical injury - a pressing issue among military personnel exposed to harmful substances in combat and training environments.

Ocular chemical injuries can lead to chronic inflammation, corneal nerve damage, persistent pain, dry eye and even permanent vision loss. Unfortunately, current treatment options are often inadequate, offering only partial relief and sometimes leading to undesirable side effects."

Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, research scientist

Singh's research aims to overcome these challenges by investigating the therapeutic potential of host-derived metabolites to reduce inflammation, promote corneal nerve regeneration and enhance wound healing.

"This project will serve as a proof of concept for leveraging endogenous metabolites to modulate immune responses and lessen disease severity following chemical injury," Singh explained. "By reprogramming immune cells and enhancing tissue repair, we aim to develop effective strategies to preserve vision and improve patient outcomes."

The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating immunometabolism, cell biology and advanced drug delivery technologies. One of its central innovations is the use of hydrogel-based platforms for delivering therapeutic metabolites. Compared to conventional eye drops, hydrogels provide sustained release, improved bioavailability and reduced dosing frequency - crucial advantages in field conditions with limited access to medical care.

"In the long term, this work has the potential to yield clinically translatable treatments that not only preserve vision but also lessen the emotional and economic burden on service members, their families and the broader health care system," said Kumar, who serves as the project's co-investigator.

"Department of Defense funding for health-related research is critical to ensure the health and welfare of our country's service members," said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "I look forward to seeing the results of this important research by Drs. Singh and Kumar, which aims to create novel treatment options that will be useful not only to those in the military, but others facing similar ocular injuries."

The award number for this grant from the U.S. Department of Defense is HT94252510634.

Traumatic injuries of the central nervous system (CNS)-such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI)-are characterized by oxidative damage and neuroinflammation. Current treatment relies mainly on supportive care and surgical intervention, with a lack of effective drugs to directly target the underlying damage.

For example, neural stem cell (NSC)-based therapy has shown therapeutic potential, but pathological microenvironments negatively impact NSC survival and directed differentiation, compromising therapeutic outcomes. Similarly, antioxidant treatment has limited success because most antioxidants don't efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Now, however, researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, have developed a novel exosome-based therapeutic agent for treating traumatic CNS injuries. This treatment can alleviate neuronal apoptosis, restore glial homeostasis, and remodel glia-neuron networks, offering potent therapeutic benefits in murine (mouse) TBI and SCI models.

The study was published in Cell Reports Medicine.

Understanding that NSC therapy involves cell-to-cell communication via exosomes-nanosized vesicles secreted by cells, including NSCs-the researchers proposed using NSC-derived exosomes (NExo) to treat CNS injury, since the exosomes are stable and remain medically active in the pathological microenvironment.

The researchers also understood that exosome-based therapy needed to address oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microenvironment.

Inspired by selenium's capacity to scavenge ROS, the researchers developed an advanced NExo containing ultrasmall nano-selenium (~3.5 nm) via lipid-mediated nucleation (SeNExo).

Prof. MA Guanghui from IPE said that SeNExo penetrated the BBB via the APOE_LRP-1 interaction after intravenous injection. Upon efficiently reaching the lesion site, the ultrasmall nano-selenium effectively scavenged ROS, while NExo promoted neuronal repair.

In a mouse TBI model, SeNExo reduced cerebral lesions and improved spatial learning and memory functions. Through proteomics, miRNA omics, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, the researchers demonstrated that SeNExo significantly downregulated the expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis in neurons. In addition, SeNExo profoundly altered the transcriptional program of inflammatory responses, promoting glial cells toward homeostasis. Moreover, SeNExo enhanced neuron-glia ligand-receptor pairs involved in CNS development while suppressing those associated with inflammation and astrogliosis. In a mouse SCI model, SeNExo also promoted locomotor recovery.

Both Prof. TAN Hui from Shenzhen Children's Hospital and LI Weiping from Shenzhen Second People's Hospital support the concept that SeNExo is a novel and promising therapeutic agent for treating traumatic CNS injury.

One peer reviewer from Cell Report Medicine said that the study provides convincing evidence that SeNExo can protect the brain following TBI and potentially SCI.

Prof. WEI Wei from IPE said that SeNExo offers excellent biocompatibility and stability. He also noted that its potent therapeutic efficacy and safety highlight its promising translational potential for developing clinically relevant CNS injury treatments.

PFAs, also known as 'forever chemicals', account for nearly 9,000 different chemicals, some of which are already prohibited or heavily regulated. Their extensive use has left a lasting mark on both the environment and public health.

The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) are reviewing PFAs risks to guide REACH UK on potential updates to chemical safety laws.

Ensuring the safety of our food remains a fundamental public health priority. Experts say wider quality and safety checks are needed on more food products as shifting industrial processes alter environmental conditions.

Research has connected PFA exposure to cancer and to harmful effects on the immune, reproductive, and hormonal systems.

Since the 1960s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized some PFAs in food packaging for their non-stick, grease-proof, and water-resistant properties. The highest PFA concentrations are often found in molded fiber packaging such as takeaway bowls, plates, and food boxes.

The United States has passed more PFA laws than most other countries, including the United Kingdom. To improve food safety, the FDA introduced an official testing method (C-010.01) to detect PFAs in a variety of foods. This method was changed in December 2021 to version C-010.02.

In this regard, a useful Application Note for Method C-010.02 has been published. The updated C-010.02 method offers a fast, reliable way to measure PFAs in foods from dairy to baked goods, eggs, and vegetables.

Tired of the limits that come with purchasing conventional reference materials from stock catalogs? Sifting through endless catalogue pages with varying concentrations and matrices wastes valuable time, with no guarantee of finding the standard you need.

Many chemists avoid the tedious process entirely, instead mixing their own analytical standards in-house. However, this approach adds extra workload and considerable risk.

Luckily, there is a better solution. Custom certified reference materials (CRMs) from Inorganic Ventures are a simpler and faster approach to obtain the appropriate analytical standard reference material for your unique use case. Inorganic Ventures always encourages its clients to share the responsibility for establishing calibration standards.

Allow Inorganic Ventures to handle the burden of creating custom analytical standards depending on your specific requirements. This saves time and removes the risks of blending standards by hand.

Not sure that custom CRMs outperform analytical standards mixed in-house? Here are six reasons why you should trust Inorganic Ventures to create calibration solutions for your workflow rather than blending them yourself.

Combining single-element analytical standards into a viable solution requires both resources and time. Consider the administrative, equipment, and human costs of stocking and measuring reorder points per solution. These costs mount quickly into a significant ongoing expense.

Inorganic Ventures' analytical standards ensure that you pay only for what you need, making inventory management much easier. Its CRMs are ready for instant use without any additional preparation, and each standard can be diluted directly from the bottle.

When creating your own calibration standards, you are always responsible for providing verification.

Labs held to strict testing specifications must continuously ensure that every standard is generated to the highest possible standards. This requires a high level of confidence and organization. An audit can turn this into a high-pressure test of record-keeping.

With a custom CRM, all regulatory documents, including CoA and SDS, are prepared for you and ready for inspection. Its standards are manufactured and certified in accordance with ISO 17025 and ISO 17034 Scopes.

To err is human, and even experienced scientists make mistakes. When mixing analytical standards in-house, you will inevitably second-guess the validity of your data. Unfortunately, there is no margin for error in the analytical sector.

Mixing errors, whether in amounts, matrix composition, or other factors, can quickly undermine accuracy.

Common human errors that can jeopardize DIY standards include: 

Transpiration can progressively raise the concentration of your analytical standards over time. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this phenomenon when combining your own working standards in-house, as it is caused by water vapor penetration into the mixture, either through container walls or through the opening.

Inorganic Ventures' proprietary packaging technology minimizes transpiration, preserving CRM integrity for years. Transpiration Control Technology (TCT) prevents transpiration from the bottle by creating an equilibrium within the heat-sealed container.

Analytical standards packaged in this manner keep their integrity for up to four years after manufacturing.

Products can be stored in the TCT bag for up to three years, and then for another year after removal. The time and expense savings associated with regular inventory refilling are completely removed, thus alleviating your storage worries.

Analytical standards must be delivered in ultra-clean bottles, and the CRM is prepared using sterile laboratory equipment and clean beginning materials. It is possible to reproduce these stringent cleaning conditions in your own lab, but this is just another example of the work and cost implications of mixing calibration standards oneself.

The Inorganic Ventures team conducted comprehensive leaching experiments to determine contamination levels in all materials used to produce the CRMs. The team obtain the cleanest components (beginning materials, weigh boats, pipettes, bottles, and so on) and correctly leach them all to achieve the cleanest final analytical standard possible. 

Inorganic Ventures also has a separate clean room with a HEPA filtration system and ultra-high purity acids for manufacture. This safeguards against environmental contamination at every stage. 

If your results are incorrect, it might be incredibly difficult to identify the cause of the error. Simple mistakes, such as going over volume, will necessitate boiling the concentrate, usually in glass, which may introduce more pollutants. The only solution is to start afresh.

Despite advances in insulin therapy and automated delivery systems, people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) still face a daily struggle: manually dosing insulin before meals. Current insulin options - rapid-acting or ultra-rapid analogs - are too slow to match the body's natural insulin response, making full automation elusive.

A new research project at Wayne State University, supported by a $300,000 grant from Breakthrough T1D International, aims to change that. Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, is developing a next-generation ultra-rapid insulin designed to dramatically accelerate insulin action and remove the need for user input at mealtime.

Our goal is to create an insulin that acts fast enough to truly mimic the human pancreas. When combined with advanced insulin delivery algorithms, this could make fully automated systems a reality and help patients manage their condition with fewer interruptions to daily life."

Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, Wayne State University

By addressing the limitations of current insulin analogs in terms of speed, onset and duration, the project has the potential to significantly improve glycemic control and reduce the burden of disease management for people with T1D.

Since joining Wayne State in 2013, Cao has received more than $6 million in external funding for diabetes-related research, including multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health and Breakthrough T1D.

Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State, praised the project's potential and the university's role in advancing human health through translational research.

"Type 1 diabetes affects millions of individuals and families, often beginning in childhood," said Obasi. "Dr. Cao's research is critical in helping to move us closer to an improved treatment that will bring new hope to those living with the disease. This funding underscores the importance of sustained investment in research to impact lives now and in the future."

Dr. Ali Abolmaali, dean of the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, said Cao's work exemplifies the college's commitment to solving real-world health challenges.

"This project is a testament to how engineering research can directly improve lives," said Abolmaali. "We're proud to support faculty like Dr. Cao, whose work bridges science, medicine and technology to serve the public good."

Breakthrough T1D International is a leading global funder of T1D research, supporting projects that accelerate the development of treatments and technologies to improve the lives of people affected by the disease.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. A key reason for its high death toll is that it often goes undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Although modern colonoscopy has greatly improved the early detection of precancerous lesions, determining which ones are likely to become cancerous remains a challenge-especially during the procedure itself. A new study published in Biophotonics Discovery may offer a promising solution.

A team led by researchers at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal tested an advanced imaging method that uses the natural glow (or autofluorescence) of tissues when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Importantly, this approach doesn't require any dyes or contrast agents. By analyzing how long this autofluorescence lasts-called "fluorescence lifetime"-the researchers could detect subtle differences in the tissue's biochemistry. Combined with machine learning, this label-free method could distinguish benign from malignant lesions in real time.

The researchers collected fresh tissue samples from 117 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. They scanned each specimen using a fiber-optic probe and a dual-laser autofluorescence lifetime system, which illuminated the tissue at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 445 nm) to excite various molecules like collagen and cellular coenzymes. This setup captured data from multiple optical channels, tracking how each type of tissue responded to the light over time. These measurements were then matched to pathology diagnoses to serve as training data for an AI-based classification model.

Using an ensemble learning technique known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), the model was trained to recognize patterns in the spectroscopic data that correspond to benign or cancerous tissue. On the training set, the model achieved 87 percent accuracy, with a sensitivity (true positive rate) of 83 percent and a specificity (true negative rate) of 90 percent. When tested on a separate set of new samples, the model performed almost as well, with 85 percent accuracy, 85 percent sensitivity, and 85 percent specificity.

In practical terms, this means the system was able to identify cancerous tissues with high reliability based only on their autofluorescence signatures. Even when applied to individual measurement points-rather than larger tissue regions-the model generated useful probability maps that highlighted tumor areas. These findings suggest that the technology could one day guide doctors during colonoscopy or surgery, helping them decide which lesions to remove and where to focus their attention.

The study also investigated whether the complex imaging system could be simplified without sacrificing accuracy. The results showed that using a reduced set of optical channels-focusing on the most informative biochemical signals-still produced strong performance, potentially lowering the cost and complexity of future clinical devices.

Although more work is needed to improve accuracy, especially for early or borderline lesions, and to expand testing to larger and more diverse patient groups, this research marks an important step toward integrating real-time, AI-guided optical diagnostics into routine colorectal cancer care. It could eventually help reduce unnecessary biopsies, shorten procedures, and ensure that dangerous lesions aren't missed.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition with significant health implications worldwide. In Nigeria, data on its prevalence and characteristics are limited, highlighting the need for comprehensive studies to better understand its epidemiology and clinical features in the region. This study aimed to assess the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and management challenges of IBD among patients undergoing colonoscopy in Nigeria.

Over five years (2019–2024), a multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted involving clinicians across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. It included a retrospective review of records from 18 centers. Data collection was conducted in two phases via Google Forms, focusing on care practices and detailed case information, including demographics, clinical features, histology, and treatment. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and tests for associations, with significance set at p < 0.05.

A total of 459 suspected IBD cases (9.7%) were identified among over 4,700 colonoscopies, with histological confirmation in 208 cases (4.4%), indicating the prevalence of IBD in the Nigerian patient population. The most common subtype was ulcerative colitis (53.9%), followed by Crohn's disease (21.0%) and indeterminate colitis (25.0%). Regional variations were observed, with higher diagnosis rates in some zones (North-West: 14.9%; South-East: 1.4%). The predominant clinical feature was rectal bleeding. Endoscopic findings frequently showed pan-colitis (62%), with significant regional differences (p < 0.001), and management mainly involved medications such as acetylsalicylic acid derivatives (60.0%), with surgical options rarely employed (0.6%). Challenges included high medication costs and limited availability, which affected nearly half of the patients (49.4%; 46.2%).

The findings of this multicenter survey illuminate the pressing issues surrounding IBD in Nigeria, drawing attention to its prevalence, complex clinical presentations, and significant management challenges. The data reveal critical similarities and differences compared to findings in West Africa, other regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The lower prevalence in Nigeria and other African studies reflects unique genetic and environmental factors influencing IBD development. Demographic trends indicate a younger population affected by IBD in Nigeria, consistent with regional observations. However, disparities in clinical presentations, treatment modalities, and barriers to care highlight broader challenges within the Nigerian healthcare system that warrant urgent attention.

Food allergies affect more than half a billion people worldwide. In severe cases, even a small bite of the wrong food can trigger anaphylaxis - a rapid, body-wide allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, a dangerous drop in blood pressure and even death.

Scientists have long understood how injected allergens - like those in lab tests or insect stings - trigger anaphylaxis. But researchers have puzzled over how anaphylaxis begins in the gut after eating a food allergen.

Now, Arizona State University researchers, in collaboration with a team led by Yale University and other partners, have pinpointed a surprising culprit: specialized immune cells in the intestine that produce powerful chemical messengers.

These chemical messengers can cause muscles in the airways and gut to contract, increase mucus production and boost inflammation. They're already known to play a role in asthma attacks. This study shows they are also key drivers of severe food allergy reactions that start in the gut.

The findings, published in the current issue of Science, reveal that reactions to allergens in the gut are fundamentally different from reactions to allergens entering the bloodstream directly.

Until now, we assumed that anaphylaxis followed the same pathway regardless of where allergens entered the body, with histamine from mast cells as the main driver. Our study shows that when allergens are ingested, a specialized set of mast cells in the gut don't release histamine - instead, they produce lipid-based molecules called leukotrienes. These molecules, rather than histamine, trigger anaphylaxis in the gastrointestinal tract."

Esther Borges Florsheim, ASU researcher 

Florsheim is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes and assistant professor with the School of Life Sciences at ASU. 

In both food and systemic allergies, immune cells called mast cells play a central role. When these cells detect an allergen via antibodies called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, they burst open, releasing chemicals that cause swelling, low blood pressure and other symptoms.

In the bloodstream, the most important of these chemicals is histamine, which is why antihistamines can help in some allergic situations. However, the new research shows that when an allergen is ingested, mast cells in the intestinal lining respond differently. They make relatively little histamine. Instead, they ramp up production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of inflammatory lipids already known to constrict airways in conditions like asthma.

In the gut lining, intestinal mast cells take cues from nearby epithelial cells. These cues shift the cells' activity, so they make more leukotrienes and less histamine. Detailed genetic and chemical analyses showed that intestinal mast cells come in several subtypes. Compared to mast cells elsewhere in the body, mast cells in the gut were primed to make leukotrienes.

Previous research found that blocking the IgE pathway - either by removing IgE antibodies or the receptor they bind to on mast cells - protected against developing severe symptoms. 

To test whether leukotrienes were truly driving the reaction, the team used zileuton, an FDA-approved drug used to treat asthma, which blocks a crucial enzyme needed to make leukotrienes. 

The results showed the drug reduced allergy symptoms and provided protection from a dangerous drop in body temperature - a hallmark of anaphylaxis.

Importantly, the same drug did not prevent reactions caused by allergens injected into the bloodstream. That finding showed that the gut pathway is different from the whole-body allergic pathway and has its own chemical drivers.

Current emergency treatments for severe allergic reactions, such as epinephrine, are aimed at quickly reversing symptoms once anaphylaxis starts. Antihistamines can help in mild reactions, but they are far less effective for preventing severe events - especially those triggered by food.

The new findings suggest that targeting leukotrienes could offer a new preventive or therapeutic approach for food-triggered anaphylaxis. 

More research is still needed to test whether the results from this study can be applied to humans. However, drugs that block leukotriene production (like zileuton) or leukotriene receptors (such as montelukast, also commonly used for asthma) are already approved for other uses, which could speed up testing for food allergy applications.

Beyond the potential clinical applications, the work changes how scientists think about allergic reactions. It shows that how an allergen gets into the body - through the skin, bloodstream or gut - can shape the type of immune response involved.

"This finding highlights the gut as unique in how it senses allergens and potentially other harmful environmental challenges, such as food additives," Florsheim says. "It also helps explain a long-standing puzzle: why levels of food-specific antibodies, especially IgE, do not reliably predict the risk of food allergy."

The researchers plan to follow up by studying whether similar mast cell populations and leukotriene-driven pathways exist in human intestines, and whether blocking them can reduce or prevent severe reactions in people with life-threatening food allergies.

For women diagnosed with early breast cancer, the long-term risk of developing a second primary cancer is low (around 2-3% greater than women in the general population), finds a study published by The BMJ today.

The researchers say this information can help reassure many breast cancer survivors who believe their risk of a second primary cancer is much higher than these results suggest.

Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers, but risk estimates from previous studies are inconsistent. The risk and type of a second cancer can also be affected by the initial treatment received, as well as social, lifestyle and genetic factors.

To address this uncertainty, researchers used data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service for England to estimate the long-term risks of second primary cancers compared with the general population, and the various factors associated with these risks.

Their findings are based on 476,373 women diagnosed in England from 1993 to 2016 with early invasive breast cancer at ages 20-75 years who underwent surgery.

Over a follow-up period of up to 20 years, 64,747 women developed a second primary cancer, but the absolute excess risks compared with risks in the general population were small. 

By 20 years, 13.6% of women had developed a non-breast cancer (mainly womb, lung or bowel cancer), 2.1% more than expected in the general population, and 5.6% had developed a contralateral breast cancer (on the other side of the body), 3.1% more than expected.

When patients were grouped by age at first breast cancer diagnosis, the excess risk of a second non-breast cancer varied little across age groups. However, the excess risk of a contralateral breast cancer was greater in younger than in older women.

For example, for a woman whose first breast cancer was diagnosed when aged 60, her estimated risks of developing a new cancer by the age of 80 are 17% for non-breast cancer and 5% for contralateral breast cancer compared to risks of 15% and 3% respectively for women of the same age in the general population.

For a woman diagnosed when aged 40, her estimated risks of developing a second cancer by the age of 60 are 6% for both non-breast and contralateral breast cancer compared to 4% and 2% respectively for women in the general population.

When patients were grouped according to other (adjuvant) treatments they received after surgery, radiotherapy was associated with higher rates of contralateral breast and lung cancers, endocrine therapy with uterine cancer (along with reduced contralateral breast cancer), and chemotherapy with acute leukaemia.

Based on these results, the researchers estimate that around 7% of excess second cancers may be due to the use of adjuvant therapies, but note that their benefits outweigh this small risk in almost all circumstances where these treatments are recommended.

The authors acknowledge that their findings may be affected by incomplete cancer registry data for some variables. What's more, they did not have information on family history, genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices such as smoking.

However, this long-term study describes the development of second cancers according to multiple patient, tumour and treatment characteristics amongst all women with early invasive breast cancer so the findings can reliably inform breast cancer patients and the clinicians who treat and support them.

They are also relevant to clinical practice and policy, and may help inform the design of future studies to assess cancer risk.

These results are reassuring and should be shared widely, say patients in a linked opinion article, who note that finding detailed information on the risks of second cancers after breast cancer was particularly difficult.

In general, the benefits of treatments in protecting patients from recurrence of breast cancer far outweigh the potential downsides, the patients write. Such information should be available and offered by clinicians at the time that adjuvant therapies are discussed.

They acknowledge that not everyone will want all the details at diagnosis, but say it should be there for those who do want it and for those who seek it later. "Information on risks should be readily available. It helps us to plan our lives and think ahead to the future," they conclude.

Investigators at Mass General Brigham and the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have uncovered how patients' healthcare spending has changed following the implementation of the No Surprises Act in 2022, a bipartisan law prohibiting unexpected or "surprise" bills after patients receive out-of-network medical care. The team found that the law dramatically reduced out-of-pocket costs, with an average annual savings of nearly $600 per patient. The findings are published in The BMJ.

"One in five insured adults in the U.S. incurred surprise bills before the No Surprises Act, and these bills frequently exceeded thousands of dollars, resulting in substantial financial hardship among patients," said lead author Michael Liu, MD, MPhil, a clinical fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and research fellow at the Smith Center. "Government agencies have called for rigorous evaluations of the law, and we believe our paper is the first to do so."

Liu and his colleagues analyzed data on 17,351 adults aged 19-64 years with direct-purchase private insurance. Some resided in intervention states that gained protections from the No Surprises Act and others resided in control states that already had laws providing comprehensive surprise billing protections and therefore did not gain additional protections from the law.

After implementation of the No Surprises Act, out-of-pocket medical spending declined significantly in intervention states-nearly $600 annually per patient-but not in control states, indicating that the law was successful in protecting patients from surprise medical bills. Although experts initially projected that premium spending (fixed monthly payments to insurance companies) would decline because the law was supposed to promote fair payment negotiations between insurers and providers, the researchers observed that such spending was unchanged after the law. "This finding is in line with anecdotal reports that providers-especially those backed by private equity firms-are leveraging loopholes and unfair tactics to secure higher payments at the expense of patients and the healthcare system," said Liu.

Importantly, the No Surprises Act did not meaningfully reduce high burden medical spending, defined as a family spending more than 10% of their income on health care, suggesting that opportunities remain to build upon the law and pursue additional policy strategies to reduce healthcare-related financial strain, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

Our findings have important implications for patients and should inform ongoing policy efforts to prevent financial toxicity and address the healthcare affordability crisis in the U.S."

Bulimia nervosa (BN), or bulimia, is a mental health disorder characterized by binge eating and a fear of gaining weight, which drives people to try and avoid weight gain, usually by compensatory (vomiting etc.). Over time, this binge–purge cycle harms both physical and mental health of the individual, leading to problems like dehydration, low blood pressure, depression, and even self-harm. BN mostly affects young women and often begins in their teenage years, with studies showing that up to three percent of women may experience BN at some point in their lives, putting them at higher risk if left untreated.

BN is thought to develop from harmful learned habits that can be changed with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This approach helps people break the binge–purge cycle by challenging negative thoughts and beliefs related to dieting and body weight. However, for many people, especially those living far away from specialist clinics, accessing face-to-face therapy is not always easy or even possible.

Now, in the first study of its kind conducted in Asia, an international team of researchers have shown that CBT can also be effective when delivered online. Their findings suggest that guided internet-based CBT (ICBT) can help people who otherwise struggle to get specialist care.

The study was conducted by Dr. Sayo Hamatani from the Research Center for Child Mental Development, University of Fukui, Japan, and included several co-authors, such as Dr. Kazuki Matsumoto from Kagoshima University, Japan; Dr. Gerhard Andersson from Linköping University in Sweden; and Dr. Yoshifumi Mizuno from the University of Fukui, along with researchers from Tohoku University Hospital, Chiba University, Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, and Tokushima University. The results were published online in Volume 8 of the journal JAMA Network Open on August 05, 2025.

"We undertook this study to lower barriers to accessing specialist care and help create a society where people can receive high-quality treatment regardless of where they live. By establishing a specialist online therapy that can be delivered at home, even patients in remote areas or with busy schedules will find it easier to continue treatment, supporting early intervention and preventing progression to more severe forms," explains Dr. Hamatani as she speaks of the motivation behind the study.

The researchers assessed the efficacy of guided ICBT by comparing it to that of usual care. To this end, they recruited 61 women between the age of 13–65 years (average age: 28 years), who were randomly assigned either to an intervention group that received guided ICBT or to a control group that continued with usual care. The program lasted 12 weeks, during which participants in the ICBT group worked through weekly online modules adapted for Japanese patients and received support from a therapist through an online platform. The program included strategies to help people resist urges to binge and purge, such as exercises to face triggers in a safe way and activities to help reshape negative views about their own bodies.

When the researchers compared the results at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention, they found that women in the ICBT group showed significantly reduced binge eating and compensatory behaviors compared to those in the usual care group, with an average decrease of about 10 episodes in total. The percentage of women whose symptoms improved enough to be considered in remission, rose from just 13% with usual care to up to 55% with ICBT. Participants also reported feeling more satisfied with the online program, with more than 75% stating they would return to this treatment program if they needed help again.

These findings strongly make the case for continued support as essential for treating BN and preventing the condition from becoming more severe. Making CBT available online could very well be a game-changer for people who cannot easily access a clinic. "With insurance support and integration into healthcare systems, this approach could reach many more people and play a key role in treating BN," highlights Dr. Hamatani.

Developing a system based on this study could potentially lead to high-quality care, promoting equitable mental healthcare and improving the overall quality-of-life among patients with BN.

A novel, multi-analyte test developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Ludwig Center and the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurosurgery can accurately identify brain cancers using small samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a promising new tool to guide clinical decision-making. 

The findings, supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, were published Aug. 25 in Cancer Discovery and demonstrate that combining multiple biological markers, including tumor-derived DNA and immune cell signatures, is more effective for diagnosing central nervous system cancers than using any one marker alone. 

"This study highlights how much more information we can gain when we evaluate several analytes together," says senior study author Chetan Bettegowda, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Cushing Professor and Director of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, director of the Reza Khatib Brain Tumor Research Center at Johns Hopkins, medical director of the Ludwig Center, and a senior author on the study. "The ability to detect cancers with high specificity and also gain insight into the immune environment of the brain could be an important advance in the care of patients with brain tumors." 

To evaluate the potential of a multi-analyte approach, investigators analyzed 206 CSF samples, including samples from patients with high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, metastases and central nervous system lymphomas. Their test, called CSF-BAM (cerebrospinal fluid–B/T cell receptor, aneuploidy and mutation), measured chromosomal abnormalities, tumor-specific mutations, and T and B cell receptor sequences. In combination, these markers identified brain cancers with more than 80% sensitivity (ability to detect cancer) and 100% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer-free) in the validation cohort. The 100% specificity means no false positives were recorded among individuals with noncancerous conditions. 

The study also showed that the assay could distinguish between the immune cell populations present in cancer and noncancer cases, offering additional biological context that could be helpful in more-challenging clinical scenarios. Investigators say this ability to categorize T and B cell populations in the CSF provides insights into both disease presence and immune response. 

Many patients with brain lesions face invasive diagnostic procedures to confirm a cancer diagnosis. A tool like this could help us make better-informed decisions about who really needs a biopsy and who doesn't."

Christopher Douville, M.D., assistant professor of oncology and senior study author

Researchers say the test could be particularly useful for cases in which conventional imaging or cytology is inconclusive, or in situations when obtaining tissue for diagnosis is risky or not possible. The multi-analyte approach, they say, enables clinicians to better detect cancer and better understand the disease status, supporting a more tailored approach to patient care.

Scientists in Australia are launching one of the most comprehensive trials to date to test whether ditching plastics in food, personal care, and household products can lower internal chemical loads and improve markers of cardiometabolic health.



Protocol: Randomised controlled trial of a low plastic diet and lifestyle intervention for adults with cardiometabolic risk factors: the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial – a protocol. Image Credit: Oksana Mizina / Shutterstock

In a recent public health protocol published in BMJ Open, researchers describe the PERTH (Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health) trial, a new randomized controlled study protocol designed to investigate whether a comprehensive, 4-week "low-plastic" diet and lifestyle intervention can reduce exposure to plastic-derived chemicals.

These chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors with documented links to obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The PERTH trial examines whether a cohort of 60 adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, provided with all-plastic-free food, cookware, and personal care products, can demonstrate measurable reductions in plastic-associated chemical excretion and exploratory changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers.

From the top of Mt. Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, plastics from food packaging, kitchen utensils, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies can be found everywhere and comprise an inescapable part of modern life. Alarmingly, in addition to their ecological and environmental impacts, a growing body of scientific literature reports extensive physiological concerns associated with them.

Two classes of chemicals commonly used in plastics: 1. bisphenols (like Bisphenol A [BPA]) and 2. phthalates (like diethyl phthalate [DEP]) are known endocrine disruptors. Observational research has linked higher exposure to these “plastic-associated chemicals (PACs)” with various adverse physiological outcomes, including obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation.

Clinical evidence suggests these outcomes substantially increase individuals' risk and severity of cardiometabolic disease. Unfortunately, whether actively and drastically reducing PAC exposure can reverse previous harm remains to be investigated through controlled intervention studies.

The present public health protocol details the proposed methodology of the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of a low-plastic lifestyle intervention on measurable health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors.

The study will involve 60 community-dwelling adults (aged 18–60 years) in Perth, Australia, who have established cardiometabolic risk factors. Study inclusion criteria include: 1. A body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², and 2. A high waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women). The study will randomly assign participants into a case (“intervention”; n = 30) or control (n = 30) group.

The intervention period will last four weeks, during which time the intervention cohort participants will receive a comprehensive, all-inclusive low-plastic lifestyle package. This includes: 1. Delivering all food and beverages in plastic-free packaging, 2. Replacement plastic-free kitchenware (e.g., stainless steel pots, glass containers), 3. Personal care products (such as shampoo and soap), and 4. Cleaning supplies.

Interventional group participants will receive detailed instructions on how to minimize plastic exposure in their daily lives. In contrast, the control group will be asked to maintain their routine lifestyle and dietary patterns.

Study outcomes will be measured by evaluating the change in a composite z-score of urinary bisphenol concentrations (BPA and BPS) between participants in the intervention and control groups. Secondary and tertiary outcomes will include changes in urinary phthalate metabolites and a range of key health markers, including cardiometabolic biomarkers, blood pressure, and body composition. Participants will also collect their own stool and nasal lavage samples to support exploratory analyses.

Participants' sociodemographic information will be recorded at baseline, and all biomedical measurements will be taken at baseline, midpoint (week 2), and at the end of the 4-week intervention.

By providing all food and products to the intervention group, the PERTH trial will be the most comprehensive and rigorously controlled trial ever conducted on the topic. Impressively, pilot trials have already revealed that BPA was detectable in over 91% of urine samples derived from healthy (no cardiometabolic disease) adults, confirming that PAC exposure is widespread in Australia.

These pilots further demonstrated that a 7-day low-plastic intervention could significantly reduce urinary PAC levels, providing a strong basis for this larger, longer trial. Notably, while laboratory staff will be blinded to participant allocation, both participants and investigators cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention.

Finally, the PERTH study leverages the Plastic-Associated Chemical-exposure Questionnaire (PACeQ) to meticulously track and assess all potential routes of plastic exposure (ingestion, inhalation, and absorption), ensuring robust and trustworthy results. The protocol also highlights the ethical rationale for the holistic intervention approach, as it avoids artificial PAC exposure in controls due to safety concerns.

The PERTH trial is a critically important study that will provide the first protocolised attempt to test the causal effects of whether a comprehensive reduction in exposure to everyday plastic chemicals can lead to exploratory improvements in cardiometabolic health markers.

Study outcomes have the potential to significantly impact public health guidelines, inform regulatory policy on the use of chemicals in consumer products, and empower individuals with practical, evidence-based strategies to reduce their body's plastic burden. While the study's Australian focus prevents its global generalizability, it comprises the first significant step from observational links to real-world interventions.

From "no added sugar" to "organic goodness," infant and toddler foods in New Zealand are overloaded with promotional claims, many of which may mislead parents and blur the line between marketing and nutrition.

Products averaged 7.5 distinct claims each, ranging wildly from just 3 claims up to a cluttered 15 claims per package.

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition & Dietetics, researchers found that all commercial toddler and infant food products in New Zealand had multiple on-pack claims.

Nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life can influence health and well-being. Early life is a period of rapid growth and could shape healthy eating patterns. Therefore, optimal nutrition in early childhood is central to healthy growth, development, and well-being. The Nutrient and Promotion Profile Model (NPPM) of the World Health Organization provides a framework for developing effective policy and legal measures to ensure the sale of appropriate toddler and infant foods.

NPPM recommends that commercial toddler and infant foods not carry nutrition, health, composition, or marketing claims. The paper highlights a key regulatory gap, as the current Australia-New Zealand Food Standards Code does not address marketing claims (such as those related to taste or convenience). Infant and toddler food labeling has been identified as an area of concern by the Food Regulation Standing Committee (FRSC) of New Zealand and Australia, as caregivers struggle to determine which foods align with the Healthy Eating Guidelines for New Zealand Babies and Toddlers.

"Free from" claims for artificial flavors and colors topped the list, appearing on 72% and 71% of products respectively, even more than "no added sugar" (53%).

The present study aimed to identify on-pack claims on commercial toddler and infant foods in New Zealand. First, all relevant toddler and infant food products were identified through the Nutritrack database. Data were annually collected from four major supermarket chains in New Zealand. Images of foods and beverages were taken, and data from the photos were entered into a database. To account for products new to the market since the last data collection, this was supplemented by an online supermarket search in January 2024, which identified 21 additional products. Products were classified into 59 categories and 15 food groups.

The study used products categorized as baby foods, which included products indicated on-pack as intended for toddlers and infants. Additionally, the food groups of dairy and snack foods were examined to identify other foods suitable for toddlers and infants. Infant products were defined as those intended for ages < 12 months. Toddler products were those designed for ages 12 to <36 months. Infant formulas, toddler milks, and follow-on formulas were excluded from the analysis.

The identified products were stratified into 14 food categories or subcategories based on the NPPM. The presence/absence of nutrition, composition, marketing, and health claims was identified. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the frequency of claims by food category and overall. The frequency of products with imagery of fruits or vegetables was also examined.

Snacks and finger foods displaying vegetable images often relied on powdered forms, contributing to their low average vegetable content of just 11.4%.

The researchers identified 210 toddler and infant food products. These included 43 toddler products and 167 infant products. Most products (35%) were vegetable and fruit purees, followed by snacks and finger foods (28%), and savory meals (24%). On average, each product had 7.5 unique claims. All products carried a marketing claim, 19% featured a health claim, and 99% had a nutrition or composition claim.

Nutrition and composition claims were the most common, with an average of four claims per product, followed by marketing claims (3.3 claims) and health claims (0.2 claims). Further, “free from” claims, relating to the absence of ingredients generally perceived to be harmful, were the most prevalent nutrition or composition claims found on 97% of products; “free from” claims most commonly referred to added sugars, flavors, colors, salt, and preservatives.

Approximately 68% of products featured words such as "fresh," "organic," "natural," or "real" on their packaging. Most products with a health claim were found in the dry cereals and starches (77%) and snacks and finger foods (34%) categories. The most common health claim was related to beneficial health and development, and these claims were more than twice as prevalent on toddler foods (found on 33% of products) compared to infant foods (15%). The most common marketing claims were related to ideal texture, taste, optimum feeding, high quality, and lifestyle or convenience.

Further, 58% of products featured images of fruits, 88% of which contained processed fruit sugars. The percentage of fruit in products with fruit imagery ranged from 0% to 100%. One-fifth of products with fruit imagery had less than 5% fruit. Vegetable images were found on the packaging of 36% of products. Most products were savory meals or purees, containing an average of 49% vegetables. Beyond imagery, the study also found that the product names themselves were often misleading. For 27% of products, the name did not accurately reflect the ingredients in the order they appear. For example, a product named ‘Organic Lamb and Garden Vegetables' implied that lamb was the main ingredient, when in fact it contained only 10% lamb compared to 90% vegetables.

Among the 27% of products with misleading names, a striking 24 out of 27 were savory meals overstating the prominence of meat or chicken.

Commercial foods for infants and toddlers in New Zealand were saturated with claims, with all products featuring at least three unique claims. Composition and nutrition claims were the most common category. Marketing claims were also common, while health claims were less frequent. One-fourth of products featured all three categories of claims.

Besides, a combined 88% of products featured vegetable and/or fruit imagery. Similar types and numbers of claims were found on infant and toddler foods, except for health claims that were more prevalent on toddler foods. The paper notes that previous research confirms these claims can be powerful, with one study finding that ‘free from' claims can promote inaccurate perceptions of a product's healthiness and influence purchasing choices. Overall, regulations are needed to restrict the use of claims and align them with best practices, thereby preventing caregivers from being misled by these promotional messages.

A landmark UK Biobank study reveals that not all additives are equal: while sugars, sweeteners, and flavorings drive higher mortality, gelling agents may offer protection, reshaping how we view the risks of ultra-processed foods.

In a recent article in the journal eClinicalMedicine, researchers in Germany investigated whether specific markers of ultra-processing (MUPs) are associated with mortality, beyond the established links between ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and poor health.

Their findings indicate that certain types of sugar, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavor enhancers, and flavors were associated with a higher risk of mortality, as was overall UPF intake.

Flavour additives dominated UK supermarket foods, appearing in 13.6% of total food intake on average, more than any other MUP category analyzed in the study.

UPFs are highly industrially processed items that are typically rich in fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients such as fiber, protein, and vitamins. These foods are marketed aggressively and valued for their convenience, often replacing healthier dietary options.

The consumption of UPFs has been rising globally, with countries such as the UK and the USA deriving more than 50% of their total energy intake from them, compared with around 10% in Italy.

This trend is concerning, as UPFs have consistently been associated with obesity, weight gain, and numerous negative health outcomes. Consequently, several national dietary guidelines recommend limiting UPF intake.

Food processing is commonly classified using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods into four groups. UPFs fall under NOVA group 4 and can be identified through MUPs. These include cosmetic additives such as sweeteners, flavors, and colors, as well as non-culinary ingredients like modified oils or fructose.

A food is classified as UPF if it contains at least one MUP. Although UPFs have been strongly linked to mortality, no studies have directly examined whether specific MUPs contribute equally to these risks. This knowledge gap is critical, as certain additives may lead to negative health outcomes, while others may not.

Assessing portion sizes required creative solutions: When packaging data was unavailable, researchers turned to the UK Food Standards Agency's standard portion guides to estimate grams consumed.

Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study of over 500,000 adults recruited between 2006 and 2010.

For this study, 186,744 participants aged 40–75 years were included after applying exclusions for missing information, implausible dietary reports, and pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes or malabsorption disorders. Dietary intake was assessed using up to five 24-hour web-based food recalls completed per participant.

To estimate UPF and MUP consumption, researchers matched each food item reported to up to ten commercial products from UK supermarkets. Ingredient lists were analyzed for 57 possible MUPs grouped into nine categories, with 37 of these found in at least one product. For each food item, a Marker Likelihood Index (MLI) was calculated based on the proportion of commercial products containing a specific MUP.

The proportion of intake from UPFs or specific MUPs for each participant was calculated relative to total food intake (expressed as a percentage of total food intake, %TFI).

Mortality data were obtained from national health registries, with follow-up until December 2022 (mean follow-up 11.0 years).

Statistical analyses used Cox proportional hazard regression models with penalized cubic splines to examine associations between MUP intake and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, alcohol intake, BMI, ethnicity, health status, education, psychiatric history, income, physical activity, blood pressure, sex, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the findings.

Even cumulative exposure to multiple MUPs mattered: Total intake across all markers showed a significant link to higher mortality risk, beyond individual MUP effects.

The participants were 58 years old on average, and 57% were female; UPF intake accounted for an average of 20.0% of their total food intake. Over 11 years of follow-up, 10,203 deaths occurred. Higher UPF consumption was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk (HR-nadir) at 18% TFI and risk rising beyond that intake level.

When examining specific MUPs, five categories – flavour, flavour enhancers, colouring agents, sweeteners, and varieties of sugar – showed strong positive associations with mortality risk at specific intake levels:

In contrast, no associations were observed for processing aids, modified oils, protein sources, or fibre.

At the individual level, 13 specific MUPs were significantly related to mortality. These included glutamate and ribonucleotides (flavor enhancers); acesulfame, saccharin, and sucralose (sweeteners); caking agents, firming agents, thickeners (processing aids); and fructose, inverted sugar, lactose, and maltodextrin (sugars). Notably, gelling agents (processing aids) showed an inverse association with mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results, especially for UPF, flavour, coloring agents, and sweeteners.

Results held firm after excluding early deaths: Sensitivity analyses removed participants who died within 2 years of dietary assessment, reducing concerns about reverse causation.

This exploratory study is the first to assess broad categories and specific MUPs in relation to mortality, showing associations between higher mortality risk and both overall UPF intake as well as several MUPs (flavors, flavor enhancers, coloring agents, sweeteners, and sugars).

The findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence linking these additives to weight gain, metabolic disruption, and alterations in gut microbiota. The inverse association for gelling agents (possibly due to pectin content) highlights significant variation in health effects across additives.

Strengths include the large cohort size, extended follow-up, and novel MUP-based classification using commercial product analysis, which enhances objectivity compared with predefined UPF food lists. However, as an exploratory analysis, limitations include reliance on self-reported dietary data, potential residual confounding, limited power for rarer MUPs, and the ‘healthy volunteer' bias of the UK Biobank.

These results highlight specific MUPs, such as flavorings, colorings, sweeteners, certain processing aids (e.g., thickeners), and sugars, as potential drivers of UPF-related health risks. Replication and exploration of mechanisms in future research are needed.

In July and August, online rumours suggested organizers of the 2026 FIFA World Cup planned to relocate games from the United States to Canada amid U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. While some advocacy groups urged FIFA to ask the U.S. government to reverse its recent immigration measures, FIFA did not commit to doing so, nor did it move any games to Canada.

THE CLAIM

As Canada joins the United States and Mexico in hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, rumours are circulating online about the impact U.S. immigration measures could have on next year's cup schedule. 

"Canada TAKES U.S. spot as FIFA RELOCATES World Cup Matches - Billions in Revenue LOST" reads the caption on an Aug. 14 TikTok with more than 100,000 plays. 

The video mentions U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban imposed on 12 countries in June and various visa restrictions as possible reasons FIFA is supposedly considering relocating World Cup games to Canada. 

A YouTube video with a similar title earned around 192,000 views. Both the YouTube and TikTok video bear signs they were generated with the help of artificial intelligence.

A similar claim about FIFA moving World Cup games over immigration concerns appeared as a July 16 Instagram post with more than 435,000 likes. It was reposted on Aug. 24 to X, formerly Twitter, receiving around 41,000 likes. 

THE FACTS

A quick Google search shows there is no announcement from FIFA about moving U.S. World Cup games to Canada. 

FIFA's official match schedule shows Canada is set to host 13 games: seven in Vancouver and six in Toronto. The schedule in August matches both the schedule in June, as captured by the Wayback Machine, as well as the schedule shown in FIFA's announcement video from February 2024. 

As soccer's governing body responsible for organizing the World Cup, FIFA faces pressure from international and U.S.-based advocacy groups to address human rights concerns arising from Trump's immigration crackdown. 

On July 1, the Miami Herald reported local activists organized outside FIFA's legal office in Coral Gables, Fla., urged FIFA to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials out of the games. 

In a joint letter published the same day, 90 U.S. civil society organizations urged FIFA "use its influence" and ask the U.S. government to uphold the rights of foreign visitors and U.S. residents during the 2025 Club World Cup and 2026 men's World Cup. 

Human Rights Watch wrote to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in May, asking that FIFA publicly acknowledge "the threat U.S. immigration policies pose to the tournament's integrity" and urge the U.S. government to change its immigration policies that may affect players and fans. 

FIFA did not directly respond to the issues Human Rights Watch raised in its letter, including travel bans, visa restrictions, and the detention and deportation of non-citizens and legal U.S. residents by ICE. 

"FIFA is committed … in ensuring respect for human rights in matters linked to any of its activities," the organization wrote in response. 

It said it expects host countries "take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the competition are able to enter the respective countries." 

Politico, citing an unnamed industry official, reported in May that FIFA president Infantino said privately he was "amused" at press reports of a World Cup summit attended by Trump that questioned whether the United States would relax its strict border rules for World Cup fans.

The Canadian Press reached out to FIFA for comment and will update this story if it receives a response.

I spent the earlier part of this week living under the stars, in a tent deep inside Yellowstone National Park, with only a patchy cellphone signal, no internet or television. It wasn't quite an Aaron Rodgers retreat but it was an amazing experience.

Anyone who has ever ‘disconnected' in that manner, understands the value that it brings. You have time to break free from the constant demands of everyday life, to refocus and renew before re-emerging with fresh energy.

But when I came out of the retreat and saw Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the upcoming games against South Korea and Japan, I wondered for half a second if I wasn't now living in an alternative reality.

Almost half of Pochettino's 23-man squad is made up of players from Major League Soccer ,as he continues to experiment with new players while the likes of Weston McKennie at Juventus, Johnny Cardoso of Atlético Madrid, Yunus Musah at AC Milan and Tanner Tessmann at Lyon have been left out.

We are nine months away from the start of the World Cup on home soil and the coach is still experimenting, still familiarizing himself with the player pool and still ‘sending messages' to players? Really?

At this stage, I would expect the national team coach to be focused on his core starting team and supporting cast, getting players familiar with their roles, the partnerships that are so vital across the field and the group dynamics that need to be fine tuned before competing with the world's elite.

Of course, there is always room for bringing in a form player or two or trying out alternative options and testing the depth of his roster. And there is some validity in Pochettino's likely goals here – broadening the pool, lighting a fire under those excluded and perhaps giving European-based players the chance to focus on their club situations for now.

But the benefits of a player being allowed to stay with a European club are limited when you remember that during the international break, large numbers of the first-team squad at clubs like Milan, Juve and Atlético, are away with their national teams anyway, weakening the significance of those training sessions, which are mainly for reserves and other non-internationals.

Two things really concern me about this roster.

Firstly, the U.S. is playing against Japan and South Korea, two teams with quality players and top-tier experience, who are exactly the kind of opponents that might be waiting in the World Cup itself, especially in the knockout phase.

With no qualifying games, these friendlies should be treated as seriously as possible, to get the squad truly competitive encounters – to test them and help them grow. As we saw with the debacle of June's 4-0 crushing by Switzerland in Nashville, if the opposition is high-level and comes in motivated, the outcome for an experimental team can be ugly.

There is already a worrying lack of enthusiasm bordering on apathy in the USMNT's fan base at a time when positivity and optimism should be growing in anticipation of this huge moment in American soccer. I don't even want to think about what the impact would be of another heavy loss at home.

Secondly, while the time for ‘sending messages' should be over by now, I also worry about exactly what kind of message Pochettino is sending by his selection of MLS players who few people, if any, were clamoring for.

When I played for the national team under Bob Bradley, there was an unwritten rule for emerging American MLS talent. If you want to be a national team player, you earn yourself a move abroad, you fight for your place at your club, you perform week-in, week-out and then you get your chance.

It was highly motivating. It led people like me to turn down, after college, a Generation Adidas contract with MLS and head to Europe. It was why I battled for a starting place at Hammarby in Sweden, moved to Sochaux in France and played for Randers in Denmark.

Jurgen Klinsmann was another national team coach who was keen to see Americans move to Europe, pushing players to get as close to the highest level as possible. It's why so many of our players over the last 25 years improved, became more professional and more steeled. It's not easy as an American walking into a European locker-room, proving yourself, earning a starting place and keeping it. It's a grind every single day. It meant the national team coach got players who had been forged by that experience, hardened and sharpened.

It also gave players in MLS something to aim for. You might be performing well enough for your club, but were you playing well enough to attract the attention of European scouts?

So what is the message the players receive when they see Pochettino's roster?

With all due respect, have the likes of Roman Celentano, Tristan Blackmon, Nathan Harriel and Sean Zawadzki really been performing at such a consistently high-level in MLS that they simply could not be ignored? Have they really thrust themselves into contention for World Cup places?

Even if you were looking to MLS-based players, it is surprising that some of these new faces are being picked ahead of the likes of Djordje Mihailovic (11 caps), DeJuan Jones (10 caps) and Chicago's exciting talent Brian Gutierrez (two caps).

But the message sent is even worse. When I see a player like Paxton Aaronson, who after trying to make it at Eintracht Frankfurt took on the challenge of a loan spell at Utrecht and earned a starting place at a top-four club in the Dutch league, take a move back to MLS, it leaves me thinking the players have understood that under Pochettino you'd actually be better off in MLS.

That is a crazy situation. But what other conclusion could we draw from the fact that a promising player like Aidan Morris, who was rightly called up due to his excellent form with the Columbus Crew, is now ignored despite being a regular in the highly competitive Championship with Middlesbrough?

Morris won two MLS Cups with the Crew before, at the age of 22, going to play for then-Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick, a great coach to learn from, given he played in Morris's midfield role. That's the kind of initiative that I would lean towards rewarding.

Morris could now be forgiven for thinking that he would have been better off, from a national team perspective, staying with the Crew, never having to worry about losing his place, never having to push himself, under pressure, every week in the grind of that league. He'd probably be in this roster if he was playing in MLS – which is absurd.

There are contradictions in Pochettino's approach, too. If the aim is to give players in new club environments space to settle, then why call up Tim Weah? He is in his first season with Marseille, adapting to a new system under Roberto De Zerbi and new teammates, and yet he is (deservedly) included in the roster.

And he should be, because Weah is a vital piece of the U.S. puzzle. His speed, quickness, timing, 1-v-1 ability, two-way commitment and World Cup experience (including scoring against Wales in Qatar) make him unique in this group.

The reality is that outside of him, the USMNT simply doesn't have another wide player with that blend of qualities. His inclusion underscores just how inconsistent the logic is when other Europe-based players in similar or even stronger club situations are left behind.

At least Pochettino says this is the last window before the experimenting stops in October. That is a relief, but I think not going with a full-strength squad for these games is another missed opportunity for the coach and the team.

Hopefully the approach to the games will be less experimental than the roster call-ups suggests. If the U.S. wants to inspire belief heading into the home World Cup, now is the time to sharpen, not experiment.

Thankfully, Christian Pulisic is on the roster, and I really hope that he and everyone else can now put this summer's unpleasant conflict behind them. The whole saga was the result of poor communication. No one blinked an eye when it was announced that Musah was missing the Gold Cup for ‘personal reasons,' and few would have objected if Christian's absence was put down to muscle fatigue or a minor injury.

I'll never understand why it was instead described by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker as the player asking to “step back” this summer due to the volume of games. The whole thing could have been avoided with different language.

Christian had a new coach coming in at AC Milan and it was important for him to be at the Milanello training ground fresh and ready to go on day one of preseason and not coming in late or tired from the Gold Cup and playing catch-up ahead of the new season.

The U.S. needs Pulisic to have a great season with Milan and to return in style to the national team. He's central to World Cup hopes, and whatever people think of his decision this summer, it is time to put it behind us and get behind our best player. Just as it's time for Pochettino to get behind his best players, period.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Lionel Messi has not yet announced when he plans to retire, but he knows that next week's match against Venezuela could be his last one playing at home in a World Cup qualifier with Argentina's national team.

“It's going to be a very, very special match for me because it's the last qualifying match,” the 38-year-old Messi said Wednesday night after Inter Miami progressed to the Leagues Cup final by beating Orlando City.

Argentina, with a spot already secured in next year's World Cup, will host Venezuela next Thursday at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires for the penultimate round of South American qualifiers. Its last match will be at Ecuador on Sept. 9.

Messi has hinted that he will retire from the national team after next year's World Cup, where Argentina is going to defend the title they won in Qatar 2022.

The qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when the soccer star will be 40 years old.

“I don't know if there will be friendlies or more matches after (Venezuela), but it is a very special match, so my family will be there with me: my wife, my children, my parents, my siblings," Messi said. "We're going to live it like that. I don't know what will happen next.”

Following Messi's statements, CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, wrote on social media that “the last dance is coming,” with a picture of Messi in an Argentina shirt.

Meanwhile, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) is trying to capitalize on Messi's last home match by raising ticket prices, with the cheapest going for $100 and the most expensive costing around $500.

Chelsea will welcome Barcelona to Stamford Bridge in the league phase of the Champions League, while Arsenal host Bayern Munich.

As was the case last season, all 36 teams in the competition will compete in one big league and each play eight fixtures.

Chelsea have a trip to Bayern Munich to look forward, but the standout fixture for the Blues is a home clash against Barcelona.

Alongside those two fixtures, there will be a reunion with former boss Antonio Conte when they travel to take on Napoli.

Arsenal, who reached the semi-finals last season, will also face Bayern, as has regularly been the case in this competition over the past decade.

That will come at the Emirates Stadium, as will a blockbuster encounter with Atletico Madrid.

There is a trip to Milan to face Inter for Mikel Arteta's side. The Italian side beat Arsenal in the league phase of the Champions League last season.

Tottenham, meanwhile, are back at Europe's top table and take on holders Paris Saint-Germain, who were fortunate to beat them in the UEFA Super Cup earlier this month.

Thomas Frank's side have plenty of familiar opponents. They travel to take on Eintracht Frankfurt, beaten on the way to Europa League glory last season, as well as Bodo/Glimt, who Spurs saw off in the semi-finals of that run.

Liverpool face another heavyweight showdown with Real Madrid, in what is a swift return to Anfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Manchester City will be at the Bernabeu to take on the 15-time champions, while they host Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and Galatasaray.

Newcastle complete the six Premier League sides in the competition and have been handed a tough set of fixtures.

The Magpies have tricky away trips, including against PSG, Leverkusen and Marseille, while Barcelona will be hosted at St James' Park.

Manchester City: Borussia Dortmund (H), Real Madrid (A), Bayer Leverkusen (H), Villarreal (A), Napoli (H), Bodo/Glimt (A), Galatasaray (H), Monaco (A)

Liverpool: Real Madrid (H), Inter Milan (A), Atletico Madrid (H), Eintracht Frankfurt (A), PSV (H), Marseille (A), Qarabag (H), Galatasaray (A)

The Blues' talisman is already facing a short spell on the sidelines after a strenuous summer where he was overworked in the pursuit of silverware

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.

Could Folarin Balogun deliver for the United States in September?

That'll be top of mind as the U.S. Men's National Team gears up to face Korea Republic and Japan in the September FIFA window.

Balogun was added to the now 23-player roster on Wednesday ahead of Aug. 31 when players report to New Jersey for training camp. He earned his first cap in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League Finals and scored his first goal in the 2-0 win against Canada in the Final, quickly garnering a name for himself as a scoring threat.

This window and the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup also give Balogun a chance to answer another question: Can he stay healthy?

He last competed with the National Team in September 2024, just as Pochettino was hired. However, this isn't Balogun's first call-up under the head coach. Balogun was one of five forwards selected to the roster for June camp, but he sustained an ankle injury before reporting for National Team duty. The forward missed significant time during the last Ligue 1 season with a dislocated shoulder and the ankle injury.

This will give Pochettino a chance to evaluate the 24-year-old forward more thoroughly. Though, the forward has proven to be efficient for both club and country. Balogun has racked up five goals in 17 caps with the USMNT. On the club side, he recorded four goals in 16 appearances for AS Monaco last season.

Josh Sargent, Damion Downs and Tim Weah are forwards on this September roster who have played the No. 9 position. This September camp gives Pochettino a chance to look at several different players as decisions for the upcoming World Cup roster need to be made. And like other positions, the striker is ripe for the taking.

Other options at the position in the player pool — Ricardo Pepi, Patrick Agyemang, Haji Wright, Downs — have all earned caps under Pochettino. Now, Balogun is poised with the opportunity to prove his value, too, in Harrison, N.J. on Sept. 6 and then in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 9.

Liverpool are assessing the possibility of moving for Real Madrid forward Rodrygo as the transfer window nears its conclusion. With Newcastle United holding firm over Alexander Isak, the 24-year-old Brazil international has been identified as a potential alternative should negotiations with the Magpies fail to progress.

Sources indicate that Arne Slot remains intent on strengthening his attacking line before the deadline, despite Hugo Ekitike's promising start on Merseyside. The pursuit of reinforcements comes in a summer where Liverpool have already demonstrated ambition, most notably with the high-profile signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen.

Rodrygo's situation at Real Madrid is increasingly uncertain. Despite his reputation as a decisive forward, questions over his role have persisted under Xabi Alonso. While the manager has publicly underlined the Brazilian's importance, assurances on regular minutes have not been forthcoming.

Former teammate Luka Modric has labelled him ‘world-class', but the forward has found himself sidelined at key moments, including limited involvement in the Club World Cup. With no guarantees of consistent selection, Rodrygo is believed to be open to evaluating opportunities away from the Bernabéu.

His omission from Brazil's latest international squad, under the management of Carlo Ancelotti, has intensified speculation about his future. With the World Cup on the horizon, Rodrygo is wary of slipping down the pecking order for his national side should his situation at Madrid remain unchanged.

Liverpool are not alone in monitoring developments. Manchester City and Arsenal are also attentive to the forward's position, though any move will require significant negotiation.

Rodrygo's current contract reflects his stature, with wages rising to nearly £350,000 per week when bonuses are included. In addition, his release clause stands at more than £860 million. Real Madrid are unlikely to expect such figures to be met, but they would demand a substantial fee for a permanent transfer.

There remains a possibility that the player could be available on loan, a scenario that Arsenal in particular are open to exploring. Liverpool, however, are understood to be prioritising clarity on Isak's availability before advancing talks.

With the Premier League champions eager to maintain momentum, the club's recruitment team face a pivotal few days. While Slot is encouraged by Ekitike's adaptation, the feeling at Anfield is that one more addition in the final third could prove decisive in sustaining a title defence.

Rodrygo's productivity last season – 23 goal contributions across all competitions – underscores why Liverpool, as well as rivals Manchester City and Arsenal, are carefully considering his availability. Should Newcastle's stance on Isak remain unyielding, Liverpool's focus may yet shift towards the Brazilian, who is weighing up his options amid growing uncertainty in Madrid.

This radar chart provides a detailed statistical profile of Rodrygo's performances over the last 365 days, based on 3,322 minutes played. It measures his percentile ranking compared with other forwards, highlighting strengths across attacking, possession, and defensive metrics.

From an attacking perspective, Rodrygo's output stands out immediately. He ranks in the 90th percentile for non-penalty expected goals (xG), showing strong positioning and ability to generate quality chances. His shot-creating actions sit at 96, while his expected assisted goals (xAG) place him in the 92nd percentile. These numbers underline his dual threat – both as a scorer and creator. His assists rating of 85 further reinforces his importance as a forward who contributes beyond just goals.

Possession-based metrics are where Rodrygo shines brightest. He posts elite numbers across progressive carries (99), successful take-ons (97), and touches in the attacking penalty area (98). His ability to advance play and consistently beat defenders makes him one of the most dynamic ball carriers in world football. A pass completion of 99 and progressive passes in the 85th percentile show that his decision-making complements his technical skill, making him reliable in tight spaces and transition play.

Defensively, the chart shows more modest contributions, which is expected for an attacking forward. His tackling (47) and aerial duels (14) are limited, while interceptions (90) suggest a willingness to press and anticipate opposition movement.

Overall, Rodrygo's radar demonstrates a forward excelling in creative and attacking phases, ranking at the top end of Europe's elite in possession and offensive output. While defensive numbers are not his strongest area, his role clearly prioritises attacking productivity, making him a valuable asset for clubs looking for a wide forward who can score, create, and progress play effectively.

Nilson Angulo has had a fantastic start to the campaign with Anderlecht. The young Ecuadorian winger, who is likely going to be featuring at the World Cup next summer, has scored twice and grabbed three assists in just eight games this season. As a result, clubs have been interested, but recently Angulo said he would prefer to stay in Belgiu. However, that may now change. Rudy Galetti has revealed that Portuguese club Sporting CP have engaged in talks with Anderlecht over bringing the 22-year-old Angulo to Portugal. Sporting CP recently missed out on the signing of Yeremay from Deportivo so are looking for an alternative.

while Anderlecht are also keen to keep Angulo, that may change if the side fail to overcome AEK Athens in Conference League qualification. After a 1-1 draw in Brussels, the side travel to Greece tonight for the return leg. Missing out on European football will mean they need to bring the financial benefits into the club via player sales. Even with a positive result in Europe, if Sporting CP submit an offer that is too good to turn down, Anderlecht will likely allow Angulo to move to Lisbon.

Anderlecht and Sporting CP are no strangers to each other, with Zeno Debast having moved from Brussels to Lisbon in the past season.

Before there was a chance for any controversy to emerge surrounding Folarin Balogun's omission from Mauricio Pochettino's latest U.S. men's national team (USMNT) roster, the Monaco forward was belatedly called up.

Balogun earned his chance to face South Korea and Japan in a series of friendlies after Vancouver Whitecaps forward Brian White pulled out through injury. The 29-year-old sustained a hamstring strain during last weekend's victory over St. Louis, creating a gap in the roster which many already expected to be filled by Balogun.

Injury hampered much of the 2024–25 campaign for the former Arsenal striker, who was sidelined for the best part of six months with a dislocated shoulder and the surgery required to fix it. After getting back on the pitch in spring, Balogun was initially included in this summer's Gold Cup roster only for an ankle injury to force him out.

Balogun's most recent international appearance came back in September 2024, before Pochettino's reign even began. His last international win and goal was the opening game of the 2024 Copa América against Bolivia.

The 24-year-old had previously been considered to be USMNT's first-choice No. 9 and will be competing for a starting spot in September with Southampton's Damion Downs and Norwich City frontman Josh Sargent. 

Pochettino's initial choice of Vancouver's White over Balogun may have been a consequence of his lofty opinion of MLS. The top flight of North American soccer is widely considered to be inferior to Europe's elite divisions, yet the Argentine coach offered an impassioned counter-view at his squad announcement.

“We need to give MLS the value, because I think competing there, I think players can show that they can perform in the national team,” Pochettino told assembled media this week. “I think it's not necessary to move from MLS to Europe. Because sometimes MLS, under my assessment, maybe is more competitive than some leagues in Europe.”

Carlo Ancelotti has announced the Brazil squad for the upcoming FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia. This marks the Italian coach's second international break in charge, and he has named an exciting squad.

The 25-man squad includes 12 Premier League players, 2025 Champions League winner Marquinhos and FC Barcelona's incredible talent Raphinha. Brazil will play at the FIFA 2026 World Cup next summer, but Ancelotti's job is to make this group a contender for the title, not just a participant.

Wesley could start on the right side of the backline for Brazil. The ex-Flamengo player suffered a baptism of fire with the national team when Argentina smashed the 'Seleção' 4-1 in March. However, the young full-back has huge potential and keeps improving at club level.

Since that tricky night in Buenos Aires, Wesley has performed incredibly for Flamengo in Brazil, earning a $29 million move to Italian Serie A outfit Roma. Wesley slotted straight into Gian Piero Gasperini's starting line-up and scored the only goal on the opening day of the season as Roma defeated Bologna 1-0.

Kaio Jorge is the top scorer in the Brazilian league so far this season and he is leading a title charge for his club. The forward has notched 15 goals and five assists in 20 league matches. Jorge has been a revelation in domestic football this year and will likely be rewarded with his first ever minutes for Brazil on the international stage.

Jorge probably won't start ahead of the likes of Chelsea's João Pedro or Tottenham's Richarlison, but given that Ancelotti wants to experiment with his team, the boss will surely give the Cruzeiro star a chance to prove his worth. Jorge will have to take every chance he gets if he wants to keep a spot in the national team.

Estêvão enjoyed a short cameo in Chelsea's first Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace. The winger then registered an assist against West Ham on matchday two. An injury forced Cole Palmer out during the warm-up, so the young Brazilian came into the starting line-up and made no mistake in showing his quality at the very top level of club football.

The kid who shone in Brazil for Palmeiras, and impressed against Chelsea at the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup in the summer, is showing his quality faster than many expected. Just a couple of weeks into the season fans can expect 18 year-old Estêvão to play regular football for Chelsea and Ancelotti's Brazil. The dynamic attacker has an abundance of raw talent and can go all the way to the top, but can he become a Brazil starter ahead of the FIFA 2026 World Cup?

Domains created to take advantage of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 in the United States were recently found. It's a sign of what's to come for the big one – the 2026 World Cup.

According to PreCrime Labs, the threat research team at BforeAI, a cybersecurity company specializing in proactive threat prevention, many domains used this year have already been registered for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

“This highlights two key tactics used by attackers: they either repurpose old domains for new campaigns or register new ones well in advance,” said the researchers. 

“By ‘aging' these domains for a year or more, attackers can better avoid detection and improve their success rates as the event nears. We even discovered domains registered for the FIFA tournaments in 2030 and 2034.”

In their report, PreCrime says it has analyzed a set of 498 domains that contain FIFA, football (soccer), and World Cup-related brand terms (e.g., “worldcup,” “fifa,” “football”). 

These domains span a mix of obvious trademark typosquats, speculative registrations, generic fan, merchandise, and betting names, and community or amateur-football sites.

In one example, researchers found a domain with a page title that says “FIFA world cup schedule” to lure users searching for official match information. When they visit the site, they are met with a betting page. 

This is a common trend observed around mega sporting events, where adversaries abuse trending keywords to maximize search visibility and social media spread.

The page content is in Mandarin Chinese, but FIFA and official broadcasters don't actually use such channels for promotions. Prominent use of celebrity pictures and “official partner” keywords are used to establish legitimacy, which is not verifiable with FIFA's actual sponsor list. 

Claims like “ 巴 西 圣 保 罗 ” (Brazil São Paulo official partner) are used, but in Mandarin, to enhance credibility.

Another webpage promotes an “EV Map for World Cup 2026,” claiming to help traveling fans find hotels and restaurants with EV chargers. In fact, the campaign obviously aims to collect personally identifiable information through a B2B phishing scheme.

Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 

In this case, fake branding elements, especially those of payment partners (VISA), flags, and FIFA logo lookalikes, were strategically added to the domains.


Unsurprisingly, the most typical scams associated with large sporting events are websites with prominent call-to-action buttons to “Buy Tickets,” a classic high-risk lure for financial fraud. 


Major events tournaments such as global soccer events or huge concert tours predictably trigger spikes in fraud infrastructure: fake ticketing, counterfeit merchandise, unlawful streaming, betting lures, and generic “fan guide” pages used as lead-gen or phishing launchpads.

And the FIFA World Cup is undoubtedly the largest one out there. In 2022, when the tournament was held in Qatar, it engaged five billion fans across all media, FIFA said. 


    Cybernews researchers have discovered severe misconfigurations affecting two Tencent sites, exposing sensitive credentials and internal source code. The critical flaws could potentially grant full access to internal services and backend infrastructure within Tencent Cloud.

Arsenal and USWNT defender Emily Fox admits she was surprised to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or. (1:07)

The NWSL's transfer window is officially closed, and for the second straight time, it involved a world-record deal -- this time for an incoming player.

Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle moved from Tigres to the Orlando Pride last week and set the new women's global transfer record at $1.5 million, per ESPN sources. But there have been several other high-profile transfers involving NWSL players and some U.S. women's national team hopefuls, too.

Outgoing transfers and intra-league trades can still take place, but the transfer window is now closed for new summer arrivals in the NWSL. So, which transfers were the best for the respective player's career? Let's grade them and dig into what these moves mean for the future.

- How women's transfer record skyrocketed with Ovalle move
- NWSL Power Rankings: Orlando Pride are officially in a slump
- USWNT debutants ranked: All 24 players with first caps under Hayes

Grade: A-

Ovalle is known as La Maga (The Magician) for her audacious play, from the scorpion-kick goal seen round the world earlier this year for Tigres to last year's cheeky goal that lifted Mexico to its first win over the USWNT on American soil.

Ovalle is already a household name in Mexico. Her move to the NWSL in her prime at 25 years old will give her a global platform to showcase those skills and, if all goes to plan, fully insert herself into the conversation as one of the world's best.

Alexis Nunes and Ali Krieger discuss the potential record signing of Lizbeth Ovalle to Orlando Pride.

That plan requires Ovalle to become a focal point for Orlando, a team already blessed with depth and talent. She'll have at least a few months (if not more) to play alongside six-time World Player of the Year Marta. The recent season-ending injury to Barbra Banda also means that Ovalle will be needed even more immediately if the Pride want to repeat.

Orlando's 22 goals scored is the lowest among the top seven teams right now -- and Banda scored eight of those. The Pride are creating opportunities -- 26.3 expected goals, per FBref so Ovalle could be the missing piece.

A world-record transfer fee will come with pressure, however. How will she handle it?

Grade: B+

Fishel's move to Seattle was about the long term. Chelsea's roster is perpetually crowded, and Fishel has eyes on the 2027 World Cup with the USWNT. To be there and to be a prominent player for United States coach Emma Hayes (who signed her at Chelsea), Fishel needs more consistent reps as a bona-fide starting forward for her club.

That is what Seattle expects from her, evidenced by an NWSL record cumulative salary and that should play out in the long term.

Right now, Fishel is still assimilating into a new club after a relatively recent return from a torn ACL. She has played limited minutes off the bench in three games for Seattle. The Reign, and Fishel, are going to need time to adapt to one another.

Grade: B+

Sentnor's move from the NWSL's last-place team to the league leaders in August is another case of playing the long game.

There are valid short-term questions about how Sentnor fits into an already stacked Kansas City roster. Sentnor was the focal point and franchise player in Utah; in Kansas City, she is not a guaranteed starter, as talented as she is. Not right now, anyway.

Alexis Nunes is joined on Futbol W by Emily Keogh to discuss the rise of Utah Royals' Ally Sentnor.

But this move is about the future for a 21-year-old rising star -- which is why Kansas City paid an intra-league record $600,000 (plus potential add-ons) to sign her. Sentnor will be coached by Vlatko Andonovski, arguably the NWSL's most successful coach and a former USWNT coach who knows what is needed in that environment.

Kansas City isn't exactly overly young, either, with Debinha turning 34 in October and Bia turning 32 in December. Roster turnover is inevitable in the NWSL especially, and Sentnor is likely to become a long-term centerpiece for the Current. This move is about her development.

Grade: A

Rarely does the cliché of "a win-win" ring true, but it is a fitting description of this move.

Watt became the first signing for 2026 NWSL expansion team Denver Summit FC, which is a nice touch of history for the Colorado native. She gets to go home for a historic moment next year to anchor a new franchise, and Orlando get salary cap relief and extra funds to use on an already expensive roster (more on that soon).

Plus, Watt gets to finish the 2025 NWSL season with Orlando on loan, giving her a six-month runway to join her new team and relocate her life. She's also an important part of the Pride's push to repeat as NWSL champions.

Watt is exactly the type of player NWSL expansion teams need to establish success. Yes, there are likely more splashy signings to come, but Watt is a hard worker who contributes offensively with dynamic wing play, and she brings championship, veteran experience to Denver. And can establish herself as an early leader at the club.

Grade: B+

On one hand, Sanchez is a loss for San Diego and the NWSL. That she left San Diego just over a year after a then-NWSL record transfer from the Houston Dash is also a bit anticlimactic. The reality, however, is that Sanchez was fighting for minutes on an overhauled Wave roster being guided by a new head coach in Jonas Eidevall. Sanchez started in only three of her last eight games for the Wave before making the move back to Tigres, where she played earlier in her career.

Sanchez already has five goals for Tigres, which is among the league leaders. That's all a net positive for her, even if she has moved around a fair amount to end up back at Estadio Universitario.

Grade: A-

Cantore joined the Spirit from Juventus after a strong showing with Italy at Euro 2025, which further boosted her celebrity, and has settled into life in Washington nicely, already after scoring in her second NWSL appearance.

The 25-year-old fills a void on a Spirit team that has dealt with endless injuries or other absences, including at the forward position, and combines well with her new teammates, as she showed again in Saturday's 3-2 win over Bay FC.

She is like a magnet for the ball in the attack, and could be an important addition for the team that looks most ready to challenge the Kansas City Current's dominance come playoff time.

Soccer's governing body is spending millions on out-of-home advertising for the 2026 World Cup before a ball has even been kicked. That early push signals how global live events are becoming OOH's new frontier.

2026 World Cup logo / Fifa

Fifa has already poured more than $5m into out-of-home (OOH) advertising in Q2 2025 to promote the Fifa Club World Cup. That figure might look like a footnote in a $2.86bn quarter for the OOH industry, but it is more than just a one-off media buy. It is an early signal of how the governing body intends to use public space to build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup, now less than a year away.

OOH has long played a supporting role during global tournaments, but Fifa's spend this far in advance shows a shift in strategy. By dominating transit hubs, airports and city centers, the organization is creating a year-long build toward one of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Anna Bager, president and chief executive of the Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA), framed it this way in the group's latest report: OOH “mirrors the cultural and social moments that shape how people spend their time and is where brands show up to connect with audiences at scale.” For Fifa, that connection starts now.

Recent tournaments show how OOH becomes indispensable during shared cultural moments. At Euro 2024, brands spent more than €313m on OOH campaigns across Europe's biggest markets, turning fan zones and city squares into branded stages. Beyond static signage, activations included live score updates on digital screens, creative that shifted with match outcomes and branded experiences embedded directly into public viewing areas. These executions helped transform city centers into extensions of the stadium experience.

Digital OOH has only heightened that role. Programmatic buying now allows advertisers to adjust messaging in real time, align creative with match results and target audiences by location or context. The flexibility of digital formats means campaigns can scale quickly while remaining responsive to the highs and lows of live sport, something static placements cannot achieve on their own.

This evolution highlights why OOH has become one of the most engaging channels for fans during major events. Stadium crowds and fan festivals are not just gatherings of spectators; they are cultural canvases where brands can establish visibility and presence at scale.

The World Cup is one of the few events that commands attention on every continent and advertisers know it. OOH revenue in the US alone grew 3% in Q2 2025, with digital formats climbing 9.2% and transit advertising up nearly 9%. Financial services, communications, and real estate brands were among the fastest-growing categories. Tech and direct-to-consumer companies made up more than a quarter of the top 100 OOH advertisers, with names such as Apple, Netflix and Amazon leading the way.

Fifa's heavy spend puts it in line with those top-tier players but also highlights the unique role of live sport. While TV spots for the 2026 Super Bowl are already priced at more than $8m for 30 seconds, OOH offers Fifa the chance to saturate the real-world environments where fans live, travel and gather. From city-center fan festivals to screens outside stadiums, out-of-home gives the World Cup a physical presence months before kickoff.

If Fifa's $5m spend in Q2 is any indication, OOH is no longer just a backdrop for major tournaments. It is becoming one of the lead platforms, capable of delivering cultural ownership in the places fans experience sport together, on the streets, in transit and across every corner of the host cities.

England face Andorra at Villa Park and Serbia away in World Cup qualifiers; John Stones, Phil Foden, Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw among familiar faces available again after June defeat to Senegal; Jack Grealish, Mason Mount will hope for call, as well as U21 stars such as Adam Wharton

By Peter Smith and Rob Dorsett

Thomas Tuchel will be without key players Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Jude Bellingham when he names his squad for September's World Cup qualifiers but familiar faces will be pushing for a recall as preparations for next summer ramp up.

The June camp ended in embarrassment for Tuchel and England, with the team soundly beaten by Senegal after an underwhelming 1-0 win away to Andorra.

England's squad announcement takes place at 2pm on Friday - follow it on Sky Sports News and the Sky Sports website and App.

But with England's toughest test of qualifying - their trip to Serbia on September 9 - in this next double-header and subsequent international breaks in October and November, Tuchel is entering a pivotal part of his project to win the World Cup in North America in 2026. His squad, named on Thursday, should reflect that.

This will be his most substantial block of training and game time with his squad before the tournament - assuming England complete what now looks like a straightforward qualification - and also a period where players will be aiming to carve out clear roles in the head coach's plans. The time for experimenting is over.

It is significant, then, that of players who missed the previous squad, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Marc Guehi, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden are fit and available. Rashford, like Trent Alexander-Arnold, hasn't had a glittering start to life in Spain, but both seem primed to be involved.

Jack Grealish will also hope his two assists for Everton at the weekend will help to nudge him back into the frame. His inclusion or absence will be a major talking point either way.

Mason Mount may feel his prospects of adding to his 36 caps are on the rise after his involvement for Manchester United this term and the long chat he had with Tuchel after the opening-weekend defeat to Arsenal.

His United team-mate Shaw is also enjoying his football again, after a couple of injury-ravaged seasons. Interestingly, Myles Lewis-Skelly, who had come in at left-back for England, has begun both Arsenal games on the bench. Djed Spence, meanwhile, has helped Tottenham make a fast start with his performances at left-back.

Adam Wharton, Tino Livramento and Liam Delap - who missed the last camp due to the U21 Euros, although Delap instead linked up with Chelsea at the Club World Cup - could be in with the seniors this time.

But will Delap dislodge surprise summer pick Ivan Toney? Dominic Solanke will also be waiting on a recall after being omitted in June, despite helping Tottenham to a Europa League success.

Tuchel made the trip to Slovakia to watch the youth team win the Euros and it will be intriguing to see if any other members of Lee Carsley's group have impressed enough. Jarell Quansah has had a call-up from Tuchel previously and, after his victorious summer with the U21s, scored on his Bayer Leverkusen debut.

Elliot Anderson is also among the Young Lions most likely to get a shout, with central midfield still a conundrum. Kobbie Mainoo's lack of game time at Manchester United will surely count against a player once seen set to become an important figure in the middle of the park for his country.

James Maddison certainly won't be involved, given his injury lay-off, while Levi Colwill is another out for the long term.

It also looks probable Ben White's international absence will continue, with the right-back - who finally made himself available for selection again in the summer - missing Arsenal's game last weekend with injury. Conor Gallagher - a favourite of Tuchel's at Chelsea - has played just over an hour's worth of football so far this season for Atletico Madrid.

In goal, Jordan Pickford remains the clear No 1 with Dean Henderson and James Trafford called up as well for the last outing. They are expected to deputise again. Aaron Ramsdale has since moved to Newcastle but is currently behind compatriot Nick Pope in the club pecking order.

Will we get the odd surprise? Tuchel has thrown those up in each squad he has named so far - but the expectation is that a clearer idea of his primary World Cup contenders will emerge with his selections this week.

Latest from Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:

The FA's youth team coaches are considering promoting Max Dowman to England's U19 squad after his impressive debut for the Arsenal first team against Leeds United at the weekend.

The 15-year-old winger has been capped 16 times at U17 level, scoring five international goals, and was a key member of England's U17 squad in the summer, starting each of their three European Championship games.

Now there is a possibility he will jump another age group, in recognition of his progress in senior football. But for that to happen, because he is still a minor, it will need the agreement of both his family and Arsenal.

His development will be carefully managed - by club and country. His team-mate Ethan Nwanieri - the only Arsenal player to make his Premier League debut at a younger age than Dowman - was promoted to England's U21s in March, at the age of 17, after careful consideration of his readiness. He went on to be a key player for Lee Carsley's side as they retained their Euros crown in June, featuring in all six matches.

The feeling around Dowman, Sky Sports News has been told, is similar - in that many in the FA feel he is now ready to step up to the U19s, but more discussions will be held before any final decision is taken.

Mikel Arteta has no doubts about Dowman's pedigree, and his appetite for big games, saying after Saturday's match with Leeds: "There is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life. For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great."

The teenager has been involved with England's junior teams for several years, making his international debut for the U16s - and then the U17s - in 2024. However, the FA and Arsenal are mindful that he still has to take his GCSEs next spring and because of his age, he cannot play Champions League football until January 1 2026.

Dowman stood out in pre-season, coming off the bench on numerous occasions and impressing Mikel Arteta with the impact he made. That prompted the Arsenal boss to bring him on at the Emirates on Saturday - albeit with his side already 4-0 up. In doing so, at 15 years and 234 days old, Dowman became the second youngest player to feature for Arsenal.

Dowman instantly excited the home crowd with a number of runs down the right wing on Saturday, and won the penalty in stoppage time that Gyokeres converted for 5-0.

Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City.

At a Legislative Budget Committee meeting on Aug. 26, Kansas lawmakers received an update from Kansas City 2026, the nonprofit overseeing the strategy of hosting the World Cup. Some key details are still hazy, with fewer than 300 days to go before the start of the event.

Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium.

There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence.

"The team base camps are really the team's home away from home, those are the locations where teams will come and train to prep for the tournament," said Lindsey Douglas, chief operating officer for Kansas City 2026. "These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial."

In the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," the large tax and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump, allocated $625 million for a security at the 11 host cities. It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million.

About 650,000 visitors are expected to the Kansas City area through the duration of the World Cup. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days.

The event will double the number of teams playing from prior World Cups to 48. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game.

"The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, this will be the largest version of that sporting event in 2026. Even though soccer is one of many sports we follow here in the United States, by far at the world stage, it is the largest," Douglas said.

That many people coming to the region is anticipated to generate $653 million in direct economic impact. Kansas City 2026 said it's attempting to leverage the visitors and the economic impact for longer-term partnerships.

"We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this," Douglas said.

There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners.

The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000.

Kansas Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, the chair of the Legislative Budget Committee, raised concerns about the number of hotel rooms available for the influx of guests. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup.

"We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area," Douglas said. "We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. Also campgrounds are really looking at this as an opportunity as well. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have."

Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. The existing public transit networks aren't substantial enough to accommodate the number of visitors coming in.

School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest.

Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport.

FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.

GOAL breaks down all 36 participants in the latest edition of the European club game's most prestigious tournament

The Champions League is almost back! On Thursday, the eagerly-awaited draw for the league phase will take place in Monaco. Obviously, with this being a UEFA-run competition, the ceremony will needlessly take well over an hour, as the European game's governing body always insists on carrying out painfully awkward interviews while dishing out meaningless awards.

However, if last year's event is anything to go by, we should learn the computer-generated fixture lists for all 36 participants after about 75 minutes of tedium. After that, we'll be able to look forward to the actual football.  

With that in mind, GOAL is back again with its Champions League power rankings to let you know which sides are looking like potential winners ahead of the draw - and who could be in trouble from the get-go...

...

There was always a sense that Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph would come back to bite them at some stage, with fatigue and injuries potentially the biggest obstacles on the road to a successful season. Few, however, would have predicted it would be so soon.

With the new campaign a little over a week old, the Blues are already sweating on the fitness of their key player Cole Palmer, who, it transpires, has been carrying a groin injury ever since the tournament in the United States.

They will pray that the problem is nothing serious, but there is little doubt that Chelsea are already paying the price for their summer success in gruelling conditions, and if they aren't careful, this could be a recurring theme throughout what was supposed to be a season where they re-established themselves among England and Europe's elite.

Rather concerningly, this is an injury that Palmer has been carrying for some time, which means it may well have been exacerbated by Chelsea going all the way at the Club World Cup and the scaled-back pre-season that followed, with the gruelling summer tournament only reaching its conclusion in mid-July.

Following his last-minute withdrawal before the thumping victory over West Ham on Friday, apparently after painkillers failed to have the desired effect, head coach Enzo Maresca admitted his talisman had already been playing through the pain barrier in the season opener against Crystal Palace five days prior, where the attacker was criticised for a subdued performance in the goalless draw. The decision to start him there deserves some scrutiny if Palmer's absence proves to be a lengthy one.

"Cole in the last four or five days was not 100 per cent,” the Italian tactician revealed. "He tried the warm-up but he felt something. We preferred not to take any risks. We will see if it's something important or not. [It's in the] groin. For the Crystal Palace game, he was not 100% but he tried to make a big effort for the club, the fans and the team. He tried tonight, but it was not very good."

Palmer was underwent a scan on Tuesday, although it remains to be seen when the results of those tests will be revealed with Chelsea not due to play again until Saturday lunchtime when they host neighbours Fulham, by which time eight days will have passed since he pulled out of the West Ham clash.

According to Chelsea reporter Si Phillips, the attacker could be sidelined for up to six weeks, although there is optimism that his layoff will be shorter and that he might even be available immediately after the upcoming pause for World Cup qualifying action.

Although England almost certainly won't have Palmer at their disposal, Chelsea will consider the international break to be well-timed as their players prepare to disperse after the Fulham game. However, their key man could still miss Premier League clashes against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton in September, while the Blues will be desperate to have him available for the visit of champions Liverpool on Saturday, October 4, in just under six weeks' time.

Having played such a key role in getting the club there, the 23-year-old may also miss out on the Blues' first two fixtures back in the Champions League in mid- and late September, as well as the third round of the Carabao Cup.

Whatever the result of the scan, this injury is a crushing blow for Chelsea at such an early stage of a season that had offered renewed hope. It's common knowledge that Palmer has been a revelation since joining the Blues less than two years ago, emerging as a creative and goal-scoring force, but his durability is an underrated attribute.

Since his arrival from Manchester City, you can count the number of games he has missed at club level on one hand; in 2023-24 he only missed the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal through illness, and there was some strange symmetry last season as he sat out the same fixture due to a hamstring problem.

His international record is strangely more patchy; after being sidelined for two England games following the defeat at the Emirates in March, Palmer has only featured in three of his country's last 10 games, having withdrawn from two squads during Lee Carsley's interim reign following Euro 2024, and he is now set to miss another camp.

The attacker's club might think the international break comes at a good time, but this could still be his longest absence since joining Chelsea, and his most significant since a serious foot injury he suffered during his time at City in 2022.

There is little doubt that this is an injury that Palmer could have avoided or would have been less severe if it wasn't for Chelsea's run to unexpected glory at the Club World Cup, where the 23-year-old was their hero once again as he dismantled European champions Paris Saint-Germain almost singlehandedly in the final. Ironically, it was a performance that led to much of the optimism around Stamford Bridge at the start of the new season, which has now been diminished in light of Palmer's setback.

Despite the west Londoners often coming up against relatively weaker opposition in the U.S., Palmer was only rested for the clash against Morocco's Esperance - clocking up more than 550 minutes in six games over the course of just under a month. It is believed that this groin problem flared up at some point during the tournament, where matches were invariably played in excruciating and physically draining heat and humidity.

It's easy to forget that he was involved in the completely misguided post-season England camp in June, too, needlessly playing in what should have been a routine win over Andorra before warming the bench against Senegal.

In normal circumstances, Palmer would have had ample time in pre-season to recover, but going all the way at the Club World Cup has come at a cost. After the final on July 13, the squad was afforded just three weeks off before reporting back for training in early August as part of their scaled-back warm-up plans, with Palmer playing more than 100 minutes across their two friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan on the same weekend when, evidently, he wasn't fully fit.

Inevitably, Palmer's imminent absence has led to scepticism over how Maresca's men will handle their upcoming games. Speaking before the West Ham clash, Sky Sports pundit and Chelsea fan Paul Merson said: "If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have.

"Palmer is the talk of the town in team talks against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea."

The ex-Arsenal man continued: "It's not just all on Palmer because the coach has to come up with solutions, too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it."

Of course, the Blues handled their business pretty well without him at the London Stadium in a thumping 5-1 victory, although some atrocious defending from a West Ham side in disarray at the start of the campaign contributed to all of their goals.

Nevertheless, it was a victory that led Maresca to effuse that Chelsea are not the one-man team that some of their detractors believe them to be, as his side delivered a cohesive performance despite the absence of their lynchpin, with five different names on the scoresheet.

"The ones that say we are 'just a Cole team', for sure Cole is our best player no doubt," the Italian said. "For sure with Cole we are (a) much better team, but I think we already showed last year in the two or three months where Cole was not 100%, when we achieved top four that no one expected."

And in fairness, if this injury is a precursor to Palmer being unavailable or ineffective more often, then the contributions of Estevao Willian and Joao Pedro in particular will be very encouraging. The former was Palmer's replacement in the starting line-up and collected the Player of the Match award after a dazzling performance that belied his tender years, including a scintillating dart to the byline before pulling the ball back for an Enzo Fernandez tap-in, while the latter scored a simple header and laid on two more for his team-mates from his sidelined colleague's No.10 position.

Behind the scenes, Chelsea may well be working on a more permanent solution. The Premier League giants are still pursuing RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons as we enter the final days of the transfer window, with the Dutchman a player capable of shouldering the creative and attacking burden that so often falls on Palmer. However, it seems his arrival will be contingent on outgoings.

Meanwhile, Barcelona's Fermin Lopez is the latest creative player to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge as the Blues look to capitalise on a bloated midfield in Catalunya, with talks opened with his representatives and a €50 million (£43m/$58m) offer supposedly lodged. Again, that clearly suggests Chelsea view acquiring cover for their talisman as something of a priority, before it's too late.

Whatever happens before the deadline on September 1, it's clear Chelsea need to alleviate the workload on their No.10. They might get away with this particular injury being a minor one, but as the fixtures pile up and the season progresses, they risk losing Palmer for a much longer period after a rest-less summer.

Mauricio Pochettino named a U.S. national team roster for the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan that left out some familiar names and top emerging players.

That sparked short-term questions — how will the USA fare against a pair of Asian powers? — and long-term speculation about Pochettino's selection process heading toward the 2026 World Cup.

Big picture/Small picture issues

It is possible to examine this roster for both the short- and the long-term implications. Pochettino helped explain during Tuesday's media call with several key statements. 

First, he quantified the USMNT player pool and said he was tracking 60-65 players on a weekly basis to monitor their progress. 

Second, he said this was the last camp with the possibility of bringing in new faces (at least in significant numbers). 

Third, and most importantly, he addressed the nature of needing roster spots to become more competitive within the squad. In a specific point that addressed the nature of the roster, he said he didn't have “A team” players or “B team” players as the media and fans like to refer to teams. Often this leads to the assumption that only a few players are competing for roster spots while others are “locks” who can take their spots for granted. 

“We respect and have full respect for all the players who can be called by us,” Pochettino said. “All need to feel the possibility to fight for a place. If we want to be a team that is really competitive, we cannot nominate 13, 14, 16 players and say for sure these guys will arrive at the World Cup and the rest need to fight for a place. 

“Come on, that is not the real sport of football. When you see national teams that have won World Cups, you really understand what that means.

“Players need to feel the threat from your teammates They need to defend their place every single possibility they have with the national team.”

Many fans were critical of the roster. Even giving full respect to a coach of Pochettino's stature, some of the picks were tough to comprehend. But critics of the roster must ask: What, exactly, makes this team exempt from an overhaul? What about the team over the past 16 months is worth clinging to? 

At the Copa America and at the Nations League, the team played far below the sum of its parts. The Gold Cup was somewhat better but even then, Pochettino was limited with roster constraints. 

If Pochettino wants to change the direction of the team, he can't call back the same core each camp, which was a valid criticism during the later years of Gregg Berhalter's tenure. The few new faces that would occasionally emerge would then have a harder time finding their way because the large core would dictate the culture. 

To get to the heart of it, this roster is about cleaning the slate. 

This camp is about making players work for call-ups, and when they get back into camp, having a new tone. It is sending a message to players.  

An important takeaway: the players not in camp are just as important as the players who are on this roster. Pochettino wants to see those who were left off respond the way Josh Sargent has (scoring goals in each of Norwich's first four games this season). 

Pochettino wants to see desperation for call-ups, not players simply assuming they'll be invited. Then once they're in camp, they know they must perform to earn playing time. 

Pochettino inherited a flawed team whose core has been together for over half a decade. It's a process to fix it. It's not about a few simple tactical adjustments but rather more drastic measures. 

We don't yet know how the team will look in October. But the players in this camp have a huge opportunity to boost their stock. The players not in this camp simply have to work harder and perform better. Pochettino and his staff are watching their club performances. 

Here's a position-by-position look at things.

Goalkeeping

Pochettino has turned the goalkeeping position on its head. Not since Tim Howard or Brad Guzan were in the picture has the USMNT willingly dropped Matt Turner, Zack Steffen or Ethan Horvath in a FIFA calendar window. Then, on top of that, 2024 Olympic team goalkeeper Patrick Schulte has also been dropped. 

Matt Freese is a great example of how things can change for a player. With Pochettino wanting to look at different options beyond Turner, Freese was given the starting Gold Cup spot when Schulte and Steffen were injured. A bad mistake against Haiti aside, he took advantage of the opportunity. He's now fighting to possibly be a World Cup starter.

Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.

NEW YORK -- "Venus, she's a legend. She's an icon. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters."

Leylah Fernandez said that matter of factly, on the rooftop of the player clubhouse at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio during a casual conversation in early August.

Less than a month later, in a scene she likely would not have predicted, she was sharing a court with her idol on Louis Armstrong Stadium in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans who were no doubt thrilled to have one more opportunity to see Venus play. 

And the result was a good one for the American-Canadian pairing. The duo, which accepted a wild card into the US Open doubles draw on Tuesday, upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in their first-round matchup on an unseasonably windy day in Queens. (It was downright uncomfortable if you were dressed for summer, though the fired-up crowd hardly seemed to notice.)

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Towering over her partner -- a former US Open singles finalist and doubles quarterfinalist -- and looking at times like a big sister, the 45-year-old Williams earned her first win in three New York tries after bowing out in the revamped mixed doubles tournament last week and losing to Karolina Muchova on Monday.

It looked bleak to start, with Williams and Fernandez falling behind 5-2 in the first set, but they rallied to even it at 5. And with the thunderous crowd firmly in their corner, they eked out the tiebreak to take the first set and grab firm control of the match.

"I have no idea what I was thinking during that tiebreak," Fernandez, who's into the third round in the singles draw, said with a laugh. "I think I just kind of went on instincts. Venus said it perfectly. Play it as if it was a singles match. So I just didn't want to think too much. ... No, I just wanted to go out there, play, and I had full confidence with Venus at the net and even in the baseline."

The next set was far less dramatic, as the unseeded pair jumped out to a 4-1 lead and comfortably closed it out. They seemed to gel and complement each other more effectively as the match wore on, finding a rhythm that kept their opponents off balance and defensive. 

Communication was key in establishing that cadence. 

"I'm used to being the big sister," Williams told reporters after the match, "so I'm kind of asking her what she wants. It's important for her to feel comfortable. Theoretically I have more experience, but she's been playing a lot more matches, so maybe that makes us neck and neck in terms of how we can compete.

"But I think we just had to see what happened, because you never know what's going to happen in a match and you have to adjust. Once we got down, I feel like we just put our foot on the gas."

It was a full circle moment for the 22-year-old Fernandez, who remembers practicing with Venus outside of Lexington, Kentucky back in 2020. She was new to the Hologic WTA Tour at the time and didn't know many players, and the gesture was a meaningful one.

"I thought I was going to be very intimidated, but she was super nice and welcoming," Fernandez recalled during the Cincinnati Open.

She certainly appeared nice and welcoming again on Thursday, as the two embraced after securing the win. 

This was Williams' first doubles victory in Queens in 11 years, though she's certainly no stranger to doubles success at this venue. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion won the doubles tournament here in 1999, alongside her sister Serena, and the pair won it a second time in 2009.

Williams and Fernandez will play Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri in the second round on Saturday.

Fifty-five years after the Original 9 took a stand, Billie Jean King gathered rising talents in New York with Ilana Kloss, Leslie Allen and Shelby Rogers to remind them that tennis greatness is measured not only in trophies, but in impact.

From dazzling fans with her athletic brilliance to reshaping the business of sport as a tournament owner and entrepreneur, Billie Jean King has spent decades entertaining, empowering and elevating the game. Her legacy isn't just etched in her remarkable collection of tournament trophies; it's embedded in the DNA of women's tennis. 

Now in its 28th year, the Billie Jean King Power Hour, created and organized by the WTA, is a cornerstone of the WTA's mentor-driven education initiatives and a core program of the WTA's Player Development.

This year's session, hosted by King in the US Open's Arthur Ashe building, brought together emerging WTA stars alongside impactful former players Ilana Kloss, Leslie Allen and Shelby Rogers to reflect, connect and ignite change.

Aligned with the WTA's Rally the World campaign, the Power Hour is both a celebration and a challenge. It calls on every WTA player to recognize their role in a global entertainment property, one that champions equality, unity, and advancement. Players don't just win matches on the WTA Tour; they win battles for recognition, visibility and respect.

Players are reminded of the bold stand taken 55 years ago by the Original 9 alongside the visionary leadership of promoter Gladys Heldman. Together, these courageous women created the Virginia Slims Circuit and laid the foundation for today's thriving Hologic WTA Tour.

King's message to this year's cohort of players was clear: “You are here because someone fought for you. Now it's your turn to fight for the next generation.”

Players were encouraged to dream big, push boundaries, and use their stages to elevate current and future generations. Through storytelling, shared experiences, and candid conversations, the event reinforced that greatness isn't just measured in trophies, it's measured in impact.

Among the promising talents who attended the 2025 Power Hour in New York were Alyssa Ahn, Emiliana Arango, Hailey Baptiste, Lois Boisson, Louisa Chirico, Fiona Crawley, Thea Frodin, Amelia Honer, Suzan Lamens, freshly crowned Montréal champion Victoria Mboko, Annika Penickova, Kristina Penikcova, Tatiana Prozorova, Zeynep Sonmez, Moyuka Uchijima and Akasha Urhobo.

Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach.

NEW YORK -- There have been times this year when Naomi Osaka expressed frustration at her lack of progress after returning to tennis as a mother. But as the North American summer hard-court season sweeps to a conclusion, it's clear she again has that championship gleam in her eye.

Thursday's 6-3, 6-1 win over Hailey Baptiste was a study in controlled aggression. Despite the swirling wind, the four-time Grand Slam champion was a composed, serene presence in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Osaka, who needed only 70 minutes to win, busted out the big strokes only when necessary.

On Saturday, the No. 23-seeded Osaka will play the winner of the later match between No. 15 Daria Kasatkina and Kamilla Rakhimova.

It's probably not a coincidence that since coach Tomasz Wiktorowski joined her team in Montreal, Osaka has won eight of nine matches.

Asked on court what he's bringing to her game, Osaka dodged the question.

“I can't give up my secrets,” she said, laughing. “But he definitely makes me see tennis in a different way -- and you can see it in the way I'm playing recently.”

Osaka's signature strokes -- a powerful serve and a forehand to go with it -- still get most of the attention. She had seven aces (and no double faults) in her first-round victory over Greet Minnen.

But it's her new-and-improved return game that suggests she might soon return to Top 10 form. It's been a point of emphasis for Wiktorowski.

“I feel like with Tomasz we've been working a lot on my returns,” Osaka told reporters, “and I feel more confident. So I think that's a really big point for me, because I feel like I was able to focus and kind of break back immediately when I needed to.”

Her return position appears to be slightly deeper -- she was about five feet off the baseline against Baptiste -- and “it's made me a lot more comfortable returning.”

In her two matches, Osaka is 11-for-14 in break-point conversions.

In perhaps the most telling statistic in tennis, she has won an extraordinary 41 of 54 (.759) second-serve return points.

Osaka, who turned heads with her red-sparkle ensemble in the opening round, came out for her second match awash in purple from head to toe. After playing the first several games with her hair down, she quickly fashioned it into a bun -- and her game picked up noticeably.

The No. 47-ranked Baptiste and Osaka had played two previous matches, earlier this year on hard courts in Auckland and Miami, and both went the three-set distance before Osaka prevailed. This time, Osaka asserted herself early and often, with service breaks in the second and sixth games.

The second set was much the same, with breaks coming from Osaka in the first, fifth and seventh games. Baptiste reached the second round at the US Open for the first time, following best-ever results at Roland Garros (fourth round) and Wimbledon (third round).

Osaka, who won US Open titles in 2018 and 2020, is now 20-5 in second-round matches at the Grand Slams and 7-1 in New York.

The world No. 1 spoke with Ostapenko following her confrontation with Taylor Townsend.ByDavid KanePublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 28, 2025

NEW YORK—Aryna Sabalenka revealed she spoke with Jelena Ostapenko in the immediate aftermath of the No. 25 seed's dramatic second-round crash out to Taylor Townsend at the 2025 US Open.“During our conversation, I didn't know what happened,” the world No. 1 said in answer to a question from *Bounces* following her second-round victory over Polina Kudermetova.What happened: Ostapenko castigated a victorious Townsend for failing to acknowledge a lucky netcord in the first set of the latter's 7-5, 6-1 victory, accusing Townsend of having “no class and no education” before getting booed off a packed Court 11 on Wednesday.“Well, I have to say that she's nice,” said Sabalenka. “You know, she just sometimes can lose control. She has some things in life to face and some struggles. I was just trying to help her to…face it more in mature way, but I was just trying to help her to settle down and kind of, like…just was someone she could speak to and just let it go.”

Sabalenka herself suffered an emotional lapse when she fell in the final of Roland Garros to Coco Gauff, later apologizing for post-match press comments that disparaged Gauff's play.“You know, I think she just sometimes can just lose control over her emotions, which [is] pretty tough,” Sabalenka continued. “I really hope that one day she will figure herself and she will handle it much better.”Read more: Ostapenko comments “came from an ugly place”Asked to clarify whether she believed Ostapenko was going through personal issues, Sabalenka said:I think so, yeah.

You just don't understand what's going on in the moment.I'm pretty sure, looking back, she's not happy with her behavior.Ostapenko was not immediately apologetic on social media, continuing to insist in since-deleted Instagram stories that Townsend owed her an apology for the netcord shot, adding that Townsend's preference to begin her pre-match warm-up broke an unwritten tennis rule.“Situations like that motivate me to work even harder,” wrote Ostapenko, who will be back on court Thursday for her first round of women's doubles with Barbora Krejcikova against No. 11 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani.

The Tennis Channel Live panel praised Townsend's response, saying, “She stood on business.”ByDavid KanePublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 28, 2025

NEW YORK—The Tennis Channel Live panel condemned Jelena Ostapenko's on-court comments to Taylor Townsend at the US Open while praising Townsend for her response in press at the 2025 US Open.Ostapenko claimed Townsend owed her an apology for not acknowledging for a lucky netcord after the 7-5, 6-1 second-round scoreline, later accusing the American of having “no class and no education.”“It came from an ugly place and there's no space for that in the sport,” said TC Analyst Prakash Amritraj.“Like in a lot of situations, you have to consider the source. When someone's going personal like this, you have to consider where it's coming from. Ostapenko hasn't been great in a lot of these situations as you can imagine and a lot of people have pointed out. But Taylor didn't sink to Ostapenko's level, she rose above it. At the end of the day, it's going to affect you more if you get dragged into the mud, and I think Taylor did what was right for her and set a great example for everyone else.”

Ostapenko drew Townsend into a lengthy argument following her 7-5, 6-1 defeat.

Townsend spoke at length about the incident after the match, clarifying while there was no pre-existing beef between herself and the No. 25 seed, “I'm just not going to tolerate disrespect. You're not going to disrespect me in my face.”“It was just factual, totally classy,” TC Analyst Paul Annacone said of Townsend's comments. “It wasn't emotional. She just kind of said, ‘Look, stuff happens in the heat of the moment. I didn't back down.'“I just thought it was so well done and it doesn't surprise me at all. Taylor Townsend is a class act and an amazing competitor. I'm just so proud of her, that she's playing great tennis and that she stated fact, and lives to play another day.”Townsend will next face No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva for the chance to reach the fourth round of the US Open for the second time in her singles career.

Defending US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the third round with a 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Polina Kudermetova on Wednesday. Earlier in the night, Jasmine Paolini overcame 17-year-old American Iva Jovic, winning 6-3, 6-3 to advance herself to the third round as well.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka was broken in the opening game Wednesday night and tested throughout by Polina Kudermetova, but ultimately showed the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd why she's the defending US Open champion.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Sabalenka prevailed 7-6 (4), 6-2 in 1 hour and 36 minutes to reach the third round and keep her title defense on track.

The win marks her 30th career main-draw victory at the US Open.

“In the first set, I was super tight and super aggressive,” Sabalenka said after the match. “It felt like there were almost no points. It was more about the serve and first shot and it was super quick. I'm glad that I was able to handle that pressure and put it back on her and get that first set.

“Then in the second set, I felt much better on the return game and my serve was much better. So, I'm really glad that in the first set I stayed really strong.”

Wednesday's second-round match was their second meeting of 2025, after Sabalenka defeated Kudermetova in January to win the Brisbane International title.

As she did in Australia, Kudermetova gave the World No. 1 everything she could handle in the first set this time around.

After Sabalenka saved four break points in the first game, Kudermetova finally converted the fifth chance to go up an early break. Sabalenka responded immediately, breaking back in the next game, but Kudermetova's barrage of forehand winners kept the pressure on, forcing a tiebreak

That's when “Tiebreakalenka” lived up to her nickname, winning her 19th tiebreak of the season in 20 attempts.

“I don't know,” Sabalenka said. “I'm just trying to stay aggressive. I'm trying to fight for every point, and I know that every point can be a key moment of the set, so I'm just trying to stay strong and I'm just trying to play aggressive.”

After trading holds early in the second set, Sabalenka struck first, breaking for a 2-1 lead. Following a medical timeout for Kudermetova's right knee during the ensuing changeover, the defending champion pulled away, securing a second break to close out the match.

Sabalenka will face 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the third round.

The two have faced each other just once in their careers, having last met in the semifinals of the aforementioned 2021 US Open, when Fernandez won in three sets.

Jasmine Paolini advanced to the third round of the US Open for the second consecutive year, defeating 17-year-old American Iva Jovic 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday night.

Paolini power 👊@JasminePaolini advances on as she defeats Jovic 6-3, 6-3.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/e5qIwopA7G

Paolini broke Jovic's serve five times in the 1-hour, 26-minute match.

Despite the scoreline, the contest was competitive, with Paolini saving her best stuff for the biggest moments, saving nine break points out of the 11 she faced.

The Italian now holds a 2-0 record against Jovic in head-to-head matchups.

Next, Paolini will face former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round. It will be their first meeting in a WTA Tour main draw.

NEW YORK — Can lightning strike twice for Alexei Popyrin at the US Open?For the second year in a row, the Australian is set to face the tournament's defending champion, this time world No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday.Last year, Popyrin shocked the tennis world with his third-round win over Novak Djokovic, who was chasing his record 25th Grand Slam title. Now he's hoping for more of the same after defeating Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3) to set up a second-round meeting with Sinner.Read More: The unquenchable fire in Novak Djokovic—and Venus Williams“Jannik is the best in the world, and he's one of the best for a reason,” Popyrin told press on Tuesday. “But I don't feel too starstruck by the occasion. I've been in that position before—I think last year is a great example of it.“For me, I feel like if I can stick to my game, if I can play the way I want to play, then I can cause trouble.”

“For me, I feel like if I can stick to my game, if I can play the way I want to play, then I can cause trouble.”

That Djokovic win was a career highlight. It was Popyrin's third Grand Slam meeting with Djokovic that year, having taken sets off him at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon before Djokovic prevailed. But in New York, Popyrin turned the tables, arriving fresh after winning his biggest title to date at the ATP Masters 1000 in Montreal and stunning Djokovic in four sets.This season has been different. Currently ranked No. 36, Popyrin's best results are quarterfinal runs in Monte Carlo and Toronto. Without a title coming into the US Open, he admits confidence isn't quite as high but says he's leaning on his experience and preparation.“I think there's a game plan to beat anybody, I think everybody has some sort of weakness,” he said. “A lot of the top guys, they hide it really really well… But I feel like everyone does have a weakness.”“I just have to focus on myself, just have to focus on what I'm doing,” he added. “For me, that's playing aggressive and playing my game. I have to focus on myself and just doing what I've been doing in the last couple of months, because it's been working.”

Popyrin actually holds the head-to-head edge over Sinner, though their only meeting came on clay in Madrid in 2021—a lifetime ago considering the Italian's surge to the top. Sinner is now world No. 1 and the reigning champion at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open.“He's just an unbelievable ballstriker,” Popyrin said of Sinner. “You give him a little bit of time, if you give him a slow ball, he'll put you away. If you hit the same rhythm to him all the time, he'll be unbelievable.“His serve has improved over the years, and I think that's what got him to where he is now… his returns are good. He's just an all-around great player and an unbelievable mover too.”

Just over a week ago, Sinner was forced to retire from the Cincinnati final against Carlos Alcaraz due to illness, which also kept him out of US Open mixed doubles with Katerina Siniakova.👉 Read More: Jannik Sinner feeling healthy after virus derailed Cincinnati final, US Open mixedSinner looked fully recovered on Monday, cruising past Vit Kopriva 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.

Carlitos hit cleanly and stayed in command. His talented opponent, Mattia Bellucci, tight for two sets, never showed what he can do.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—It only took two games for the first sign of trouble to appear.Mattia Bellucci was serving at 0-1, 15-40 versus Carlos Alcaraz. That the 65th-ranked player in the world would go down an immediate break against a five-time Grand Slam champ was hardly a shock, or a disaster in a best-of-five-set match. This was the first time the 24-year-old Italian had played under the bright lights in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Alcaraz, of course, knows that super-charged atmosphere well. You might say he embodies it.So it wasn't the fact that Bellucci ended up losing his serve in the second game of the match that seemed so ominous, it was the way he lost it. At 15-40, he fired a serve and followed it with a forehand winner. One break point down. At 30-40, he fired another serve, drew a short reply from Alcaraz, and moved in for the kill. It looked for a split second that he would get himself out of the jam, and get on the board early—always a plus for an Ashe rookie.But instead of knocking off that short forehand at the peak of its bounce, Bellucci waited for the ball to come down a bit. And then, possibly because he wanted to see which way Alcaraz was going, he waited some more. When Bellucci finally swung, he could no longer pound it straight down. He had to use topspin to get it over the net and back down in the court. He didn't use enough, the ball went long, and he was broken.

Sorry, I gotta do my job. Carlos Alcaraz, to the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd

Bellucci was clearly tight and hesitant. Typically, a player in his position will lose the first set quickly, and then loosen up somewhere in the second, once he gets a couple holds under his belt. Bellucci did the first thing—he lost the opening set 6-1. But he never loosened up in the second, and lost it 6-0.Playing on Ashe at night is one thing. Doing it against an in-form and not-nervous Alcaraz, who has been spotted an early lead, is another, much worse proposition. An opponent of his can normally count on him dropping his level, donating you a few wild errors, and maybe helping you to a break of serve. But that wasn't the Alcaraz we saw on Wednesday. He was clean and in command. He won 86 percent of his first-serve points, had 17 break points on Bellucci's serve, was 14 of 18 at net, and hit 32 winners while holding his opponent to 11.“I played great, to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” Alcaraz said after his 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 win. “I tried to make the most of his mistakes, getting a good good rhythm.”

That said, the most important stat of the night was Bellucci's winner-to-error ratio: He hit 11 of the former, and made 35 of the latter. Even in the third set, when he had finally relaxed and Alcaraz had lost a little focus, Bellucci couldn't keep the ball in long enough to create any scoreboard pressure.“I know Mattia's level, and today wasn't his day,” Alcaraz said, while apologizing to the crowd for not making the match last longer.“Sorry, I gotta do my job.”

“Sorry, I gotta do my job.”

When I saw the draw, I won't say I circled this match, but I did think it would be interesting and potentially entertaining for a night crowd. When he's feeling good, Bellucci has a wide repertoire of shots and superb touch. His run to the semis in Rotterdam earlier this year, where he beat Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, was memorable. He killed them with his jumping backhand drop shot.But I can only remember Bellucci daring to hit that shot once against Alcaraz on Wednesday. It won him the point with a brilliantly angled short backhand, but it was a one-off, a glimpse of what could have been. Bellucci lost to Alcaraz, but he lost first to Ashe.As for the winner, he moves on to the third round, and a date with another, higher-ranked Italian, Luciano Darderi.

NEW YORK—Aryna Sabalenka has battled through some late nights at the US Open, starting one match after midnight en route to her 2024 title.The defending champion could have been in for a similarly late finish as she was scheduled to follow former champion Carlos Alcaraz and close out the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium.But Alcaraz came through for Sabalenka on Wednesday night, posting a one-hour, 36-minute victory over Mattia Bellucci and paving the way for Sabalenka to ease into the third round by 11PM.To say Sabalenka was relieved was an understatement:

Q. Last year you started a match here after midnight, I believe. You started much more on time tonight, and you finished relatively early. How big a difference does that make in your recovery?ARYNA SABALENKA: Oh, thank you, Carlos. Thank you so much for finishing that match in three sets and making it quick and not too much of a wait for me, because I hate playing the second after 7:00 after guys.It's the worst. Especially when you play in the later stages of the tournament when the matches get tighter, and there's, like, five sets, and you are, like, it's 12:00, and you're still waiting.I'm super happy that he did it really quick, and I went on court on time. Now I'll be back, and I'll have some more time to recover.The top seed navigated a tough first set against Polina Kudermetova before racing through the second, putting together a 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory in an identical time of one hour and 36 minutes, reaching the third round at Flushing Meadows for a fifth straight year.Sabalenka will next face Leylah Fernandez in a rematch of their 2021 semifinal, a match Fernandez won in three in three sets and the world No. 1 initially claimed not to remember.“Of course, I do remember a couple of things,” she clarified, “and I love revenge. So, I'm actually super excited facing her here again.”Sabalenka is scheduled to take on Fernandez on Friday—not too late, perhaps Alcaraz willing.

"I designed this outfit a while ago," Osaka revealed in her post-match press conference. "I just thought it would be really fun to do a New York under the lights. I'm glad that my first match was a night match, because this outfit was really fun to play in."Completing her walkout look: a red embellished jacket, matching headphones—and a red bejeweled Labubu figurine with its own blue racquet, which she proudly showed off post-match.“This is my Labubu!” she told the crowd with a grin. “She's named Billie Jean Bling—not Billie Jean King, Billie Jean Bling.”

Osaka has worn a floral-inspired Nike kit at nearly every Grand Slam this year. At the Australian Open, she rocked a sunflower-themed kit, complete with matching clips and earrings. At Roland Garros, she went full ‘sakura' with cherry blossom nails and magical girl-inspired hair.At Wimbledon, however, she hit pause on the floral looks, opting for a more understated white outfit after an early exit in Paris.“Since it's Wimbledon and I haven't really seen anyone doing anything, I felt like I was being the extra one again,” Osaka told press in London. “Spoiler alert, but the US Open (outfit) is really extra.”

Townsend shrugged off the net incident, saying “You're not going to disrespect me in my face.”ByDavid KanePublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 28, 2025

NEW YORK—“This is the type of day you all live for,” Taylor Townsend told the media as she sat down for her post-match press conference at the 2025 US Open.Townsend had just clinched a 7-5, 6-1 win over Jelena Ostapenko that devolved into near-bedlam as the No. 25 seeded-Ostapenko lashed out at her victorious opponent at net, accusing her of having “no class and no education,” drawing boos from the Court 11 crowd.“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

“It's competition. People get upset when they lose,” Townsend said on court immediately after the match.

I chalk it up to being upset and, you know, she pulled out all the stops to try and break the momentum. Sometimes people do that, but it is what it is. Still, there's no beef. But again, like you guys saw, I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter. Taylor Townsend

“I didn't back down because you're not going to insult me, especially after I carried myself a certain type of way with nothing but respect,” she added in press. “If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. That's just the fact of the matter.“I think that that's tennis, right? You know no matter what's going on, it's me versus you, but at the end of the day we have to respect each other and respect what happens out on the court. It's competition.“So, you know, it was unfortunate, but…it's something I can put on my TikTok!”

“So, you know, it was unfortunate, but…it's something I can put on my TikTok!”

Ostapenko wrote a statement after the match on her Instagram stories, later posting an update to deny allegations that her outburst had racist undertones. (IG/@jelena.ostapenko).

By the time Townsend had taken the podium for her press conference Ostapenko, who had not been requested by the media in the event that she lost her second round, posted a statement to social media accusing Townsend of being “very disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding moment and didn't say sorry.“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was the first time ever that this happened to me on tour.”Ostapenko, who later denied the outburst had racist understones on her Instagram stories, further accused Townsend of breaking a rule by to start their pre-match warm-up at the net, something Townsend said she does before every match.

“You know, this isn't the first, second, third, fourth time I've played Jelena, so if she's complaining about how I warm up, that's fine,” said Townsend. “You can go back to the time that I played my first-ever pro tennis match, and I've been doing this since even juniors. It wasn't anything targeted towards her to try and take her off of her game or her rhythm. You know, I just was doing my thing.“Honestly, laugh at it. I think it's comical. I think that it's kind of funny, because to then go online and have to justify what you said, you obviously feel some type of way and feel like you have to give an explanation for how you acted. I don't feel like I have to explain how I acted. I think it was very self-explanatory. I'm standing in what I said.”Though she called this behavior part of Ostapenko's “MO,” Townsend said she bore no ill will against the former French Open champion after the match, the top-ranked doubles player dismissing the suggestion that Ostapenko be barred from competing in the doubles event as a result of the incident.

The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here sitting in front of you guys moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important. She's packed up and she's gone. I'm here, and that's the only thing that matters. Taylor Townsend

“I'm an Aries, so I'm a fire sign. I wore fire today. Maybe that's why I was fired up. I was ready to go,” she said with a laugh.“Yeah, I mean, this is one of the reasons why I love sports. You know, to be able to watch the tension and watch things and to see how someone can handle themselves in the moment. You know, how they handled their emotions, how they handle ups and downs, how they handle momentum shifts, you know, things that are thrown in the mix of whether it's to try and break your rhythm, break your momentum, how do they handle it mentally?“The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk,” she added as the press conference concluded. “Because ultimately, I'm the one here sitting in front of you guys moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important.

NEW YORK (AP)—Daniil Medvedev was fined a total of $42,500 by the US Open on Wednesday—more than a third of his $110,000 tournament prize money—for his meltdown during a first-round loss after a photographer wandered onto the court during the match.Tournament referee Jake Garner docked Medvedev $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and another $12,500 for racket abuse. When the match ended, Medvedev repeatedly smacked a racket against his sideline chair, destroying the equipment.Medvedev, a former No. 1-ranked player who won the championship at Flushing Meadows in 2021, was angered on Sunday night when chair umpire Greg Allensworth decided to allow opponent Benjamin Bonzi another first serve after the bizarre interruption.Bonzi was a point from winning while leading 5-4 in the third set when the photographer—whose credential was later revoked—began walking along the side of the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium just after a fault.Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay. Medvedev approached the official to complain, and that is when things got wild. The crowd began booing and chanted, "Second serve!" In all, play was held up for more than six minutes as Medvedev riled up the fans and insulted Allensworth.

"He wants to go home, guys. He doesn't like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour," Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.When order was restored, Medvedev wound up taking that set—and the fourth, too. But Bonzi eventually wound up winning 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4.It was Medvedev's third consecutive Grand Slam loss in the first round, including last month at Wimbledon against Bonzi.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

See which driver's got the smarts in the final episode of Grill the Grid for 2025.

We like to think our Grill the Grids are pretty fiendish – but our producers really had it in for the F1 drivers with the final round of the series for 2025.

The current field were asked to guess the Grand Prix and the year in which it took place from some pretty opaque descriptions – with each question involving three separate clues, and points on offer from three down to one depending on how many of those clues the drivers required.

It was tricky enough to make Kick Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg plead “help me” to his press officer waiting in the wings – as the drivers' efforts set the final scores for the 2025 Grill the Grid championship.

Hit play on the video above to see who aced the final round of Grill the Grid – and find out which driver was crowned the series champion for 2025.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue.

A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery.

A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1.

Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid.

Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Oscar Piastri remains at the top of the Drivers' Championship ahead of Round 15, but his lead now stands at just nine points from McLaren team mate Lando Norris following the Briton's victory last time out in Hungary.

Norris was also the race winner when F1 visited Zandvoort in 2024 – but can the 25-year-old repeat that this time around, or will Piastri return to the top step of the podium?

There is likely to be plenty of fan support for Max Verstappen as the Dutchman enters into his home weekend. Red Bull struggled for pace at the Hungaroring, but can they bounce back this time out? And where will Mercedes and Ferrari place in the pecking order?

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31.

*From the last four races in the Netherlands

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference.

You don't really appreciate the banking until you go around it at Turn 3. The theory is multiple lines, but everyone just bolts for the outside line and tries to get the exit right. And again, coming through the final corner as well, running the banking.

It is a nice, flowing track. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well...

“For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The teams will have a choice of the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, whereas in 2024 the available compounds were C1, C2 and C3.

“The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.

“[In 2024], 16 drivers lined up on the grid on the medium tyre, while three – Lewis Hamilton, Yuki Tsunoda and Valtteri Bottas – went for the soft, with Kevin Magnussen starting from the pit lane on hards. Three quarters of the field made just one stop during the race, taking on the hard as the second set, while Magnussen went with the medium.

“The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium.

“Nico Hulkenberg drove the longest stint of all, completing 57 laps on the hard. Oscar Piastri topped the list with the medium on 33 laps, while Hamilton ran 24 on the soft.”

The season resumes with things still very much all to play for in the Drivers' Championship. Just nine points now separate leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris at the top of the standings, with Norris seemingly holding the momentum after winning three of the last four Grands Prix before the summer break.

Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far.

It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. However, McLaren have also voiced their concerns about the possibility of the squad's rivals posing more of a challenge in the second half of the campaign.

Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again.

Red Bull, meanwhile, faced a challenging weekend at the Hungaroring, with the RB21 struggling to match the team's competitors. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans?

Elsewhere, the midfield battle remains as tight as ever. Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort.

James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented.

In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out.

Once the rest of the field had eventually pitted, Hunt found himself in the giddy heights of P1 – a position Lauda was desperate to reclaim. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation.

It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix.

'Disappointed' Sainz regrets 'not getting the points' when Williams were more competitive earlier in the season 

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will resume their intra-team fight at the upcoming Dutch Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri has taken a moment to reflect on his battle against McLaren team mate Lando Norris this season, with the championship situation finely poised ahead of the decisive 10-round run-in.

Making the most of an ultra-competitive McLaren package, Piastri and Norris often found themselves in a fight of their own over the first 14 Grand Prix weekends – the Australian winning six races to the Briton's five so far.

While there have been some dramatic moments, such as a collision at the Canadian Grand Prix and close calls during wheel-to-wheel scraps in Austria and Hungary, the two drivers have maintained cordial relations.

Speaking ahead of the campaign resuming at the Dutch Grand Prix, Piastri provided some more insight on the intra-team environment – and how the two McLaren drivers are balancing their respective bids for the individual title with the team's collective goals.

“Our relationship hasn't really changed,” Piastri, who leads Norris by a slender margin of nine points, explained in an interview for the official McLaren website.

“The competitive environment is quite different this year, yes, but our relationship is pretty much the same. The way we work together, how we try and help the team, and what we want from the car, it is all the same.

“I think we're both very conscious that we want to have success with this team for a long time. That is not lost on either of us. Healthy competition is important, of course, but it is important to keep the team united, and I think we both have that in the back of our minds.”

Piastri, who is navigating his third season in F1, compared to Norris' seventh, also reflected more generally on how he has dealt with the weight of being in contention for the title.

“I would say I've handled it well, but this has been the part of the year when the pressure isn't really on in the championship fight,” he commented.

“Obviously, you don't want to give away points, but it has been far too early to be thinking of the season in that way. At this stage, you just want to go into the weekend trying to get the most out of it as you can, rather than thinking of the championship overall.

“So yes, I think I've handled it well, but I haven't concentrated on it much.”

Looking ahead, though, Piastri admitted: “The pressure is only going to increase from here. When we get to the latter part of the year, that is when the pressure will ramp up.”

While Piastri and Norris' head-to-head looks set to rumble on, McLaren are cruising towards back-to-back Teams' Championship titles for the first time since 1991 – boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari in the standings.

Saturday Night Live Season 51 is going to look a lot different. In the last few days, several cast members — including Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim, and Devon Walker — and a handful of the show's writers have announced that they're leaving the show ahead of the next season.


	The exits seem to be part of wider changes expected at the NBC staple after SNL creator Lorne Michaels said in an interview with Puck that fans can expect major moves leading up to the premiere of the new season on Oct. 4. When asked if he was going to “shake things up” at SNL, he said yes.


	“It'll be announced in a week or so,” said Michaels on Aug. 22, noting that this upcoming season he feels “the pressure to reinvent.”


	Here's everyone who has exited Saturday Night Live ahead of Season 51:


	Multiple outlets, including Variety and People, confirmed that Heidi Gardner won't be returning to SNL for Season 51. Gardner was an SNL staple and worked at the NBC show for eight years.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The comedian participated in more sketches than any other cast member in Season 49, and was known for her “Weekend Update” character, teen movie critic Bailey Gismert. She was the longest-tenured female cast member during Season 50.


	On Thursday, Aug. 28, several outlets confirmed that Longfellow was officially out ahead of SNL 51.


	Longfellow joined the cast as a featured player in Season 48 and became part of the main cast for Season 50.  He has yet to address his departure on social media.

	











	The news came as a surprise to some after LateNighter reported that Longfellow taped a screen test for the Weekend Update segment, which Colin Jost and Michael Che currently co-host. (It's unclear if the pair of comedians plan to leave the show.)


	Wakim announced on Wednesday, Aug. 27, that he wouldn't be returning to SNL next season after joining for SNL 50.


	“I won't be returning to SNL next year,” he wrote on Instagram. “It was a gut punch of a call to get, but I'm so grateful for my time there.”

	Wakim shared that he found out about his departure while at Six Flags and went on an “emotional walk through Bugs Bunny Park and stared out across Daffy Duck Lake thinking about life.”


	Wakin also thanked SNL creator Lorne Michaels for believing in him and “changing my life.”


	“Every time I scanned into the building I would think how insane it is to get to work there,” he said. “It was the most terrifying, thrilling, and rewarding experience of my life and I will miss it dearly and all the brilliant people that work there that made it feel like a home.”


	Walker shared the news of his exit on Tuesday, writing on social media that “me and baby broke up.”


	“Me and the show did three years together, and sometimes it was really cool,” Walker wrote in a post about his departure. “Sometimes it was toxic as hell. But we did what we made the most of what it was, even amidst all of the dysfunction. We made a fucked up lil family.”

	While it's unclear if Walker was leaving the show by choice, he poked fun at the scenario and titled his note, “wait..did he quit or did he get fired?”

	Walker joked that he's trying to be “in a prestige drama” next, “ideally something with Julianne Moore.”


	Yim and Baker, who were both writers on the show, are also departing Saturday Night Live.


	Yim was a part of the SNL writing room for five years. They joined the show in 2020 and were promoted to writing supervisor in 2023.


	“Lorne hired me over the phone when I was 23, and the job literally made all of my dreams come true … I loved it and I laughed every day and it's where I grew up,” they wrote. “I was the first-ever out trans person to be a writer for SNL. I always felt honored to be working within the long tradition of queer writing at the show.”

	Yim wrote a special thank you to cast member Bowen Yang for “changing my life and for making me feel normal.”


	Meanwhile, writer and stand-up comic Baker left the show after joining SNL during Season 47 back in 2022 after writing for That Damn Michael Che. She wrote for “Weekend Update” during Season 50.

If we asked you how many streaming services is too many streamers, you'd probably at best say a number you can count on both hands. And yet Amazon Prime Video via its subscriptions has “more than a 100” different streamers you've probably never heard of that you can get without needing a hundred different logins and passwords. 

On Thursday, Amazon and NBCUniversal announced that Peacock Premium would now be available as a subscription add-on via Prime Video. It means instead of subscribing directly to Peacock, you can get all of Peacock's content by adding it to your Prime membership (it's priced at $16.99 per month and $169.99 per year and is ad-free). That in itself isn't notable, but with Peacock joining the fray, it leaves Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu the only major streamers that you can't get on Amazon.

HBO Max returned to Amazon not long ago after being away, and Apple TV+ joining the service was a big coup considering the two tech giants are massive competitors and that Apple fancies itself as its own one-stop shop for people to stream whatever they want. Some of the other subscriptions you can add include Paramount+, FOX One, MGM+, Crunchyroll, STARZ, BET+, AMC+, and BritBox, to name just a few. 

 










While those are all streamers that have their own apps you can subscribe to directly, Amazon also has plenty that don't have their own terrestrial apps you can download and are only available through places like Amazon or other channels. One we previously reported on was Wonder Project, which is the faith-based company behind “House of David,” and today they announced it launches on October 5, just to add to the hundreds of services.

Because Amazon also offers many of these streamers as part of bundles, it makes it that much less likely that you cancel Amazon Prime entirely. It also helps Amazon as a brand, because although Peacock may officially be the home to “Poker Face” and “The Traitors,” if you're accessing those shows and HBO's and Paramount's all through one platform on Amazon, the average user begins to not even be able to tell the difference. 

Such is the utopian vision of streaming that many executives have long touted, that there will be one super streamer to rule them all and you won't have to do guess work to figure out which service has the show you actually want to watch (some people used to call this cable). Amazon is inching closer to being that leader, but they'd have to still make up a lot of ground if it was going to convince Netflix and Disney that they need it. Netflix is dominant enough on its own that other studios — including NBCUniversal — continue to license their content to Netflix, and that Netflix doesn't need to rely on any other bundles to keep people from canceling. Disney meanwhile has taken great pains (and billions of dollars) to merge the functionality of Disney+, Hulu, and the newly launched ESPN streamer into one place. 

 










But Amazon must be doing something right if even Peacock sees the value of hitching its wagon to the big guy.

The radio staple hosted the first hip-hop show at the station in 1992.

	They say all good things come to an end. After hosting the first hip-hop show ever at Hot 97 in 1992, Funkmaster Flex announced Thursday (Aug. 28) that he'll be unplugging his turntables for good at the station next week.

THIS MONDAY LABOR DAY SEPTEMBER 1ST WITH BE MY LAST SHOW ON HOT97 AT 7PM! ALL THINGS COME TO AN END! END OF AN ERA THAT I ENJOYED VERY MUCH! I SUPER ENJOYED IT ALL! I WILL MAKE THE LAST SHOW A GREAT ONE! APPRECIATE EVERYONE WHO HAS SUPPORTED ME OVER THE YEARS!


	Fans of the station were stunned about Funk Flex's departure announcement, wondering what his next move would be. “END OF AN ERA INDEED! We gonna need another classic moment before you go out with a BANG, Flex,” one person wrote.




Another added: “We living in the end of times the mayans were talking about wtf!”


	After starting at Hot 97 over three decades ago, the Bronx native is responsible for plenty of classic NYC radio moments, including his premiere of Jay-Z and Ye's “Otis” in 2011, which he restarted roughly 25 times and dropped 63 bombs on over the course of 22 minutes. 


	Earlier in August, Flex was presented with a Key to the City by New York City Mayor Eric Adams for “his role in shaping the global reach of NYC's hip hop scene through his iconic platform.”


	“I'm humbled and honored to receive the Key to the City I've always called home,” Flex said. “New York made me. Hot 97 gave me the mic and hip-hop gave me a voice. This moment means everything.”

Mindy Kaling‘s new Hulu series Not Suitable For Work has cast five actors to lead the comedy: Ella Hunt (Saturday Night, Horizon: An American Saga), Avantika (Mean Girls, The Sex Lives of College Girls), Will Angus (Prom Dates), Jack Martin (La Brea) and Nicholas Duvernay (The White Lotus).


Not Suitable for Work follows five work-obsessed twentysomethings striving for professional success and, if they have time, personal happiness in Manhattan's most glamorous neighborhood, Murray Hill.


	Hunt will play AJ Pascarelli, a charming but intense first-year analyst at the most prestigious investment bank in New York. 

	











	Avantika will play Abhinaya “Abby” Chilukuri, a fashion-obsessed, savvy assistant to a demanding celebrity stylist.

	Angus will play Davis Beau Bradley Barrett III, a high-energy finance bro, but underneath his fratty exterior, Davis wants to love and be loved.

	Martin will play Josh Teitelbaum, a smart, idealistic and occasionally sanctimonious New Yorker (born and raised, he's the first to tell you).


	Duvernay will play Kel Washington, a charming, slightly anxious medical student struggling to ace his exams while plotting his big break as an actor.


	Kaling created Not Suitable for Work and executive produces with showrunner Charlie Grandy (The Sex Lives of College Girls, The Mindy Project) and 3 Arts Entertainment's Howard Klein. Kaling International produces the series in association with Warner Bros. Television, where both Kaling and Grandy are under overall deals.

Dolan made the surprise reveal ahead of the immersive film's big opening night in Las Vegas. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


The Wizard of Oz makes its groundbreaking debut at Las Vegas' Sphere on Thursday night, and just before showtime, James Dolan is dropping quite the easter egg. 


	The Sphere Entertainment Co. executive chairman and CEO took part in a walkthrough of the experience with select press — alongside Sphere president and chief operating officer Jennifer Koester and visual effects specialist Ben Grossmann — and revealed that there is one specific A.I.-assisted change to keep an eye out for. 




	“I won't tell you where, it's only for like two seconds,” as he asked reporters if they were familiar with Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav. After an affirmative, he said, “[They] replaced the faces of two very short, two-second characters in the movie with mine and David. I challenge you to find it.”

	Grossmann was quick to chime in that “they were uncredited characters who were too blurry to be identified, and have now been enhanced to be identified.” (Warner Bros. owns the rights to The Wizard of Oz film). 


	It adds buzz to the Sphere's already buzzing new attraction, which features an immersive adaptation of the classic film — like when that tornado hits Kansas, attendees will have wind whipping at their face, leaves flying in front of them and bolts of lightning puncturing the fog. It has also used A.I. to adapt the film to the Sphere's massive screen, which the execs discussed heavily during the preview. 

	











	Grossmann explained, “We had a choice. We could either hire modern artists to reanimate those performances by hand, which we felt would destroy the integrity of the original performance,” or embrace “a new technology that allows you to train on things that existed before it, so that it can reproduce those things accurately. And then we tested it for two years to make sure that if we used A.I., we would actually have more integrity to the original performances than if we didn't, because the only other alternatives were computer graphics that would be humans manipulating the performance.” 


	“We actually found that that gave us more integrity to the original because when we would complete a missing character or an elbow or something that's off,” he continued. “It knew what Judy Garland's eyelashes looked like on that day in that scene, when she was performing, for detail and filling all of those things that were missing.” 


	And for those who bristle at A.I. being used on the 1939 film, Grossmann noted that “the original work of art continues to exist” in many other places. “We've adapted it into a new medium, and we've done it with what we believe is a high degree of authenticity and integrity to the original performance,” he said. “We've stayed in touch with their descendants. We've been in contact with the I.P. holders, we've licensed all the material appropriately, we made sure that the A.I. models, which can be controversial, are fine tuned specifically and exclusively on the original material. So we've done all the things that people have been concerned about doing right and no one has done before.” 

	











	Dolan added that he doesn't “really think that it's a fair criticism” over the use of A.I. and wants people to see the movie before they cast judgement. Grossmann responded, “I think [with] the controversy around A.I. replacing humans through technology, we ended up employing more artists on this project than I think Hollywood has employed in previous years, just to continue this journey,” working with more than 1,000 artists throughout the process.  


	Dolan — who said he plans to screen the film for the next decade at Sphere venues around the world — also took the moment to admit, “We went way over the budget. What we were originally thinking, we ended up almost two times what we were originally thinking. We're getting up pretty close to that $100 million mark — it was worth it.”

EXCLUSIVE: When NBC's Chicago Med returns this fall for its eleventh season, it will be without one of its three remaining original cast members. Marlyne Barrett, who has played doting yet no-nonsense ER nurse Maggie Lockwood since the show's 2015 launch, is stepping back from the medical drama for personal reasons, sources tell Deadline. 


	This is envisioned as a temporary leave, and the hope is for her to return at some point, I hear. 


	As Deadline reported in June, the other two Chicago Med original cast members, series stars S. Epatha Merkerson (Sharon Goodwin) and Oliver Platt (Daniel Charles), are set to come back after their options for the 2025-26 season were picked up. And just this week, Deadline broke the news that fellow OG Nick Gehlfuss, who left after eight seasons, will make a return this season as a guest-star, reprising his role as Dr. Will Halstead.

	Over the years, Barrett's Charge Nurse Maggie has become the eyes, ears and heart of Gaffney Medical's Emergency Department, endlessly dedicated to her position and loyal to all the physicians around her. Maggie's major Season 10 storyline involved the tense nursing union negotiations at the hospital, which culminated in a sick-out.


	In Season 5, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and eventually went into remission. Barrett announced her real-life diagnosis of uterine and ovarian cancer in July 2022. In September 2024, the actress revealed that she was in full remission. 

	











Chicago Med, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Allen MacDonald, Stephen Hootstein and Peter Jankowski.


	The three One Chicago dramas kick off their new seasons Oct. 1, with Chicago Med leading the charge at 8 p.m.

Netflix‘s new series Extraction has added two actors to its series regular cast: May Calamawy (Moon Knight, Lee Cronin's The Mummy) and Waleed Zuaiter (Gangs of London, Baghdad Central), with Ed Speleers (Star Trek: Picard, You) set as a recurring guest star. They join the previously announced Omar Sy, Boyd Holbrook and Natalie Dormer.


	From showrunner, writer, and executive producer Glen Mazzara and executive-produced by AGBO, Extraction is set in the world of the action thriller movie franchise starring Chris Hemsworth.


	The eight-episode first season follows a mercenary (Omar Sy) who embarks on a dangerous mission to rescue hostages in Libya. Trapped between warring factions and ruthless killers, he must navigate life-or-death choices while confronting deep emotional wounds.

Extraction explores the trauma, betrayal, and moral conflicts of characters pushed to the edge.

	Sources tell Deadline that Calamawy, Zuaiter and Speleers will play the following roles:


	Calamawy will play Priscilla Ragab, an intelligent and empathetic executive who remains calm while under pressure. Zuaiter will play Hamza Najjar, a former soldier with a profound desire for justice. Speleers will play Alford Griff, an engineer who is described as unpredictable.


	This is the second time Netflix has extended a successful original movie franchise into a TV series. The To All the Boys I've Loved Before film trilogy spawned the hit comedy series XO, Kitty, which was recently renewed for a third season. In the opposite direction, the streamer has a Peaky Blinders movie on the way, based on the popular TV series.

	The 2020 action thriller Extraction, directed by Sam Hargrave, was based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, with art by Fernando León González, and co-written by Joe and Anthony Russo. Hemsworth stars as an Australian black ops mercenary who takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

	











	A sequel, Extraction 2, was released in 2023, with the main cast reprising their roles. The movie brings back Hemsworth's Rake, who is tasked with a new mission — rescuing the battered family of a ruthless Georgian gangster from the prison where they are being held.


	AGBO produced both films.


	In addition to the Russo brothers and Mazzara, executive producers include Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Chris Castaldi for AGBO, Sam Hargrave, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin, Netflix & AGBO: A Proven Partnership. Ari Costa produces for AGBO.

	Calamawy is repped by WME and Range Media Partners. Zuaiter is repped by Gersh, Echo Lake Entertainment, The Artists Partnership and Frederick P. Bimbler of Moses & Singer. Speleers is repped by Paradigm and Independent Talent Group in the UK.

Lorne Michaels says he's feeling "pressure to reinvent this season" after the show's landmark 50th year.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Ahead of the season 51 premiere of Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4, Lorne Michaels confirmed in an interview that a few familiar faces will not return to the cast this fall — and those exits are starting to be announced one by one.


	When asked by Puck in an interview published Aug. 22 if he planned to “shake things up” for the 2025-26 season, the SNL creator and producer replied, “Yes,” adding that he was feeling the “pressure to reinvent this season” after mostly keeping the cast intact from season 49 into the show's landmark 50th year.


	“I wanted people coming back and being part of [the 50th season],” Michaels told Puck. “So when Kate [McKinnon] hosted, Kristen [Wiig] and Maya [Rudolph] came back for it. And that meant there couldn't be those kind of disruptions or anything that was going to take the focus off [the 50th season].”


	The 2024-25 season 50 cast included 17 people in total: 14 full-time cast members and three featured players. The longest-running cast members currently on Saturday Night Live are led by Kenan Thompson, who started on the show in 2003 and holds the record for the longest-tenured SNL castmate of all time. Other vets in the mix: Weekend Update co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che, who both joined the cast in 2014; Mikey Day (2016); Heidi Gardner (2017); Ego Nwodim (2018); and Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang (both 2019).


	But who won't be back when the sketch comedy show returns to Studio 8H in October? Below, find the full list of cast members exiting Saturday Night Live ahead of season 51.


	Devon Walker joined the cast in 2022 as a featured player for season 48. He was promoted to a full-time cast member for his third and final season on the cast.


	On Aug. 26, Walker confirmed his exit from the show with an Instagram post captioned “me and baby broke up.”


	He expounded on his exit in a note posted to Instagram with the cheeky title “wait..did he quit or did he get fired?,” writing in part: “To me, jobs in this industry feel like a bunch of little marriages. Some of em last for a long time if we're lucky, but most of them are fleeting. Permanent until they're not. That's the deal. You know what it is it when you sign up. Me and the show did three years together, and sometimes it was really cool. Sometimes it was toxic as hell. But we did what we made the most of what it was, even amidst all of the dysfunction. We made a f‑‑‑ed up lil family.”


	Emil Wakim was one of three featured players added for season 50 (alongside Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline), so he only spent one season as part of the SNL cast.


	Wakim announced the news Aug. 27 on Instagram, writing in part: “i won't be returning to snl next year. it was a gut punch of a call to get but i'm so grateful for my time there. i was at six flags celebrating my friends 36th birthday and went on a really emotional walk through bugs bunny park and stared out across daffy duck lake thinking about life. every time i scanned into the building i would think how insane it is to get to work there. it was the most terrifying, thrilling, and rewarding experience of my life and i will miss it dearly and all the brilliant people that work there that made it feel like a home. thank u to lorne for taking a chance on me and changing my life.”


	Michael Longfellow joined the cast in 2022 for season 48 as a featured player and was promoted to the cast for season 50 — his final year on the show.


	Unlike Walker and Wakim, Longfellow did not announce his own departure; Deadline broke the news on Aug. 28 and Longfellow has yet to comment.


	Heidi Gardner is the longest-running cast member to exit so far, joining the show in 2017 as a featured player on season 43. She was promoted to full-time cast two years later, in 2019, spending eight seasons on the show.


	Like Longfellow, the news of Gardner's exit did not come from the comic herself. Vulture was the first to report the news on Aug. 28.

A major star for the majority of his adult life, Jay Kelly has so thoroughly subsumed himself into his classic screen persona — smirking, debonair, heroic — that he no longer seems to know who he is off set. More troublingly, the world-famous actor has come to like it that way. As Sylvia Plath once wrote: “It's a hell of a responsibility to be yourself. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.” 

That quote serves as an almost oppressively fitting epigraph for the misty-eyed Netflix movie that Noah Baumbach has made about one of the last true Hollywood stars — or two of them, I should say, as Jay Kelly is so transparent a stand-in for the actor who plays him that he and George Clooney share the same body of work. (No complaint here: “Funny People” is one of my favorite genres). Plath's words help to frame “Jay Kelly” as the story of a dashing sexagenerian who's known by everyone and no one in equal measure, but Baumbach's uncharacteristically precious screenplay, co-written with thee Emily Mortimer, has little trouble articulating that dilemma on its own terms.

Related Stories That ‘Star Wars: Starfighter' First Look Is Our Line in the Sand: No More Black and White First Look Images! Emma Stone Brings Yorgos Lanthimos' ‘Funny and F**ked-Up' ‘Bugonia' to Venice — and If It's an Oscar Movie, She Should Go Lead 

One catchy line that claws at the same idea: “All my memories are movies.” Jay delivers it towards the start of the film, so soon after he's wrapped production on a new crime picture — “8 Men from Now,” which ends with the actor dying for the umpteenth time — that he might as well still be reading from a script. There's an immediately perceptible twinge of regret in Clooney's voice, like the kind of shooting pain that can't mean anything serious so long as you choose to ignore it, but the real wound of that double-bladed dialogue won't be felt until much later. 

 










The problem for Jay isn't that his movies are memories, and that he's gone from one part to another for so long that he's forgotten how to act without the cameras rolling; that's a problem, but also one that has always managed to solve itself. No, the problem for Jay is that his memories are movies: They're frozen in time, shared by everyone who's seen them, and practically impossible to change once they've been cemented in the public imagination. On set, Jay has the power to go again. To do another take. To get one more just for safety. In life, however, he has to live with the choices he's made. And as Jay reaches a certain age and starts being threatened with career tributes, he suddenly finds himself forced to watch those choices back in a veritable supercut of great success and profound misgiving. 

Which is to say that yes, “Jay Kelly” is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves. Baumbach lacks Sofia Coppola's singular ability to leverage a character's wealth for the wanting it reveals of them, but he, Mortimer, and Clooney share a vivid understanding of the resentments that can form in the space between who we are and how we're seen — and of how stardom can widen that space to the point that friendships and families are liable to fall into it unnoticed. 

 










It's a space that Baumbach explores here with an unusually gentle touch. On the one hand, the “Meyerowitz Stories” director has never been as allergic to sentimentality as his prickliest work might suggest, and I find it hard to begrudge any of the great filmmakers for going soft as they get older — we should all be so lucky to reach the back half of our lives and feel as if the world was a kinder, more loving place than we once thought. On the other hand, watching a director as scabrous as Noah Baumbach make a movie as tenderly indrawn as “Jay Kelly” can feel like watching a ginsu knife get dulled into a loofah. 

Here, Baumbach compensates for that sometimes clumsily overdrawn emotionality by rooting his film in a cragged bedrock of sadness — one that adds a serrated edge to the constant refrain of “I was too busy having sex with movie stars to spend time with my daughters” melancholy. That sadness is baked into the story from the start, as “Jay Kelly” begins with the death of a mentor figure named Peter (Jim Broadbent, seen in flashback), who directed Jay's breakout success 30 years earlier. Peter was desperately fending off irrelevance the last time they spoke, and had begged Jay to help him get his comeback project off the ground. Jay felt the project was too raw and vulnerable for his brand, and was unmoved by Peter's appeal to his filial duty. In the end, Peter failed to get the movie financed, and Jay can't help but suspect that it literally killed him.

 










That suspicion furrows something deep behind Jay's eyes; it's a serious wrinkle on the face of someone whose job requires him to be a dimple-cheeked blank slate at all times, pliable enough to play a variety of parts but always recognizably “himself.” A whole team of people have devoted the best years of their lives to ensuring that Jay never has to feel anything worse than mild discomfort, his sweet if self-annihilating manager Ron Sukenick (Adam Sandler) chief among them, but they don't pick up on the aftershocks of Peter's death until after it's too late. They don't know what's going to happen when Jay is lured to a bar for a post-funeral drink with his old acting school friend Timothy (Billy Crudup), who's aged into a pediatrician with a serious chip on his shoulder.

The next thing Ron knows, Jay has a black eye, he's pulling out of the big new movie he's due to start in a few days, and he's loading his entire team onto a plane to France as part of a wildly ill-advised plan to crash his teenage daughter's European vacation and spend some quality time with her before she goes to college in the fall. It's the perfect setup for a Sturgian misadventure across the continent, but “Jay Kelly” — more frantic than funny, and increasingly trending towards wistful revelation — is less interested in pursuing madcap laughs than it is in exploring the life of the mind. And so an overnight train ride that puts Jay among the common folk becomes the venue for a head trip down memory lane, complete with Trafalmadorian flashbacks that taunt the movie star by denying him another take. 

 










By design, “Jay Kelly” strikes an uneasy balance between moving forward and being stuck in the past. The long and emotionally imprecise flashbacks — which find Jay revisiting the critical audition where he upstaged Timothy, a set romance he had with one of his co-stars, and a more recent therapy session that he attended with his semi-estranged adult daughter (Riley Keough) — are meant to act as headwinds for a story about a man careening out of control, but none of them crackle with Baumbach's usual wit, and all of them suffer from a slightly elevated tone that only serves the “unreality” of Jay's life by making every part of it even harder to believe. 

That Clooney is just playing a sadder, more blinkered version of himself — one who never found a lasting love, nor started a family he was interested in keeping — would seem to solve any issues of verisimilitude, and there are a number of sequences in “Jay Kelly” where his real-life fame adds credence to the chaos we're seeing on-screen (most of them having to do with a starstruck member of the public). There are also several moments in which the self-reflexiveness of Clooney's casting effectively baits us into believing that the Cary Grant of his day is baring his soul for our edification. That he's waving us backstage and confessing the awful truth that some part of ourselves always looked for behind every red carpet smile and Golden Globes acceptance speech. That he's not that happy. That his life isn't perfect. That money, looks, and an unimpeachable run across the six greatest seasons of any network drama ever made don't make him better than us, even though that third thing objectively does. 

 










The last of those moments is heartstoppingly transcendent, as Baumbach brings the full weight of Clooney's iconography to bear on Jay's most private misgivings. The problem is that the rest of them rely on Clooney's persona to get the job done, and — in stark contrast to the unsparing honesty of “Funny People” — they aren't mean enough to sell us on the idea that Jay could be such a dithering cocker spaniel in his private life (there's a reason why Ron always addresses him as “puppy,” besides the fact that Ron addresses all of his clients that way). 

There's no use in faulting Clooney for his performance, as no one does Clooney better, and his leading man appeal — somehow wide-eyed and “aw shucks” at the same time — has seldom been used more acutely than it is here. Alas, his ineffable Clooney-ness also has the perverse effect of making “Jay Kelly” less convincing at the same time, at least so far as its lead character is being played by a man who makes all of his foibles that much harder to believe. I'm sure George Clooney has problems of his own, but no one would have a harder time inhabiting the problems that Corge Glooney is meant to have in this movie. That Jay Kelly's flaws clash against George Clooney's charms is precisely the point, of course — one is simply no match for the other. 

 










It's up to the rest of the cast to help level the playing field, but the only thing “Jay Kelly” does with its traveling circus is to winnow them down one by one as they get tired of Jay's antics. He's the overgrown child who takes them away from their actual children, blithely indifferent to the fact that he means more to them than they do to him in return. 

Some employees, like his publicist (Laura Dern), bail at the first sign of real trouble. Others, like Ron, are suffering from too great a sunk-cost fallacy to quit on him now. Sandler wears the shit out of a puffy Polo vest, and it's fun to see him lead with quiet resignation instead of unchecked rage, but I don't know if he's ever starred in a movie that's given him less to do. While Baumbach uses Ron to gesture at the specifically Hollywood complications of mixing business with pleasure, and to address the sheer number of people who are subsumed into the personal identity of a single brand-name star (“You're Jay Kelly,” Ron moans, “but I'm Jay Kelly too”), the character never develops beyond the tender embodiment of all the things his boss has forfeited along the way, including self-awareness, a cohesive family, and a wife played by Greta Gerwig. 

Getting close to other people was something that Jay always planned to do later, and the prospect of receiving a tribute from a Tuscan film festival is an unavoidable sign that he's running out of time. But other people were always going to be incidental to what really matters about “Jay Kelly,” a gorgeously bittersweet shortfaller that hits hardest as a cautionary tale about the perils of trying to avoid oneself in a world that only allows us to act like there's anyone else for us to be. Being a movie star just makes it that much easier to pass on the roles you were born to play. 

 










“Jay Kelly” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Netflix will release it in select theaters on Friday, November 14, and on Netflix on Friday, December 5.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	When Danny Ramirez and Tom Culliver first met as NYU freshmen, their bond was forged in unlikely fashion — over a failed multi-level marketing pitch that quickly gave way to a shared obsession with movies. Over a decade down the line, that friendship has crystallized into Pinstripes, a production company they officially launched earlier this year with the aim of telling the stories no one else is, in a fashion you'll never forget.


	An actor working early in his career on the Sam Levinson film Assassination Nation and the Netflix series On My Block, Ramirez has in recent years taken on a much bigger profile with roles in the likes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Top Gun: Maverick. Culliver, meanwhile, has spent the decade-plus since graduating college building himself up as a producer and executive, most recently working alongside famed producer Cassian Elwes for more than five years as a creative executive at Elevated Films.

	











	With projects like the forthcoming soccer drama Baton, which also counts Victoria Alonso & David Beckham as producers, the duo will now look to build on their individual successes to date and make their mark together as both taste-driven filmmakers and industry disruptors. Their first test arrives in the Gus Van Sant-directed Dead Man's Wire, a true-crime drama marking Pinstripes' debut feature, which is set to premiere in Venice on September 2nd before making its way to TIFF.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The film, starring Bill Skarsgård and Dacre Montgomery, is based on the true story of Tony Kiritsis, a former real estate developer who took the mortgage banker who did him wrong hostage. Ahead of the film's launch, I sat down for an exclusive conversation with Ramirez and Culliver, during which they offered new details on their upcoming slate and highlighted what we can expect from Pinstripes in the years to come.

	











	Sharing their timeline on getting to set for their next films Baton and Pursuit of Touch, both to be directed by Ramirez, they also touch on their ambitions to mount a fresh take on Scarface, lessons learned from the likes of Elwes and Tom Cruise, and more.


DEADLINE: Tell us a bit about how you two met. It's an unusual story…


DANNY RAMIREZ: We met as freshmen at NYU. Tom went for film, and I went for first, mechanical engineering, and then transferred over to Tisch for acting.


TOM CULLIVER: The first time we met, really, was Danny was part of a multi-level marketing scheme, and he tried to pitch me to join. We're 18, 19. He sits me down with his PowerPoint presentation, walking me through, “Here's how you can be your own boss. This is the path to unlimited freedom and success.”


	He runs through the entire “business plan,” and then I'm sitting there and have just one question, which is like, “I'm just confused about where the money comes from.” After that, he was like, “Let me run back to the PowerPoint. I think we missed that.” 


RAMIREZ: I played college soccer and then transferred from a school in Atlanta to NYU, and while I was at NYU, I realized, if I'm not going to have a degree in sciences or in business and I'm going to be in the arts, the idea that I could make a living off of acting was still up in the air. So I fell into one of these multi-level marketing schemes targeted to college kids. I thought that I'd be able to pick my career as an actor and have some financial freedom. Obviously, [I] learned the hard way that easy money is not real money. But that was the beginning of how Tom and I realized, all right, first of all, we can hang. And the beautiful connective tissue to what we're doing now is, we're opening up Pinstripes, and that is one of the projects that we're taking on. 


	Me and Lewis Pullman are doing this movie called The Juice, which is based on that multi-level marketing company that I was a part of. It's an all-encompassing South Florida rags-to-riches tragicomedy, à la Wolf of Wall Street, I could say.


	So that was the beginning of how we got started. And then as he graduated, he moved out to L.A. I stayed in New York for an extra year, and then we became roommates here in L.A. It was three of us that moved in together, and there was a moment where I wasn't getting the roles that I wanted. I was getting supporting roles with really awesome directors, but no one's giving me the lead that I feel like I'm able to wrestle with. So I was like, “I'm going to write something.” And Tom was like, “All right, pitch it.” So I said the outline, and we kind of agreed. Then, everything got quiet for a couple months, and I went to work. And I remember specifically showing the first draft of it. At that point, Tom and I knew each other as friends, but he read the draft and I saw the twinkle in his eye where he's like, oh, he's for real. He could write. And then from that point on, we were like, we could do this organized on Baton, the soccer [movie] that we're working on now. The first draft of that was 2018. 


	In my mind, there's so many actors that are like, “I'm going to write,” and no one actually does something. So I got that feeling from everyone around me that it's like until you prove yourself, you're just [in that same group]. But at that point, Tom had already been working for a couple years. So when I showed that first draft, I felt a shift of him not just respecting me as an actor, but being like, oh, we could do this, if this is the quality of your writing.

	











CULLIVER: When you're early in the industry, like an assistant or a junior exec, and you hear about an actor, even if it's someone that you love that wants to be a writer, wants to direct, it's like, “Oh, good.” And then when they actually send you something and it's exceptionally good — better than A-level writers that you're reading — it changes not just how you see somebody. But creatively, you're like, Oh, not only can Danny and I creatively riff, but this is somebody that's going to make my work better, and we can help each other excel through the industry, in a way that's a true creative partnership.


DEADLINE: What were the film's that bonded you early on?


RAMIREZ: One of our favorite movies is Catch Me If You Can, and that's actually where our company title comes from. Pinstripes comes from where [Christopher] Walken asks Leo [DiCaprio], “Do you know why the Yankees always win?” And Leo's like, “Mickey Mantle.” And then Walken's like, “No, pinstripes. They can't stop looking at the damn pinstripes.” And so that was one that we instantly connected on. 


CULLIVER: That's a great touchstone for us, as far as one, I think Spielberg's best movie of the last 25 years. Thematically, just very rich. Also, just expertly written, sweeping scope, a sense of swagger to it. A sense of charm and playfulness, but still approaching the human condition in a real way. I'd say that it encapsulates a lot of what we're interested in, in film.


RAMIREZ: But it's Director Park…


CULLIVER: Park Chan-wook. Bong Joon Ho. 


RAMIREZ: Shoplifters. 


CULLIVER: [Hirokazu] Kore-eda.


RAMIREZ: There's this world that I think international film has been able to tackle head on that's where our sensibilities have lived. It's like, I remember the first time I saw Todd Field's work and I was like, how is everyone not talking about this? And so there is obviously some left-of-center stuff, but there's [also] four-quadrant stuff that we're approaching. Baton is a sports drama, but it's very much through the lens of an athlete. So I think our genres that we are interested in range from a family drama, to a thriller, to a heist movie. [But] it's more so the quality of storytelling within that, within the tones and genres that we attack.


DEADLINE: Obviously, Danny, you've made significant inroads at this point in your acting career and can use that to your advantage as a producer. But that aside, why start a company together now?


RAMIREZ: Well, the company, the energy around it started in 2018, I think. It's when we were like, “We could do this together.” He had his day job, I had my day job. And we could develop movies on weekends. So I think it's always been like, all right, let's make movies that one, aren't being offered to me, or are not being made by Hollywood in the first place, whether or not I'm in them.


	Now more than ever, I think Tom is at a place that as an individual producer, he's incredibly well liked and respected, has great taste. He now is hitting that same curve that I feel like I'm hitting on my acting career. It's kind of the perfect time to branch out. There's a sense of responsibility, coming from the Tom Cruise school of film, that there is a craft and a work ethic around how to make something of quality. And I think once you're exposed to that, it's really hard to see a bunch of movies that are made without that same love and effort and sweat and blood equity.


	So I think part of our whole thing is, we grew up on movies that took a lot of effort and quality to make. And it's not just about just making money. I think we are craft-first. And once we realized we both have that same sense of responsibility when it comes to story, we were like, why not now? Why not us? We have a big group of people that believe in us, that have been championing our work, from the second film I wrote, Pursuit of Touch…Jeremy O. Harris and bb² are creative producers on it. And Baton, it's Victoria Alonso…

	











DEADLINE: What's the latest on Pursuit of Touch?


RAMIREZ: We have a shooting script. We have a couple of exciting attachments. Cast announcement is coming up shortly. But that'll be the second feature that I direct. 


CULLIVER: Just to go back to the question about why start a company, obviously for Danny and other actors starting companies, I think that you see an industry that needs a spark and that needs new ideas. I think where Danny and I coalesce is believing that movies that are made of the highest quality are generally the ones that last longest. And in this business, you sort of have to work outside of what is current, and work on what is eternal. Obviously, for me, it's the easiest decision in the world because getting to make movies with your friends is sort of the whole point. But I do think that starting something is exciting, and then being with young people with new ideas and new energy is always going to be what Hollywood feeds off.


RAMIREZ: We have a ton of projects in development. We have at least 12 scripts, 50 other types of pieces in development at early stages. Unscripted [projects], we have a couple. We have an exciting host attachment to our main unscripted show… There's other areas that we're venturing to expand with different collaborations and partners. I don't know if we're ready to announce those yet, but basically wherever you could fit story in, we're venturing to go to — now more than ever, where there's so many different avenues, whether it's video games or anything in the tech space. I think there's so many ways to tell human, authentic stories in there that are made with sweat equity.


DEADLINE: Will you be acquiring IP to develop projects around, alongside your work on originals?


CULLIVER: Funny you should ask. One of the larger pieces of IP that we're adapting at the minute is Scarface. Obviously, Danny will play Scarface. We want to modernize it, adapting the original novel. [Editor's Note: Universal Pictures released the most famous Scarface movie — 1983's from Brian De Palma— and has flirted with reimagining the property, attaching Luca Guadagnino to direct in 2020. But the source material, a 1930 novel by Armitage Trail, is in the public domain.] 


	We're independently developing it; we have some development financing in place. Obviously, there's the Pacino legacy of it from the '80s and then the original 1932 movie, but I think it's ripe for modernizing, and to have someone like Danny in the lead is really exciting.


RAMIREZ: [We'll be] developing our own IP, but also then going out and finding partners that have interesting IP that want to partner with us as creatives. But there's also some that we're just, with our little bit of funds, developing ourselves. 


CULLIVER: I think importantly on the IP thing, we're not going to engage on something if we don't have a totally unique, fresh way into it. You don't want to do stuff where you're just remaking stuff for remakes' sake. We're not going to do this cravenly; we have something to say with the material. There's been too much of that in the last 20 years to just go around making remakes because you can latch onto some audience built into the IP. You've got to have a new story to tell within it.


RAMIREZ: Scarface, to us, is the one that it's been a dream role to play, but also to develop it in a way that I understand it. I think in 2025, it's more relevant now than ever. So that's where we're excited to take this on. 

	











DEADLINE: You've talked about wanting to tell stories that haven't been told. What do you see that isn't being well serviced by the industry at the moment?


RAMIREZ: There's a ton of stories, whether it's Mexican-American to Latin American to Latino stories with people at the forefront who aren't just supporting actors in somebody else's story, but rather the protagonist. The amount of Latinos in the U.S. is remarkable, and it's only growing, and the stories made for them are very specific to the places in culture that we've been allowed to walk through. So there's a lot of TV for them; there's not that much prestige film for them. It's been limited to what is financeable. So part of the game that we're having to approach head on is like, okay, we want to do prestige film with stories that usually have been put to the side or haven't been told because there's no perceived return on the value of it. So we're trying to find ways to navigate the obvious financial culture that's been laid out within film, but then tell those stories that are uniquely Latin American — that are Mexican, Colombian, being the two heritages that I share. But also, across the board, stories that have been put to the side. To make a shift in the world, it doesn't happen in one moment, but it happens in a bunch of little ones. So those are the types of stories that we want to tell.


DEADLINE: Is it too early to speak to creative attachments to Baton, beyond what we already know?


RAMIREZ: It's a little early. We might hear about it in the next month or so… As far as cast goes, as a first-time director, we put together a really amazing infrastructure around me. I can't wait to share [the cast] because the more I think about it, the luckier I feel around my first film, having the insane amount of talent who all believe in the script, believe in the story, believe in the vision.


CULLIVER: The thing that to me is the most exciting thing about it is one, to make the greatest soccer movie ever. It hasn't been done well, I don't think ever. I mean we've said it in every pitch, basically: That soccer ball is really the best attachment you can have. That's world religion, and you've got a World Cup year in America [in 2026]. The time is right to make a soccer movie in America. 


RAMIREZ: Soccer was my first love. It was a connection that I had with my family. And so every single time I've ever stepped on any set, from Assassination Nation to Top Gun to On My Block, any time I've shadowed a filmmaker, it's always been through the lens of every single one of these lessons, how can I take away from this in order, the moment that I'm able to tell the football film that I want to, that I absorb all these lessons in order to actualize it?


	I've been able, thankfully, to shadow Chris McQuarrie. I've shadowed [Alejandro González] Iñárritu. I've been able to shadow Sam Levinson, Claire Denis,  the filmmakers that I dreamed of working with, and not only got the chance to work with, but then got to be able to just see their processes and see how they develop shots. All of that has all been funneled through the lens of, this is all going to go towards this football film.


DEADLINE: Can you expand on the lessons you've taken from someone like Tom Cruise that remain top of mind in approaching a project like Baton?


RAMIREZ: From the first time we ever stepped on set [on Top Gun: Maverick], it was understanding how to ground and make the audience feel the most dynamic sequences ever shot. Being on an F-18 and trying to figure out how that visual language translates most effectively, and the amount of technical planning needed to actualize something to feel that texture. 

	











	Tom is a big champion of this project. He was able to connect us with a couple people that are now a part of Baton. From the visual bible that I created to the to the script, he's someone that, as I shadowed him in a recent project, he sat down and is like, “All right, tell me, how are you going to shoot this? Have you thought of this?”


DEADLINE: You shadowed Cruise and Iñárritu film on their forthcoming film for Warner Bros?


RAMIREZ: Yes, sir. Unbelievable. All I'll say is, “Wow, wow, wow.” That's it. But in the times that we were able to talk, it was a lot of asking questions and then figuring out how some of these things are going to best translate on screen. He's someone that has a wealth of knowledge, and since the first day, he literally is like, “Every door for every head of department is open on any project I do.” And so because of Pursuit of Touch, we are able to talk to the head of special effects on a different project. He's opened up these doors.


DEADLINE: You shadowed McQuarrie on the most recent Mission: Impossible film?


RAMIREZ: Both 7 and 8. I mean, whenever a director says that I can shadow them, I fly myself out and I shadow them. It becomes that simple. As a geek myself, I'm not going to pass on that opportunity. I'd rather be on set than watch it just at home.


CULLIVER: For me, the last five years I've been working side by side with Cassian Elwes, one of the legends of the indie film biz. And then working next to him as a co-producer with him on our first title, Dead Man's Wire, you get to work with someone like Gus Van Sant, who's made some of the best movies of the last 30 years. You soak in process, you soak in what you're willing to fight for, and you soak in their unique perspectives on the business and then story. Working with Gus was a dream, and then having five years to learn from Cassian is one of the best grad schools I could have asked for.


DEADLINE: Dead Man's Wire will mark Pinstripes' first producing credit. Tell us a bit about the film and what drew you to it.


CULLIVER: The movie started with Austin Kolodny, who wrote the script. It's based on the true story of Tony Kiritsis, who took his banker or his mortgage lender hostage in 1977 Indianapolis, and it became a national news story. It's one of those true stories that you just cannot f*cking believe actually happened, and the real character of Tony Kiritsis was just like an absolute motormouth, hilarious stand-up comic, one of the funniest dudes who's ever taken somebody hostage ever. And so the minute I read that, which would have been like February 2022, I was just like, oh, this is a f*cking movie. From there, I brought it in and Cassian and I began working on it. I went around trying to find some development financing, and we got it set up. It went through a few iterations over the last two or three years, but myself, Austin and Cassian were with it the entire time. Sam Pressman joined us, from Pressman Film, at one point.


	And then basically in September of last year, Cassian and Gus had worked together from Cassian's days at WME. They ran into each other. Cassian sent Gus the script — we'd been working on the script, tinkering here and there — and basically the next morning, he was like, “I'm in.” From then, it was just a bullet train towards trying to make the movie. From the time that Gus signed on to the first day of shooting was about eight or nine weeks, which is pretty nuts, and we shot in the middle of winter in Louisville, Kentucky, where we've worked a bunch over the years…Gus hadn't made a movie in seven or eight years; I think everyone was excited by [his return].

	











	We got a snowstorm one day before first day of principal photography, which is perfect because the real thing happened during a snowstorm, or just after one. So we got this free production value of the entire ground iced over, which was perfect, even though it completely f*cked us with the picture cars, which I had to deal with. We had to get all these '70s cars; obviously, the highways are closed. So you get these calls like, “You have to go and tell Gus Van Sant day one, ‘Hey, we're not going to have any '70s cars.” And credit to him, if I was that director, I would have been like, “F*ck you guys, I'm out.” Gus was like, “Oh, yeah, no. That's fine. We'll figure it out.” Been there and done that many times.


	It was a dream of a shoot. Every single actor in this movie is brilliant, and then the day that Cassian and I saw the first cut with Veronica Radaelli, our producer…She's very ingrained in Kentucky culture and she's probably the best physical producer I've ever worked with; certainly is that. Cassian says that she's the best physical producer he's ever worked with, which probably means a lot more because he's worked with about 300. We all saw the first cut, and I cried. I just wept, after three years, to have a real piece of cinema with our name on it and to know that it was going to be Danny and I's first movie. It was like, “F*ck, we got a banger.” We just knew it. I'm very excited for the world to see it.


RAMIREZ: To me, the thing that I find most special, obviously, I go into the personal, which is what Tom was able to do. You can't teach taste, and when you latch onto a piece of work that you know is special, whether it's finished or not, and then you follow through with that…He's read so many scripts through the years that some were good, some were terrible. But he had finished watching every Oscar-nominated film by the age of 14, and so I was like, Tom's got taste. He's been in Australia running up somebody's credit card to be able to watch all these movies, but he was able to do it. And so I think those are lessons that I take away. I'm a big believer in the 10,000 hours, and as this whole thing came together and I got updates, whether I was on set or wherever it was in the process, it was just like, a few people believed in this film, and they got it done. And watching this, getting that link that has an expiration date and you've got to watch it by then, was one of the most surreal moments of my life, where I was able to watch a piece that started from someone finding it, reading it, sharing it, and to watch it, knowing that not just my business partner, but my best friend was a big reason as to why this piece exists in the way it does. That, to me, is my takeaway.


DEADLINE: How many films are you looking to make a year? And at what budget level?


RAMIREZ: We see around two to three movies a year right now based on the development money we have, but also the IP that we have in our possession. The budget would be $5 [million]-plus. 


CULLIVER: We want to work with the studios and make massive movies, and we have the ability to make small movies at a very high quality, too. To us, the budget is somewhat irrelevant. It's project-specific. 


DEADLINE: How are you financing development? What's the plan financially to get films off the ground?


RAMIREZ: We have a couple of partners that, since our inception, we've aligned with for development funds. As far as the productions go, it's an independent basis. So Baton has a different setup than Pursuit of Touch or Five Star would have; I just said the title [of a thriller we're working on]. The Juice, the MLM one, that is Lewis and I, and that had a different structure around the development. One of our luxuries is that there's a lot of stuff in-house that we develop ourselves. We can write ourselves. We could also go out and find a writer. We have actors in-house, obviously. So I think we have immense flexibility in that way. And so far from what we've seen, that's been a really awesome quality. 

	











	Sometimes if we're fixated on something and we have a great creative partner, instead of having to go out and find necessarily a writer, we could look and be like, all right, is this something that we should write? And that's helped us out. That's where Five Star came from: Knowing that we wanted to tell this type of thriller story, I was like, “I am obsessed with that. That's something I could take on.” So instantly, we put sweat equity into it and we have a script that somebody else has loved, and so that's been one of the maybe 10 projects that we have done that way and have either set up or are setting up.


CULLIVER: I think it's a mix of, as Danny's saying, either we'll write it ourselves. We can bring in outside development financing. Every now and then, we'll build something from the ground up and just sell it off immediately. It's project-specific at the moment. [Development is] something that I've been doing the hard way for five or six years now, and the hustle, you get used to it, and you get good at it.


DEADLINE: What is your current timeline for getting projects into production?


CULLIVER: Baton, we're gearing up hopefully for the end of the year, trying to get that thing in the can before the new year so that we can hit a release around the World Cup. We've got some exciting Danny news on the acting front, so there's that schedule, but [of] the next movies that we've got lined up, Pursuit of Touch is coming together very quickly. We think that that can be up, I would say, Q2 next year. There's a few other smaller movies I think we can do in the next 12 months, but [Baton and Pursuit of Touch] are probably the two that are nearest on the horizon. 


RAMIREZ: I think early on, [we were] putting our heads together and being like, all right, there is a need for Latinos to lead something. But since then, once we realized that story transcends who you attach to something, there's a lot of projects that don't have me involved, whether as an actor or a director or a writer, but rather just as a producer. So we've been able to break out of just films that were for me to lead. I think that, to me, has been the biggest surprise — [that] if the North Star is storytelling, everything around it is as exciting. It's like finding, what actor fits into this character, [and is] as excited about this role as we are? I never thought that was going to be something that I'd be fascinated by, but it's awesome.


CULLIVER: We have Old Men Drink Coffee Alone. That's a small family comedy that Alex Lehmann's directing, who directed one of my favorite movies of the last five years, Paddleton. It's been a dream to work with him. We're constantly working with high-end filmmakers. In the indie space, they come together very quickly, and we have a lot of excellent material that is gestating and can come together in the next three months.


RAMIREZ: And then I'm obviously pitching all my friends that I've worked together on everything. And it's funny. Anthony Mackie is just staring at us right now [from a Twisted Metal Billboard]. [Laughs] Literally right at us.

It's not surprising to see more Saturday Night Live staffers departing the show as Lorne Michaels commences his annual purge, but the latest name to be announced does come as a bit of a shock. Repertory player Michael Longfellow is officially out, Deadline reports. Longfellow didn't have much screentime in season 50—in May he joked that he only worked “like 12 hours a week”—but earlier this week, Late Nighter reported that the comedian had screen tested alongside writer KC Shornima to potentially take over the Weekend Update desk. Whether the new update means Michael Che and Colin Jost will stay in the job for at least another year is unclear, but Longfellow definitely won't be subbing in. 

Deadline did not specify whether Longfellow was fired or left of his own accord, and as of this writing, neither NBC nor Longfellow himself have commented on the departure. Longfellow follows writers Celeste Yim and Rosebud Baker as well as performers Devon Walker and Emil Wakim, the latter of which indicated in his post about the news that he was let go.

Longfellow joined the show as a featured player in season 48 and was promoted to a member of the main cast ahead of the series' landmark 50th season. It's a shame he won't be returning to the Weekend Update desk (much less running it) as he did have some memorable moments on the segment, including bits in which he discussed TikTok and Real ID, during his tenure. 

Ahead of the show's 50th anniversary special earlier this year, Longfellow offered some advice to new cast members, per Entertainment Weekly. “Buy in. Be crazy. You can stay up for two days in a row. You just got to do it,” he said. “It's not fun, but you can do that.” Longfellow also works as a touring stand-up comic outside of SNL, but at least he can get a little more sleep going forward. We'll see what other cast members hit the road during SNL‘s great shake-up, which doesn't show any signs of slowing down over the next few days or weeks.

	Federal officials arrested two firefighters on Wednesday during what appeared to be an immigration raid on first responders combating the ongoing Bear Gulch wildfire in Washington state. The arrests come as the administration continues to insist that its nationwide crackdown on undocumented immigration is primarily targeting criminals and gang members.  


	According to a report from The Seattle Times, a spokesperson for the Incident Management Team responding to the blaze said that they were “aware of a Border Patrol operation on the fire.” According to sources who spoke to the Times — including firefighters who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — federal agents spent over three hours running identification checks on two contracted response crews. 


	“You risked your life out here to save the community,” one firefighter said. “This is how they treat us.” The firefighter added that they and others were instructed not to record their interactions with law enforcement.

	Another firefighter told the Times that the men who were arrested were not allowed to say goodbye to the rest of the crew. “I asked them if his (family) can say goodbye to him because they're family, and they're just ripping them away,” the firefighter said. “And this is what he said: ‘You need to get the (expletive) out of here. I'm gonna make you leave.'”


	The move to conduct immigration enforcement raids on an active emergency response, and on emergency responders themselves, is a stark departure from past Department of Homeland Security policies. Under the Biden administration, the department had clear policies stating that “absent exigent circumstances, immigration enforcement will not be conducted at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided.” 

	











	In another departure, the DHS has moved to ban aid groups and state organizations receiving federal funds from providing emergency response assistance to undocumented migrants. The new guidelines, first reported on Wednesday by The Washington Post, state that groups may not “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration.” The guidance requires organizations to cooperate with ICE and immigration enforcement, forcing them to “provide access to detainees, such as when an immigration officer seeks to interview a person who might be a removable alien,” and prohibiting them from “harboring, concealing, or shielding from detection illegal aliens.”

	Essentially, the new guidelines would require volunteer groups and other aid agencies to verify the immigration status of an individual before providing support in the aftermath of a flood, hurricane, wildfire, or other disaster. 


	At the same time, the administration has revoked guidelines preventing ICE and immigration officials from detaining migrants at hospitals, churches, schools, and even immigration hearings. For the Trump administration, the spaces and places where an already marginalized community are at their most vulnerable are hunting grounds for detention quotas.

Dr. Phil's contentious legal battle over the bankruptcy of his media venture, Merit Street Media, has taken a juicy turn. Merit's former broadcasting partners Trinity Broadcasting and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) have joined forces to accuse Phil McGraw of all sorts of shady shit, most notably that he swindled both organizations for millions and then used the bankruptcy to launch a new media venture, Envoy. This week, Trinity complained in court that McGraw has been going to “extraordinary lengths” to avoid deposition (per Deadline). 

One of his deposition-dodging tactics is allegedly refusing to hand over relevant materials for discovery in Trinity's breach of contract lawsuit. But the materials PBR has managed to acquire are pretty damning. Text messages from Merit Street's chief operating officer Joel Cheatwood suggest a bankruptcy conspiracy, evidenced by the fact that he instructed employees to keep all communications off of their work emails. The texts (via The Independent) lay out a scheme to wind down operations at Merit Street while shifting staffers over to Envoy. “The way this will probably work is once MSM is wound down there will be an auction of assets and newco will bid to buy the MSM program library,” he explained in one text. He also texted that he and Merit's Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon needed to “be very careful with our public activities associated with Envoy since we are still full and active employees” of Merit, adding that any “[a]ctivities that would indicate we are more focused on Envoy could be problematic if called into question.”

“The Debtor and its executives knew the Envoy scheme was problematic and tried to conceal it by using only personal emails and texts. On June 30 (two days before the bankruptcy), Mr. Cheatwood instructed a colleague that ‘any communication involving timing of events, strategies, etc. we need to not use the merit street e-mail system. Use text instead,'” PBR's filing reads. (PBR hasn't outright sued Merit Street, but accused the company of failing to pay millions in owed payments.) “The documents produced to date demonstrate that this bankruptcy was conceived as a scheme to divert the Debtor's employees and intellectual property to Envoy, a competing business Dr. Phil founded the day before this case was filed, and leave the Debtor's business as a shell with nothing more than a repeated loop of re-runs.”

“By its own admission in a meet-and-confer between counsel on August 26, 2025, Peteski still has not produced all of Phillip C. McGraw's emails and text messages (despite his deposition being scheduled to begin in less than 48 hours from the time of such conference), nor has it produced all of the documents concerning Envoy,” Trinity stated in its own filing (via Deadline). “Peteski's same delay tactics persist. The pattern is so striking that it is more than mere déjà vu; it is a deliberate rerun, scripted by parties who have decided that the Court's orders are optional guidance rather than binding directives.”

Sabrina Carpenter warned that the provocative lyrics on her upcoming album Man's Best Friend might not be for prude-minded people in a preview from the singer's interview with CBS Mornings.


	“The album is not for any pearl clutchers,” Carpenter told Gayle King in a clip shared Thursday, one day before Man's Best Friend's arrival. “But I also think that even pearl clutchers can listen to an album like that in their own solitude and find something that makes them smirk and chuckle to themselves.”

“This is just fun”: In an exclusive interview tomorrow, pop superstar @SabrinaAnnLynn tells @GayleKing how she embraces the provocative lyrics in her highly-anticipated next album, “Man's Best Friend.” pic.twitter.com/DBWlGjXu2K


	While previous hits like “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” were more subtle with the innuendo, Man's Best Friend's previous singles and controversial album art suggest a bolder, more sexual LP, one that might make casual fans uncomfortable.


	“Sometimes people hear the lyrics that are really bold, and they go, ‘I don't want to sing this in front of other people.' It's like it's almost too TMI,” Carpenter added.

	“But I think about being at a concert with, you know, however many young women I see in the front row that are screaming at the top of their lungs with their best friends, and you can go like, ‘Oh, we can all sigh of relief, like, ‘This is just fun.' And that's all it has to be.”


	In her recent Rolling Stone cover story, Carpenter said of the people bemoaning her sultry stage shows, in particular her “Juno” positions, “It's always so funny to me when people complain. They're like, ‘All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. Clearly you love sex. You're obsessed with it. It's in my show. There's so many more moments than the ‘Juno' positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I can't control that. If you come to the show, you'll [also] hear the ballads, you'll hear the more introspective numbers. I find irony and humor in all of that, because it seems to be a recurring theme. I'm not upset about it, other than I feel mad pressure to be funny sometimes.”

	Executive produced by Lionel Richie and Megan Thee Stallion, the show pairs acts like TLC, Kylie Minogue, Patti LaBelle and Boy George with some of today's biggest K-pop groups for high-stakes song battles judged live in Seoul, South Korea. With limited rehearsal time and a mix of languages, styles and generations, each collaboration reimagines iconic hits with a K-pop twist, from “Lady Marmalade” to “Can't Get You Out of My Head.”Billboard spoke with Richie and Megan about what drew them to the project, the lessons they learned while filming in Korea, and how they approached creating authentic collaborations that honor both K-pop and Western pop traditions.

You're both executive producers on KPOPPED. What drew you to this project in the first place, and why did you feel it was the right time to bring K-pop and Western pop together on this scale?


			Trending on Billboard		







Lionel Richie: The idea was, clearly K-pop in Korea has already popped. K-pop in the rest of the world is popping. So, the concept of putting this in the world, and how we present it to the world, was probably the challenge.K-pop understands every song that we've ever put out in America, in the world — they know it by heart, backwards and forwards. They know every group by heart. But we don't know them and their culture. So let's take this culture of our musical history and heritage back to Korea.




	PSY was right there. PSY's ready to go, but who's going to be my co-pilot, my wing person? And of course, when it came down to, “Okay, who do you want, Lionel?” I said, “Let's just go all the way crazy, let's go Megan.”And all of a sudden, we heard the greatest word I could ever hear in the English language: “Yes, I'm in.” Megan said “yes.” And from that point on, we had magic. Because now we have curiosity. And putting this magical gumbo of music and talent together with Megan is now: “What the hell are we doing?”Megan Thee Stallion: So when the opportunity came to me, I automatically was like, “Lionel Richie? Hell yeah, I'm in. Whatever he want me to do, I'm doing it.”Everybody already knows about my love for K-pop, for just being a weeb, an anime nerd and just a big K-pop stan in general. This is right up my alley. This is right up my lane. Y'all don't gotta twist my arm because I want to do this anyway. When we went to Korea, I was just having a blast. I forgot we were even out there working because I was just living my best life.Just coming together with him [Lionel] and doing this project, I felt so much gratitude. I felt so much appreciation. I'm just thankful, and I can't wait for people to see it, because we were literally out there just having a ball.


This show is all about bridging cultures, genres, and generations. What's one thing you each learned about K-pop during filming that surprised you?


Lionel Richie: For me, it was the precision. I must say, I'm fascinated. A lot of times, you have to figure out how to look relaxed on stage while going through a rehearsal. You're supposed to make it look like you just did this automatically, and there's a whole lot of letting go you have to do.


	With K-pop, it looks so intricate, but at the same time, when you watch it, they're flowing together as one unit. I said, “That's magical, let me figure that out.” And of course, from that point on, I realized they know every song, every musical style. That's what sparked my curiosity: Can we make this work, to blend these styles, these languages and these generations together? It was basically a cultural conversation through music.


Megan Thee Stallion: I'm a big fan of a lot of girl K-pop groups. So when I see them dance and be so in tune with each other, so in sync, it feels like, “Okay girl, I eat, breathe and sleep performance. This is just me.” I get it.


	So I kind of thought they might come off cold, because I didn't know — do you have interests outside of this? But actually, meeting a lot of those girls and women, we sat down, took our hair out of those ponytails, took the makeup off and just chilled, talking. I realized they're just girls at the end of the day. We're from two different parts of the world, but we connected on things we related to as women and as entertainers, especially the pressure that comes with being female entertainers.


	Just knowing they were real people, really sweet people, made me so happy. I made a lot of friends and they taught me so many cool things. It wasn't an act, it wasn't a show. If you see them being sweet in little moments in interviews, that's who they actually are. They're really, really sweet, and I miss them so much.

	











	I was just surprised at how genuinely sweet everybody was.


We're seeing legendary artists team up with K-pop groups to reimagine iconic songs. How did you approach making sure these collaborations still felt authentic to both sides?


Megan Thee Stallion: I don't do anything that doesn't feel authentic to me. If this opportunity didn't feel like something I was gonna be able to be on board with, I wouldn't have did it because I don't know how to fake it. I don't know how to be anything other than Megan Thee Stallion. I didn't know how I was gonna make everybody get on my page, but I knew that's what I was gonna have to do. I was definitely down to come and learn and be a part of this K-pop collab, but how do we make this be Megan Thee Stallion and BILLLIE? How do we make this feel like both of us without taking away the core parts of each of us?When we had those personal conversations in the back, that real chemistry, once we got on stage, it was just too easy because now we already know each other and we made each other feel very comfortable. We were making stuff up as we go low key. We just met each other and we vibed. We were really up there just being our authentic selves.


Lionel Richie:  When Megan took the time to go beneath the facade of their performance and really found and met them as people, it became a real thing. Megan does not know how to be anything else authentically, but Megan, so that's perfect. And same with me. I know I act a lot of crazy stuff, but my point is there's a real Alabama guy here and I only know how to be a certain way. So, when we approach people, we're looking for where's the real. I think Megan did a great job in pulling that out of everybody. You did a great job, kid.


If you could pick any K-pop artist or group to remix one of your songs, past or present, who would it be and which song would they do?


 Lionel Richie: I'm gonna call out the big guns, BTS, “All Night Long.” I think that that would be stupid.

	











Megan Thee Stallion:  I think I would love to hear ATEEZ do “Cognac Queen” or something. Take them completely out of their element and bring them over here on some real Southern Megan Thee Stallion type stuff. I think that'll be really cute. I think the girls would go crazy.

Hayley Williams of Paramore has released a new solo album comprised of the 17 tracks shared earlier this summer and the new bonus song “Parachute.” Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party is out now on streaming services, with physical releases arriving on November 7 via Post Atlantic—Williams' own label, started after her 20-year contract with Atlantic ended—and distributed by Secretly Distribution. Listen to the new album below.

Since granting the title track with a music video, Williams has also shared a visual for “Glum,” directed by AJ Gibboney and Zac Farro, which you can watch below. Williams and Daniel James wrote, played, and recorded most instruments on Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, with additional help longtime collaborators Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard. Jim-E Stack also contributed to “True Believer.”

Back in 2020, Williams made her solo debut with the full-length album Petals for Armor. She followed it up with the three-track Petals for Armor: Self-Serenades EP that same year and Flowers for Vases / Descansos in 2021. She described the latter LP as “a prequel, or some sort of detour between parts 1 and 2 of Petals.” Afterward, Paramore wrote and released their fifth studio album as a band, This Is Why, in 2023.

Shouldn't a first look, you know, actually give you a first look at a movie? Especially when it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” set we've seen in over six years?

 It's been that long since “The Rise of Skywalker” came out, that long that Lucasfilm has been figuring what the future of “Star Wars” would be on the big screen. And now we have heard that the upcoming “Star Wars: Starfighter,” set in the years after “Rise of Skywalker,” has set much of the rest of its cast — Amy Adams, Aaron Pierre, Flynn Gray, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, and Daniel Ings join the already announced Ryan Gosling, Matt Smith, and Mia Goth — is going into production, and is giving us a first look.

If you can even call it a first look. What's the opposite of a first look? A blank stare. That's kinda what Gosling and Gray are doing above. 

Look, a posed photo of the actors just being themselves isn't always terrible — the epochal 2014 “Force Awakens” cast photo was incredible, just to see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford occupy the same space once again, but that involved a level of interest that simply is not yet there for “Starfighter.”

 










Three IndieWire staffers had strong thoughts about this “Star Wars: Starfighter” first look, and we're going to vent them like superheated plasma.

Over the course of a normal workday — especially one in the thick of fall film festival season — one can probably imagine the glut of emails that arrive with tick-tock regularity in the ol' IndieWire inboxes, so the unexpected ones? Those require a higher level of interest to get me clicking. A “first look” image of the next “Star Wars” movie? That fits the bill — but, alas. There's no question that plenty of words and phrases have lost their meaning in recent years, and “first look” seems to be one of them, at least in the entertainment space.

What should a true “first look” be? Well, for my money, it should be an actual production still, an initial peek not quite behind the curtain, but adjacent to it. I want to get a sense of what the final film will look like and feel like, a little action, a little movement. A black and white still — not, it seems clear, a photo taken during the filming of a real scene — with our stars (or is it their characters? that's always unclear) simply resting on a landspeeder, everything so dark and muddled that it's impossible to see much else? There are, uh, big pipes? Sure. Star Ryan Gosling might be wearing a cape? Fine. 

 










It's fine enough to mark the start of production with some glamour shots, but a “first look” this does not make, because it doesn't speak to the primary function of these kinds of photos: it doesn't tell me about the film itself. It doesn't even tell me about the making of this film (think about that recent first look for Richard Linkater's “Nouvelle Vague,” which captured the impish creative charm that runs through the final film). And don't even get me started on the use of black and white. “Star Wars” films used to have some pop and pizzazz, but this first look? Doesn't tell me anything.

It's not just funny, it's fitting, that the very first reply on Discussing Film's tweet with the photo is “It is time for ‘Drive' in space.” Because there's almost nothing that actually connotes “Star Wars” here other than the vaguest outline of a landspeeder. Why is this in black and white other than because of some idea that black and white signifies importance? If this is really a set from the movie, it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” movie set in over six years — we deserve to see that in color. You know, the way the movie itself will be presented? Gosling doesn't look like he's in a flight suit, and Flynn Gray looks like he's just Ezra from “Star Wars: Rebels” come to life, even though we know this movie will be set in a time when Ezra is a middle-aged man. What is there here to be really excited about? You couldn't even have a glimpse of an actual “Star Wars” starfighter in this first look at “Star Wars: Starfighter”? Maybe give us an A-Wing, to think outside the box a bit. Hell, throw Expanded Universe fans a bone and make it an E-Wing. I'm not saying that there needs to be some Easter Egg to suggest Gosling is playing Corran Horn (though, let's face it, any diehard “Star Wars” fan will tell you they could do a lot worse than adapting Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston's peerlessly great “X-Wing” books), but something to suggest, you know, intrigue. “Who's that guy?” People loved asking that when Vanity Fair would run their (color!) first looks at “Star Wars” movies back in the day. No one is going to ask “Who's that guy?” about this image.

 










Sometimes, a traumatic experience burns itself so deeply into your psyche that your worldview is irreparably altered. For me, one such memory was the first look photo for “Tulsa King” Season 1 dropping. The year was 2022, we hadn't seen a trailer for the Sylvester Stallone-led gangster series, and the world was hopelessly naive to the crime comedy delights that awaited us. But, one day, our first breadcrumb arrived… and it was just a picture of Stallone standing in a suit, looking exactly like I imagine he looks when he goes out for coffee on a random Tuesday. 

Perhaps it was just a formative memory because it came early in my media career, but I remember being dumbfounded by the notion that a show whose entire appeal rested on a single star would announce itself with such a regular-ass picture of said star. (To give some reluctant credit, he was standing in Tulsa, but I feel that's a detail we could have inferred from the title.) Close friends of mine know not to bring up the “Tulsa King” first look around me anymore because it often devolves into a rant that has real potential to ruin a night. 

“Tulsa King” has since become one of my favorite shows, so all's well that ends well. But that was the day I decided I was done with first look photos. I'm not even sure that the difference between black-and-white or color matters. I simply have no desire to see A-list stars looking exactly like themselves in a movie before I have the chance to see a second of them in action. I don't think there's a single person who looks at these things who isn't already following movies closely enough to be aware of what's coming out. These photos aren't swaying anybody, no matter how devilishly handsome Ryan Gosling looks. 

 










Nobody on this planet is lacking for opportunities to see pictures of celebrities anymore. We can Google or stream anything at any time, and algorithms go out of their way to shove our favorite beautiful people in our faces at all hours of the day. Yet we're still just uploading more pixels of the same people to data servers simply because we can! Somebody has to stand up to this madness, and I'm willing to risk everything to do it. I know attention spans are getting shorter, but I truly believe the human race is capable of waiting for a trailer. We need less stimulation and more patience, and these disingenuously named “first looks” are not helping us in either department.

Hayley Williams has always been bold — from her brightly-hued hair dye to her kickass attitude as the lead singer of Paramore. When it comes to music, the singer is equally unafraid. She belts her heart out and spits brutally honest lyrics across the band's discography and her own solo albums, 2020's Petals for Armor and 2021's Flowers for Vases/Descansos. But never has Williams sounded as brave as she does on her third album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. “I'll be the biggest star at this fucking karaoke bar,” she declares on the moody title track. The song's chorus repeats one line over and over again (“Can only go up from here”) as Williams gives up on shooting for the moon and settles for a more modest version of fame. It's ironic that a song about a literal ego death should be a highlight of Williams' strongest solo work to date. On Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, she's headed well beyond the stars — and she knows it.


	“Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party” and 16 other songs were surprise-released at the beginning of August after the singer initially uploaded the collection of songs on her website via an old-school web player. Despite being long enough for a full LP, the collection wasn't marketed as an album. (Even though it totally was). But now, after Williams gave Ego Death a properly long name true to her emo roots, and an official track list, the project finally feels complete.

	











	The track list was a major piece of this puzzle. Once Williams uploaded the 17 singles to streaming platforms just a few days after the web player, fans immediately created their own track lists through playlists. An overzealous Haleyhead even compiled all of the fan-made trackl ists into a website. Just like the web player, the experience felt plucked from the early-aughts days of Limewire downloads and the detailed labor of CD and cassette mixtapes. Williams said she wanted to shirk the weighty responsibility onto fans and gain inspiration from the way they received the music. But one listen to Ego Death and it's apparent the unconventional rollout was by design. Every heartfelt lyric and song transition details how Williams has clawed her way out of major loss and grief to uncover a new version of herself.

	Not only did Williams finally select a track list and provide an album title, she also shared a new song, “Parachute.” It's cacophonous and raging with regret, packing its deepest blows in the second verse. “You were at my wedding … You could've told me not to do it,” she shouts. That kind of romantic trauma is a theme throughout the record. Her rough vocal take is filled with hurt; Williams strains her voice as each word turns into a yell. It makes the wail she uncorked on Paramore's “All I Wanted” pale in comparison. There are plenty of other lovesick melodies on Ego Death, from the Lost in Translation-inspired “Dream Girl in Shibuya” to the Weezer-esque “Disappearing Man.” But “Parachute” sums up the scope of the heartbreak that defines much of the album best, especially as it closes out the LP. It follows the tender “I Won't Quit on You,” a hopeful moment where Williams promises she won't give up on her relationship. On “Parachute,” that hope is lost. But even so, with tracks like “Whim” and “Love Me Different,” the singer shows she's not afraid to open the metal cages to her black-tar heart and show all its boundless love.


	Throughout the album, there are similar hints of desired optimism. The sun peaks through the blinds and Williams is desperate to feel its warmth once more as she struggles with her loss. The cover alone is a perfect example of this dichotomy: it's a black-and-white close-up image of Williams with a yellow square around her face, echoing the aesthetic of the 17 singles. Even on some of the most depressing tracks, like the meditative “Glum” or antidepressant ode “Mirtzapine,” lyrics like “In the wake of your sunshine, I've never felt more glum” are pushed up against vibrant beats and clashes of powerful guitar.

	At 17 songs, Ego Death might seem bloated. But this album marks the first time Williams has ever owned her work outright, and who can blame her for wanting to make the most of that? (In 2024, the musician's decades-plus, controversial record contract with Atlantic ended.) This newfound freedom is a revelation for Williams, who calls out the “dumb motherfuckers that I made rich” on the trip-hop-tinged “Ice in My OJ.” Even with the lengthy track list, every song feels purposeful, each its own reflection of the musician's unique sonic landscape. Williams reaches for all of her influences and sprinkles samples of them onto Ego Death songs. From French alt-rock band Phoenix on “Love Me Different” to post-Weezer jokers the Bloodhound Gang for the chorus of “Discovery Channel,” and even a nod to TLC's “Waterfalls” in the lyrics of the title track, the album is a kaleidoscope of the music taste Williams has cultivated over the years.

Ego Death is also notably more percussive and louder than the rest of the singer's solo work. Producer Daniel James worked on Flowers for Vases and returned for Williams' third LP. With help from Paramore touring musicians Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard, as well as Lorde producer Jim-E Stack, who has a hand in “True Believer,” every track is propulsive no matter if it's diving into synth-pop or alt-rock. Gone is the sparse production of Petals or the quiet dissonance of Flowers. Here, the music is alive and banger-ready.


	If Williams' first two LPs saw her dipping her toe into solo work, Ego Death is a full plunge. Never has she sounded more certain or free. There is a kind of death here, one where the musician leaves behind bits of her past self, but more than anything, the album feels like a baptism. Williams emerges from the depths of her focused creation ready for a new life, where the possibilities are endless.

With “The Favourite” and “Poor Things,” Yorgos Lanthimos went from the Greek arthouse curiosity behind films like “Dogtooth” and “The Lobster” to a major Oscar player. His tart-tongued Queen Anne period piece “The Favourite” earned 10 Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress Olivia Colman. With “Poor Things,” he again solidified a Best Actress winner with Emma Stone as a brain-transplant patient turned feminist, with three crafts wins in tow. The writing was on the walls for future success when Lanthimos and his screenwriting collaborator Efthimis Filippou earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for “The Lobster” in 2016.

“The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and his nihilistic triptych “Kinds of Kindness” (which he shot as a diversion from the post-production rigors of “Poor Things”) were all set up at Searchlight; with “Bugonia,” he joins Focus Features for the first time. 

His latest film and tenth feature, “Bugonia” premieres Thursday night in competition at the 82nd Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos' stomping grounds for “The Favourite” and 2023 Golden Lion winner “Poor Things,” though press caught the first screenings on the Lido this morning. Lanthimos and his cast and crew (including cinematographer Robbie Ryan) took questions from the Venice press corps afterward.

 










A hostage thriller with a timely political bent, “Bugonia” is a remake of the 2003 Korean sci-fi film “Save the Green Planet!” “Kinds of Kindness” Cannes 2024 Best Actor winner Jesse Plemons plays a mentally disturbed vigilante who kidnaps Emma Stone‘s big pharma CEO, believing she is an alien sent to Earth to take over the human race. 

While early footage suggested Stone might factor as a supporting actor in “Bugonia,” she's indeed the co-lead of the film alongside Plemons (Aidan Delbis plays the cousin Plemons forces into his conspiracist scheme). “Bugonia” doesn't necessarily feel like an Oscar movie up front, though Focus' October release date and festival play this weekend at Telluride suggest awards hopes for the violent, darkly funny sci-fi allegory.

The script comes from Emmy-winning “Succession” and “The Menu” writer/director Will Tracy, rather than Lanthimos' Oscar-nominated writing collaborators Tony McNamara (“Poor Things,” “The Favourite”) or Filippou.

“With the exception of Will, we have all worked with Yorgos multiple times,” Stone said at the press conference, also noting that the “idea that we are alone” in the universe, given the movie's extraterrestrial narrative, is “pretty narcissistic to think.” She added, “It ends up feeling like … a really comforting and safe environment to explore and feel as free as possible. I know everybody says it's ‘like we're a family,' but it does really feel like that when you've made so many things together and you've sort of been in those trenches together.”

 










She also said the film, in which Plemons is a would-be foot soldier for the human resistance against corporate greed, is “reflective of this point in time in our world,” and a “really fascinating and moving, funny and fucked-up, and alive” story. 

Both Plemons and Stone revealed they did not watch Jang Joon-hwan's “Save the Green Planet!” before making “Bugonia,” which shot on 35mm and VistaVision cameras in England last summer. DP Robbie Ryan's fourth collaboration with Lanthimos after “The Favourite,” “Poor Things,” and “Kinds of Kindness” should gain notices of awards crafts voters for its ambitious visuals despite the pressure-cooker, home-invasion chamber drama setup.

“Not much of the dystopia in this film is very fictional,” said Lanthimos, who recognized the film became even more time-sensitive during production and post-production with lone wolf assassins bent on taking down corporate bigwigs dominating news headlines. “A lot of it is very reflective of the real world. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a dystopic film, which, in my mind, is presenting an image of the future and what happened to civilization.”

“I don't know how much time we have with everything that's happening in the world, with technology, AI, wars, climate change, and the denial of all these things,” he added.

 










“Bugonia” might be too weird and too violent for the Academy, but with a roomy Best Actress field (no certain entrant stands out just yet), two-time winner Stone (“La La Land” as well) could break into the race. Calling her performance as CEO Michelle Fuller — which the actress literally shaved her head for — a supporting actress role would be blatant category fraud, as she's in most scenes of the movie going toe-to-toe with co-lead Plemons. And the physical rigors of her portrayal (the movie appears to show her getting a buzzcut live on camera) have already earned the sort of attention that makes her a Best Actress contender to watch for.

Plemons too, all gaunt and disheveled and mentally harried, makes the case for an overdue lead actor nomination after earning a supporting nod for “The Power of the Dog.” It's a busy Best Actor race, though, with George Clooney also debuting in Venice as a Hollywood actor at the end of his tether in Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.” In terms of Best Picture chances, the edgy and dark “Bugonia” doesn't feel so tailor-made for the top category as the high-concept crowd-pleaser “Poor Things” or the period lushness and spicy dialogue of “The Favourite.”

I'd keep a closer eye on the cinematography and craft of “Bugonia” in terms of an awards traction, though Tracy's pedigree from “Succession” and as an EP on the Emmy-nominated HBO movie “Mountainhead” gives him an awards season edge. Plus, the 2025 Academy loves an underdog-championing, eat-the-rich story, as we of course saw with the more accessible but still original indie “Anora.”

 










Focus Features will release “Bugonia” in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

Before releasing his great new album, Live Laugh Love, Earl Sweatshirt played it for fans at a Los Angeles listening party. The thing was, the rapper was not there, instead sending an imposter the way that the late MF Doom used to do. Earl Sweatshirt is now giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the whole imposter process, via his new video for “Crisco.”

The new video, from director, producer, and editor Jimmy Regular, begins with a simple message: “earl was not looking forward to performing at his album listening party. instead, he decided to cast someone to embody his overall essence on stage.” From there, we see that Sweatshirt, his mother, and Zack Fox auditioned four men to fill in for the rapper. The obvious candidate was Gary Murakami, who spent some time with Sweatshirt to see what living life as the Californian is really like. The visual ends with Murakami's stand-in performance for Sweatshirt at the party. Watch the “Crisco” video below.

“Crisco” is the second Live Laugh Love track to get a music video, following “Tourmaline.” The album follows 2022's Sick! and the Alchemist collaboration Voir Dire.

	Influencer Emilie Kiser spoke out for the first time on social media Thursday following an investigation into her son's drowning death in May. In a lengthy Instagram Story statement, Kiser said she's taking full accountability for not doing more to prevent her song Trigg's death. She also spoke out about the intense grief she's faced over the past few months.


	“I never thought we would experience grief in this way or the pain of losing him so suddenly. It's a pain, heartache, and void that no family should ever have to endure,” she wrote. “I take full accountability as Trigg's mother, and I know I should have done more to protect him. One of the hardest lessons I carry is that a permanent pool fence could have saved his life, and it's something I will never overlook again.” 


	She continued: “I hope amidst this pain, Trigg's story will help prevent other children and families from suffering the same loss.”


	Kiser said that she's spent the last few months coming to terms with her son's death, calling Trigg — who died on May 18 after drowning on May 12 at the Kiser home in Phoenix while under the care of his father — “our baby and our best friend.”

	“The light and spirit he brought into this world was bright, pure, joyful, and undeniable. We miss him every second of every day and continuing forward often feels unbearable,” she wrote.


	Kiser thanked her family for their “unconditional love” and their supportive audience for the “outpouring of love” through these “extremely tough times.” Kiser wrote: “The only way through grief is to keep going minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, and every moment since that day I've done my best to keep picking myself up.”

	











	Kiser concluded her post by sharing that she will be “establishing more boundaries with what I share online” moving forward as well. “In the future, I hope to be in a place to share more about how I am navigating this grief, but right now, all I can say is thank you for the love, compassion, patience and space you've given us to grieve. I am more grateful for it than can ever be expressed,” she wrote.


	Trigg drowned while under the care of his father and Kiser's husband, Brady. According to a May police report, surveillance footage showed that Trigg was unsupervised for at least nine minutes and was in the water for seven minutes before his father found him. During that time, Brady was allegedly caring for their newborn son and watching an NBA playoff game.

EXCLUSIVE: Kristen Bell and Daniela Melchior are set to join David Harbour in the cast of Violent Night 2 for Universal Pictures and 87North. Tommy Wirkola will direct from a screenplay by Pat Casey and Josh Miller.


	Universal Pictures will release Violent Night 2 on Wednesday, December 4, 2026.


	While exact plot details are under wraps, Harbour's ass-kicking Santa Clause is back. And he's not happy.


	The 2022 bare-knuckle holiday sensation Violent Night followed an embittered Santa, armed with lethal combat skills, who takes out a team of ruthless mercenaries to rescue a girl and her family. Now, it's time for not-so-jolly Saint Nick to suit up again.

Violent Night 2 will be produced by 87North founders Kelly McCormick and David Leitch through their first-look deal with Universal. Universal's EVP Production Development Matt Reilly and Director of Development Tony Ducret will oversee the project.

	Following breakout roles in The Suicide Squad and Fast X, Melchior most recently co-starred in the Amazon MGM Studios reimagining of Road House opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. Her upcoming slate includes Balls Up, a comedy directed by Academy Award winner Peter Farrelly (Green Book) in which she stars alongside Mark Wahlberg.

Imagine if Michael Haneke's “Funny Games” were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia.” 

Jesse Plemons stars as a galaxy-brained conspiracist beekeeper who's either severely mentally ill or the only prophet among us, hijacking his cousin (Aidan Delbis) into a scheme to kidnap a big pharma executive (Emma Stone) whom he believes to be a body-snatched alien sent to end the planet.

 










Lanthimos works from an on-the-nose-for-the-now feature screenplay by “Succession” and “The Menu” writer Will Tracy, diverting from the droll theater of cruelty present in scripts by Efthimis Filippou (“Kinds of Kindness”) or the florid repartee of Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”). “Bugonia” has all the streak of Tracy's kill-the-rich brand of satire, but with the Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker interrogating the potential performativity of such capitalist-fighting crusades.

That's because Lanthimos brings to this film his signature stamp of perverse detachment, though without the fish-eyed lenses this harrowing time around depravity's merry-go-round. Recall that the most unexpectedly mainstream-friendly film of his career, “Poor Things,” revealed a tender, even hopeful side to the “Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Dogtooth” director known for his clinical stance on humankind's worthiness; “Kinds of Kindness,” though, snapped us back into his grim worldview with a trio of nihilistic tales about mental manipulation.

“Bugonia” falls somewhere between that film, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” and “The Lobster” in terms of both its double-sided callousness toward and guarded optimism about our willingness or ability to reverse course. 

It's both a funny, fucked-up trifle — one that hurtles toward a hilariously unsubtle, “Burn After Reading”-esque note of we-learned-nothing existential futility — and an earnest message movie for our disintegrating present, a warning that we are probably too late to effect any real change on the world we so vaingloriously messed up. Accusations of Lanthimos veering toward the twee of late (or always) apply less to “Bugonia,” which has no shortage of entrails or a torture scene set to, of all songs, Green Day's “Nick Shea.” 

 










Lanthimos' tenth feature would have been more consistently engaging, a real home run, as a 90-minute feature as opposed to two hours that encroach on a tedious overplaying of their themes. But would it then seem important enough? “Bugonia” is either profound or profoundly silly. It's also both.

This time, Lanthimos takes a stab at a remake, faithfully re-mounting, save for a few significant changes, Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 Korean sci-fi movie “Save the Green Planet!” Ultimately, this film's absurd existentialist deadpan aligns Lanthimos' work here closer to Ruben Östlund than ever — himself a filmmaker likely drawing from Lanthimos these days — to mine the comedy of repetitious futility to disorienting effect. Social burnout Teddy lives in the kind of paranoiac's hovel where the windows are papered over by tinfoil, and where you can all but feel the bugs crawling over you, while not working as a factory lackey for biomedical company Auxolith in middle-of-depressing-nowhere U.S.A. He maintains multiple beehives in his backyard, obsessing over the colony collapse disorder that threatens not just his bees, but all of them everywhere. Is his property the control room of a hoped-for utopia, or an unkempt truther's hell-hole bunker? You decide.

At the top of the Auxolith's pyramid is decorated CEO Michelle Fuller. She keeps a picture with Michelle Obama in her office, but bristles at the language of DEI training while knowing well enough to put on a placid, phony smile and encourage her employees to, sure, head home by 5:30 p.m. — one of many requisite gestures of pity toward her underlings that, dear God no, should not be understood by them as compulsory. One of those “we care about our employees” little treats of false gratitude that always comes with an asterisk, a footnote, and then that other footnote. 

 










Anyone who's been a cog in the corporate world can resonate with the hollow ring of Michelle's posturing, as if a gun was put to her head by a committee demanding she do better. In the boardroom, she's all for socially conscious messaging around her company's questionable medical advancements, but off the clock, when she's not popping mystery pills and singing to Chappell Roan in her shiny SUV, she has no trouble sleeping at night despite her company having destroyed lives with a vanguard opioid-withdrawal medication that backfired.

Teddy is one such casualty of Auxolith's pioneering biotechnology, with his mother (Alicia Silverstone) now in a coma bed with tubes attached after a drug trial gone wrong. So it makes sense that the chosen target of his master plan is Michelle herself. Jacked up on steroids, Teddy and his dutiful, clearly exploited cousin Don stage a home invasion, drugging and kidnapping Michelle to drag her back to Teddy's disheveled outpost. Lanthimos and cinematographer Robbie Ryan stage and shoot said home invasion like a Jacques Tati sequence — that is to say, from an amused, ironic distance that watches humans squirm and scramble without intervention. Though, of course, Lanthimos not intervening or getting too close to the action is its own sort of intervention, doing by not doing.

 










But “Bugonia” will eventually rub your face much closer into viscera and shrapnel and other bodily horrors. Emma Stone actually shaved her head for the movie, appearing to do so on camera with commendable, unfazed dedication to the task, as Teddy and Don hold Michelle hostage, and she starts to play along with the idea that, yeah, sure, she might be an extraterrestrial sent to our Earth to wreak havoc. Anything to get her out of those damned chains, and convince Teddy to loosen his tightening grasp, hell-bent on Michelle withdrawing her supposed species from Earth before the next lunar eclipse. Is Teddy insane, or actually onto something? The film is clever in how it constantly shifts our allegiances, and its own.

“Bugonia” is fascinating in contrast to a film like “Kinds of Kindness,” which Lanthimos shot almost as a lark, a slice of escapism from the large-scale demands of “Poor Things,” with a minimalist crew and set. His latest film is even more scaled-down — until it isn't — than “Kinds of Kindness,” serving almost as a stagelike chamber drama wrought on Super 35 and VistaVision. The canvas may be small, but Lanthimos colors inside the lines with grandeur, treating the deceptively walled-up material with the application of a bigger-budget studio project.

 










Stone is predictably great, but her Michelle Fuller is closer to her spiraling flip-anthropist in TV's “The Curse” than the can't-take-her-down feminist Bella Baxter of “Poor Things.” Lanthimos' skepticism of humankind's capacity to evolve is a welcome comfort, as always, in our politically miserable era. Some hot-button jokes land better than others, though “Bugonia” is always questioning the ideology on either side. Teddy confesses to having tried alt-right, “alt-lite,” Marxism, you name it, with no costume quite fitting his mentally collapsing outlook. There's a great line in which Teddy calls college education a “credentialist scam for laundering privilege,” and it's spoken so convincingly that it makes you wonder, well, isn't it?

A superb and unvarnished Plemons, who played a cherub-faced corporate drone in one of three roles in “Kinds of Kindness,” slims down and goes gaunter and more manic, physically and emotionally, than ever to play a borderline-psychopathic conspiracy head with sadistic tendencies. And don't count out Stavros Halkias in a Paul Walter Hauser-type performance as Teddy's childhood babysitter who's now the town cop. When cops show up at the door for a wellness check at an ongoing, in-the-basement hostage situation at any house in the movies, well, we know how that story ends.

 










The timely urgency of “Bugonia” could be identified from outer space unless you've been living under a celestial object these days, as rogue vigilantes taking down corporate bigwigs have, in a post-2020 world, turned into the folk heroes dominating headlines and activating internet warriors. That's not to say “Bugonia” carries an empowering message: If anything, it's distrusting in humanity's ability to rise above our own failures, arguing that while it's not too late to turn things around, we probably won't anyway.

“Bugonia” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Focus Features will release the film in select theaters on Friday, October 24 and widely on Friday, October 31.

Ryan Gosling stars in the Shawn Levy-directed Star Wars movie.


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	The latest Star Wars movie, Star Wars: Starfighter, began rolling cameras in the United Kingdom Thursday, with Lucasfilm marking the occassion by unveiling the full cast.


	Flynn Gray, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams are the new additions on the call sheet for the Lucasfilm feature, which is being directed by Shawn Levy and stars Ryan Gosling. Mia Goth and Matt Smith were already revealed to be in the cast, playing villains.




	“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” said Levy in a statement. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”

Starfighter is a standalone film not connected to previous Star Wars movies or characters from the so-called Skywalker Saga, the films revolving around Luke Skywalker and his father, Anakin.




			Popular on THR		







	But there is, of course, the Star Wars timeline that must be followed, and Starfighter takes place approximately five years after the events of 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.












	Gray is the big discovery, as the kid actor nabs the break of a lifetime to star alongside Gosling in a Star Wars feature. The script, penned by Jonathan Tropper and which, of course, is being kept under wraps, is said to see Gosling's character protect a young charge from evildoers in a galaxy-spanning adventure. Actors Stateside and in the UK were in contention for months and months before casting Gray, who has appeared in one episode of Wednesday and an Irish crime show titled Borderline.


	An almost equally healthy search was conducted for the actress to play his mother, a role which appears to have gone to Adams. (She worked with Levy on his 2009 movie Night at the Museum: Battle for the Smithsonian and starred in the Levy-produced sci-fi drama Arrival.) Lucasfilm did not reveal plot or character details in Thursday's announcement. 


	Much of the supporting cast is British. Bird is known for his work on The Inbetweeners series and movies, while Westman appeared with Claire Danes in period mini-series The Essex Serpent. Ings is one of the stars of Guy Ritchie's crime series The Gentlemen.


	Pierre is already in the space business, as the star of DC Studios' upcoming show Lanterns, and broke out with the Netflix hit Rebel Ridge.


	Levy and Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy are producing. Executive producers are Gosling, Dan Levine, Mary McLaglen, and Josh McLaglen.


Starfighter will be released theatrically May 28, 2027.

Exerting control over media and information is one of the hallmarks of a fascist movement. Apropos of nothing, two prominent Republicans from the House Committee on Oversight and Government reform, Kentucky representative James Comer and South Carolina's Nancy Mace, have launched an inquiry into Wikipedia. In an announcement, the inquiry's goal is defined as “investigating organized efforts, undertaken in violation of Wikipedia platform rules, to influence U.S. public opinion on important and sensitive topics by manipulating Wikipedia articles.” 

“Multiple studies and reports have highlighted efforts to manipulate information on the Wikipedia platform for propaganda aimed at Western audiences,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Wikimedia Foundation Chief Executive Officer Maryana Iskander. “One recent report raised troubling questions about potentially systematic efforts to advance antisemitic and anti-Israel information in Wikipedia articles related to conflicts with the State of Israel. A second investigation detailed actions by hostile nation-state actors to expose Western audiences to pro-Kremlin and anti-Western messaging by manipulating Wikipedia articles and other news outlets relied on for training AI chatbots.”

The inquiry “seeks information to help our examination of how Wikipedia responds to such threats and how frequently it creates accountability when intentional, egregious, or highly suspicious patterns of conduct on topics of sensitive public interest are brought to attention,” the letter reads. Comer and Mace profess themselves concerned about “malicious conduct that injects bias or undermines a neutral point of view” on Wikipedia. 

Of course, what's considered a “biased” perspective or a “neutral” one is subjective, at least in this day and age. President Donald Trump's administration has undertaken an effort to revise the programming of national institutions such as the Smithsonian. This was done under an executive order called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which claims there's been “a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation's history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” Trump's admin has also made efforts to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the country, which is being reflected in the programming and staffing of Hollywood studios and news organizations. CBS News, for instance, is set to install an ombudsman to “receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns.” Increasingly, it seems the only welcome perspective in the U.S. is that of the President and the modern Republican party.

Anyone who clicks play on the trailer for Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia will recognize the opening chords of Chappell Roan's “Good Luck, Babe!” but be advised: none of these characters are fine and they're definitely not cool. Emma Stone's character seems to think she's both of those things at the beginning of the clip as she strides into her fancy office to record some sort of corporate gobbledygook about diversity and empowerment. That changes, though, as soon as she meets two conspiracy nuts played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis. 

Like any good conspiracy theorists, Plemons and Delbis' characters are 100% convinced they're doing the right thing. “Welcome to the headquarters of the human resistance,” Plemons says after kidnapping Stone and shaving her head to prevent her from “contacting [her] ship.” Later, Delbis accuses her of being “alien filth.” The whole concept is pretty funny, but it would be a bit funnier if it didn't feel so eminently timely. 



“I know who you are. I know what you are,” Plemons tells his captive later in the trailer. The thing is—maybe he does. Plemons and Delbis' characters are portrayed with all the usual conspiracy theorist trappings, but for all we know, they're spot on. Stone's CEO could very well belong to an extraterrestrial species hell-bent on capturing and destroying the Earth. 

What we do know is that the latest Lanthimos project is loosely based on a Korean black comedy called Save The Green Planet!. It also has a killer team of humans behind it. Stone does double duty as an actor and producer in her latest collaboration with the Poor Things director. Lanthimos also abducted Square Peg's Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen to produce the project. Stavros Halkias and Alicia Silverstone also star. 

Bugonia will open in select theaters October 24 before expanding October 31. That's if the aliens don't get us first, of course.

TIFF and NYFF are just around the corner, but we're finally starting to see trailers for some of the films that already made waves at festivals earlier this year. The latest offering is Kleber Mendonça Filho's The Secret Agent, which Neon snagged the rights to after it received widespread acclaim at Cannes this spring. Filho and Wagner Moura left the Croisette with the Best Director and Best Actor awards respectively, so this is definitely one to look out for.

The film's trailer portrays an energetic but chaotic vision of 1977 Brazil. “Marcelo (Moura), a technology expert in his early 40s, is on the run,” the film's logline reads. “He arrives in Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes that the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.” Marcelo may also not be quite as much of a pacifist as he likes to envision himself. “I am not a violent person,” he says at the end of the clip. “But this man… I'd kill him with a hammer.” 



The Secret Agent is a Portuguese-language film, marking a return to Moura's native language after starring in English-language productions like Civil War and Dope Thief. “It's incredibly liberating to act in Portuguese,” the actor told Variety in May. “When I work in English or Spanish, the words don't come out of my mouth filled with memories the way they do in Portuguese. For me, it's pivotal to keep connected to Brazilian cinema.” 

Filho, who previously competed at Cannes with 2016's Aquarius and 2019's Bacurau, also expressed a lot of pride in the film and its portrayal of his country. “The film takes place in a pre-globalized Brazil,” he said. “Globalization standardized worldwide aesthetics, which made it even more beautiful to work on recreating 70s Recife. People went to their families to look for pictures of their parents, to understand how they dressed, how their houses looked… I believe this brings a great level of authenticity. As I've said, I'm very happy with the film.”

The Secret Agent opens November 26 in select theaters.

	Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings and Amy Adams have officially been set to join Ryan Gosling in Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Starfighter. Shawn Levy is directing the pic, which was penned by Jonathan Tropper.


	“I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said Thursday, when the casting news was revealed on Starwars.com, along with the news that production has begun in the UK.

	The post also included a first look at the set, with Gosling and Gray leaning and sitting, respectively, on what looks to be a landspeeder. See it above.

	











	“From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally,” Levy continued. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.”


	The film is set to bow on May 28, 2027. Levy produces with Kennedy. Executive producers are Gosling, Dan Levine, Mary McLaglen and Josh McLaglen. 


Details of Starfighter were unveiled in April at the Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo. The film is set five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the Skywalker saga and currently stands as the final feature chronologically on the Star Wars timeline.

	











	When Deadline broke the news of Smith's casting, sources said he would be playing the villain role.

Peacock will become available in Amazon Channels, as the NBCUniversal streaming service pursues more bundles and channel deals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, will become available as an add-on for Prime Video customers as part of a wide-ranging deal between Amazon and Comcast.


	The agreement will see Peacock Premium Plus (that's the ad-free tier) become available via Prime Video's channels offering for $16.99 per month or $169.99 per year. Prime Video Channels has become a major aggregator of streaming services, with HBO Max, Paramount+, Starz and Apple TV+ among the services offered, underscoring its effectiveness in driving subscriptions and Amazon's one-stop billing capabilities.

	Peacock has largely eschewed from participating in bundles and channels programs up to this point, but a source familiar with the talks says that the company is likely to become more aggressive in pursuing those sorts of arrangements moving forward, using the Amazon deal as a template.


	While Peacock has been available as part of bundles within the Comcast Xfinity environment, and in a deal with Charter Spectrum, Prime Video Channels is the first tech platform to offer the service as an add-on. Google's YouTube and Roku also have robust channels offerings, while Disney and HBO Max have been opportunistically seeking bundle arrangements.


	The Amazon deal is likely the first of a number of deals that will expand the availability of Peacock, which is still smaller than many of its subscription streaming competitors with about 41 million subscribers. Peacock has shifted much of its focus to live sports, and will add the NBA this fall.


	The deal also improves Prime Video's sports proposition, with the platform also recently adding Fox One to its channels offering. With both Peacock and Fox One, Prime Video now provides access to four of the five national NFL packages (ESPN is still the lone holdout for now).

	











	The Amazon-Comcast deal also includes extensions on distribution deals covering a number of other areas, ensuring Peacock's continued availability on Fire TV devices, Prime Video availability on Xfinity X1 devices, and allowing users to continue to buy and rent films from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on Prime Video.


	“This multi-faceted set of agreements is a testament to our close collaboration with Amazon, delivering significant value across our businesses and expanding exposure of our world-class content,” said Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation. “Millions of Amazon customers can continue to enjoy NBCUniversal's popular shows, films, and live events on Peacock via Fire TV or through Prime Video Subscriptions, or buying or renting on Prime Video, while also accessing Amazon's premier entertainment on Xfinity X1 — ensuring they can watch what they love, wherever and however they choose.”


	“At Amazon, we are always working to make customers' lives better every day and these new agreements with Comcast NBCU are fantastic for millions of customers, who are looking for the fastest and easiest way to find all their entertainment and sports in one place,” added Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “Adding Peacock to our growing list of subscriptions – while renewing our long-standing agreements for Fire TV, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and Xfinity X1 – deepens an incredible working relationship with Comcast/NBCU, and we look forward to a future of mutual distribution that benefits our shared customers.”

Ivy and Theo (Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch), chef and architect, meet on a whim in the Michelin-grade kitchen where Ivy works, after Theo bursts in unannounced to blow off steam mid-meal. Disappointed and distressed that their superiors can't see their minor geniuses—dehydrated blueberries and cascading garden balconies, respectively—they bond over a distrust of the old guard and an immediate hope in one another, one that blooms with the swift surreality of a time-lapsed flower reaching maturation in a minute flat. Before they leave the kitchen, they're in love. But unbeknownst to them, the war of The Roses has begun.

Calling it a meet-cute wouldn't be accurate. They don't do “cute.” When it comes to Ivy and Theo, unapologetic audacity is the only road traveled, which makes for a beginning as explosive as the ending. “But we haven't even had sex yet,” Ivy says suggestively, the two having only just exchanged names. “Well, that's only minutes away,” returns Theo. The seemingly pre-programmed words tumble out of their mouths as if they were suddenly out of control, on existential autopilot, as surprised by what they're saying as we are.

Soon after they meet, they leave the U.K. for California, where they take root and raise a couple kids. In the first phase of their life together, Theo rises through the ranks of the architecture world and Ivy shapes the children, as well as the family's every meal, much to her pleasure. Opinionated, irreverent, and secure, even in the face of each other, the Roses possess an ebullience and resilience that slowly erodes (albeit, in hilarious fashion) under the rushing river of marriage management and child-rearing that comes to dominate their busying lives.

The cultural significance of Warren Adler's The War Of The Roses bookended the 1980s with the release of his novel in '81 and the Danny DeVito-directed film in '89. In 2025, the book and movie might as well be historical artifacts, but the ghost of the story has stuck around. The tale of two embittered lovers going straight for the jugular carries across generations—it's unfortunately supremely relatable. Modernized remake The Roses sits under the glass ceiling of the rom-com genre and walks on well-tread narrative territory. But, under Jay Roach's measured direction, that's not a problem. He gives the timeless story an original edge, never allowing a dull frame to slow the sharp film. 

One can't imagine Ivy and Theo together after the opening scene, a disastrous marriage counseling session that ends with the therapist swearing them off in the name of incurable resentment, self-righteousness, and defensiveness as the crumbling couple gangs up on the innocent clinician in a fit of delirious enablement. (In the therapist's defense, the nicest thing either of them had to say about each other was, “He has arms.”) A dark, organ-reeling jazz jam propels the sequence, a tonal harbinger of the passion and ferocity to come and a bellwether for the film's terrific taste in music, both in Severance composer Theodore Shapiro's score and the inspired indie-folk soundtrack.

However, it's also almost impossible to imagine the pair apart after the first hour of inimitable chemistry and pitch-black comedy charm. Things finally go awry when Theo's attempt at a masterpiece—a maritime museum in the shape of a large sailing vessel—opens on the same night an unparalleled storm hits the bay. But the storm also gives way to a new opportunity for Ivy. In the second act, the couple's dynamic flips, and she's the globetrotting careerist to Theo's stay-at-home dad.  Eventually, they each get the opportunity to fund the others' dreams, and they do. But it's still not enough. The tides turn practically overnight, and the sudden desperation for divorce begets an avalanche of life-ruining sabotage.

Supporting them are Kate McKinnon and Andy Samberg (American friends, met at a gun range) in career-best bit parts: A bizarro, kinky-sad, nothing-to-lose, overfamiliar type for the former—an equal blend of Sheila Sovage, Debette Goldry, and Kathryn Hahn in Step Brothers—and an obliviously overconfident dude-bro for the latter. But, instead of an unhinged couple in their 20s or 30s, they've adapted their mode to the disillusionment of 40-somethings sunk up to the eyes in suburban suppression. Allison Janney takes a terse turn as an unbearable divorce lawyer, while Ncuti Gatwa and Sunita Mani stand out among the rest of the stacked cast.

Roach—the wunderkind studio comedy director (the Austin Powers trilogy, Meet The Parents and Fockers) turned historical dramatist (Trumbo, Bombshell)—hasn't delivered much of note in the last nine years. But he's back with a bang in The Roses. There's a rejuvenated spirit to his pace and craft that stems from a now-veteran wisdom and the fresh collaboration with screenwriter Tony McNamara, who's had enormous success in film, alongside Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite, Poor Things, Cruella), and TV (The Great), since 2018.

Having written a much looser and sharper-tongued Colman character in The Favourite—which is saying a lot, considering Ivy names her dainty seafood shack “We've Got Crabs!”—McNamara precisely pens her role, while Colman winks, flirts, punches, swings, and sings right in her comfort zone. To make the rich richer, it turns out Cumberbatch is McNamara's male Colman. The wit and restraint behind his interpretation of the driven-husband-turned-superdad is grounded in this same script-star chemistry. As a result, the leads are magnets, whether they're surgically picking each other apart with the cruelty of Caligula or steaming up a seductive romance. Their remarkable rapport makes The Roses essential viewing, a must-watch rom-com.

T
he first ICE detention center inaugurated in the second Trump era is a squat, soot-colored building surrounded by parking lots, warehouses, and petrochemical holding tanks on a deserted stretch of industrial waterfront in Newark, New Jersey. 


	In May, this patch of asphalt and chainlink was the site of a dramatic showdown between nearly two dozen federal law enforcement officers and four Democratic officials. That encounter has culminated in one of the most shockingly brazen political prosecutions in recent history — a case that, depending on its outcome, could augur a new political reality for anyone willing to challenge the president's regime.


	Delaney Hall is operated by GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison contractor whose for-profit facilities have been dogged by allegations of wrongful death, sexual abuse, and exposing inmates to toxic chemicals. Its corporate PAC was also the first to max out donations to Donald Trump's 2024 reelection campaign. 

	











	Almost as soon as Trump re-took office, GEO Group inked a 15-year, $1 billion contract to warehouse immigrants at Delaney Hall. Before the mothballed facility reopened, inspectors flagged at least two dozen fire code, plumbing, and electricity issues, according to the city's lawyers, who sued in an unsuccessful effort to prevent GEO from resuming operations there.


	Today, Delaney Hall holds 548 individuals — 89 percent of whom have no criminal record — rounded up in the Trump administration's immigration dragnet. 

	











	On May 9, a few days after GEO Group began housing detainees at the Newark detention center, three members of Congress representing New Jersey — Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, in whose district the facility sits — arrived at Delaney Hall to perform an oversight visit. 


	Weeks earlier, the same delegation checked in on a similar facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. (Such inspections are a routine part of Congress' function.) But, this time, their tour was being slow-walked. The members of Congress had already been waiting for an hour and half when Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrived. Baraka was standing inside the fenced area — a guard let him in — when nearly two dozen officers arrived and confronted him. They told Baraka he was trespassing, and threatened to arrest him.

	Video of the incident shows 80-year-old Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman trying to reason with them. “You are here on private property— ” she is saying, as an officer interrupts her. “Ma'am, this is the last warning,” he tells her. 


	“It's ‘Congresswoman,'” McIver replies sharply. “Show some respect!”  


	Baraka agreed to leave, and he was outside the facility a few minutes later when an officer with the Department of Homeland Security announced he would be arresting the Newark mayor anyway, “per the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.” (This is according to body camera footage described in court documents filed as part of an ongoing criminal case over the incident.)


	The crowd of protesters already gathered outside the facility was outraged. “Circle the mayor!” one yelled, as officers — some in windbreakers, others in riot gear — fought their way toward Baraka. Later, as Baraka was violently forced into a pair of handcuffs, McIver could be seen pushing through the crowd after him. The entire scene looked more like a mosh pit than anything else, with everyone — demonstrators, journalists, elected officials and federal officers — shoving and struggling against each other.

	A judge would later excoriate the Justice Department for its “hasty” decision to arrest Baraka, “a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences” — and a choice that, the judge added, “suggests a worrying misstep by your office.” 


	The charges against the mayor were dropped a little more than a week later. But they were replaced by new ones: this time against McIver, who was indicted for  “assaulting, impeding, and interfering” with a federal officer — a trio of charges that, together, carry a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison.

	











	“The days of woke are over,” President Trump said, speaking about the charges against McIver. “That woman — I have no idea who she is — she was out of control. She was shoving federal agents… The days of that crap are over in this country.”


	Trump has been loudly declaring his desire and intention to “lock up” his political enemies since his first campaign for office, but that bluster has taken a more sinister turn since the president returned to office in January, emboldened and enabled by a stable of sycophantic appointees eager to do his bidding. In the last few weeks alone, the Justice Department has announced investigations of Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and New York Attorney General Letitia James, each of whom oversaw high-profile investigations of Trump after his first term. The FBI recently searched the home of former Trump adviser-turned-critic John Bolton. The DOJ has reportedly opened criminal investigations into John Brennan and James Comey, the CIA director and FBI director who both served in Trump's first administration, and, in what may be a prelude of things still to come, Trump's director of national intelligence has accused Barack Obama and his officials of a “years-long coup” against the current president. 


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said last month, referring to Obama and members of his administration. 


	Unlike with California Sen. Alex Padilla (handcuffed and escorted out of a press conference in Los Angeles), or New York City Comptroller Brad Lander (detained at immigration court, before the charges against him were dropped), or some of the other Democrats Trump has threatened or his administration is investigating, the Trump administration appears determined to prosecute McIver to the fullest extent of the law.


	Her case will be an important test of what, if any, guardrails remain to prevent the Trump administration from siccing a pack of Justice Department lawyers on anyone with the temerity to question his administration's authority.


	Sitting in her office in June, wearing a pair of fluffy pink slippers and snacking on a pack of peanut M&Ms after a long day on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, McIver doesn't much resemble the menace U.S. attorney Alina Habba — Trump's former personal lawyer, and the acting, but disputed, United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey — has portrayed in her indictment.

	











	McIver, who favors bright suits and colorful glasses, is gregarious and warm, fussing over anyone who enters her orbit — staffer, colleague, stranger — like they're her own child. The quality of her energy can make McIver seem older than she is. At 38, she is among the youngest sitting members of Congress, and, having arrived here in Washington, D.C., less than a year ago, she is also among its greenest. 


	And yet, with the full force of a weaponized Department of Justice bearing down on her, she  remains remarkably composed.


	“I really look forward to court,” she tells me with a shrug. “To lay out all of the facts, to go through everything that happened and to make sure that the truth is told.” 


	“We know why we were there,” she adds. “To do our jobs.”


	The first thing you need to know about LaMonica McIver is that, despite her disarming demeanor, she is not afraid of a fight. Growing up in the heart of Newark's Central Ward, she got into plenty of them. 


	“I was always getting suspended for fighting,” she says. “My mom, at some point, was like, ‘I'm gonna stop taking you back to school because all you gonna do is get suspended again. I don't need to keep running back here.'”


	It was her fifth grade teacher — future Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — who helped her find an outlet for her energy, inviting her down to his campaign headquarters to volunteer. Baraka was the cool teacher — the one who showed up in Timberland boots, whose voice you can hear on the interstitial tracks on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the one who challenged Newark's longtime mayor, Sharpe James, running on the slogan “Shorty for Mayor,” when he was just 24 years old.


	“She was always feisty, no nonsense,” Baraka says of his former student. “As we like to say: She didn't take no tea for the fever. But, at the end of the day, she grew up in a rough community, rough neighborhood, and always had to defend herself — or defend other people.”


	In those days, Baraka's campaign headquarters were in a repurposed strip mall doctor's office, flanked by a Chinese restaurant, a fish market, and a nail salon. “I'll never forget — the place was so raggedy that it still had the hospital bed in one of the rooms. I remember we used to go back there and take a nap,” McIver says, laughing. Her first day was volunteering at the African American Day parade, where Lauryn Hill was riding with the candidate on the truck, and all the kids from McIver's school were marching around it in T-shirts that said “Take It Personal” — the campaign slogan that year. McIver was hooked.

	











	She started canvassing the neighborhood for the campaign, handing out literature in her spare time. At first she says that she just liked telling people what to do — ”Go out and vote!” — but eventually she was possessed by a larger sense of civic purpose. “Learning your community, learning what it means to be ‘of service,' learning what it means to care about people — to learn that at 10? To have someone instill that in you? And it wasn't just Ras Baraka,” she says. “It was all the people around him, who were from the city, involved in public service.”


	Baraka ended up losing that race in 1998. But the loss didn't deter McIver — neither did the many, many losses that followed. Through middle school and high school, she returned every four years when he launched a new bid for office, and helped out with the clothing drives, food drives, voter registration drives they mounted in the political off-season. 


	By the time Baraka won a seat on the city council, in 2010, McIver was out of college. She had spent the last years of her college career raising her three younger siblings — her brother, in high school, and two sisters, both in elementary school — after her mother entered rehab for drug addiction. 


	During the 19 months her mom spent in treatment, McIver commuted between college and home, packing her siblings lunches and helping them with their homework between her own classes. “It wasn't as hard an adjustment as you might think,” McIver's sister, LaShay McIver, tells me. “She was playing a parent figure in our lives for a very long time — probably since her early teens… Making sure our grades are good, making sure we're behaving in school. When she would get her paycheck, she would buy me clothes.”


	After she graduated, McIver worked in school districts all around the state of New Jersey, before she felt the call to run for office herself in 2018. The Newark city council skewed older and male, and she decided there ought to be someone there advocating for the interests of young parents like herself — by this time, she had her own two-year-old daughter — so she decided to mount a campaign.


	She ran against nine men, and won, becoming the youngest woman in city history to sit on the council. Two years later, in 2020, she was elected council president — right as the pandemic was poised to bear down on Newark. “I'll never forget,” she says. “We were going inside our larger senior buildings, having to get assistance to pull dead bodies out, because the hospitals were taxed, the funeral homes couldn't take another person. We had to get our police department to rent ice trucks inside of our city parking lot, just to get bodies out of the buildings.” 

	











	Those horrific months were followed by protests ignited in the wake of George Floyd's murder, when, McIver says, “We had people showing up from all over the world trying to burn down downtown.”


	Things had barely returned to normal in Newark, when she set her sights on a higher office. It was 2024, and Congressman Donald Payne Jr. — who, with his father before him, had represented this district most of McIver's life —  suddenly died of a heart attack. 


	McIver made it through the special election gauntlet, arriving in Congress in September of 2024, to little fanfare and no orientation — just a massive backlog of constituent services cases to deal with. By then, her district had been without a congressional representative for five months. She was only in D.C. for a week before the session adjourned, and she had to head back to New Jersey to campaign in the general election — her fourth race in as many months.


	She won, but returned to Congress in November with a new reality waiting for her, as a soon-to-be member of the minority party, under a dangerously emboldened Trump administration. “It's been unreal,” she says, looking back. “I did not come here for this.”


	“All my life, I've been wanting to serve in public service, to work for people, to deliver,” McIver tells me over lunch at The Yard, a burger joint in downtown Newark's Military Park. Everyone seems to know her here. When we walked in, she was met with applause and pledges to support her legal fund. Her profile, already outsized after representing this area first in City Council and now in Congress, has only continued to grow since she became a target of the Trump administration. “I just feel like, in this moment, there is nothing to deliver. We have a party in control that is not interested in delivering help — at least not for people that I represent.”


	Roughly one-third of McIver's constituents are immigrants, and from the moment Trump took office, the community has been in the crosshairs of the federal government. Two days after Trump's inauguration, ICE raided The Net, a Portuguese neighborhood in downtown Newark. 


	“They were out on the street in this little quaint neighborhood with big guns, Army vests, everything — and they scared the crap out of these residents,” McIver says. “From that day on, it's been downhill, in most of my communities in the 10th [congressional district].”

	











	Weeks before she and her colleagues went to Delaney Hall to perform the infamous oversight visit, McIver and her colleague, Rep. Rob Menendez, met with ICE officials at their office in Newark to discuss the fallout from those raids and, at the very least, try to open a line of communication.


	“We were like, ‘Look, the people of the East [ward] are scared to death. Businesses are not booming. This is an area where there are usually droves of people walking, shopping, eating in restaurants. Since ICE came down, though, people are scared — not even because they are here undocumented, just because they're like I don't want to be approached,” she says. “We went to these folks' office to meet with them, saying, ‘Hey, can we try to establish a better relationship? …Let's just work together. We want a safe border too — a protected one. We just don't want you harassing communities. So, what can we do?'”


	The meeting went smoothly, which is why she was caught so off guard by the disturbingly disproportionate response she and her colleagues were met with a few weeks later at Delaney Hall. 


	“They say this whole thing is about ‘criminals,' but it's not about criminals — it's about being cruel and attacking anybody who is here that is, basically, not white, to be honest with you,” McIver says. “I just think people didn't sign up for this, they're like, ‘Hey, when you get criminals, get the criminals. But not my neighbor. Not the people that cook our food, not the person trying to get their green card or going through citizenship, who is 60 years old, or people who were given protections to be here and now you tell them, Screw you, you're gone.'… It's just heartbreaking. To see families being ripped apart, to see kids with cancer being deported, to see people in college who are here — being innovators, engineers and teachers — to see [people say to] them, ‘Oh, your student visa is gone.' No explanation, no due process.”


	It's just all so senselessly punitive, McIver tells me. And a similar sentiment might be expressed about her own legal predicament — the breathtakingly political prosecution of a sitting member of Congress, one with virtually no precedent in recent history. How that case will ultimately resolve remains an open question.


	In June, McIver pleaded not guilty to all three charges against her, and, just last week, her lawyers submitted a new motion to dismiss the charges, drawing comparisons between the conduct she is alleged to have committed against federal officers while exercising her statutory and constitutional oversight responsibilities, and the conduct demonstrated by some 160 rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 — “throwing explosives, beating federal officers with baseball bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray” — all of whom recently had their charges under the same statute dismissed by the Justice Department.

	McIver, for her part, is spending as little time as possible thinking about the case. She's too busy with work. “I'm angry that the administration is choosing to waste taxpayers dollars and energy, to charge me for going there — for doing my job,” she says. “But at the same time, I'm not mad about representing the people that I represent here in New Jersey, or for going to check on their family members at Delaney Hall because that's what they sent me to Congress to do.


	“I can't be scared about doing that.”

Fall festivals supply the nutrients for a rich diet of films for the next six months, all the way until Oscar night. Venice launched Wednesday with Francis Coppola paying tribute to his friend Werner Herzog. On Thursday, Telluride revealed its lineup, which plays over the Labor Day weekend. (And, yes, the German maverick will fly to Telluride, as always.)

He's among the Telluride regulars who return for the summer-camp vibe in the mountains of Colorado. Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy usually throw a party. So does Muppet scion Lisa Henson. Oprah Winfrey is coming this year, even without a film, as are filmmakers Rian Johnson and Jason Reitman. (Herzog does have a film: documentary “Ghost Elephants,” shot in Namibia and Angola.)

“Our community is a real community,” said festival director Julie Huntsinger in a phone interview with IndieWire. “And I want everybody to hang out together and have fun and watch.”

This year, Huntsinger wants to avoid the scheduling snafus that led so many loyal badge holders ($780 each) standing in line for hours without seeing the big films. Distributors like to see how movies play for Telluride's cross-section of the national arthouse audience, passing word of mouth from line to line.

 










One clue that something special was happening last year with Sean Baker's Palme D'Or-winner “Anora” was the huge number of turnaways when the film was booked in small venues (patron passes, which cost $4,900, get in first). “Anora” eventually won five Oscars, including Best Picture. “Nobody saw that coming, I promise you, to the extent that it was popular,” said Huntsinger. “It's a crapshoot, what people will go crazy for.”

Huntsinger and her programmers cherry-pick titles from Sundance, Berlin, and especially Cannes. And well before Telluride co-founder Tom Luddy's death in 2023, Huntsinger has been flying solo and booking a strong lineup of highbrow awards contenders, classics, and idiosyncratic discoveries.

“We have exactly what we wanted,” she said. “Everything that plays in Cannes is fair game. We'll contact people and say, ‘Oh, we'd very much like to show it.' And I don't think we've ever been turned down.”

When it comes to new titles, though, the competition is fierce, even if Huntsinger pretends that Telluride doesn't truck in “world premieres,” and landing the celebrities who go with them. That requires distributors like Netflix to pony up for a private jet to fly George Clooney, Laura Dern, and Adam Sandler from Venice to Telluride for Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” a profile of an aging actor looking at himself in the mirror.

 










Also making the trek from Venice are Yorgos Lanthimos and his regulars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons, returning to the festival for Focus Features' “Bugonia.” “It's [Lanthimos'] usual, ‘Oh, my God. What was he thinking?,'” said Huntsinger. “This time, he has kicked the living shit out of Emma Stone. What more will he ask her to do? But it's a fantastic ride. Jesse Plemons will be the talk of everything.”

On the other hand, Kathryn Bigelow's Netflix film “A House of Dynamite” will not travel from Venice to Telluride. And so far, Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” starring Oscar Isaac as the scientist and Jacob Elordi as the monster, has not been announced. But there's always a “secret screening” or two as the festival runs its course.

Some titles on Telluride's top-secret lineup circulate in advance — inevitable as other festivals reveal their premieres and publicists organize their schedules. Prominent showings include Netflix's “Ballad of a Small Player” (Edward Berger's return after “Conclave”) starring Colin Farrell as a sad-sack gambler, and Chloé Zhao's adaptation of the bestselling tearjerker “Hamnet” (Focus), starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley as William and Agnes Shakespeare.

“Ballad of a Small Player” proves Berger's virtuosity, said Huntsinger. “It is true that Edward can direct anything, his versatility is so underrated. This is unusual and dreamy and almost like a bit of a Wong Kar-Wai feel. But he never feels derivative or copycat.”

 










“Hamnet” represents something of a homecoming: It was born out of a walk in the woods at Telluride 2022 with Zhao and Mescal when he was there for “Aftersun.” 

“The film is a meditation on loss from a feminine perspective,” said Huntsinger. “It shifts the story around Shakespeare to focus on his wife, but it doesn't diminish anybody in the process. Chloé's working with Paul and Jesse. They're like a beautiful instrument, all three of them working together.”

Other first-time showings include “Crazy Heart” director Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” (20th Century Studios). “It delivers,” said Huntsinger. “It's one of those movies that, on paper, sounds good, although musical performances can be iffy. But [Timothee] Chalamet knocked it out of the park with ‘A Complete Unknown.' Jeremy Allen White does the same, it's all his voice. It's not a singing-performance heavy film with the giant concert scenes. This is [Scott Cooper's] best movie.”

Huntsinger usually offers a few unexpected gems, like last year's “Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight” (Sony Pictures Classics), which launched major new auteur Embeth Davidtz. This year's surprises include “Tuner,” the feature-directing debut of “Navalny” Oscar-winner Daniel Roher, starring Dustin Hoffman. (Its sound designer is “The Zone of Interest” Oscar-winner Johnnie Burn.) Huntsinger also made room for a last-minute submission from Ondi Timoner with her short film about losing a home to the Altadena fires, “All the Walls Came Down.”

 










Telluride launches Oscar conversations and reminds everyone of Cannes gems in the awards hunt. These include three prize-winners from Neon: “It Was Just an Accident” (director Jafar Panahi will accept a special tribute), “The Secret Agent,” starring Best Actor Cannes winner Wagner Moura, and Norwegian Oscar entry “Sentimental Value,” starring Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Rensve.

Skarsgård's son Alexander stars in risque entry, “Pillion” (A24), which debuted in Un Certain Regard. MUBI brings two films starring Josh O'Connor with Oliver Hermanus' “The History of Sound” and Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind.” Also showing is Harris Dickinson's directorial debut “Urchin” (1-2 Special), starring Un Certain Regard actor-winner Frank Dillane. Some missing titles, like Neon's “Sirat,” will turn up on the schedules at Toronto and NYFF.

Not screening at Telluride, or any of the fall festivals, is MUBI's $24-million Cannes pickup “Die, My Love” from Lynne Ramsay, which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. It earned mixed reviews at Cannes and might continue to do so. MUBI plans a wide release on November 7.

Also not in the festival lineups is Paul Thomas Anderson's Leonardo DiCaprio-starring “One Battle After Another” (Warner Bros., September 26). Anderson doesn't like attending festivals.

 










Dickinson and Mescal will attend Telluride even though they're shooting one of Sam Mendes' Beatles movies (Dickinson is Paul McCartney; Mescal is John Lennon). The actual McCartney is on tour, so he will not be there to support Morgan Neville's Wings documentary “Man on the Run” (Amazon/MGM). Related: McCartney's former roommate, swinging '60s music producer Peter Asher, is the subject of Telluride documentary “Everywhere Man: The Life and Times of Peter Asher.” (McCartney once dated Peter's sister, Jane.)

Sundance hit “If I Had Legs I Could Kick You” could reignite Oscar talk around Rose Byrne's incendiary performance as a frayed mother with a special-needs child. And Berlin breakout “Blue Moon” (Sony Pictures Classics) marks not only two festival entries from Richard Linklater, who also directed Cannes' “Nouvelle Vague” (Netflix), but the Austin director's first visit to Telluride.

“Blue Moon” stars Telluride tributee Ethan Hawke as alcoholic songwriter Lorenz Hart, sadly watching his former partner Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) celebrate the opening night of “Oklahoma!” at Sardi's. (Scott took home the Berlin Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.) Hawke will also be at Telluride to support his Merle Haggard documentary, “Highway 99: A Double Album.”

 










Telluride continue to support documentaries, which are often neglected at festivals like Cannes. (Ironically, Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux directed a documentary, “Lumière, le Cinéma,” which is among the 15 in the main SHOW.) “Sometimes they're better than the scripted films that are out nowadays,” said Huntsinger.

Telluride docs include “Summer Tour” (Grateful Dead & Co.); “Ask E. Jean,” Ivy Meeropol's portrait of E. Jean Carroll, who is now 82; Laura Poitras' “Cover-Up,” a profile of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh; Nick Hooker's “Karl,” about Karl Lagerfeld, and “Lost in the Jungle” from Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, a search-and-rescue mission about Colombian children who survived a plane crash. “It is a thriller,” said Huntsinger. “Even though you know the ending.”

There's a plethora of films from the U.K., from Plan B's adaptation of bestselling memoir “H is for Hawk” starring Claire Foy and an Eurasian goshawk (it's already screening for distributors), to Riz Ahmed's South Asian take on “Hamlet.” “That country, that culture, they support filmmaking,” said Huntsinger. “Every aspect of it.” She's grateful, as the American supply of films feels diminished, “with our cupboard being a little bare right now.”

After Venice and Telluride come the larger amplifier festivals Toronto and New York and a series of regional festivals from the Hamptons and Middleburg to SCAD. Oscar campaigners will relentlessly bang the drums through March. But Telluride gets the beat started.

It's been two years since Tia Mowry's divorce from Cory Hardrict was made official. The actress, who starred in Hallmark's “A Gingerbread Christmas” in 2018, has acknowledged that she and Hardrict maintain a positive relationship. In an interview with Parents.com, she revealed what she views as the most crucial thing former couples need to remember.

“The main important thing is making sure that the children still see the parents together and communicating, and still see them [being] cordial,” she said. “That's what keeps children beautifully adjusted. It keeps their nervous system calm and at ease when they see their parents are still together, we all come together as a family.”

Her actions have proven that these aren't mere words. Earlier this year, she posted Instagram photos showing the exes celebrating their kids' birthdays together. But beyond co-parenting, she's also making sure to foster independence — no matter how challenging it may be.

“I don't think it is your job to make your kids happy,” Mowry told Parents.com. “I think that it is your job to keep your kids safe, nurture them, guide them, but they have to learn on their own how to make themselves happy, because we don't want to create co-dependency.”

A recent event showed that her methods are working. When 7-year-old Cairo went to the school nurse after being hit with a ball, the nurse asked if she should call Mowry. Cairo replied, “No.”

“I desperately wanted to speak to her and hear her voice to make sure that she was OK,” Mowry said. “But I had to allow this opportunity for her to gain independence and say, ‘I got this.'”

Mowry's thoughts on letting her kids have their own voice align with her beliefs about raising self-sufficient children. If her kids are uncomfortable with something, she doesn't expect them to do it. She admitted her upbringing was much different. 

“I think growing up, it was definitely a cultural thing where it's like, ‘My house, my rules,'” she clarified. “I didn't want to do that with my children. I wanted my children to never be afraid to express themselves.”

She may want her kids to learn independence, but she also cherishes every moment she has with them, especially with her 14-year-old, Cree.

“Sometimes I enjoy saying, ‘Did you put on your deodorant today? Did you brush your teeth?'” Mowry said, getting emotional. “Because I know I hate to sound so cliché, but I am counting down the days I have.”

The state saw a nearly 400 percent jump in applications to get filming subsidies. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Apple TV+'s The Studio and a new HBO series from Larry David headline the first round of subsidies to Hollywood after California's historic expansion of the state's entertainment tax credit program, designed to woo productions back to their cultural home.


	In total, 22 TV productions will get $256 million in incentives for shooting in California, the film commission announced on Wednesday. They're projected to generate $1.1 billion in economic activity across multiple industries with ties to the entertainment industry and employ 6,500 cast and crew members, as well as 46,100 background performers. Most of the filming is expected to take place in Los Angeles, where workers have been experiencing a shortage of jobs since the dual writers and actors strikes.

	This allotment of subsidies saw a nearly 400 percent increase in applications, according to the film commission. The main changes to the program reflect its increased popularity: the increase of the total cap from $330 million to $750 million; the 35 percent base credit; the expansion of the category of productions that qualify to include shorter TV shows, sitcoms, animated titles and large-scale competition shows.


	“California has long been the entertainment capital of the world — and the newly expanded film and TV tax credit program is keeping it that way,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. “This program means paychecks for middle-class workers, opportunities for small businesses and investment in communities up and down the state. We're not just protecting our legacy — we're reminding the world why the Golden State remains the beating heart of film and television.”  

	











	Other shows that will receive tax credits include a new 20th Television drama from This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman, Warner Bros. Television's Presumed Innocent, Sony Pictures Television's SWAT Exiles, CBS Studios's NCIS Origins and Group Chat, and a 20th Television pilot from Kenya Barris.


	“As an L.A. native, I feel lucky to have been able to shoot so many projects here throughout my career and love that we'll be able to continue spotlighting our incredible city, its people and the culture,” Barris said in a statement. “Not only does this credit allow us to work with the best crews and craftspeople around but, more importantly, it allows us to create jobs and support the LA film community at a time when it's more important than ever.”


	A main tenet of the changes to California's program involved swaying TV shows, long an anchor of production in the region, to shoot in the state. There's a separate incentive for productions that relocate from another state to California, which Tom Segura's Netflix series Bad Thoughts is taking advantage of as it moves away from Texas.


	California has steadily been losing production as other regions beef up their incentive programs in a race to host Hollywood. One example: In June, Texas passed a law that increased by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years.

The hit leads Billboard's 100-position Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century retrospective. Below, find a breakdown of the 2000-24 top 10.


													By
												

	Trevor Anderson



The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” outshines all competitors on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart. The smash lands at No. 1 on the survey, which is based on performance on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from the start of 2000 through the end of 2024.


	“Blinding Lights” claims the shiny prize largely for its unprecedented longevity in the top 10: 59 weeks, the most of any song not only in the quarter century but in the entire history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, dating to its 1958 consolidation into a single, genre-encompassing listing. Of its run in the top 10, “Blinding Lights” snagged 11 frames at No. 1 — the most among The Weeknd's nine career champs.


	In November 2021, “Blinding Lights” crowned Billboard's Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs chart, dating to the weekly list's August 1958 start. “I don't think [it] has hit me yet,” The Weeknd told Billboard upon learning of the song's all-time, all-genre command. “I just count my blessings, and I'm just grateful.”


	Reflecting the biggest names in R&B and hip-hop from Y2K to today, check out the top 10 songs on Billboard's Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century chart below and the entire 100-position ranking in Billboard's Greatest of All Time charts menu.


	Following the reveal of Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the 21st Century chart and the unveiling of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums of the 21st Century chart, check back Friday (Aug. 29) for Billboard's rundown of The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart, with all coverage of Billboard's 21st Century Charts here.


	Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs of the 21st Century recaps reflect performance on weekly charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024. The Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists category ranks the best-performing acts in that span based on activity on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. (Titles released prior to mid-1999 are excluded, although such entries that appeared on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums or Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in that span contribute to the calculation of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Artists chart.) The Top Producers of the 21st Century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart reflects producers with the most No. 1s on weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts dated Jan. 1, 2000, through Dec. 28, 2024, with ties broken by most top 10s and most overall chart entries.


	The star team-up dominated the summer of 2013 and beyond, racking up 16 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs that June through October. For all three hitmakers, who have enjoyed multiple No. 1s on the chart, “Blurred Lines” remains their longest-leading ruler.


	After a nearly eight-year break between albums, Maxwell returned in 2009 with BLACKsummers'night and his biggest hit single. “This song, it's about wanting to be with somebody but meeting them too early,” the singer-songwriter shared at a 2008 concert in which he performed the song pre-release. With its flight to No. 1, “Wings” and its 14-week Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs reign returned Maxwell to the summit for the first time in a decade, since “Fortunate” in 1999.


	Despite a No. 2 peak on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, SZA's “Snooze” passed many of its contemporaries in the long run thanks to strong consistency, as the 2022 release resonated after the height of its promo campaign as a single. Radio strength was an essential asset, as it claimed a record 37-week command atop the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.


	Post Malone and Swae Lee swung to No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and stuck to the top rank for 11 weeks with their Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack smash, which began its run in early 2019. Both knew the feeling of an extensive stay well: Post Malone previously … posted 14 weeks in charge via “Rockstar” in 2017-18, while Swae Lee and his brother Slim Jxmmi, as duo Rae Sremmurd, ruled for seven weeks with “Black Beatles” in 2016-17.


	Bruno Mars had much to like in 2017, as singles from his ‘90s R&B-inspired album, 24K Magic, reaped massive rewards. “That's What I Like,” the album's second single (after its title track), celebrated 10 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 2019, it was revealed as the second-biggest hit on the chart for the entire 2010s decade.


	“Thrift Shop” notched 14 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2013, pushing its main creators, duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, to a banner breakout year. Follow-up single “Can't Hold Us” captured seven weeks at No. 1 later that year, and “Thrift Shop” wrapped 2013 as the year-end No. 1 track on the annual Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs recap.


	“Sure Thing” was already a hit upon its release, hitting No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for a week in 2011. An unexpected revival from TikTok in 2023, however, pushed it into the history books. Thanks to that second wind, the single added 30 weeks to its chart run and became the track with the most weeks, 89, in the 67-year history of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.


	Blige's devotional ode ranks as the top song by a woman for the quarter century on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The crown chart jewel of the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul's collection conquered the tally for 15 weeks in 2006, longer than Blige's five other leaders combined. In its run, the track surpassed two other of the genre's juggernaut tracks (Deborah Cox's “Nobody's Supposed To Be Here” and Mariah Carey's “We Belong Together”) as the longest-leading hit by a woman, a mark that Blige owned for the next 17 years.


	Erasing any notion of being a one-year wonder, Lil Nas X found more hits in 2021, including his smash collaboration with Jack Harlow. The rising talents' joint effort was a runaway success, posting 19 weeks at No. 1 on the weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. At the time, Lil Nas X owned the two longest leaders, with 2019's “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus) in first place, with 20 frames.


	Ascending from the underground alt-R&B scenes of Toronto to international stardom, The Weeknd reached unprecedented stature with the glistening “Blinding Lights.” The single spent 11 weeks in charge of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart — chief of Abel Tesfaye's nine champs — and a record 59 weeks in the top 10. The blockbuster claims history on other Billboard recaps, ruling the Top Hot 100 Songs of the 21st Century chart, announced in January, following its coronation on the Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs retrospective.

Sting is being sued by his former Police bandmates Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland over alleged missing royalties for their signature song “Every Breath You Take,” according to reports published by the Los Angeles Times and other titles.

	Summers and Copeland filed their lawsuit in London High Court, in which they claim they were never properly credited as songwriters on “Every Breath You Take,” their biggest hit in the U.S. The pair also claim they never received royalties for their contributions to it.

	Sting (real name: Gordon Matthew Sumner) and his publishing company, Magnetic Publishing, are listed as defendants in the suit.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Released in 1983, “Every Breath You Take” logged eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, longer than any other single that year. It was the band's first and only leader on the chart, and won a brace of Grammy Awards, for song of the year and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals.


	The evergreen number grew wings when Summers' arpeggio was sampled on Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' Notorious B.I.G. tribute from 1997, “I'll Be Missing You.” In 2023, Puff Daddy went on the record as saying he pays Sting $5,000 every day for the use of that sample, a comment he later walked back.

	











	In 2022, Sting sold his entire song catalog from his early days in The Police through his solo career to the Universal Music Publishing Group, a business decision that reunites his music publishing rights with his master recordings.


	While terms of that deal were not disclosed, Billboard previously reported that Sting had been shopping a music asset bundle that produced an annual royalty income stream of about $12-$13 million and was looking at a roughly $360 million payday.


	With their bleach-blonde hair, tight performances, and collection of radio friendly hits, including “Roxanne,” “Message in a Bottle”, “Walking on The Moon”, “Don't Stand So Close to Me”, “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” “King of Pain” and more, The Police were arguably the biggest band in the world, certainly for an album cycle or two.


	In the UK, the band landed five consecutive No. 1s on the Official UK Albums Chart. In the U.S., Synchronicity logged 17 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The bandmates went their separate ways after completing the 1984 world tour in support of Synchronicity, before reuniting briefly in 1986 for a re-recording in “Don't Stand So Close To Me,” which appeared on a greatest hits collection.


	The former bandmates settled their differences to mount a 2007–08 world tour, marking the 30th anniversary of their formation. Sting is booked to perform at QPAC's Glasshouse Theatre in Brisbane next year, where he will present his musical The Last Ship.

The first teaser trailer for The Carpenter's Son—a biblical horror movie starring FKA twigs as Mary, mother of Jesus—is here. Nicolas Cage plays Joseph in the movie, and you can see them both in the clip below. Lofty Nathan wrote and directed the film, which stars Noah Jupe as Jesus. It is set for release this autumn, but no date has been set.

A movie synopsis shared upon the film's announcement last year said The Carpenter's Son “tells the dark story of a family hiding out in Roman Egypt. The son, known only as ‘the Boy,' is driven to doubt by another mysterious child and rebels against his guardian, the Carpenter, revealing inherent powers and a fate beyond his comprehension. As he exercises his own power, the Boy and his family become the target of horrors, natural and divine.”

FKA twigs recently starred opposite Bill Skarsgård in Rupert Sanders' remake of the 1994 cult classic The Crow. She also has a new album, Eusexua Afterglow, on the way—a standalone, full-length follow-up to Eusexua, according to her publicists.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent engagement has spawned reactions from fans and friends all over the world.

On Aug. 26, the superstar couple announced their engagement via a gorgeous, flower-filled Instagram post captioned with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”

Now, fans want to know all of the details, including when and where the lovebirds will tie the knot. While no details about the upcoming wedding have been shared publicly, it's no surprise that the suggestions are rolling on—and that includes a cheeky idea to host the wedding at a beloved college football stadium in Swift's home state of Pennsylvania.

A post shared by Penn State University (@pennstate)

Hours after Swift and Kelce revealed they were engaged, a post on Penn State University's Instagram page featured a photo from the proposal.

The university's Nittany Lion mascot was then added in, with a bubble that read, “Congrats on your engagement! We have the perfect wedding venue to seat 107k of your closest friends.”

A second slide showed photos from the couple's flower-filled engagement day, as well as shots of Swift performing in State College, PA.  Another photo featured reception tables, seemingly from past events at the school.

‘Don't shake this off because this is our type of love story 🫶,” came the caption. “Wedding in @jordancenter and reception in @beaver_stadium!”

For more than 60 years, Beaver Stadium has been home to the Nittany Lions at Penn State's University Park campus. The stadium has an official seating capacity of 106,572, which makes it the second-largest stadium in the country, per gopsusports.com.

The Bryce Jordan Center is a 15,261-seat arena on Penn State's main University Park campus.

A post shared by Penn State Football (@pennstatefball)

While the Travis and Taylor Penn State wedding idea is pretty far-fetched, weddings have been held at the iconic Beaver Stadium in the past.

The Knot previously posted photos from the nuptials for two PSU alumni in 2015 after their wedding was held at their alma mater's Beaver Stadium.

The groom even proposed to his fiancée right outside the stadium during homecoming weekend, and the entire wedding featured Penn State's navy and white color scheme.

According to Philadelphia magazine, the stadium has four event rooms in varying sizes —The Letterman's Lounge, the Recruit's Lounge,  the President's Suite & Lounge, and the supersized  Mt. Nittany Club space.

The doc, which follows Ye circa 2018 to 2024, will be released in about 1,000 U.S. theaters on Sept. 19.

	The Ye documentary In Whose Name? has released an explosive trailer, featuring appearances from Drake, Kim Kardashian and Elon Musk.


	Directed by Nico Ballesteros, the doc follows Ye (formerly Kanye West) from about 2018 until 2024 and is completely shot on an iPhone. The trailer jumps around from West's deteriorating relationship with then-wife Kim Kardashian — who filed for divorce in 2021 — to his failed 2020 presidential run and Sunday Service performances.


	“The best thing about being an artist who's bipolar is anything you do and say is an art piece,” Ye says in the clip.

	The doc pulls the curtain back on Ye to give fans an authentic look at the method to his madness in recent years and what makes him one of the most polarizing artists of the 21st century.




			Trending on Billboard		







	There are plenty of celebrity cameos, including studio sessions with Drake, Pharrell and Swizz Beatz. West is also shown walking out with Playboi Carti and Marilyn Manson at the Donda 2 listening party in Miami and delves into his relationship with his children. 

A post shared by Nico Ballesteros (@nico.ballesteros)


	“Should I have blown up the Gap sh–? Should I have blown up the Adidas sh–? But the answer is yes,” he says, referencing his split with the companies following his antisemitic remarks in 2022. 


In Whose Name? will be released in about 1,000 theaters across the U.S. on Sept. 19 for a limited time. Tickets can be purchased on the doc's website. “A documentary six years in the making,” a press release for the film reads. “3,000 hours of footage refined to one story about the world's most polarizing living artist.”

Taylor Swift‘s BFF has entered the chat. 

Two best friends, two soulmates, and two love stories unfolding in the same year, it almost feels like a movie. Selena Gomez is celebrating Taylor Swift's fairytale engagement in the sweetest way. 

After Travis Kelce, 35, proposed to Swift, 35, in a romantic garden setting, Gomez couldn't resist sharing her excitement with fans.

“When bestie gets engaged,” Gomez wrote on her Instagram Story August 27, alongside photos from the couple's enchanting proposal. The short but heartfelt message quickly went viral among fans. Here are the sweetest reactions: 

Oh after y'all set selena up to look like she never posted Taylor solo now yall wanna ost what she posted first. Selena fans have the right to be nasty to all of yall. https://t.co/tRZJIBJYrR

The post also tied back to a nostalgic chapter in their friendship. 

Gomez reshared a fan post that featured Swift's 2009 tweet, in which she wrote: “Real love still happens sometimes. It's not just something we make up when we're nine. I have to believe that. You do too.” The fan added side-by-side images of both stars' proposals, captioned, “16 years later,” a moment Gomez proudly highlighted.

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

Swift announced her engagement to Kelce on August 26 with an Instagram carousel showing the Kansas City Chiefs star down on one knee surrounded by flowers. The Grammy winner captioned the post, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” while showing off her sparkling diamond ring.

The proposal was witnessed by both families, who were overjoyed to see the couple take this next step.

The engagement follows a milestone of Gomez's own. Last December, Swift left a playful comment under Gomez's Instagram post announcing her engagement to producer Benny Blanco, teasing, “Yes, I will be the flower girl.”

Now, with both women celebrating love at the same time, their enduring friendship continues to be a source of joy for fans.

Donna Kelce marked her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a touching online gesture. The day after the couple shared their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner to a collage of their childhood photos. The sweet side-by-side images showed Swift posing against a prop tree in a school portrait, while a young Travis smiled in a flannel shirt against a classic blue backdrop.

The producers behind popcorn thriller 'G20' were sued on Wednesday for copyright infringement. There's been an uptick in accusations of infringement in recent years, though that hasn't led to much success for those filing the lawsuits. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	It's a tale as old as Hollywood: A writer drafts a screenplay and submits it to various competitions. They get some buzz, maybe even placing in a few, though their script ultimately doesn't land anywhere. Then, they see a movie that feels similar to what they wrote. And after looking at the film's IMDB page, they realize that they're a couple levels removed from one of the title's producers or writers, who they suspect may have read their screenplay once upon a time and ripped it off. They file a lawsuit.


	Most copyright infringement lawsuits don't go anywhere, but a writer suing over popcorn thriller G20 is looking to flip the narrative. In a complaint filed on Wednesday in California federal court, Clarice Eboni Boykin-Patterson alleges the producers behind the Viola Davis action flick copied her screenplay.

	With G20, Davis joined the pantheon of action heroes tasked with saving the world from calamity. She's the president of the United States with an extensive military background and weapons training but wait, she must also balance her very serious work life with a family. When viewers meet Davis' character, she's bickering with her 17-year-old daughter after the teen snuck out to a party at a Georgetown bar. 


	Boykin-Patterson, an entertainment reporter for The Daily Beast, challenges both works featuring “intense violence” with “warm, relatable familial drama,” among other things.


	Like G20, Boykin-Patterson's screenplay follows a Black woman in politics that must save an auditorium of people, including her family, from terrorists, led by a man with a personal vendetta, who've taken over the international conference (warning: spoilers ahead). She ultimately evades capture but her husband — whose main role is to support the political ambitions of his wife in both works — is kidnapped and used as a bargaining chip. In the movie and screenplay, titled “Election Night,” the protagonist's friend appears to die but are eventually shown to have survived.

	











	The lawsuit adds both works “feature the same themes; who gets to legislate and be in power in the future, does an inclusionary style of leadership edge out those who traditionally held power, and who inherits power and gets to wield it.” It also says they share the same genre: Tense thrillers that feature a race against the block with an “underlying tension and dread that result from the precariousness of the central characters, i.e. their gender and race and their overcompensation for these traits.”


	While these broad similarities alone may not be covered by copyright law, the lawsuit alleges that, when aggregated together, they can constitute infringement. There's some truth to the argument: Courts have found that a writer stringing together several elements that aren't typically protected by copyright — like a ragtag group of misfits banding together to pull off a high-stakes con — can serve as the foundation to an idea theft claim. Still, there's an uphill battle to climb. 


	In April, Showtime Networks and Lionsgate's Entertainment One defeated a copyright lawsuit over Yellowjackets. The court found in that case that several of the alleged similarities are common tropes found in survival thrillers, pointing to the death of a head coach and survival of his two children, attempts by survivors to escape isolation and the division of groups into rival factions. If two works share basic plot points, it's natural for them to have identical tones, the court reasoned.

	











	“There can be no serious dispute that escape attempts by shipwrecked or stranded survivors are prevalent throughout fiction and history, from Odysseus, Robinson Crusoe, and Gilligan to Shackleton and the Uruguayan rugby team,” the judge wrote in an order dismissing the lawsuit.


	A major factor in the case will be whether the producers and writers behind the movie have read Boykin-Patterson's screenplay. In 2021, “Election Night” was submitted to the ScreenCraft Screenwriting Fellowship contest, where it was a quarterfinalist, and the Launch Pad Feature Competition, where it got to the second round, while being shopped around to various production companies.


	The lawsuit stresses that Logan Miller and Noah Miller, the writers of G20, are managed by Daniel Sherman, an executive producer on the movie who's been a judge in the Launch Pad competition, the same event Boykin-Patterson submitted her screenplay.


	The decision comes amid a shift in the vetting of copyright lawsuits that's increasingly encouraged creators to sue. In recent years, federal appeals courts have been cautioning lower courts against early dismissal and from imposing their views on whether two works overlap enough to warrant allowing lawsuits to proceed. One of those rulings — at least the third since 2020 overturning a defense-friendly decision in a copyright case — reversed a federal judge's decision to toss Francesca Gregorini's lawsuit against M. Night Shyamalan and Apple over Servant on the premise that dismissal was premature because “reasonable minds could differ” on whether her and the acclaimed horror director's works are substantially similar.

	











	That's contributed to an uptick in copyright lawsuits actually getting to trial. Earlier this year, juries considered claims of infringement against Disney over Moana and Shyamalan over Servant. Both ended in defense verdicts.


	The findings in those trials reaffirmed the high bar in convincing a jury that any alleged similarities between two works constitute copyright infringement. Copyright law doesn't protect general ideas — like incidents, characters and settings considered standard in the treatment of particular topics (think a priest in a movie about possession) — only the particular expression of those ideas. 


	The last case in which a plaintiff may have come out on top involves the Shape of Water. After a federal appeals court in 2020 revived the lawsuit from the estate of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel, which alleged that the makers of the Oscar-winning film ripped off Let Me Hear You Whisper, a settlement was reached.


	MRC, which distributed the movie, and JuVee Productions, Davis' production banner, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

For moms, few moments are bigger than seeing their children find happiness. Donna Kelce celebrated her son Travis Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift with a heartfelt online tribute. 

The day after the couple announced their news on August 26, Donna updated her Facebook banner photo to a collage of Travis and Taylor's childhood pictures. 

The side-by-side shots showed Swift leaning against a prop tree in a school portrait while a young Travis posed in a flannel shirt against a blue backdrop. 

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

Even before the big announcement, Donna had hinted at the happiness in her son's life. Speaking to People in an interview published August 25, she shared, “I think his mind is settled. That's about all I can tell you. I think he feels calm and he feels like he's on a mission and he knows exactly what he wants.”

At the time, her ex-husband Ed Kelce had already confirmed that Travis had proposed earlier in August. As he told ABC Cleveland, “Travis actually did the proposal maybe two weeks—not quite two weeks ago.”

Travis had initially hoped to wait until just before the NFL season kicked off on Sept. 5 to make his proposal, but both his family and Swift's dad, Scott Swift, encouraged him not to delay.

“Scott said, ‘Come on, when are you going to get this done?'” Ed recalled on The Jimmy and Nath Show on August 26. “He was going to make a big production out of it. Wanted to make it uber special. And I told him the same thing Scott told him—asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it.”

When the NFL star finally got down on one knee, both families were overcome with joy. “The family—both sides—kind of assumed this was going to happen because we'd never seen our kids so happy,” Ed added.

While the engagement marked a new chapter for the couple, Travis and Taylor had already been sharing glimpses of their romance online.

Taylor's first Instagram post featuring Travis was a selfie with Prince William, Princess Kate, and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, backstage at her Eras Tour show in London.

Travis shared his own Instagram debut with Taylor in July 2025, including a cozy dinner photo that revealed their matching lockscreen pictures of each other.

With ‘Dead Man's Wire' premiering out of competition in Venice, the elusive auteur looks back on a career defined by risk, reinvention and ignoring all the rules.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	There's no such thing as a typical Gus Van Sant film.


	With the possible exception of Steven Soderbergh, no American filmmaker working today has had a career marked by such radical shifts in style, budget and artistic ambition as the 73-year-old director from Louisville, Kentucky. From edgy indies to blockbuster crowd-pleasers, prestige Oscar bait to experimental movies, Van Sant has spent the past 40 years delighting, surprising and confounding his audience.




	His early films — the “Portland trilogy” of 1988's Mala Noche, 1989's Drugstore Cowboy and 1991's My Own Private Idaho — were gritty, realist dramas about outsiders: migrant workers, nomadic drug addicts and gay hustlers. The mid-'90s saw Van Sant pivot to more studio-friendly fare: the glossy camp of the 1995 dark satire To Die For, featuring Nicole Kidman in a career-making wig, and 1997's Good Will Hunting, a $225 million global hit that introduced the world to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

	But at the height of his studio success, in between his first Oscar nomination for Good Will Hunting and his second for 2008's political biopic Milk, Van Sant veered in an entirely different direction.


	His “death trilogy” — 2002's Gerry, 2003's Elephant and 2005's Last Days — was a sharp turn into art house experimentation. Loosely scripted and influenced by European auteurs Béla Tarr and Chantal Akerman, these films favored long, choreographed shots, languid pacing and a disregard for Hollywood conventions. Around the same time, in 1998, he made his notorious shot-for-shot color remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, a $60 million studio picture that now plays like a conceptual art installation.

	











	“I think it goes back to the beginning, when I started making short films with my friends,” Van Sant says of his frequent shifts in style. “We were experimenting, scratching on the film, drawing on the film, animating directly onto 8mm. But we were also going to the cinema in this small town in Connecticut every Friday, watching war movies, or cartoons, or whatever. We'd watch Bonanza on TV. The experiment became: Could I extend my experiments in film into dramatic storytelling, to make something that looked like the things I would see on TV?”


	Van Sant credits his high school English teacher David Stone with introducing him to experimental cinema, showing 14-year-old Gus Canadian Film Board shorts and Citizen Kane in class. “Things like Stan Brakhage, Stan Vanderbeek, the Kuchar brothers, Ron Rice — people like that.”


	Other early influences included a stint assisting Ken Shapiro, director of 1974's pre-SNL sketch spoof The Groove Tube. “Lorne Michaels was actually working for him as a writer when he pitched Saturday Night Live to NBC,” Van Sant recalls. The job gave him a taste for counterculture comedy and the nuts and bolts of indie production.


	At the same time, he was bingeing on films from an emerging queer cinema scene. Apart from John Waters — whose 1972 cult classic Pink Flamingos played every Friday at midnight at New York's Quad Cinema — “there weren't really other gay filmmakers that I knew,” he says. “In Hollywood, there was a queer scene, though it wasn't called that. At the gay film festival at the Vista Theater, [the American entries] were mostly old Tennessee Williams adaptations with gay themes, alongside Danish, Swedish, Dutch and Spanish titles. But no new American films. Americans weren't really making independent queer films.”

	











	So Van Sant made one. With $25,000 he'd earned in New York advertising, he financed Mala Noche, a 16mm black-and-white adaptation of the Walt Curtis novel about an almost-romance between a gay store clerk and two young Mexican immigrants.


	“Walt Curtis wasn't a typical city gay man,” says Van Sant. “He was more the kind of queer man who would get kicked out of a gay bar. So Mala Noche wasn't about mainstream gay culture. It was about a sidelined, independent gay man.”


	The film arrived during a golden moment for American indie cinema, fueled by upstart distributors like New Line, Orion and Miramax and the booming home video market. “Around the same time I made my film, Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch were making their first movies — She's Gotta Have It and Stranger Than Paradise — all in black-and-white and all low-budget.”


	Van Sant credits his chameleon-like approach to filmmaking to the way he shape-shifts when working with actors: “One director — I can't remember who, probably Frank Capra — was asked, ‘How do you direct different people?' And he said: ‘If they want to hear Chopin, you play Chopin. If they want to hear rock ‘n' roll, you play rock ‘n' roll.' I'm obsequious enough to mold into their needs, to understand what they want to do and how to make that thing happen.”


	He has often gravitated toward real-life stories: Mala Noche, Drugstore Cowboy and Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot were all adapted from memoirs; Milk was a biopic; To Die For satirized the Pamela Smart murder case. His latest, Dead Man's Wire, premiering out of competition in Venice (where Van Sant will receive the Campari Passion for Film Award), is based on a bizarre 1970s hostage standoff in Indianapolis. Bill Skarsgard plays Tony Kiritsis, a former developer who wired a shotgun to his mortgage banker's neck in a bid for a public apology and a payout.

	











	The project originally was set up with Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage. When they dropped out, producer Cassian Elwes — who had worked with Van Sant on Gerry — called to offer it to him. “Werner is so extreme that you start to see the extreme qualities in the story,” Van Sant says. “I also really knew the quality of this Midwest, middle-class life. My father [and] my grandfather were these types of Midwest small-town businessmen.”


	Van Sant is currently developing another real-life tale, a project about disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried.


	“Working with real stories is less about what I can bring to the story than about the story bringing itself to you, feeling like it's something you are connected to,” he says. “With Sam Bankman-Fried, I just thought this is an amazing sort of car crash in the crypto world. And then someone sent me a script about it.”


	There might not be anyone out there quite like Gus Van Sant. But asked about a kindred spirit, even a possible successor, he names Sean Baker.


	“It's amazing what he's doing. The fact that Anora just swept the Oscars shows there's hope. He comes by a style that's where I've always lived: You make something with small intentions but find the humanity within those intentions,” says Van Sant. “You don't let the money take over your sentiment as a filmmaker. You cast people that are new, that haven't been used before, and simplify the set to not have too many working parts. If you see a shot of a Bergman set, there's like four people. Or watch Godard making Breathless. There's a shopping cart and two guys.”

The truth about extraterrestrial encounters may lie on the operating table, according to doctors and skeptics. 

One night in 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas was plowing his field in rural Brazil when he saw mysterious red lights flying through the sky. What he presumed was a spacecraft landed in a nearby field. According to the farmer's account, he was approached by short humanoid creatures and taken back to their ship despite his attempts to escape. There, Boas claimed his captors experimented on him by taking samples of his body tissue and exposing him to noxious gas.   

Nearly 70 years later, Boas' extraterrestrial encounter is still one of the most famous abduction reports in history, along with other storied accounts from Barney and Betty Hill in 1961 and Travis Walton in 1975; in each case, the alleged victims recalled details similar to Boas' story, like bright lights and probing. Since that fateful night in 1957, several thousand more alien encounters have been reported, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, a research foundation based in Washington state. But are aliens actually abducting hundreds of humans each year, or even at all? Experts suggest there might be a simpler explanation—one that lies on the operating table. 

Accidental awareness is a complication where anesthesia patients wake up while they're really supposed to be unconscious. Most patients don't experience pain during accidental awareness, but may retain memories of the operating theater, according to the Royal College of Anesthetists, a UK-based professional organization. If a patient became aware during surgery, they would likely see bright lights, figures standing over them, and experience feelings of being out of control. Some scholars suggest this visual closely resembles classic abduction accounts, and that these memories may play a role in alien abduction claims. One paper in particular highlights an “altered state of consciousness” and feelings of “nakedness, pain, and a loss of control” as intraoperative experiences that could be confused with an extraterrestrial encounter.  

So why doesn't everyone who experiences accidental awareness believe they were abducted by aliens? According to Daniel J. Cole, M.D., former president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the timeline of patients remembering accidental awareness varies greatly. Memories can be instant or delayed, and sometimes they're even triggered by life events not related to the surgery itself. Cole also says there's a chance the trauma from accidental awareness could manifest as delusions. 

“This area is not well understood,” Cole says in an email. “But it is possible that intraoperative awareness could result in dissociative phenomena and false memories.”

Another expert, Benjamin Radford—paranormal investigator, author, and research fellow—says that, in some cases, remembering medical procedures could “absolutely” lead someone to believe they were abducted by aliens. However, he points out that the theory fails to explain why some people who have never undergone surgery may still believe they were abducted. Radford suggests a much more obvious culprit—one that is affecting most of our lives everyday, whether or not we even realize it. 

“I think that the more likely explanation, at least for many of these, is drawing on pop culture experiences and pop culture depictions,” says Radford, who is also deputy editor at the Skeptical Inquirer, a publication that uses reason to examine controversial and extraordinary claims. 

He points to medical dramas as possible fodder for false memories of alien abductions because the genre is popular and something most people have seen at some point or another. Radford explains that, while viewers may not be consciously memorizing technical medical terms, after watching enough of the shows, they'll eventually get a general sense of what a medical procedure could look like. With this in mind, he says “it's not surprising” that alleged abduction victims would elicit similar details when recounting their experiences. 

Professional skeptic and contributor at the Skeptical Inquirer, Daniel Reed, explains that perception is key. When it comes to our brains, perception is variable and difficult to measure, especially weeks or months after an event occurs. He uses an example of a pink elephant. While most are able to imagine a pink animal with large ears, the picture that appears in your mind is ultimately unique to you; the same goes for our perception of events. With the right level of priming, people may come to understand something fictitious to be true and then become deeply attached to those beliefs, according to Reed. 

Whether someone experiences an alien encounter because of extraterrestrial creatures or as a manifestation of medical trauma, the event deeply impacts their lives. Peter Davenport—director of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and manager of the Center's reporting hotline—says emotional impact is one of the criteria NUFORC uses when evaluating the validity of a report. He also says the strong feelings witnesses confess align with his own experiences, as he's allegedly seen several unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in his lifetime. 

“People are profoundly moved by their sightings, oftentimes,” Davenport says. “And you can hear it in their voice, even when they describe a sighting that occurred 50 years ago. You can tell they're sincere and reporting accurately just by the emotion they're exhibiting as they tell their story. […] Those emotions are hard to fake for most people.”

Christian Stepien, chief technology officer for NUFORC, emphasized in an email that the Center does not believe alien encounters are a manifestation of medical trauma, but rather true anomalous experiences. 

While the jury is still out on the relationship between alien encounters and experiences on the operating table, at least one thing's for certain in Boas' case way back in 1957: the Brazilian farmer read an article about alien invasions just one day before making his own report. 

So, was the extraterrestrial encounter a matter of mere coincidence? Or did the alien encounter story inspire Boas? And in that case, was the story that spurred his account in fact derived from another person's experience on the operating table?

Despite Denmark's reputation as one of the most secular and scientifically literate countries in the world, new research has found that a surprising number of Danes continue to believe in supernatural phenomena. The findings, published in Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences, suggest that the tendency to believe in spiritual forces, psychic essences, and magical thinking remains widespread even in a highly educated and irreligious society.

“I'm interested in how the mind works and how various types of cognitive bias can sometimes be advantageous and sometimes make us see patterns that aren't real and to see causal agents where there are none,” explained study author Ken Ramshøj Christensen, an associate professor at Aarhus University.

“Inspired by earlier, primarily American, surveys on supernatural belief that showed striking high levels of isolated supernatural belief, we wanted to find out how widespread different types of supernatural belief is in Denmark, which is otherwise a highly secular country, and to look for potential correlations between different types of belief, i.e. patterns, which most other surveys haven't done.”

The research team surveyed 2,204 adults from across Denmark using an anonymous online questionnaire that circulated through Facebook, Twitter, and online forums. The survey ran from November 2017 to February 2018 and asked participants to respond to 39 belief-related items using a five-point scale ranging from strong disbelief to strong belief.

Participants indicated their beliefs in a variety of domains: spirituality, supernatural forces, aliens, conspiracy theories, and science. The questions touched on topics such as telepathy, crystal healing, reincarnation, astrology, vaccines, angels, ghosts, and scientific explanations of the universe. The researchers also gathered demographic data, including biological sex, age, education level, and religious identification.

Although the sample was not randomly selected, it was demographically broad and aligned reasonably well with the national population in terms of age and education. The researchers then conducted statistical analyses to examine how belief levels varied across different groups and whether the beliefs clustered in meaningful ways.

The results revealed that supernatural beliefs remain widespread in Denmark, though their prevalence varies by topic. While only a tiny fraction of participants endorsed belief in vampires (0.3%) or zombies (0.6%), belief in a “psychic essence” or soul was endorsed by over 30% of respondents. Roughly 12% said they believed in angels, while around 14% reported belief in astrology. About 25% believed in dream interpretation as a meaningful way to understand the subconscious.

“I found it a bit surprising that 12.3% said they believe in angels, and 10.1% weren't sure; that's almost 1 in 5 in total,” Christensen told PsyPost. “For ghost, it's almost 1 in 4. It's also interesting that while astrology is popular, only few say they actually believe in it.”

The researchers found that these beliefs were not randomly distributed but tended to fall into coherent clusters. For example, belief in angels often co-occurred with belief in ghosts, reincarnation, and psychic energy, forming what the researchers described as a “spirituality” cluster. Beliefs in clairvoyance, magic, tarot, and crystal healing formed another distinct group, which the researchers called “magical thinking.” Beliefs in alien visitors and vaccine-related conspiracy theories were also correlated and formed part of what the authors labeled “openness to alternative explanations.”

In contrast, belief in scientific explanations—such as human evolution by natural selection or the usefulness of science for explaining mental and emotional life—tended to be negatively correlated with supernatural and magical beliefs. In other words, the more someone believed in scientific reasoning, the less likely they were to believe in paranormal forces, and vice versa.

The researchers also examined how demographic characteristics were linked to belief patterns. One of the strongest predictors was sex. Women were significantly more likely than men to report belief in supernatural ideas across nearly every category, including spirituality, magical thinking, and paranormal phenomena. Men, on the other hand, scored higher in belief in science.

This sex difference might relate to average differences in cognitive style, according to the researchers. For instance, women tend to score higher on empathizing traits—such as understanding others' emotions—while men tend to score higher on systemizing traits, such as analyzing rules and patterns. These tendencies may affect how people interpret ambiguous events or engage with belief systems.

Education level also played a role. Participants with more years of education tended to report slightly lower levels of supernatural belief, especially in spirituality, conspiracy theories, and magical thinking. However, this effect was small. The researchers noted that while education may offer tools for critical thinking, it does not entirely override cognitive biases or intuitive reasoning.

Religiosity was another strong predictor. People who identified as religious—whether Christian or another tradition—were significantly more likely to endorse supernatural beliefs. Those with no religious affiliation reported the lowest levels of belief in paranormal and spiritual phenomena and the highest levels of belief in science. Still, the boundaries were not absolute. Some nonreligious individuals endorsed belief in concepts like psychic energy or angels, suggesting that supernatural beliefs are not confined to formal religious systems.

Age, by contrast, was not a significant factor. The researchers found no meaningful relationship between a participant's age and their tendency to believe in supernatural ideas or scientific explanations.

The findings offer insights into how cultural and biological factors work together to influence belief. Even in a society like Denmark—known for its secular values and widespread education—supernatural ideas remain embedded in the population.

“Even though almost two thirds of our participants said they didn't have any religious belief, there was a fair amount of belief in spirituality and the supernatural, including spirits, ghosts, angels, and telepathy,” Christensen explained. “And length of education only has a tiny effect on supernatural belief. Above all, there was a clear sex difference: More women than men are religious, and women are also significantly more likely to believe in the supernatural. All of this, we think, can be explained in terms of evolved predispositions.”

While the study offers a detailed look at supernatural belief in a secular context, there are limitations. The sample was not randomly selected, and certain regions of Denmark were overrepresented, which could introduce bias. The cross-sectional nature of the study also means it cannot capture how beliefs change over time.

“It would be interesting to see whether the belief in various supernatural phenomena is rising, and whether the correlation patterns are changing, which would require replicating our study,” Christensen said.

Still, the researchers argue that the large sample size and the consistency of findings with existing research strengthen the conclusions. Future studies could examine whether supernatural beliefs are increasing or decreasing in different societies, how they respond to major cultural events, or whether education systems can shape these beliefs in lasting ways.

The results also suggest a need to explore the psychological functions that supernatural beliefs might serve, especially when they are not tied to organized religion. Beliefs in spirits, angels, or intuitive healing may offer emotional comfort, community identity, or a sense of control—particularly during uncertainty.

The study, “Evolved Minds in a Secular World: A Large-Scale Survey of Supernatural Beliefs in Denmark,” was authored by Ken Ramshøj Christensen and Mathias Clasen.

Researchers examining debates over women's bodily autonomy find that harm arguments often operate less as genuine moral convictions and more as rhetorical tools. The study points to fairness and purity as stronger predictors of people's actual stances on these issues.

Psychologists find that not everyone responds to partner phone use the same way. A daily diary study shows attachment-anxious individuals report stronger feelings of rejection and are more likely to retaliate when phubbed, underscoring how early relational patterns shape digital conflicts.

A new study suggests the strongest driver of conspiracy beliefs about the Trump assassination attempt wasn't social media or cable news. Instead, researchers found an unexpected social factor that could explain why some people fall for these narratives.

Researchers have uncovered a surprising link between political extremism and emotional chills—those shivers or goosebumps people feel during powerful music or speeches—suggesting that intense bodily reactions may reflect deeper psychological and ideological patterns across the political spectrum.

New research finds that men high in psychopathy and sexual desire, and women who are less picky with matches, report more sexual encounters via Tinder. The findings suggest dating apps favor fast, opportunistic mating strategies shaped by personality.

A new longitudinal study of Chinese high school students suggests that growing up in poverty weakens belief in a just world, while unpredictable environments show less consistent effects. Perceptions of discrimination appear to help explain this link.

Frequent churchgoers are more likely to say tackle football is appropriate for kids, according to new research. The study highlights how religious beliefs may influence support for the sport.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris framed the 2024 presidential debate in starkly different terms, according to a new study—but their language also showed surprising overlap in tone, emotional content, and specificity.

BARBERTON, Ohio – Community members are invited to a paranormal investigation of Barberton's historic West Theatre on Aug. 30 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Experienced investigators from Haunted Havens, a paranormal investigation company, will lead the tour. Attendees will explore the mysteries and supernatural occurrences rumored to have taken place at the iconic venue - -from the boiler room to the creepy attic -- according to Haunted Havens founder Stephanie Pitz.

A Portage Lakes resident and Wadsworth High School graduate, Pitz founded Haunted Havens last year. During her childhood, she felt a connection to the supernatural world, but her parents didn't want to hear about it, she told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. A ghost tour of Savannah, Georgia, that Pitz went on about 10 years ago rekindled her interest. After taking additional tours in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and other places in the South, she decided to open her own company to lead paranormal tours at various locations in Ohio.

“I take people who want to go on ghost tours but don't know where to start, or people who don't know where to go, or don't have friends to go with them, because their friends aren't into that sort of thing. I teach the equipment, and the cost of the tours includes the use of all of the equipment,” Pitz said. 

Tour equipment includes dowsing rods (an ancient tool used to detect water), and REM rods and K2 EMF readers, which detect electrical activity, according to Pitz.

“I just want more people to understand that if you are curious about paranormal activity, you don't just have to watch shows on TV, you can get hands-on, too. I'm trying to make that link between those types of people, because I was that person,” Pitz said.

Tickets are $45 for individuals ages 12 and older. The tour is open to novice and experienced investigators. Basic paranormal equipment is provided, but attendees can also bring their own equipment and a flashlight.

West Theatre opened in August of 1947 at 1017 Wooster Road, according to the Barberton Historical Society. It showed second-run movies until its closure in 2008. The theatre briefly served as a concert venue and a church until it reopened as a theatre in January of 2017, according to Ohio.com reports.

MACON, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) – Visit Macon and the Macon Beyond team are hosting an overnight ghost hunt at one of the city's most historic landmarks, the Burke Mansion, according to Visit Macon.

The exclusive event will be held October 3, and will allow guests to spend the night in the 1887-built mansion while participating in an immersive paranormal investigation.

The ghost hunt will be hosted by actress and producer Carrie Genzel, known for her roles in “The Walking Dead,” “Supernatural,” “Jennifer's Body” and other horror films and series. She will be joined by spiritual medium Morrighan Lynne and paranormal investigator Jonathan Morgan.

The evening begins with a reception featuring wine, signature cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a guided paranormal investigation through the mansion's most storied spaces. Guests will also receive tickets to Rock Candy Tours' Macon Macabre Walking Tour.

“This team has had so much fun exploring the most requested sites in Macon for legends and lore in our video series,” Genzel said. “I have been fascinated with the unexplained, and have had numerous encounters. Moving to Macon sparked my passion for exploring the city's haunted sites and interacting with its supernatural inhabitants.”

Two ticket options are available:

Ghost Hunt Event Only — Friday, October 3, beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $45 and include the cocktail reception, guided paranormal investigation, an event T-shirt and the walking tour.

Luxury Stay + Ghost Hunt Experience — October 3-5. Packages include a two-night stay at Burke Mansion with breakfast, parking, a themed gift basket, a VIP meet-and-greet, the walking tour and access to the ghost hunt. Suites for one to two guests are $500, while the carriage house for two to four guests is $1,000.

“This is all in good fun,” said Gary Wheat, president and CEO of Visit Macon. “We saw the attention and sincere appeal for Macon's October events last year, so we have to keep building on that by creating a calendar full of activities and a place where guests will want to stay with us this season.”

Macon has been named by HGTV as one of the best small towns to celebrate Halloween and highlighted by Travel + Leisure as one of the nation's top destinations for haunted mansions and ghost tours.

In an exclusive excerpt from a new book about their 25 years working together, see how the lawman and medium found trust in each other

St. Martin's Publishing Group

 Before we left the office, I quickly grabbed a few extras from female colleagues: a bracelet, a compact mirror, a woman's watch, and a necklace. Control items, I thought. If this guy was legit, he should be able to tell the difference between what belonged to Fran and what didn't, right?


 I was still sitting on a fence of extremes when it came to this psychic.


 Part of me still thought he was a fraud, and the lawman in me wanted to take him down. I even researched reasons to arrest him. Wire fraud? Mail fraud? And yet, my stubborn heart wanted to believe he was the real deal.


 We arrived at his office in Long Island as a family was leaving. They were crying and thanking the young man, whom I took to be John, in the center of the room. The mother threw her arms around him and hugged tight.


 “You have no idea what you have done for us today.”


 I could feel my anger rising. This guy was taking advantage of a grieving family. The young man — he had a boyish face, brown hair, and glasses — approached me.


 “Hi, I'm John. Are you Agent Hilland?”


 He was not what I expected. From the voice on the radio, I imagined an older man with a grand, theatrical, presence. This guy was younger than me, humble and unassuming. He looked like someone's kid brother. He looked like goddamn Harry Potter.


 “Yes. Thanks for seeing us,” I said, introducing Dansman.


 “Glad to help. Oh. You're not FBI,” John said to Dansman.


 “You're right, I'm not,” said Dansman. He shot me an I-told-you-so look. See?


 Okay, one point for the psychic. But what else will he know? I was prepared for this to be a bust. We sat at a large, wooden desk in a plain, unadorned room. No candles, no incense, no crystal balls.


St. Martin's Publishing Group

 “My assistant tells me you need help with a case,” John began. “The first thing I need to say is that if I end up helping you, it must stay private between us. I don't want you to mention it to the press, I don't want to be in any paperwork.”


 “That's not a problem,” I told him.


 “Good. Have either of you worked with a psychic before?”


 “I have,” said Dansman. “A few times, in other cases.”


 “Never,” I said.


 “Let me explain how I work. The information comes to me from my spirit guides in three different ways: clairvoyance, clairaudience and clairsentience. That means I see pictures, I hear thoughts and I get feelings or sensations. I will interpret what I'm seeing, hearing and feeling using my own frame of reference, and hopefully you'll understand it.


 “Some of the information you might understand right away. Some you might not. It's important that you write everything down, even if you don't understand. It could make sense to you later.”


 We took out our notebooks and pens, ready to go.


 “I'll get people above you, to your side, and below you,” John continued, “meaning older, the same age, and younger. I might be off by a name, but not by an initial.”


 And one more thing, he emphasized.


 “Do not give me any information or try to steer me in any direction. I want to describe to you exactly what I'm getting without interference.”


Erica Schultz

 We nodded.


 “Before we begin, do you have any questions?”


 “Yes,” I said. “I want to confirm. This is an active case. It's not our practice to discuss our investigations with the public, so ...”


 “As far as I'm concerned, you were never here.” John said, cutting me off. “I prefer it that way. Nothing personal, but I don't like to get involved with law enforcement. My only condition in helping you guys is that you don't mention to anyone that you met with me.”


 Good. We were on the same page. Though I could see slight disappointment on Dansman's face.


 “Let's get started,” said John. “Did you bring any belongings of the person you are looking for?” John asked.


 Dansman pulled the items from a bag and placed them on John's desk. John closed his eyes, took a deep breath, cupped his palms together and focused on them. After a minute, he reached over and moved the “control” items — bracelet, mirror, watch, necklace — from the group and put them in a pile to the side.


 I was stunned. He figured it out right away.

 “I don't know what these things are,” said John, “but they have nothing to do with the reason you're here,” he said.


 Dansman and I glanced at each other. Point two for the psychic. John returned his focus to Fran's items and picked up her eyeglasses. He looked up, almost past us, as if he was staring at someone behind us.


 “I'm seeing a woman. She looks older than her actual age. She's crossed over. She has two names like Mary Anne, Barbara Anne ... but people called her by her second name ... ​there's an F sound like Fern or Fran ... wait. It's Fran.”


 My heart raced. Dansman's eyes were locked on Edward. The next chunk of information came in a rush of words.


Paul Arasim

 “She was vain about her appearance. She had breast implants — they're showing me serial numbers on them — and dyed blond hair. Blue eyes. She wore a lot of makeup. Fran was a smoker. I smell cigarette smoke and strong perfume, like when a person tries to cover up the smoke scent with a lot of perfume. She's also showing me that she couldn't walk, like she broke her leg? She's showing me crutches. I feel a strong pain in the back of my head. Was she struck in the head? Yes ... ​she was hit in the back of the head with something. She didn't see it coming. Weird,” John said, still looking beyond us.


 “I feel like she was tricked into going somewhere by someone she trusted. A boyfriend or husband. He is still here, he hasn't crossed. He has a simple J name, like John or Jim or Joe. And a second S name, very common, like ... ​Smith.”


 I shivered. This was unreal.


 John put down the glasses and picked up the hairbrush.


 “After she was hit in the head, the J-S name — let's call him ‘Smith' — strangled her to make sure she was dead. Not like a bloodbath or anything. It was like he knocked her out with one blow, then strangled her.”


 I sat back in my chair, stunned. What the actual hell? Was he was seeing all this play out in front of him? I looked over at Dansman, who was equally shocked. I barely had time to register the horror he described when another rush of information came.


 “He was much younger than her,” John continued. “Maybe 10 years. She was angry. Was there another woman? She thought there was another woman. But not in the same state where they were living."


 “She's showing me stairs. They were upstairs, on a third floor if not higher. There was an argument. She confronted him about a bunch of things, not just one issue. It feels like a whole bunch of different things. Smith was lying to her and she knew it. She called him out on it. He felt like his worlds were crashing together.”


 John shook his head.


 “Man, this guy has major control issues. Major. He needs to be in control. Whatever she did or said, she was taking that control away from him, and he didn't like it.”


 Dansman and I scribbled notes as fast as we could, trying to keep up.


 “The woman, F name — Fran — was fed up and demanded Smith take her somewhere. He was lying to her about so many things. I don't understand this. She's showing me furniture. Did he steal her furniture? There's also a second home. Like I said, she was calling him out an all his lies.”


 Dansman and I kept nodding. John kept getting hit after hit, like a pinball whacking against the bells in a machine. Tilt, tilt, tilt. But not only was John confirming details we already knew, he was giving information we didn't know — details that made sense, information that rang true that we could follow up on.


 We kept scribbling. He kept talking.


 “So, Smith calms her down, he appeases her somehow. Like, ‘Don't worry, Honey, I'll show you everything is okay.' I see them walking out of an apartment building or condo. She's using crutches. It's in the daytime, not at night. Wait, other people saw them leaving — a couple who live in the same building. It feels like they were walking in as she and Smith were leaving ... Oh.”


 John looked at Dansman. “You interviewed these people?”


 Dansman nodded.


 “And they told you they saw them leaving together. But the timing doesn't line up. It's like he kills her on a Saturday but you guys don't know she's missing until a week later.”


 Again, Dansman nodded. He was speechless.


 “So, he, Smith, helps this woman, Fran, to the car. He drives. She thinks she is going somewhere to see something she believes he is lying about. He's taking her to this place ... ​it feels right off a major highway. It's ironic. She was nervous and pissed off, because she knew she was about to expose his lie. And he was nervous and pissed off, because he knew she was about to expose his lie. They both knew."


 “So, whatever this place is, it has an industrial feel to it, like metal and steel, blacktop, concrete ... ​I hear the highway. It's near a major highway with lots of traffic. There are many doors ... ​metal garage doors ...”


 I was so charged up I couldn't stay quiet any longer.


 “Like a public storage unit?” I asked.


 John's eyes lit up.


 “Yes. It absolutely feels like that. Definitely New Jersey, not far from where they lived and where he worked.”


 Again, Dansman and I exchanged a glance. Smith had that public storage facility in New Brunswick, N.J., where Fran's furniture was supposed to be.


 John continued.


 “It was still daylight. I see him pointing to a door and drawing her attention away from what he was about to do. Then he just did it.”

 John's eyes darted around, as if he was watching it happen.


 “For her it was in an instant,” he said. “She didn't even know what happened, she was unconscious before she hit the ground. Then, instantaneously, he pulls her inside whatever this thing is, this garage unit, and closes the door so nobody can see what's happening.”


 John paused, as if trying to process the deluge of images.


 I had to ask. He said not to steer him in a direction, but he didn't say not to ask questions.


 “What did he do with her body?”


 John glanced at me, then gazed again beyond me. He squinted, like he was trying to see or understand something.


 “She's not in one piece,” he said. “He dismembered her and put the pieces in something. She's encapsulated.”


 “What do you mean?” I asked.


 John's brow furrowed.


 “She's encapsulated in something. I keep seeing cylinders ... ​I'm not sure what this is. He's very smart. Whatever he put her in, it's got no smell and it's somewhere no one would suspect there was a body ... ​or pieces of a body.”


 “Like what?”


 “I don't know. I keep seeing cylinders. Her body is in these cylinders but also in something to keep her preserved, like fluid ... ​or concrete.”


 I'm sure Dansman was thinking what I was thinking. Smith worked at an industrial company called Carborundum, which produced refractory, heat-resistant concrete blocks.


 “You know when you see a new development being built, and they have these huge concrete ... ​I don't know what you call them ... storm drains?” John asked.


 “Sewer drains?” I asked.


 “Yeah. Like that. When you find her, her body parts will be remarkably intact. Well preserved.”


 My heart was racing now. I was hanging on his every word.


 “So, we will find her?”


 John paused. He looked thoughtfully at whatever invisible presence was behind us.


 “I think so. But it's not going to be easy,” he said. “And it won't be anytime soon.”

Porepunkah, Australia — Australian police said Thursday they will not rest until they catch a 56-year-old gunman who fled into the bush two days earlier after allegedly killing two officers. Detectives said they were speaking to the man's partner and searching rugged, forested terrain near the small town of Porepunkah, in the northeast of Victoria state.   The suspect, identified by police as Dezi Freeman, escaped on foot after opening fire when a team of 10 police arrived at his property on Tuesday, allegedly killing two policemen and wounding a third.

 Police say the man — described by local media as a radicalized conspiracy theorist — is heavily armed, has bush survival skills and knows the area well.

 "We will not rest until we apprehend the offender," said Russell Barrett, Victoria police deputy commissioner for regional operations.

Police were in contact with the man's partner, had searched a number of properties, and believed he was still in the area, Barrett said.

 But "we've had no confirmed sightings," he told a news conference.

 Anyone harboring the man would be prosecuted for committing a criminal offense, Barrett warned.

 Police said they were moving carefully through the bush, and warned people not to travel into the surrounding alpine area to go skiing.

 "It is really difficult terrain. It is complex terrain," Victoria police superintendent Brett Kahan said.

 Police say the shooting happened in a matter of minutes when they descended on the man's property on Tuesday morning to execute a search warrant. 

Police fired at the suspect but apparently did not wound him, they said.

 The shootout resulted in the deaths of 59-year-old detective Neal Thompson and 35-year-old senior constable Vadim De Waart.

 Police say the wounded officer has undergone surgery and is expected to recover.

 Australia's The Age newspaper said Freeman was a self-professed "sovereign citizen," referring to a movement whose adherents falsely believe they are not subject to laws passed by the government.

 Police have not commented on those reports.

 While fighting a speeding penalty in a Melbourne court last year, Freeman referred to police as "frigging Nazis," "Gestapo," and "terrorist thugs," according to a copy of the judge's ruling.  Freeman told the court that "even the sight of a cop or a cop car… it's like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier," according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Deadly shootings are relatively rare in Australia, and police fatalities even rarer. The latest deaths listed in a national memorial to fallen police showed three officers were killed on duty in separate incidents in 2023, including one by gunshot.

 In December 2022, four police arrived at a tree-lined property near small Queensland town of Wieambilla and came under fire from the family living there.

 Six people were killed in that incident, including two police officers. Police later blamed the family's fundamentalist Christian beliefs for what was termed a terrorist attack.

 A ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons has been in place in Australia since a 1996 mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people. 

Then-newly-elected Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative and close friend of George W. Bush, pushed through the sweeping gun control legislation just 12 days after the shooting.

"The hardest things to do in politics often involve taking away rights and privileges from your own supporters," Howard CBS News' Seth Doane in a 2022 interview, looking back at the landmark legislation.

The new laws banned the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forced people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy a firearm; and — perhaps most significantly — called for a massive, mandatory gun-buyback. Australia's government confiscated and destroyed close to 700,000 firearms, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.

"People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'" Howard recalled. "And I'd tell them: 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder?'"

Contributor.

Every week that passes, a new scandal emerges. It must be the heat of the campaign. One of the latest "victims" is the controversial Justice Minister, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, who appeared on a hidden camera offering his influence to Tim Ballard, another contentious character. Ballard, a former Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security's Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce has led multiple anti-child trafficking NGOs over the years, some of which he's been expelled from accused of sexual misconduct and irregular donation procurement. He denies the accusations.

In the leaked video, Minister Cúneo Libarona tells Ballard that after watching the film "Sound of Freedom," where Hollywood star Jim Caviezel plays Ballard embarking on a dangerous mission to the Colombian jungle to rescue captive children, he was inspired to write a legal project that he wishes to send to Congress. He invites Ballard to read it and then offers him access to media outlets, journalists, and even judges and ministers to "tell your story and the issues." He goes on to tell Ballard he will help him "clear up that misunderstanding that occurred in our country."

It wasn't immediately clear what misunderstanding Cúneo Libarona was speaking of, but Ballard's name became a feature in mainstream Argentine media earlier this year when television gossip star Viviana Canosa promised to come out with serious accusations of sexual abuse and even pedophilia against several colleagues including Florencia Peña and Lizy Tagliani. Canosa's accusations sparked a media scandal and multiple legal proceedings, many against Canosa herself. She indicated that Ballard had given her information about child-trafficking, forcing the former Special Agent to admit having meeting her, but denying they ever spoke about these issues.

The opposition has called for Minister Cúneo Libaron's head, indicating he is colluding with a foreigner who is also an interested party in passing purported legislation, adding that he is an interested party. Even within the ranks of the Javier Milei administration, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has called Ballard a fraudster with multiple accusations against him. Why would someone with the political backing of President Milei and the power of a Security Minister agree to a meeting with Ballard, and then go on to incriminate himself so directly? Who filmed him? And why was the video leaked?

One of the connective threads behind the multiple scandals faced by Milei and his top officials is CPAC, the conservative think tank that counts with the Argentine President and Donald Trump as some of its highest-profile members. According to Perfil's Giselle Leclerq, the former Special Agent was part of the CPAC summit held in February where both Milei and Trump were in attendance. National deputy Esteban Paulón says that Ballard was introduced to Milei by Laura Belén Arrieta, the infamous single passenger of the private jet owned by Leondro Scatturice who entered the country with ten pieces of undeclared luggage. Arrieta, one of the organizers of CPAC's Latin American chapter, is employed by Scatturice, who has close ties with Argentina's intelligence agencies and Santiago Caputo, the controversial political aide to President Milei who runs Cúneo Libarona's Ministry through his deputy, Sebastián Amerio. Everything is connected, it seems.

Back to Bullard, his anti-child trafficking work crossed paths with the wild conspiracy theories associated with QAnon, which has a solid belief base among the ranks of the right wing-conservative MAGA movement, as Leclerq noted. The belief that a cabal of sex-traffickers and pedophiles led by prominent Democrats and Hollywood stars has led the QAnon world to "invade" the digital campaigning of the traditional NGOs in the space, as the New York Times reported, which also interviewed Ballard who noted the increased awareness was an opportunity. The idea that the QAnon cult can stop human-trafficking has led to dangerous situations such as the hostage showdown at Comet Ping Pong, where a radicalized person walked into the restaurant armed with an AR-15 style assault rifle in order to investigate the "pizzagate" conspiracy.

In Argentina, there was the troubling disappearance of five-year-old Loan Peña in Corrientes province. As the investigation was underway a man who claimed to be a member of multiple US security agencies and who was known as "the American" was arrested after trying to get involved with the case. His real name is Nicolás Gabriel Soria and he said he had worked with Ballard, something the latter denied. As Leclerq reported, a lawyer for two of Bullard's sexual abuse accusers noted that Soria had been brainwashed to believe he was helping to battle in the front lines of the battle against child-trafficking by Aerial Recovery, one of the NGOs Ballard worked with. He was part of a program aimed at helping war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who received some basic training and then become "loyal mercenaries sent to 'work' across the globe." Soria "got involved in the case thinking he was a child trafficking expert because he was given some sort of certification and he truly believes the whole [QAnon]



Rodrigo Tripolone, the attorney, suggests that Ballard has a fraudulent modus operandi: in order to feed his image as a "pedophile hunter" he presents himself as an expert, cozies up to local authorities, and then tags along in domestic police operations to gain credibility. Many of these types of images can be seen on his social media.

For whatever it's worth, Ballard's video with Minister Cúneo Libarona adds another spot to the tiger. The MAGA world appears to have easy access to Milei and his cabinet through CPAC, allowing Ballard to sit with the Justice Minister to attempt to clear his name, or 10 bags to get smuggled into the country without proper investigation on Scatturice's airplane, by his employee. A recent investigation showed that Scatturice's technology firm, OCP Tech, received a $78-million government contract for maintaining Wi-Fi connections in schools. Along the same lines, B class characters like Hayden Mark Davis, Julian Peh, along with local connections Mauricio Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy got President Milei to participate in a meme coin rugpull scam that is now under investigation by the US judiciary. Furthermore, Karina Milei's political task force, a company named Tech Security, owned by the family of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Martín Menem and advisor Eduardo "Lule" Menem, received a contract worth four billion pesos from government-owned Banco Nación. And now, the Spagnuolo scandal in the ANDIS agency for the handicapped.

The smear campaign is in full force. Several weeks ago there was a purge of the Buenos Aires Province police force accused of campaigning on behalf of Maximiliano Bondarenko, libertarian candidate in the third electoral section that is a historical bastion of Peronism. Together, all of these and other "operations" or coordinated information leaks destined to harm political opponents indicate that the traditional method of doing politics in Argentina is alive and well, and it includes illegal espionage. This doesn't mean those on the receiving-end are innocent, quite the contrary in many cases. Expect the freakshow to continue.

A new report from a crowdsourced UFO-sighting app found that among the hundreds of reports of unidentified metallic orbs between 2022 and 2025, the majority were spotted in the dead of night near military installations in California, New York and Arizona.

Enigma, which allows users to report their own UFO sightings, logged more than 8,000 reports in the U.S. between Dec. 2022 and June 2025, according to the report. Of these, 422 described the presence of a metallic orb, the majority of which were observed between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. within five miles of military bases.

Investigating such mysterious flying objects is the work of the Pentagon's All-doman Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which logged 757 cases between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the office's annual report. Twenty-one of these cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Of the 422 metallic orbs reportedly spotted by Enigma users, 360 of them were seen near military bases such as Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base in California.

"While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma," the report said. "Often spotted at high altitudes near sensitive infrastructure, these orbs are described as hovering silently or darting across the sky at seemingly impossible speeds."



"Consistently seen across the globe, the orbs typically lack visible propulsion systems or control surfaces."

"What makes these orbs especially compelling isn't just how often they appear, but where and how they operate. They are frequently observed in restricted airspace, near nuclear facilities, and have even been tracked on radar or captured by high-resolution infrared systems," the report added.

According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. The 24-second video was taken by an MQ-9, an unmanned aerial vehicle, though it was determined to be a "typical" unresolved UAP.

"While AARO assesses the object in the clip is not exhibiting anomalous behavior, the object remains unidentified," the AARO report said.

Of the hundreds of reports of metallic orbs, 43% mentioned the appearance of light and 40% said the object flew very low, according to Enigma. Another 35% said the object flew rapidly, fast or quick, and 38% reported the object was hovering.

A common theory about the metallic orbs paints them as surveillance devices, whether deployed by terrestrial governments or by "non-human intelligences," the Enigma report said.

"Some skeptics argue metallic orbs may be misunderstood weather balloons, optical illusions, or rare atmospheric conditions (like ball lightning)," the report admits. "And others maintain that they are a psychological manifestation, projected by the human mind during altered states or high-stress moments."

"Despite official statements and competing theories, their origin and purpose remain unknown."

A 19-year-old Chinese man barely survived the worst four months of his life after being seduced and then sold into slavery by his 17-year-old girlfriend.

Chinese media recently reported the shocking case of a young man from Zhanjiang, in China's Guangdong province, who endured four months of captivity and torture at the hands of a scam ring in Myanmar, after being lured into a trap by his teenage girlfriend. The victim's sister claims the two met at a local pool hall where the 17-year-old girl hung out in revealing outfits and wore counterfeit designer handbags to project an aura of wealth. Her brother was instantly drawn to her and hung on her every word when she bragged about her family's operations in Southern Asia, even though she never offered any proof. She repeatedly tried to convince the 19-year-old to travel with her to the neighboring country for lucrative work opportunities, and eventually, he accepted, despite his family's opposition.

 In February of this year, the pair secretly traveled to Thailand, with his family learning about his whereabouts from his friends. On their way back, while approaching the Thailand-Myanmar border, the 17-year-old girl made up a story about having to pick someone up close by and simply abandoned her boyfriend in the middle of nowhere. Shortly after, a group of armed men approched him, took all his documents and his mobile phone before taking him to a secret compund.

“My brother told me people with guns had taken him away,” the teen's sister recalled, adding that this was all he was able to text her before his phone was taken away.

The 19-year-old Chinese man was taken to a secluded camp, his head was shaved, and he was forced to sit in front of a computer for 16 – 20 hours a day, carrying out scams against his fellow countrymen. If he failed to reach his daily quotas or if his efforts didn't bear fruit, the young man faced severe physical punishment, including being hit with metal rods over his back and head.

During his captivity, the 19-year-old victim lost over 10 kilograms due to food deprivation, and due to the repeated beatings, he suffered permanent hearing loss. However, because he turned out to be extremely bad at scamming people, his captors decided he wasn't going to make them any money that way, so they decided to contact his family and ask for a ransom.

In June of 2025, the teen's family managed to raise the 350,000 yuan ($49,000) ransom and secured his release. However, the rescued teenager lives in constant anxiety and fear of being abducted and tortured again. He has nightmares about his four months in captivity and has developed paranoia.

As for his treacherous girlfriend, she was arrested after returning to China following a ten-day vacation in Thailand and now faces charges for her involvement in the victim's abduction by the Myanmar scam ring.

“She's only 17 years old. Who would have thought she could do something so evil?” the victim's sister told reporters. “It's unbelievable that she's capable of such despicable acts at such a young age.”

Home - News - Supernatural creator reveals canceled Sam and Dean plot that "could have changed everything"

Kateryna Danshyna

News editor

Exactly 20 years have passed since Supernatural debuted on the air, and fans have seen 15 (!) exciting seasons and a generally satisfying finale. However, few people know that showrunner Andrew Dabba planned a completely different story for the last episodes.

One of the ideas was that the Winchester brothers would make their knowledge of the supernatural universe public.

“One storyline we talked about for a long time was that Sam and Dean would go public. They said: “We're making a public service announcement that monsters are real. If you see something strange in your city, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We are just going to spread the word.”

In the end, this plan was abandoned because it would have forced Supernatural to go in a completely different and “weird” direction. Dubb clarifies that the brothers' publicity would have been “logistically challenging for the show.”

“All of a sudden Sam and Dean became world famous, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but in reality, I think it would have ruined the show. It wouldn't have been a good thing, and that's one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

Among other canceled ideas for the show: the return of the Antichrist, played by Gattlin Griffith, in a “different form.” The character, also called Jesse Turner, was introduced in season 5, where Castiel (Misha Collins) predicted that he was destined to help Lucifer in the war against Heaven. Initially, Jesse had no idea who he was until Sam and Dean revealed the truth to him, prompting the character to go into hiding, and his whereabouts remained unknown even after the series ended.

The last episode of Supernatural aired on November 19, 2020. Now, 5 years after the show's end, the trio of main actors has a chance to reunite in another project. In February, the official page of the show published a video with Jensen Ackles gathering his colleagues Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins to appear in the fifth season of the Amazon series — all of them are rumored to appear in the same scene.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

  The entire first season of Charmed existed before I was even born, and it finished airing as I was learning how to add and subtract. Yet, I've still been infatuated with the witchy TV series for as long as I can remember.



  For those out of the loop, Charmed is an eight-season supernatural drama that ran from 1998 to 2006, following the lives of the Halliwell sisters, a trio of witches known as the Charmed Ones who are prophesied to be the greatest force of good to ever live. Like similar paranormal shows — Supernatural, Lost Girl, Grimm — the sisters fight a new baddie in each episode, which generally leads to season finale clashes with increasingly powerful forces of evil. Unlike those shows though, Charmed at its core isn't about fighting the forces of evil, but championing the goodness of love in all of its mundane and magical forms.



  As I come off my sixth re-watch of the series, (that's more than 800 hours), I've realized that it's become a comfort in some of my hardest times. Between its fully fleshed-out characters and interesting villains, seasons consisting of 20 or more hourlong episodes, and behind-the-scenes drama that encapsulates early 2000s pop culture, Charmed is like a long, warm hug to me.



  Honestly, I think it's the best TV show ever made. (The 2018 reboot, with all of its innovative and unique additions, doesn't hold a candle to the original.)



Charmed finds strength as a series in its characters. Rather than a group of one-dimensional witches focused solely on the craft, creator Constance M. Burge gives each of the sisters their own hopes and dreams beyond their duties as the Charmed Ones.



  The oldest sister is Prue (Shannen Doherty), who has the power of telekinesis. She's regarded as the strongest and is rigid in that eldest sibling kind of way (there's an entire episode where her sisters try to get Prue to say "I love you" to them). When we meet her she's an arts appraiser at the Buckland Auction House, but as she realizes she wants to create art herself, she takes a job as a photographer at a magazine.



  Then there's Piper (Holly Marie Combs), the middle sister with the power to freeze time. In the beginning she's working as a restaurant manager, but right when Season 2 starts, she opens her own nightclub, P3. Though it's an indication of Piper's character growth, it's also a clever way to add killer musical acts such as The Cranberries, Dishwalla, Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Navarro, to name a few, to the show.



  Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) is the youngest sister and the most rebellious. She's often fighting with Prue over the past. However, Phoebe's power of premonition and later, her skills as an empath, quickly adds a level of maturity to her character. By the final few seasons, Phoebe is the premiere advice columnist in all of San Francisco.



  After Prue abruptly and unceremoniously dies in the Season 3 finale — in 2023, Doherty finally confirmed that she left the show due to drama between her and Milano on set — we meet the fourth Halliwell sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Paige is their half-sister on their mom's side, and she inherits Prue's power of telekinesis. Her addition effectively changes the sisters' dynamic, which makes the show feel refreshed as it enters its fourth season.



  Beyond the main characters, their love interests are often compelling additions to the story. We meet Leo (Brian Krause), the Charmed Ones' whitelighter, or guardian angel, early on in the series. While posing as the sisters' handyman, he and Piper begin to fall for each other. Phoebe's first love interest, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), turns out to be a half-demon who wants to turn her evil. He sticks around far longer than he should, but he's just a joy to hate.



  And unlike some shows that absolutely fumble at the end (looking at you, Game of Thrones), the show's final season wraps everything up in this perfect little bow. Piper and Leo grow old together, Phoebe literally falls in love with love (his name is Coop and he's a cupid), and Paige finds her own destiny somewhere between her calling as a witch and a whitelighter. ♦

People have seen the largest number of metallic orbs over military installations in the US. Even military personnel have reported seeing them. Most of them appeared between 1 and 4 am. They hover for some time and then dash away within seconds. Pentagon officials are scratching their heads.

Metallic orb-like unidentified flying objects have swarmed the skies over military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. People have reported seeing thousands of mysterious things that can't be explained in the past two and a half years. Of the 8,000 sightings, 422 of them were metallic orbs, according to the crowdsourced platform Enigma. The majority of them were seen between 1 and 4 am, and almost all of them were hovering over a site linked to the US military. This has once again ignited rumours about these places hiding something, a secret being kept from not just Americans, but the entire world. What strengthens the argument that these objects could have been from another world is that even military personnel said they saw them. Civilians and pilots also said they saw UFOs. Enigma data shows that 360 metallic orbs were seen within a few miles of military bases in the US. In three of these cases, the orbs were seen multiple times within a distance of five miles from Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base.

The description of what these orbs do is also almost similar - they hover silently over an area, and then bolt at extreme speeds without leaving any smoke or ice trail. A lot of these sightings are accompanied by videos. One person saw two liquid metallic orbs in Brooklyn's Fort Hamilton in June 2024 for a full two minutes. In Los Angeles, a metallic orb appeared after several planes flying in a formation flew by. This has piled up a lot of work for the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which was made to find explanations for these sightings. While it dismissed most of them as either birds or planes, several of them still remain unresolved. AARO's annual report mentions that 757 UFOs were seen between May 2023 and June 2024, and 21 cases were classified as unresolved sightings.

Eyewitnesses reported the maximum number of orbs in Texas and Florida. Government officials believe that they could be advanced drones that can dash from a place within seconds, an NYT report stated. Meanwhile, some even think that they could be surveillance devices sent by Russia and China. UFO sightings have been reported not only in the US but also in many other parts of the world. The Buga Sphere, which was captured from Colombia, has been generating a lot of buzz. Researchers say that it has wires inside it and has even grown in weight since being caught. It is even said that it dried up all the grass in the place it fell. A video clip on X even suggests that it is responding to Sanskrit shlokas and chants.

A new study published in PNAS Nexus suggests that people are more likely to believe conspiracy theories about the 2024 attempted assassination of Donald Trump if they heard them from people they know rather than from social media or news outlets. While conspiracy theories spread widely across platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), the researchers found that interpersonal networks played a stronger role in shaping belief.

The study was motivated by a growing need to better understand how conspiracy theories take hold and spread, particularly in the aftermath of high-profile, emotionally charged events. Previous research has often centered on individual psychological traits, such as a tendency toward suspicion or political extremism, to explain why some people are more prone to conspiratorial beliefs. While these factors remain important, the current study aimed to explore a less studied domain: the role of communication networks and interpersonal influence.

The authors used the July 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump as a test case because it quickly became a flashpoint for politically charged misinformation. As with past events like the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the suddenness and ambiguity of the Trump shooting generated intense speculation and competing narratives.

Almost immediately, people began sharing theories across the political spectrum—some suggesting Democratic operatives were behind the attack, others alleging the whole event was staged to benefit Trump politically. This combination of salience, controversy, and rapid information flow created an ideal environment to examine how beliefs about conspiracy theories form and spread.

The research team collected survey data from a nationally diverse sample of 2,765 U.S. adults between July 17 and 21, just days after the shooting took place. The survey was conducted online through a non-probability sample, with efforts made to balance demographics like age, race, gender, and geographic region. To further improve representativeness, the researchers applied post-stratification weights based on census and voting data.

Participants were first asked if they had heard about the Trump assassination attempt. Those who were aware of the incident were then asked where they had received their information—options included television, radio, newspapers, social media, news websites, podcasts, or from people they know. Respondents could select multiple sources. The researchers used this information to examine how different channels of communication were linked to awareness and belief in two specific conspiracy theories: one claiming that Democratic operatives orchestrated the shooting, and another alleging that the event was staged altogether.

To assess belief in the theories, participants who had heard them were asked how likely they thought each was to be true. Responses ranged from “very unlikely” to “very likely” on a five-point scale. The researchers also collected demographic data, political orientation, approval of Trump, general interest in politics, and a standard measure of conspiratorial thinking known as the American Conspiracy Thinking Scale.

Statistical analyses included logistic regression to determine predictors of exposure to conspiracy theories and linear regression to assess what factors were associated with belief.

Nearly all respondents (95%) reported being aware of the assassination attempt. The majority of those who were informed said they got their information from television (64%), followed by social media (43%), and personal contacts (30%).

Of those surveyed, 41% had heard the theory that Democratic operatives were behind the attack. Among this group, 53% had seen the claim on social media, 28% had seen it on television, and 32% had heard it from people they knew. Roughly 29% of those exposed to this theory believed it was likely to be true.

The second theory—that the event was staged—was even more widely circulated, with 53% of participants reporting they had encountered it. Of these, 52% saw it on social media, 34% heard it from personal contacts, and 21% saw it on television. About 29% of those who had heard this theory said they believed it was likely.

Social media appeared to be the main vector for initial exposure to both theories. However, when the researchers examined what influenced actual belief, a different picture emerged. People who heard the conspiracy theories through interpersonal networks were significantly more likely to believe them. This pattern held across both left-leaning and right-leaning narratives.

In contrast, social media use was not strongly linked to belief in the theories once exposure was accounted for. While it increased the likelihood of encountering conspiracy content, it did not appear to increase the chance that people would believe it. This finding runs counter to the often-repeated assumption that social media is the primary engine of conspiracy belief.

Other factors associated with belief included approval of Trump, political partisanship, and a higher score on the conspiratorial thinking scale. These variables tended to predict belief in expected ways. For instance, Republicans and Trump supporters were more likely to believe the Democratic operative theory, while Democrats were somewhat more open to the idea that the event was staged.

Notably, among all the information sources analyzed, interpersonal communication was the only one consistently and positively associated with belief in both conspiracy theories. Hearing about a conspiracy from someone personally known increased the perceived likelihood that the theory was true by 0.2 to 0.4 points on a 0–4 scale.

These findings indicate that conspiratorial thinking is not just a function of individual psychology or online media exposure, but also a social process embedded in everyday relationships. However, there are some limitations to consider. The survey used a non-probability sample, which may not fully represent the U.S. population despite statistical adjustments.

In addition, the study was observational, so it cannot determine causation. It remains unclear whether people adopt conspiracy beliefs because of their social networks or whether they seek out relationships with people who already share those beliefs. Longitudinal or experimental research would be needed to untangle these possibilities.

Future research could explore how strong or confident people are in their beliefs, not just whether they accept a theory. Another promising direction would be to examine the structure of conspiratorial social networks: are there particular patterns of relationship or communication styles that make belief more likely to take hold? Understanding these dynamics could help in designing more effective interventions aimed at reducing the social spread of misinformation.

The researchers also suggest that future studies should consider how interpersonal influence interacts with other media, such as algorithm-driven news feeds, and how conversations about conspiracy theories evolve over time.

The study, “Information from social ties predicts conspiracy beliefs: Evidence from the attempted assassination of Donald Trump,” was authored by Katherine Ognyanova, James N. Druckman, Jonathan Schulman, Matthew A. Baum, Roy H. Perlis, and David Lazer.

New findings indicate that conspiracy theories targeting foreign governments can significantly shape war-related beliefs. Across five studies, people exposed to these narratives expressed greater support for military action, less humanitarian concern, and stronger identification with aggressor nations.

A recent study tested whether people can be “inoculated” against misinformation by shifting how they think. The results suggest that boosting open-minded thinking through a simple message can reduce conspiracy beliefs and help individuals better separate truth from falsehood.

A massive 15-country study suggests that people who are highly sensitive to personal injustice are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories — including claims about climate change and vaccines — regardless of broader societal histories of conflict or oppression.

A new study suggests that believing in one conspiracy theory may slightly increase the likelihood of believing in others. The research offers rare causal evidence in support of the long-debated “rabbit hole” model of how conspiracy beliefs spread.

Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants.

Support for Donald Trump is linked to darker personality traits, including increased psychopathy and decreased empathy, new research finds. The study also connects conservative political beliefs to lower benevolence, suggesting personality may shape how people engage with politics and ideology.

In a rare example of psychological research predicting an election before it happened, a team of researchers used campaign language to anticipate Donald Trump's 2024 victory—and got it right.
