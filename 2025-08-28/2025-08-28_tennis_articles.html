                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters." Leylah Fernandez said that matter of factly, on the rooftop of the player clubhouse at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio during a casual conversation in early August. Less than a month later, in a scene she likely would not have predicted, she was sharing a court with her idol on Louis Armstrong Stadium in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans who were no doubt thrilled to have one more opportunity to see Venus play. The duo, which accepted a wild card into the US Open doubles draw on Tuesday, upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in their first-round matchup on an unseasonably windy day in Queens. (It was downright uncomfortable if you were dressed for summer, though the fired-up crowd hardly seemed to notice.) Towering over her partner -- a former US Open singles finalist and doubles quarterfinalist -- and looking at times like a big sister, the 45-year-old Williams earned her first win in three New York tries after bowing out in the revamped mixed doubles tournament last week and losing to Karolina Muchova on Monday. It looked bleak to start, with Williams and Fernandez falling behind 5-2 in the first set, but they rallied to even it at 5. "I have no idea what I was thinking during that tiebreak," Fernandez, who's into the third round in the singles draw, said with a laugh. So I just didn't want to think too much. ... No, I just wanted to go out there, play, and I had full confidence with Venus at the net and even in the baseline." The next set was far less dramatic, as the unseeded pair jumped out to a 4-1 lead and comfortably closed it out. They seemed to gel and complement each other more effectively as the match wore on, finding a rhythm that kept their opponents off balance and defensive. Communication was key in establishing that cadence. "I'm used to being the big sister," Williams told reporters after the match, "so I'm kind of asking her what she wants. Theoretically I have more experience, but she's been playing a lot more matches, so maybe that makes us neck and neck in terms of how we can compete. It was a full circle moment for the 22-year-old Fernandez, who remembers practicing with Venus outside of Lexington, Kentucky back in 2020. "I thought I was going to be very intimidated, but she was super nice and welcoming," Fernandez recalled during the Cincinnati Open. This was Williams' first doubles victory in Queens in 11 years, though she's certainly no stranger to doubles success at this venue. Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.</p>

From dazzling fans with her athletic brilliance to reshaping the business of sport as a tournament owner and entrepreneur, Billie Jean King has spent decades entertaining, empowering and elevating the game. Her legacy isn't just etched in her remarkable collection of tournament trophies; it's embedded in the DNA of women's tennis. This year's session, hosted by King in the US Open's Arthur Ashe building, brought together emerging WTA stars alongside impactful former players Ilana Kloss, Leslie Allen and Shelby Rogers to reflect, connect and ignite change. It calls on every WTA player to recognize their role in a global entertainment property, one that champions equality, unity, and advancement. Together, these courageous women created the Virginia Slims Circuit and laid the foundation for today's thriving Hologic WTA Tour. Now it's your turn to fight for the next generation.” Through storytelling, shared experiences, and candid conversations, the event reinforced that greatness isn't just measured in trophies, it's measured in impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach. NEW YORK -- There have been times this year when Naomi Osaka expressed frustration at her lack of progress after returning to tennis as a mother. But as the North American summer hard-court season sweeps to a conclusion, it's clear she again has that championship gleam in her eye. Thursday's 6-3, 6-1 win over Hailey Baptiste was a study in controlled aggression. Despite the swirling wind, the four-time Grand Slam champion was a composed, serene presence in Louis Armstrong Stadium. It's probably not a coincidence that since coach Tomasz Wiktorowski joined her team in Montreal, Osaka has won eight of nine matches. Asked on court what he's bringing to her game, Osaka dodged the question. “I can't give up my secrets,” she said, laughing. “But he definitely makes me see tennis in a different way -- and you can see it in the way I'm playing recently.” Osaka's signature strokes -- a powerful serve and a forehand to go with it -- still get most of the attention. She had seven aces (and no double faults) in her first-round victory over Greet Minnen. It's been a point of emphasis for Wiktorowski. “I feel like with Tomasz we've been working a lot on my returns,” Osaka told reporters, “and I feel more confident. Her return position appears to be slightly deeper -- she was about five feet off the baseline against Baptiste -- and “it's made me a lot more comfortable returning.” Osaka, who turned heads with her red-sparkle ensemble in the opening round, came out for her second match awash in purple from head to toe. After playing the first several games with her hair down, she quickly fashioned it into a bun -- and her game picked up noticeably. Against Hailey Baptiste, Naomi Osaka struck only when the moment demanded, a measured brand of shot-making that underscored her evolving approach.</p>

Without a title coming into the US Open, he admits confidence isn't quite as high but says he's leaning on his experience and preparation.“I think there's a game plan to beat anybody, I think everybody has some sort of weakness,” he said. “A lot of the top guys, they hide it really really well… But I feel like everyone does have a weakness.”“I just have to focus on myself, just have to focus on what I'm doing,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His talented opponent, Mattia Bellucci, tight for two sets, never showed what he can do.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 28, 2025 copy_link NEW YORK—It only took two games for the first sign of trouble to appear.Mattia Bellucci was serving at 0-1, 15-40 versus Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz, of course, knows that super-charged atmosphere well. At 30-40, he fired another serve, drew a short reply from Alcaraz, and moved in for the kill. It looked for a split second that he would get himself out of the jam, and get on the board early—always a plus for an Ashe rookie.But instead of knocking off that short forehand at the peak of its bounce, Bellucci waited for the ball to come down a bit. When Bellucci finally swung, he could no longer pound it straight down. He had to use topspin to get it over the net and back down in the court.

Carlos Alcaraz, to the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd Typically, a player in his position will lose the first set quickly, and then loosen up somewhere in the second, once he gets a couple holds under his belt. But he never loosened up in the second, and lost it 6-0.Playing on Ashe at night is one thing. Doing it against an in-form and not-nervous Alcaraz, who has been spotted an early lead, is another, much worse proposition. An opponent of his can normally count on him dropping his level, donating you a few wild errors, and maybe helping you to a break of serve. But that wasn't the Alcaraz we saw on Wednesday. He won 86 percent of his first-serve points, had 17 break points on Bellucci's serve, was 14 of 18 at net, and hit 32 winners while holding his opponent to 11.“I played great, to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” Alcaraz said after his 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 win.

Even in the third set, when he had finally relaxed and Alcaraz had lost a little focus, Bellucci couldn't keep the ball in long enough to create any scoreboard pressure.“I know Mattia's level, and today wasn't his day,” Alcaraz said, while apologizing to the crowd for not making the match last longer.“Sorry, I gotta do my job.” “I know Mattia's level, and today wasn't his day,” Alcaraz said, while apologizing to the crowd for not making the match last longer.“Sorry, I gotta do my job.” When he's feeling good, Bellucci has a wide repertoire of shots and superb touch. His run to the semis in Rotterdam earlier this year, where he beat Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, was memorable. He killed them with his jumping backhand drop shot.But I can only remember Bellucci daring to hit that shot once against Alcaraz on Wednesday. Bellucci lost to Alcaraz, but he lost first to Ashe.As for the winner, he moves on to the third round, and a date with another, higher-ranked Italian, Luciano Darderi.

You know, I just was doing my thing.“Honestly, laugh at it. I think that it's kind of funny, because to then go online and have to justify what you said, you obviously feel some type of way and feel like you have to give an explanation for how you acted. I think it was very self-explanatory. I'm standing in what I said.”Though she called this behavior part of Ostapenko's “MO,” Townsend said she bore no ill will against the former French Open champion after the match, the top-ranked doubles player dismissing the suggestion that Ostapenko be barred from competing in the doubles event as a result of the incident.

The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here sitting in front of you guys moving on to the next round, getting the next check, moving on, being able to still be here and speak to you guys, and that's what's the most important. Maybe that's why I was fired up. You know, to be able to watch the tension and watch things and to see how someone can handle themselves in the moment.
