                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. equity futures were little changed on Thursday evening, after the S&P 500 registered a fresh record driven by renewed optimism around the artificial intelligence trade. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 62 points, or 0.1%. Investors also parsed fresh corporate earnings in extended trading. Shares of Ulta Beauty advanced about 3% after hours following a strong full-year outlook, while Autodesk stock gained more than 10% thanks to better-than-expected guidance. Shares of Dell Technologies slipped 5% following a soft outlook for the current quarter. Earlier, the broad-based index set an all-time intraday high. The Dow's 45,636.90 finish was also a new record. Although Nvidia's earnings initially sparked some concern tied its data center business and only slightly better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter, the report helped lift peer chip stocks that initially pulled back. Nvidia stock ultimately ended the day down less than 1%. "I think if someone is trying to ring the bell at the top for AI, they're underestimating how quickly penetration grows. We're probably in the first quarter or first third of that cycle for AI," Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder and head of research Tom Lee told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Thursday. Investors will now turn their attention to fresh inflation data to cap off the final trading day of August with the personal consumption expenditures index. With all three major indexes at or near record highs, the gains for the month have been solid. The 30-stock Dow is up 0.01% week to date, but it has logged a 3.4% advance in August. The S&P 500 has tallied a 0.5% increase week to date, and is up 2.6% so far this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added about 1% this week, which has helped boost August's gain to 2.8%. Institiutional interest is shifting toward Solana this week as bitcoin and ether remain in their pullback. The move also pulls SOL's month-to-date gain (22%) above ETH's (20%). The token has been climbing since VanEck last Friday filed to launch a staked Solana ETF in partnership with the decentralized finance platform Jito. Adding to that momentum was a Bloomberg report earlier this week that Galaxy and Jump are seeking $1 billion for a SOL treasury vehicle. Check out some of the companies making headlines in extended trading. Stock futures were little changed on Thursday, after the S&P 500 hit a fresh intraday record during regular trading.

Crypto:

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission headquarters in Washington.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken a step that could make it easier for some overseas crypto exchanges to legally offer derivatives to American traders, a move that could reopen a path back into the US for firms like Binance Holdings Ltd.

The agency issued an advisory clarifying how foreign platforms can register as so-called foreign boards of trade, provided they are fully licensed to offer derivatives in regulatory regimes that the CFTC deems comparable to US levels of oversight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trade Desk has a target on its back — shaped like an Amazon logo. Earlier this month, The Trade Desk's stock cratered almost 40%, with analysts blaming intensifying competition from Amazon and uncertainty about whether Wall Street's once-favorite adtech darling could fight back. It was The Trade Desk's largest-ever one-day stock decline. But behind the scenes, Amazon's gut punch had been building for years. At that time, Amazon had already cemented itself as a major advertising player. A year earlier, it brought in $31 billion in ad revenue, behind only Google and Meta, as the third-biggest digital ad seller worldwide. Its ad business was fueled primarily by Amazon sellers jockeying for prime real estate as shoppers search Amazon.com for diapers and dog food. Beyond search, it brought ads to all corners of Amazon — from its delivery packaging to its "Thursday Night Football" telecasts and within its Whole Foods stores — attracting endemic (brands that sell on Amazon) and non-endemic advertisers alike. Amazon knew there was a bigger opportunity to apply its valuable trove of shopping data beyond its own walls to the wider internet of sites and platforms it doesn't own. But while the Amazon DSP had existed in some form for more than a decade, the tech was clunky, and it hadn't been a priority internally. Amazon made a raft of high-profile hires from companies like Google, Meta, and Roku. At its peak in 2024, The Trade Desk had a market cap of around $69 billion. It's now trading at around $25 billion, despite posting 19% year-on-year quarterly revenue growth. Meanwhile, Google's adtech business's growth has been hobbled by two recent antitrust rulings that could soon force it to divest assets like its Chrome browser and ad exchange or agree to other remedies. Current and former Amazon staffers, ad buyers, and other industry insiders said they think Amazon's quest for global DSP domination is only just getting underway. Once considered a sleeping giant of the ad business, Amazon's advertising services segment — of which the DSP plays a small role — accounted for its largest-ever share (9.36%) of the company's total revenue in its most recent quarter, and grew by 23% versus last year. "We see them gaining tremendous share in the adtech universe since few companies in the world can replicate their value proposition at this point," said Ashwin Navin, CEO of Samba TV, a TV analytics company. The Trade Desk didn't respond to requests for comment. Amazon began laying the groundwork for its big DSP play in 2021. Over 18 months, it hired key players who had helped build some of the most important architectural pieces in adtech history. The system was buggy, and there often weren't sufficient media quality controls, O'Kelley said. But over time, Amazon began to fix these, he added. Analysts at Lightshed Partners said this month that while it previously took brands upward of 75 clicks to set up a campaign within Amazon's DSP, it now takes just 4. It's a concept designed to speed up efficiency and ward off needless bureaucracy. But Amazon's new adtech brain trust found that this sometimes hindered the DSP. A big leap forward was Amazon's work to better link its DSP with Amazon Marketing Cloud, a move advertising insiders said began to take shape around 18 months ago. Launched for use by all advertisers in 2021, AMC is what's known as a data clean room. That means it connects the dots between Amazon's data and a brand's data to help give advertisers a clearer picture of how their campaigns are driving sales. Amazon Marketing Cloud can help filter that pool down to find people who have added a product to their cart but didn't purchase it, and identify new audiences based on an individual customer's data and the advertiser's campaign objectives. Amazon used to keep a low profile at major industry events like Cannes Lions, the big advertising schmoozefest held in the south of France each June. But it notably upped its presence over the past three years, building a massive "port" to host meetings, panels, and concerts to woo ad buyers. This year, the DSP team boasted big new partnerships with Roku and Disney. These allow advertisers to reach tens of millions of streaming TV viewers in the US, and use Amazon's data to target specific audiences and measure whether campaigns are driving sales. The deals bolstered Amazon's already solid position selling ads on smart TVs, which was kicked off by its decision last year to switch on ads by default for all Prime Video users. Morgan Stanley analysts predicted in July that Prime Video would overtake YouTube to become the leading seller of ads on smart TVs in the US by 2027. The fees Amazon charges advertisers to use its DSP are also turning heads. Amazon's DSP fees tend to fall between 4% and 8% on average, according to seven ad buyers and other insiders with direct knowledge. Fees can vary depending on how much a particular agency or advertiser is spending. "Clients and agencies are under significant amounts of pressure, and I think Amazon identifies an opportunity," said Rhys Williams, managing partner of the media agency The7Stars. While there isn't an available resource that denotes DSP market share, the advertising insiders interviewed for this article estimated that Amazon had quickly gained ground. "Amazon is not a competitor and Google really isn't much of a competitor anymore either," Green said on The Trade Desk's August earnings call. "We're trying to buy the open internet, leveraging technology that values media objectively. Advertisers are looking for adtech partners that can provide them with unique audiences and demonstrable results. O'Kelley said the rise of Amazon's rounded offering could force The Trade Desk to rethink that strategy, and perhaps consider acquiring media and data companies in order to better compete.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is fundraising off of checks from the government that he's unlikely to send. In recent months, Trump's political operation has sent several fundraising emails that mention either the "DOGE Dividend" or tariff rebate checks, both of which theoretically involve sending checks to some Americans worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. With tariff rebate checks, some of the revenue from tariffs would be sent primarily to lower-income Americans. And even if he did, Trump would have to seek approval from Congress, where Republicans are overwhelmingly against both ideas. That hasn't stopped the president's campaign from using both concepts — sometimes simultaneously — to solicit donations. "Should bonus revenue from tariffs go back to the American People VIA CHECK SIGNED BY TRUMP?" "My team tells me that gathering ONE MILLION RESPONSES TODAY is the best way to send these so-called "representatives" a message they won't be able to ignore." Trump's political operation has sent at least two other emails about tariff rebate checks this month. Before Thursday, Trump had most recently mentioned DOGE dividends in an early June email, with the subject line: "I've got a $5,000 question for you." "Would you take a DOGE dividend check signed by yours truly?," asks the email. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has not floated the DOGE checks idea since February, and DOGE has so far resulted in a much smaller cut to government spending than initially predicted. Meanwhile, the president said on Wednesday that while there's a "concept" of tariff rebate checks, he "primarily" wants to put additional revenue from tariffs toward paying down the debt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's artificial intelligence models to power AI features in its key products. The software company said Thursday that it's begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. The MAI-1-preview model is being tested on LMArena, a website where people can conduct evaluations. "We will be rolling MAI-1-preview out for certain text use cases within Copilot over the coming weeks to learn and improve from user feedback," Microsoft said in a blog post. The company has published a form where developers can request early access. Meanwhile, Microsoft remains a key backer of OpenAI and strategic partner to the AI startup that's now valued at about $500 billion. Microsoft draws on models from OpenAI to power features in Bing, the Windows 11 operating system and other products. But the companies are clearly moving into competition in various ways. Last year, Microsoft added OpenAI to the list of competitors in its annual report. It's a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week. Microsoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips. Microsoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi. Last year, Microsoft hired him and many of his Inflection colleagues. Suleyman's group inside Microsoft has been expanding, with about two dozen people coming from Google's DeepMind AI lab in recent months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against Donald Trump challenges his ability to remove her from office, but only briefly addresses the central accusations that she committed mortgage fraud. One part of the documents filed in the suit suggests that the issue at hand regarding documents Cook submitted for home loans may have been caused by a "clerical error" on her part and asserts that even if a mistake was made it does not rise to an offense that would justify removing her from office. The complaint mostly focuses on rules outlined in the Federal Reserve Act that state Fed officials can only be removed for "cause," a legally nebulous condition that may have to be determined by the Supreme Court. Cook maintains that the fraud allegations do not meet the standard and instead are subterfuge for Trump's efforts to stack the Fed Board of Governors in his favor so that he can get the interest rate cuts he has been demanding. "This allegation about conduct that predates Governor Cook's Senate confirmation has never been investigated, much less proven. This allegation is not grounds for removal under the" act. Trump and other officials, most notably Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have alleged that Cook provided false information about her primary residence when obtaining federally backed mortgages. The complaint said that even if Cook did make a mistake on the applications, it still wouldn't rise to cause. "Even if the President had been more careful in obscuring his real justification for targeting Governor Cook, the President's concocted basis for removal — the unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook 'potentially' erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation — does not amount to 'cause' within the meaning of the FRA and is unsupported by caselaw," stated the complaint from Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell. Moreover, the suit says that "the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional. In a statement to CNBC, Pulte noted that Cook did not attempt to refute the claims against her. "In her filing, Ms. Cook does not deny that these are her mortgage documents, so one has to wonder why she, or [Fed Chair] Jerome Powell, would want this to be a part of the Federal Reserve, which is supposed to have preeminent integrity and which is critical to the safety and soundness of the U.S. Mortgage Market," Pulte said in a statement to CNBC's Scott Wapner. However, avoiding the specifics in this type of case is far from unusual as doing so would give credence to the allegation, said Robert Hockett, a professor of law and public finance at Cornell Law School. "You don't want to play his game, or legitimize his game by playing it," Hockett said. "'I'm not surprised at all that the lawsuit wouldn't include paragraph after paragraph providing the details of her mortgage applications. Markets have been relatively unbothered by the battle between Cook and Trump, though that could change as the case escalates. "We have no privileged knowledge of the legal facts, but believe if it were established Cook committed even accidental mortgage misrepresentation, she would have to go," Guha said in a note earlier this week. If Trump is successful in removing Cook, it would give him a 4-3 edge on the board in terms of appointees should Stephen Miran get through Senate confirmation to fill an empty seat. That could be extended to 5-2 if Powell chooses not to fill out his term as governor after his run as head of the central bank expires in May 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pure Storage shares jumped 32% on Thursday and closed at a record after the data storage management vendor reported quarterly results that topped estimates and lifted its guidance for the year. In March, Pure announced it had secured an agreement with Meta to be the social media company's "key storage provider." That came three months after Pure teased a new contract with an unnamed "top four" AI hyperscaler. The deal was viewed as a huge win for Pure, as internet giants search for ways to meet their burgeoning storage needs due to artificial intelligence with greater cost and energy efficiency. The company had expected to deploy 1 to 2 exabytes with Meta by the end of the fiscal year, and said Wednesday that "we are now increasingly confident about the assumption," adding that it could go further. An exabyte is equal to 1 billion gigabytes. "Our relationship with Meta continues to advance," finance chief Tarek Robbiati, who was named to the post in June, said on the earnings call. Robbiati added that the company is seeing "increased interest from other hyperscalers" looking to replace their traditional storage with Pure's technology. For the second quarter, Pure reported revenue growth of 13% to $861 million, topping the $846.9 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents exceeded the 39-cent average analyst estimate. Pure CEO Charles Giancarlo, a former top executive at Cisco who joined the storage company in 2017, said on the earnings call that the rollout with Meta is "right on time and on target." And in an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" ahead of the call, Giancarlo said that while the company has been selling to the enterprise since its founding about 15 years ago, it's more recently been targeting the hyperscalers. "We believe that will continue to scale in the years ahead," he said, regarding the new business. Giancarlo said the key is Pure's ability to more efficiently manage space, power and cooling. "With power being at such a premium, the ability to use less power on storage and therefore be able to use more power for things such as AI becomes very, very interesting" he said. The stock had its third-best day on record in December, when it jumped 22% after the company announced, alongside earnings, that it had landed its first hyperscaler customer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A confidential internal document, and accounts from people familiar with the matter, reveal why. The company has flagged its unique pay structure, lagging AI reputation, and rigid return-to-office rules as major hurdles. Amazon's absence from recent splashy AI hires underscores those concerns. Meta has pulled in high-profile talent from ScaleAI, Apple, and OpenAI. Google and OpenAI continue to be top destinations for AI experts, while Microsoft has even drafted a wish list of Meta AI employees it hopes to recruit. Amazon's spokesperson initially told BI that the company continues to "adapt our approach to remain highly competitive, maintaining flexibility in both our compensation packages and work arrangements to attract and retain the best AI talent in this dynamic market." Our compensation is competitive, but we also want missionaries who are passionate about inventing things that will make a meaningful difference for customers — for those kinds of people, there's no better place in the world to build." One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos still using door desks today. This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation. Amazon's "egalitarian philosophy" on pay leaves its offers "below par" compared with top rivals, it added. For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is limited, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field. Indeed, Amazon has yet to find a blockbuster AI product like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, although its Bedrock AI cloud service has made progress. Amazon's pay structure has been a long-standing source of tension. Several people who spoke to Business Insider cited the 2020 departure of Amazon robotics VP Brad Porter as evidence of the company's frugal approach hampering talent recruitment and retention. Porter left in part after Amazon refused to raise his pay band. Amazon's stock vesting schedule is also heavily backloaded, a structure that can be less attractive to new hires. The policy extends even to top executives, who generally receive no cash bonuses. An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling. "Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave," Reyes said. "Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet." On Amazon's earnings call last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pressed CEO Andy Jassy on Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI and fears of losing market share to rivals. Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call. According to the document, the company will refine its "compensation and location strategy" and host more events designed to highlight its generative AI capabilities. Another point of contention is Amazon's aggressive return-to-office mandate, which has already caused logistical issues. Amazon is exploring ways to allow for more "location-flexible" roles, the document added. Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company is "always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations." Last year, it brought on Adept CEO David Luan as part of a licensing deal with the AI startup. But the company has also seen departures, including senior AI leaders like chip designer Rami Sinno and VP Vasi Philomin, who worked on Bedrock. One Amazon recruiter told Business Insider that a growing number of job candidates started declining offers last year because of the company's RTO policy. "We are losing out on talent," this person added. Indeed, Bloomberg reported recently that Oracle has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past two years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier. Still, multiple people familiar with the situation told Business Insider there haven't been any formal updates to internal pay guidelines. One current Amazon manager said it remains almost impossible for the company to enact sweeping changes, given its long track record of sticking to the existing system. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters. "Based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from changing an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades," Amazon wrote this year about executive compensation in its annual proxy statement. Some of the high-profile recruits Meta recently lured have already departed.</p>
