                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's artificial intelligence models to power AI features in its key products. The software company said Thursday that it's begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. The MAI-1-preview model is being tested on LMArena, a website where people can conduct evaluations. "We will be rolling MAI-1-preview out for certain text use cases within Copilot over the coming weeks to learn and improve from user feedback," Microsoft said in a blog post. The company has published a form where developers can request early access. Meanwhile, Microsoft remains a key backer of OpenAI and strategic partner to the AI startup that's now valued at about $500 billion. Microsoft draws on models from OpenAI to power features in Bing, the Windows 11 operating system and other products. But the companies are clearly moving into competition in various ways. Last year, Microsoft added OpenAI to the list of competitors in its annual report. It's a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week. Microsoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips. Microsoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi. Last year, Microsoft hired him and many of his Inflection colleagues. Suleyman's group inside Microsoft has been expanding, with about two dozen people coming from Google's DeepMind AI lab in recent months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill's efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike's corporate staff. It's unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike's EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill's efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women's, men's and kid's as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike's innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a "small number" of staff will depart as a result of the shifts. Staff will learn if they're impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. "To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader," the memo said. Since taking the helm of the world's largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that's now starting to materialize. "Instead of a men's, women's and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve," said Hill. Hill said the company would organize into "sport-obsessed teams" which would "drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union formally proposed Thursday to remove tariffs on American industrial goods, fulfilling a key element of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement and ensuring that lower automobile tariffs will be retroactive to the beginning of August. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement that the removal of duties on industrial goods, along with providing "preferential market access" for some U.S. seafood and agricultural goods, would "ensure tariff relief by the US for the vital EU automotive sector starting retroactively from 1st of August." "These steps contribute to restoring stability and predictability in EU-US trade and investment relations, to the benefit of business, workers and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic," it added. The proposal, which now needs to be approved by the European Parliament and Council, was first outlined last week in a joint statement from the two trade partners. The U.S. and EU announced they had reached a trade deal — after weeks of tense negotiations — at the end of July. U.S. President Donald Trump said the deal would see a 15% tariff imposed on most European goods to the U.S., including cars. The rate came as a relief to the United States' largest trading partner after Trump previously threatened it with duties of 30%. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The traditional approach to investing in the energy sector going back decades has often come down to making sure a portfolio has exposure to the "majors" — integrated oil and gas stocks like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have also paid reliable dividends. There are times when it hasn't worked well in recent history — such as during the peak existential fears over the past decade about an oil industry on the way out as a global source of power — but it has done reasonably well since that panic ended. But this year, even as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and energy stocks as a category have produced positive returns, they have not been the big winners for investors playing the energy theme of the future, according to Paul Baiocchi, head of fund sales and strategy at SS&C ALPS Advisors. He pointed to year-to-date outflows among investors in XLE of roughly $7 billion, the largest and most liquid energy market ETF. Some of that may be related to fears that the global economy will slump as a result of President Trump's trade war, and as oil prices remain under pressure, the shares of oil and gas stocks will face greater headwinds. But it's also a sign of a broader change in how investors think about ways to gain energy exposure. "It speaks to the fact that advisors and investors are starting to think about energy more in terms of power than just crude oil and natural gas," Baiocchi said on this week's CNBC "ETF Edge." His firm has long offered a way to play a more concentrated bet within the broader energy sector, led by its 15 year-old Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which focuses on energy infrastructure such as pipelines and has seen net inflows this year. Some of Trump's policy priorities play into this trend as well, including support for U.S. artificial intelligence development in a new tech arms race against China, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and the promotion of nuclear power. Jack Clark, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, said at a recent summit where big tech companies met with energy leaders that it estimates 50 gigawatts of new power is needed by 2027, equivalent to about 50 nuclear reactors. While XLE has seen outflows this year, its utilities sector comp the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has seen inflows near $3 billion and has tripled the performance of XLE, up roughly 12% this year versus 4% for the broader energy sector. According to Malcolm Dorson of Global X ETFs, who appeared alongside Baiocchi on "ETF Edge," the investor thinking on energy is changing as power generation becomes central to "all the technologies of tomorrow" and a huge surge in demand begins. "Not only AI, but electric vehicles and large factories, and the big picture is that the U.S. is sort of not ready for all of this," Dorson said. Global X has launched an ETF focused on the theme, the Global X U.S. Electrification ETF (ZAP). "The U.S. needs to produce about 45% more electricity than it produces today by 2040, after almost two decades of stagnant demand," he said. And that demand will also mean higher prices paid by electricity consumers, which are expected to continue to outpace general inflation in the years ahead, as they have since 2022. Electricity prices have nearly doubled the inflation rate for all goods and services in 2025, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026. The ETF experts also weighed in on the impressive performance run for international stocks in 2025, sleeper markets like Argentina and Greece, whether it's time to take some profits, and where to place overseas bets next.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels. Correction, Wednesday, August 27 — An earlier version of this post incorrectly presented previous remarks from Nvidia's Q1 analyst call as being said on the Q2 call — those quotes have been removed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walgreens on Thursday named retail veteran Mike Motz as its chief executive officer after the U.S. pharmacy chain was taken private by Sycamore Partners, marking a fresh chapter for the company that has been struggling to keep pace with rivals. Motz, previously the CEO of office supplies chain Staples' U.S. retail business, will succeed Tim Wentworth and steer the ailing pharmacy operator as it shifts its focus back on core retail and pharmacy operations. He had also worked as the president of Canadian pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart. Walgreens has struggled to expand beyond its pharmacy business and diversify into broader healthcare services, even as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turned to lower-cost options from Amazon and Walmart for their prescriptions and toiletries. Wentworth, who took the helm in 2023, spearheaded a turnaround at the company through cost cuts, including the removal of multiple mid-level executives and store closures. Wentworth will continue to serve as a director, Walgreens said. The company also appointed John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a senior adviser to Sycamore, as executive chairman. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global popstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce are officially engaged — with a large diamond ring to prove it. In the photos of their social media post appears a hard-to-miss diamond on Swift's finger, a style that's known as an old mine brilliant cut, Tree Paine, Swift's publicist, told The Associated Press. The ring was designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry in New York City. "It looks to be upwards of 10 carats, and it might be a vintage stone given the cut," Paul Zimnisky, a New York-based diamond industry analyst, said via email. Jared Jewelers told CNBC through a written statement that the ring could cost approximately $250,000 to $500,000. It's "a lot of speculation at this point," she said. While Swift's ring was designed for her, it wouldn't be unusual to see replicas or similar styles appear across the market, said Zimnisky. (The trend-setting Swift's engagement moved several stocks this week, including names related to jewelry and apparel, amid fan interest in her ring and engagement dress.) A comparable diamond, meanwhile, may be harder to come by. Old mine diamonds have a "distinct elongated shape with curved edges" and go back to the time when diamonds were cut, shaped and polished by hand, according to Sarah Hanlon, celebrity and entertainment editor of The Knot, a bridal site. What's more, the larger carat weight a stone is, the rarer and more expensive it's likely to be, Gizzi said, "especially when we're talking about natural diamonds versus a lab-grown." According to Zimnisky, lab-grown diamonds can be found for almost 90% less than the cost of a natural diamond. However, experts say the elongated style of the singer's ring has already been popping up among engaged couples — or as a song by Swift goes, "It's been a long time coming." "This style is very much on trend for what we've started to see, which is elongated cuts like hers, as well as a return to natural diamonds and then also this idea of antique cuts," Gizzi said. In fact, elongated shapes like marquise have been selling for a premium this year due to high demand, said Zimnisky. Couples inspired by Swift's ring can find more affordable versions with less expensive gemstones, said Zimnisky. While old mine diamonds are rare and can be more costly, diamond shapes like cushions, emeralds and Asschers are easier to come by, said The Knot's Hanlon. Couples can also look into the vintage jewelry market, experts say. "There's no wrong way to go about it," said Gizzi. "The inspiration is definitely something that can be found in different price points." When shopping for engagement rings, start off by defining your budget. While costs can range widely, the average couple spent $5,200 on an engagement ring, according to The Knot's 2024 Jewelry and Engagement study. Instead of rules of thumb like spending "three months' salary," your budget should come down to what you're looking for in a ring, experts say. Lab-grown diamonds will no longer follow the same rules. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. economy grew at a pace that was faster than expected in the second quarter as consumers and businesses held up against tariff volatility. Gross domestic product rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the April-through-June period, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its second estimate for the most encompassing measure of economic activity. The reading was better than an initial 3.0% estimate as well as the 3.1% Dow Jones consensus forecast. Consumer spending, which rose by 1.6% compared with an initial 1.4% estimate, helped push the number higher. Importantly, a measure called final sales to private domestic purchasers jumped 1.9%, up from the previous figure of 1.2%. Federal Reserve officials watch that metric closely as an indication of demand and sales that focuses on activity within U.S. borders, an especially important measure considering the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Imports, which subtract from GDP, tumbled 29.8% in the quarter after companies stockpiled ahead of Trump's April 2 "liberation day" announcement. At the same time, exports, which add to GDP, fell by 1.3%, compared with the previous estimate of -1.8%. For the first half of the year, GDP has grown about 2.1%, or an average of a little more than 1% per quarter. "The good news is consumption came in higher than previously thought. Americans are continuing to spend despite the tariffs and uncertainty, albeit at a slower pace than past years," said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. "Going forward, the economy is likely to stay in this slower speed mode with spending and growth around 1.5% as the tariffs become more visible to American consumers." Inflation-related estimates were little changed from the initial reading. Core personal consumption expenditures prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5%, unchanged from the prior figure, while the headline PCE price index edged lower to 2%, in line with the Fed's inflation goal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hello, this is Spriha Srivastava, CNBC International's Executive Editor for Digital, writing from London. This week, I take a closer look at India's tightrope walk — tariffs from Washington, oil from Moscow, and an uneasy handshake with Beijing. Picture this: you're at a dinner party with three friends who are struggling to get along. One is picking fights with everyone, another is slipping you secret notes under the table, and the third is that old frenemy you'd rather avoid but can't ignore. Washington is piling on tariffs, Moscow is keeping India's energy bills in check with cheap oil, and Beijing, despite a bruised relationship, is preparing to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi with open arms at the SCO summit in China this week. Washington has imposed a 25% reciprocal tariff on imports from India, followed by another 25% penalty tied to India's Russian oil purchases. The U.S. is India's single largest export market, worth about $87 billion a year, nearly a fifth of its total merchandise trade. Key Indian sectors such as diamonds, garments and seafood are especially exposed. Think of what that means on the ground. On a number of fronts, the U.S. and India are cooperating; the two countries are expanding defense cooperation, for instance, working together in the Quad, and advancing semiconductor supply chain talks. Yet trade frictions complicate the relationship, raising the question in Delhi: does Washington view India as a true partner, or simply another trading problem to manage? In 2021, just 1% of India's crude came from Russia. Today it's more than 35%, around 1.75 million barrels a day, saving Delhi over $17 billion since early 2022, according to analyst estimates. Those discounts have kept inflation in check and given Modi breathing space at home. India is walking a geopolitical tightrope, with Pakistan tensions threatening to boil over. In that context, Russia is a vital security partner and central to India's defense procurement, making it difficult for Delhi to pull away without weakening its security posture. U.S. officials including Peter Navarro and Scott Bessent argue Delhi is "profiteering" by paying above the G7's $60 price cap on Russian oil and exporting refined fuels back to Europe. Then comes Beijing, which represents perhaps the trickiest relationship of all. Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and stand alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Beijing says the event is a display of solidarity, tensions between India and China remain unresolved. Since then, India has banned hundreds of Chinese apps, tightened foreign investment rules, and promoted self-reliance in key sectors. Yet trade between the two countries still hit $118 billion last year, with India importing far more than it exports. This imbalance frustrates Delhi but also underscores why cutting ties is not realistic. Analysts say Modi is unlikely to secure a major breakthrough when he visits Tianjin. But showing up is a signal in itself — that India is willing to keep lines of communication open, even while deepening defense ties with Washington and buying cheap oil from Moscow. Russia keeps the lights on, but at a political cost. China is the rival next door, yet too big to ignore. It has worked for decades, but today the balancing act is under more pressure than ever. Which brings us back to that dinner party. India wants all three guests to remain seated, however awkward the conversation may be. The real test is whether Modi can stop someone from banging the table, throwing down their fork, and storming out. Richard Rossow, Senior Adviser and Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said that a deal between the U.S. and India is "still very much possible" as the South Asian country puts forth substantial sweeteners. Arnab Mitra, India consumer analyst at Goldman Sachs, said there could be a mass consumption revival in India driven by rural demand and upcoming GST reforms. Meera Shankar, former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said India will not be able to entirely open up its agricultural sector because of domestic political sensitivities. Trade negotiations between India and the U.S. still ongoing. India's Foreign Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that India has "some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended." India and Russia reaffirm plans to boost bilateral trade. The two countries have vowed to expand their trade ties in a move indicating that U.S. President Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil are unlikely to impact their partnership. Raghuram Rajan said that Trump's hefty tariffs send New Delhi a clear "wake-up call" to reduce its dependence on a single trading partner. He added that it is now important for India to "ask who benefits and who is hurt." People on the street are looking at China and comparing it to India. People who have been away from the Chinese markets think it's time to move back. But, I do think this is a relatively short-term thinking. Indian markets fell Thursday, after a holiday the day before. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield fell to 6.58%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A confidential internal document, and accounts from people familiar with the matter, reveal why. The company has flagged its unique pay structure, lagging AI reputation, and rigid return-to-office rules as major hurdles. Amazon's absence from recent splashy AI hires underscores those concerns. Meta has pulled in high-profile talent from ScaleAI, Apple, and OpenAI. Google and OpenAI continue to be top destinations for AI experts, while Microsoft has even drafted a wish list of Meta AI employees it hopes to recruit. Amazon's spokesperson initially told BI that the company continues to "adapt our approach to remain highly competitive, maintaining flexibility in both our compensation packages and work arrangements to attract and retain the best AI talent in this dynamic market." Our compensation is competitive, but we also want missionaries who are passionate about inventing things that will make a meaningful difference for customers — for those kinds of people, there's no better place in the world to build." One of its origin stories recounts how the company bought cheap doors from Home Depot and hacked them together as office desks. This became guiding symbol of Amazon's cautious spending, with founder Jeff Bezos still using door desks today. This penny-pinching culture has smashed straight into an AI hiring battle that's being fueled by unprecedented spending, putting Amazon in a tricky situation. Amazon's "egalitarian philosophy" on pay leaves its offers "below par" compared with top rivals, it added. For Amazon, missing out on top AI talent is a potential risk. ​​The pool of top-tier AI researchers and engineers is limited, and without experts with deep knowhow, it's hard to compete at the frontier of the field. Indeed, Amazon has yet to find a blockbuster AI product like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, although its Bedrock AI cloud service has made progress. Amazon's pay structure has been a long-standing source of tension. Several people who spoke to Business Insider cited the 2020 departure of Amazon robotics VP Brad Porter as evidence of the company's frugal approach hampering talent recruitment and retention. Porter left in part after Amazon refused to raise his pay band. Amazon's stock vesting schedule is also heavily backloaded, a structure that can be less attractive to new hires. The policy extends even to top executives, who generally receive no cash bonuses. An August report from venture capital firm SignalFire shows Amazon is on the lower end of engineering retention, far below Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Jarod Reyes, SignalFire's head of developer community, told Business Insider that Amazon rivals are making bigger strides in AI, across open models, foundational research, and developer tooling. "Amazon hasn't clearly positioned itself as a leader in the generative AI wave," Reyes said. "Engineers are paying attention and they're voting with their feet." On Amazon's earnings call last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak pressed CEO Andy Jassy on Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI and fears of losing market share to rivals. Jassy's response fell flat, sending Amazon's stock lower during the call. According to the document, the company will refine its "compensation and location strategy" and host more events designed to highlight its generative AI capabilities. Another point of contention is Amazon's aggressive return-to-office mandate, which has already caused logistical issues. Amazon is exploring ways to allow for more "location-flexible" roles, the document added. Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the company is "always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations." Last year, it brought on Adept CEO David Luan as part of a licensing deal with the AI startup. But the company has also seen departures, including senior AI leaders like chip designer Rami Sinno and VP Vasi Philomin, who worked on Bedrock. One Amazon recruiter told Business Insider that a growing number of job candidates started declining offers last year because of the company's RTO policy. "We are losing out on talent," this person added. Indeed, Bloomberg reported recently that Oracle has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past two years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier. Still, multiple people familiar with the situation told Business Insider there haven't been any formal updates to internal pay guidelines. One current Amazon manager said it remains almost impossible for the company to enact sweeping changes, given its long track record of sticking to the existing system. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters. "Based on how we run our business and what we have achieved, there are more risks than potential benefits from changing an approach that has been so successful for our shareholders over the past several decades," Amazon wrote this year about executive compensation in its annual proxy statement. Some of the high-profile recruits Meta recently lured have already departed.</p>
