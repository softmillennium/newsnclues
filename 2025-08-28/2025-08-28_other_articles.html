                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One night in 1957, Antônio Vilas Boas was plowing his field in rural Brazil when he saw mysterious red lights flying through the sky. Since that fateful night in 1957, several thousand more alien encounters have been reported, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, a research foundation based in Washington state. But are aliens actually abducting hundreds of humans each year, or even at all? Experts suggest there might be a simpler explanation—one that lies on the operating table. Accidental awareness is a complication where anesthesia patients wake up while they're really supposed to be unconscious. Most patients don't experience pain during accidental awareness, but may retain memories of the operating theater, according to the Royal College of Anesthetists, a UK-based professional organization. If a patient became aware during surgery, they would likely see bright lights, figures standing over them, and experience feelings of being out of control. So why doesn't everyone who experiences accidental awareness believe they were abducted by aliens? Memories can be instant or delayed, and sometimes they're even triggered by life events not related to the surgery itself. Cole also says there's a chance the trauma from accidental awareness could manifest as delusions. “This area is not well understood,” Cole says in an email. “But it is possible that intraoperative awareness could result in dissociative phenomena and false memories.” Another expert, Benjamin Radford—paranormal investigator, author, and research fellow—says that, in some cases, remembering medical procedures could “absolutely” lead someone to believe they were abducted by aliens. However, he points out that the theory fails to explain why some people who have never undergone surgery may still believe they were abducted. Radford suggests a much more obvious culprit—one that is affecting most of our lives everyday, whether or not we even realize it. “I think that the more likely explanation, at least for many of these, is drawing on pop culture experiences and pop culture depictions,” says Radford, who is also deputy editor at the Skeptical Inquirer, a publication that uses reason to examine controversial and extraordinary claims. He points to medical dramas as possible fodder for false memories of alien abductions because the genre is popular and something most people have seen at some point or another. Radford explains that, while viewers may not be consciously memorizing technical medical terms, after watching enough of the shows, they'll eventually get a general sense of what a medical procedure could look like. With this in mind, he says “it's not surprising” that alleged abduction victims would elicit similar details when recounting their experiences. Professional skeptic and contributor at the Skeptical Inquirer, Daniel Reed, explains that perception is key. While most are able to imagine a pink animal with large ears, the picture that appears in your mind is ultimately unique to you; the same goes for our perception of events. He also says the strong feelings witnesses confess align with his own experiences, as he's allegedly seen several unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in his lifetime. “People are profoundly moved by their sightings, oftentimes,” Davenport says. “And you can hear it in their voice, even when they describe a sighting that occurred 50 years ago. Christian Stepien, chief technology officer for NUFORC, emphasized in an email that the Center does not believe alien encounters are a manifestation of medical trauma, but rather true anomalous experiences. So, was the extraterrestrial encounter a matter of mere coincidence? And in that case, was the story that spurred his account in fact derived from another person's experience on the operating table? It seems only Boas—and the aliens who supposedly abducted him—will ever know. Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BARBERTON, Ohio – Community members are invited to a paranormal investigation of Barberton's historic West Theatre on Aug. 30 from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. Experienced investigators from Haunted Havens, a paranormal investigation company, will lead the tour. A Portage Lakes resident and Wadsworth High School graduate, Pitz founded Haunted Havens last year. During her childhood, she felt a connection to the supernatural world, but her parents didn't want to hear about it, she told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. A ghost tour of Savannah, Georgia, that Pitz went on about 10 years ago rekindled her interest. After taking additional tours in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and other places in the South, she decided to open her own company to lead paranormal tours at various locations in Ohio. “I take people who want to go on ghost tours but don't know where to start, or people who don't know where to go, or don't have friends to go with them, because their friends aren't into that sort of thing. Tour equipment includes dowsing rods (an ancient tool used to detect water), and REM rods and K2 EMF readers, which detect electrical activity, according to Pitz. “I just want more people to understand that if you are curious about paranormal activity, you don't just have to watch shows on TV, you can get hands-on, too. I'm trying to make that link between those types of people, because I was that person,” Pitz said. The tour is open to novice and experienced investigators. West Theatre opened in August of 1947 at 1017 Wooster Road, according to the Barberton Historical Society. It showed second-run movies until its closure in 2008.

Guests will also receive tickets to Rock Candy Tours' Macon Macabre Walking Tour. “This team has had so much fun exploring the most requested sites in Macon for legends and lore in our video series,” Genzel said. Moving to Macon sparked my passion for exploring the city's haunted sites and interacting with its supernatural inhabitants.” Ghost Hunt Event Only — Friday, October 3, beginning at 6 p.m. Tickets are $45 and include the cocktail reception, guided paranormal investigation, an event T-shirt and the walking tour. Packages include a two-night stay at Burke Mansion with breakfast, parking, a themed gift basket, a VIP meet-and-greet, the walking tour and access to the ghost hunt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an exclusive excerpt from a new book about their 25 years working together, see how the lawman and medium found trust in each other If this guy was legit, he should be able to tell the difference between what belonged to Fran and what didn't, right? I was still sitting on a fence of extremes when it came to this psychic. Part of me still thought he was a fraud, and the lawman in me wanted to take him down. I even researched reasons to arrest him. And yet, my stubborn heart wanted to believe he was the real deal. We arrived at his office in Long Island as a family was leaving. The mother threw her arms around him and hugged tight. I could feel my anger rising. This guy was taking advantage of a grieving family. The young man — he had a boyish face, brown hair, and glasses — approached me. He was not what I expected. From the voice on the radio, I imagined an older man with a grand, theatrical, presence. This guy was younger than me, humble and unassuming. He looked like someone's kid brother. He looked like goddamn Harry Potter. Thanks for seeing us,” I said, introducing Dansman. You're not FBI,” John said to Dansman. “You're right, I'm not,” said Dansman. He shot me an I-told-you-so look. Okay, one point for the psychic. But what else will he know? I was prepared for this to be a bust. “My assistant tells me you need help with a case,” John began. “The first thing I need to say is that if I end up helping you, it must stay private between us. “That's not a problem,” I told him. Have either of you worked with a psychic before?” “A few times, in other cases.” “Let me explain how I work. The information comes to me from my spirit guides in three different ways: clairvoyance, clairaudience and clairsentience. I will interpret what I'm seeing, hearing and feeling using my own frame of reference, and hopefully you'll understand it. “Some of the information you might understand right away. It could make sense to you later.” We took out our notebooks and pens, ready to go. “I'll get people above you, to your side, and below you,” John continued, “meaning older, the same age, and younger. And one more thing, he emphasized. “Do not give me any information or try to steer me in any direction. “Before we begin, do you have any questions?” Nothing personal, but I don't like to get involved with law enforcement. We were on the same page. Though I could see slight disappointment on Dansman's face. Dansman pulled the items from a bag and placed them on John's desk. John closed his eyes, took a deep breath, cupped his palms together and focused on them. After a minute, he reached over and moved the “control” items — bracelet, mirror, watch, necklace — from the group and put them in a pile to the side. He figured it out right away.

Dansman and I glanced at each other. John returned his focus to Fran's items and picked up her eyeglasses. He looked up, almost past us, as if he was staring at someone behind us. She looks older than her actual age. She has two names like Mary Anne, Barbara Anne ... but people called her by her second name ... ​there's an F sound like Fern or Fran ... wait. Dansman's eyes were locked on Edward. “She was vain about her appearance. She had breast implants — they're showing me serial numbers on them — and dyed blond hair. She wore a lot of makeup. I smell cigarette smoke and strong perfume, like when a person tries to cover up the smoke scent with a lot of perfume. I feel a strong pain in the back of my head. Was she struck in the head? She didn't see it coming. Weird,” John said, still looking beyond us. And a second S name, very common, like ... ​Smith.” “After she was hit in the head, the J-S name — let's call him ‘Smith' — strangled her to make sure she was dead. Not like a bloodbath or anything. I sat back in my chair, stunned. I looked over at Dansman, who was equally shocked. I barely had time to register the horror he described when another rush of information came. “He was much younger than her,” John continued. She thought there was another woman. But not in the same state where they were living." They were upstairs, on a third floor if not higher. She confronted him about a bunch of things, not just one issue. It feels like a whole bunch of different things. Smith was lying to her and she knew it. She called him out on it. He felt like his worlds were crashing together.” “Man, this guy has major control issues. He needs to be in control. Whatever she did or said, she was taking that control away from him, and he didn't like it.” “The woman, F name — Fran — was fed up and demanded Smith take her somewhere. He was lying to her about so many things. Like I said, she was calling him out an all his lies.” John kept getting hit after hit, like a pinball whacking against the bells in a machine. But not only was John confirming details we already knew, he was giving information we didn't know — details that made sense, information that rang true that we could follow up on. Like, ‘Don't worry, Honey, I'll show you everything is okay.' I see them walking out of an apartment building or condo. It's in the daytime, not at night. Wait, other people saw them leaving — a couple who live in the same building. It feels like they were walking in as she and Smith were leaving ... Oh.” But the timing doesn't line up. It's like he kills her on a Saturday but you guys don't know she's missing until a week later.” “So, he, Smith, helps this woman, Fran, to the car. He's taking her to this place ... ​it feels right off a major highway. And he was nervous and pissed off, because he knew she was about to expose his lie. “So, whatever this place is, it has an industrial feel to it, like metal and steel, blacktop, concrete ... ​I hear the highway. It's near a major highway with lots of traffic. “Like a public storage unit?” I asked. Again, Dansman and I exchanged a glance. Smith had that public storage facility in New Brunswick, N.J., where Fran's furniture was supposed to be. I see him pointing to a door and drawing her attention away from what he was about to do. Hartford Courant/MCT/ABACAPRESS.COM; New Haven Police via Getty John's eyes darted around, as if he was watching it happen. “For her it was in an instant,” he said. Then, instantaneously, he pulls her inside whatever this thing is, this garage unit, and closes the door so nobody can see what's happening.” John paused, as if trying to process the deluge of images. He said not to steer him in a direction, but he didn't say not to ask questions. “What did he do with her body?” “She's not in one piece,” he said. “He dismembered her and put the pieces in something. “What do you mean?” I asked. I keep seeing cylinders ... ​I'm not sure what this is. Whatever he put her in, it's got no smell and it's somewhere no one would suspect there was a body ... ​or pieces of a body.” Her body is in these cylinders but also in something to keep her preserved, like fluid ... ​or concrete.” Smith worked at an industrial company called Carborundum, which produced refractory, heat-resistant concrete blocks. “You know when you see a new development being built, and they have these huge concrete ... ​I don't know what you call them ... storm drains?” John asked. I was hanging on his every word. He looked thoughtfully at whatever invisible presence was behind us. But it's not going to be easy,” he said. “And it won't be anytime soon.” From CHASING EVIL, by John Edward and Robert Hilland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Porepunkah, Australia — Australian police said Thursday they will not rest until they catch a 56-year-old gunman who fled into the bush two days earlier after allegedly killing two officers. The suspect, identified by police as Dezi Freeman, escaped on foot after opening fire when a team of 10 police arrived at his property on Tuesday, allegedly killing two policemen and wounding a third. Police say the man — described by local media as a radicalized conspiracy theorist — is heavily armed, has bush survival skills and knows the area well. "We will not rest until we apprehend the offender," said Russell Barrett, Victoria police deputy commissioner for regional operations. Police were in contact with the man's partner, had searched a number of properties, and believed he was still in the area, Barrett said. But "we've had no confirmed sightings," he told a news conference. Anyone harboring the man would be prosecuted for committing a criminal offense, Barrett warned. Police said they were moving carefully through the bush, and warned people not to travel into the surrounding alpine area to go skiing. It is complex terrain," Victoria police superintendent Brett Kahan said. Police say the shooting happened in a matter of minutes when they descended on the man's property on Tuesday morning to execute a search warrant. Police fired at the suspect but apparently did not wound him, they said. Police say the wounded officer has undergone surgery and is expected to recover. Australia's The Age newspaper said Freeman was a self-professed "sovereign citizen," referring to a movement whose adherents falsely believe they are not subject to laws passed by the government. Deadly shootings are relatively rare in Australia, and police fatalities even rarer. In December 2022, four police arrived at a tree-lined property near small Queensland town of Wieambilla and came under fire from the family living there. Six people were killed in that incident, including two police officers. Police later blamed the family's fundamentalist Christian beliefs for what was termed a terrorist attack. Then-newly-elected Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative and close friend of George W. Bush, pushed through the sweeping gun control legislation just 12 days after the shooting. "The hardest things to do in politics often involve taking away rights and privileges from your own supporters," Howard CBS News' Seth Doane in a 2022 interview, looking back at the landmark legislation. Australia's government confiscated and destroyed close to 700,000 firearms, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder?'"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every week that passes, a new scandal emerges. One of the latest "victims" is the controversial Justice Minister, Mariano Cúneo Libarona, who appeared on a hidden camera offering his influence to Tim Ballard, another contentious character. Ballard, a former Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security's Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce has led multiple anti-child trafficking NGOs over the years, some of which he's been expelled from accused of sexual misconduct and irregular donation procurement. In the leaked video, Minister Cúneo Libarona tells Ballard that after watching the film "Sound of Freedom," where Hollywood star Jim Caviezel plays Ballard embarking on a dangerous mission to the Colombian jungle to rescue captive children, he was inspired to write a legal project that he wishes to send to Congress. He goes on to tell Ballard he will help him "clear up that misunderstanding that occurred in our country." It wasn't immediately clear what misunderstanding Cúneo Libarona was speaking of, but Ballard's name became a feature in mainstream Argentine media earlier this year when television gossip star Viviana Canosa promised to come out with serious accusations of sexual abuse and even pedophilia against several colleagues including Florencia Peña and Lizy Tagliani. She indicated that Ballard had given her information about child-trafficking, forcing the former Special Agent to admit having meeting her, but denying they ever spoke about these issues. The opposition has called for Minister Cúneo Libaron's head, indicating he is colluding with a foreigner who is also an interested party in passing purported legislation, adding that he is an interested party. Even within the ranks of the Javier Milei administration, Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has called Ballard a fraudster with multiple accusations against him. Why would someone with the political backing of President Milei and the power of a Security Minister agree to a meeting with Ballard, and then go on to incriminate himself so directly? According to Perfil's Giselle Leclerq, the former Special Agent was part of the CPAC summit held in February where both Milei and Trump were in attendance. National deputy Esteban Paulón says that Ballard was introduced to Milei by Laura Belén Arrieta, the infamous single passenger of the private jet owned by Leondro Scatturice who entered the country with ten pieces of undeclared luggage. Arrieta, one of the organizers of CPAC's Latin American chapter, is employed by Scatturice, who has close ties with Argentina's intelligence agencies and Santiago Caputo, the controversial political aide to President Milei who runs Cúneo Libarona's Ministry through his deputy, Sebastián Amerio. Back to Bullard, his anti-child trafficking work crossed paths with the wild conspiracy theories associated with QAnon, which has a solid belief base among the ranks of the right wing-conservative MAGA movement, as Leclerq noted. As the investigation was underway a man who claimed to be a member of multiple US security agencies and who was known as "the American" was arrested after trying to get involved with the case. His real name is Nicolás Gabriel Soria and he said he had worked with Ballard, something the latter denied. As Leclerq reported, a lawyer for two of Bullard's sexual abuse accusers noted that Soria had been brainwashed to believe he was helping to battle in the front lines of the battle against child-trafficking by Aerial Recovery, one of the NGOs Ballard worked with. He was part of a program aimed at helping war veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who received some basic training and then become "loyal mercenaries sent to 'work' across the globe." Soria "got involved in the case thinking he was a child trafficking expert because he was given some sort of certification and he truly believes the whole [QAnon] Rodrigo Tripolone, the attorney, suggests that Ballard has a fraudulent modus operandi: in order to feed his image as a "pedophile hunter" he presents himself as an expert, cozies up to local authorities, and then tags along in domestic police operations to gain credibility. For whatever it's worth, Ballard's video with Minister Cúneo Libarona adds another spot to the tiger. A recent investigation showed that Scatturice's technology firm, OCP Tech, received a $78-million government contract for maintaining Wi-Fi connections in schools. Along the same lines, B class characters like Hayden Mark Davis, Julian Peh, along with local connections Mauricio Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy got President Milei to participate in a meme coin rugpull scam that is now under investigation by the US judiciary. Furthermore, Karina Milei's political task force, a company named Tech Security, owned by the family of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Martín Menem and advisor Eduardo "Lule" Menem, received a contract worth four billion pesos from government-owned Banco Nación. Together, all of these and other "operations" or coordinated information leaks destined to harm political opponents indicate that the traditional method of doing politics in Argentina is alive and well, and it includes illegal espionage. This piece was originally published in the Buenos Aires Times, Argentina's only English-language newspaper.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report from a crowdsourced UFO-sighting app found that among the hundreds of reports of unidentified metallic orbs between 2022 and 2025, the majority were spotted in the dead of night near military installations in California, New York and Arizona. Enigma, which allows users to report their own UFO sightings, logged more than 8,000 reports in the U.S. between Dec. 2022 and June 2025, according to the report. Twenty-one of these cases were classified as unresolved sightings. Of the 422 metallic orbs reportedly spotted by Enigma users, 360 of them were seen near military bases such as Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base in California. "While classic disc-shaped UFOs dominated mid-20th century sightings, orb-shaped UAP have emerged as one of the most frequently reported modern phenomena on Enigma," the report said. "Often spotted at high altitudes near sensitive infrastructure, these orbs are described as hovering silently or darting across the sky at seemingly impossible speeds." They are frequently observed in restricted airspace, near nuclear facilities, and have even been tracked on radar or captured by high-resolution infrared systems," the report added. According to Enigma, former head of the AARO Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick presented a video of one such metallic sphere flying over the Middle East. Trump says FBI on scene as 'up to 100 shots heard' in Minneapolis church school shooting Active shooter dead after opening fire on Minneapolis church as '20 targeted' A common theory about the metallic orbs paints them as surveillance devices, whether deployed by terrestrial governments or by "non-human intelligences," the Enigma report said. "Some skeptics argue metallic orbs may be misunderstood weather balloons, optical illusions, or rare atmospheric conditions (like ball lightning)," the report admits. "And others maintain that they are a psychological manifestation, projected by the human mind during altered states or high-stress moments."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 19-year-old Chinese man barely survived the worst four months of his life after being seduced and then sold into slavery by his 17-year-old girlfriend. Chinese media recently reported the shocking case of a young man from Zhanjiang, in China's Guangdong province, who endured four months of captivity and torture at the hands of a scam ring in Myanmar, after being lured into a trap by his teenage girlfriend. The victim's sister claims the two met at a local pool hall where the 17-year-old girl hung out in revealing outfits and wore counterfeit designer handbags to project an aura of wealth. On their way back, while approaching the Thailand-Myanmar border, the 17-year-old girl made up a story about having to pick someone up close by and simply abandoned her boyfriend in the middle of nowhere. Shortly after, a group of armed men approched him, took all his documents and his mobile phone before taking him to a secret compund. “My brother told me people with guns had taken him away,” the teen's sister recalled, adding that this was all he was able to text her before his phone was taken away. The 19-year-old Chinese man was taken to a secluded camp, his head was shaved, and he was forced to sit in front of a computer for 16 – 20 hours a day, carrying out scams against his fellow countrymen. If he failed to reach his daily quotas or if his efforts didn't bear fruit, the young man faced severe physical punishment, including being hit with metal rods over his back and head. During his captivity, the 19-year-old victim lost over 10 kilograms due to food deprivation, and due to the repeated beatings, he suffered permanent hearing loss. However, because he turned out to be extremely bad at scamming people, his captors decided he wasn't going to make them any money that way, so they decided to contact his family and ask for a ransom. As for his treacherous girlfriend, she was arrested after returning to China following a ten-day vacation in Thailand and now faces charges for her involvement in the victim's abduction by the Myanmar scam ring. Who would have thought she could do something so evil?” the victim's sister told reporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The entire first season of Charmed existed before I was even born, and it finished airing as I was learning how to add and subtract. Like similar paranormal shows — Supernatural, Lost Girl, Grimm — the sisters fight a new baddie in each episode, which generally leads to season finale clashes with increasingly powerful forces of evil. As I come off my sixth re-watch of the series, (that's more than 800 hours), I've realized that it's become a comfort in some of my hardest times. Between its fully fleshed-out characters and interesting villains, seasons consisting of 20 or more hourlong episodes, and behind-the-scenes drama that encapsulates early 2000s pop culture, Charmed is like a long, warm hug to me. Honestly, I think it's the best TV show ever made. Charmed finds strength as a series in its characters. Rather than a group of one-dimensional witches focused solely on the craft, creator Constance M. Burge gives each of the sisters their own hopes and dreams beyond their duties as the Charmed Ones. She's regarded as the strongest and is rigid in that eldest sibling kind of way (there's an entire episode where her sisters try to get Prue to say "I love you" to them). Though it's an indication of Piper's character growth, it's also a clever way to add killer musical acts such as The Cranberries, Dishwalla, Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Navarro, to name a few, to the show. However, Phoebe's power of premonition and later, her skills as an empath, quickly adds a level of maturity to her character. After Prue abruptly and unceremoniously dies in the Season 3 finale — in 2023, Doherty finally confirmed that she left the show due to drama between her and Milano on set — we meet the fourth Halliwell sister, Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). While posing as the sisters' handyman, he and Piper begin to fall for each other. Phoebe's first love interest, Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), turns out to be a half-demon who wants to turn her evil. And unlike some shows that absolutely fumble at the end (looking at you, Game of Thrones), the show's final season wraps everything up in this perfect little bow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They hover for some time and then dash away within seconds. Metallic orb-like unidentified flying objects have swarmed the skies over military installations in New York, California, and Arizona. People have reported seeing thousands of mysterious things that can't be explained in the past two and a half years. The majority of them were seen between 1 and 4 am, and almost all of them were hovering over a site linked to the US military. This has once again ignited rumours about these places hiding something, a secret being kept from not just Americans, but the entire world. What strengthens the argument that these objects could have been from another world is that even military personnel said they saw them. Civilians and pilots also said they saw UFOs. Enigma data shows that 360 metallic orbs were seen within a few miles of military bases in the US. In three of these cases, the orbs were seen multiple times within a distance of five miles from Fort Hamilton in New York, Papago Military Reserve in Arizona, and Los Angeles Air Force Base. The description of what these orbs do is also almost similar - they hover silently over an area, and then bolt at extreme speeds without leaving any smoke or ice trail. A lot of these sightings are accompanied by videos. This has piled up a lot of work for the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which was made to find explanations for these sightings. Viral video claims Buga Sphere is responding to Sanskrit mantras Eyewitnesses reported the maximum number of orbs in Texas and Florida. Government officials believe that they could be advanced drones that can dash from a place within seconds, an NYT report stated. Meanwhile, some even think that they could be surveillance devices sent by Russia and China. The Buga Sphere, which was captured from Colombia, has been generating a lot of buzz. A video clip on X even suggests that it is responding to Sanskrit shlokas and chants. Anamica Singh is a versatile writer and editor who has more than 16 years of experience in the field.
