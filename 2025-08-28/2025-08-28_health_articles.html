                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Sukhvinder Singh, a research scientist in the laboratory of Dr. Ashok Kumar, professor of ophthalmology, visual and anatomical sciences at Wayne State University's School of Medicine, has been awarded the grant, "Harnessing Immunometabolism to Ameliorate the Pathology of Ocular Chemical Injuries," to support innovative studies into developing novel therapies to enhance corneal nerve repair and promote wound healing after ocular chemical injury - a pressing issue among military personnel exposed to harmful substances in combat and training environments. Ocular chemical injuries can lead to chronic inflammation, corneal nerve damage, persistent pain, dry eye and even permanent vision loss. Unfortunately, current treatment options are often inadequate, offering only partial relief and sometimes leading to undesirable side effects." Singh's research aims to overcome these challenges by investigating the therapeutic potential of host-derived metabolites to reduce inflammation, promote corneal nerve regeneration and enhance wound healing. "This project will serve as a proof of concept for leveraging endogenous metabolites to modulate immune responses and lessen disease severity following chemical injury," Singh explained. The study employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating immunometabolism, cell biology and advanced drug delivery technologies. Compared to conventional eye drops, hydrogels provide sustained release, improved bioavailability and reduced dosing frequency - crucial advantages in field conditions with limited access to medical care. "Department of Defense funding for health-related research is critical to ensure the health and welfare of our country's service members," said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "I look forward to seeing the results of this important research by Drs. Singh and Kumar, which aims to create novel treatment options that will be useful not only to those in the military, but others facing similar ocular injuries."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Current treatment relies mainly on supportive care and surgical intervention, with a lack of effective drugs to directly target the underlying damage. For example, neural stem cell (NSC)-based therapy has shown therapeutic potential, but pathological microenvironments negatively impact NSC survival and directed differentiation, compromising therapeutic outcomes. Similarly, antioxidant treatment has limited success because most antioxidants don't efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Now, however, researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in cooperation with Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, have developed a novel exosome-based therapeutic agent for treating traumatic CNS injuries. This treatment can alleviate neuronal apoptosis, restore glial homeostasis, and remodel glia-neuron networks, offering potent therapeutic benefits in murine (mouse) TBI and SCI models. Understanding that NSC therapy involves cell-to-cell communication via exosomes-nanosized vesicles secreted by cells, including NSCs-the researchers proposed using NSC-derived exosomes (NExo) to treat CNS injury, since the exosomes are stable and remain medically active in the pathological microenvironment. The researchers also understood that exosome-based therapy needed to address oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microenvironment. Inspired by selenium's capacity to scavenge ROS, the researchers developed an advanced NExo containing ultrasmall nano-selenium (~3.5 nm) via lipid-mediated nucleation (SeNExo). Through proteomics, miRNA omics, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, the researchers demonstrated that SeNExo significantly downregulated the expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis in neurons. In addition, SeNExo profoundly altered the transcriptional program of inflammatory responses, promoting glial cells toward homeostasis. Moreover, SeNExo enhanced neuron-glia ligand-receptor pairs involved in CNS development while suppressing those associated with inflammation and astrogliosis. In a mouse SCI model, SeNExo also promoted locomotor recovery. Both Prof. TAN Hui from Shenzhen Children's Hospital and LI Weiping from Shenzhen Second People's Hospital support the concept that SeNExo is a novel and promising therapeutic agent for treating traumatic CNS injury. One peer reviewer from Cell Report Medicine said that the study provides convincing evidence that SeNExo can protect the brain following TBI and potentially SCI. He also noted that its potent therapeutic efficacy and safety highlight its promising translational potential for developing clinically relevant CNS injury treatments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turbidity refers to the cloudiness or haziness of water, caused by suspended particles including clay, silt, organic matter, rust, and other fine debris. These particles scatter and absorb light, which affects water quality. While turbidity may not be harmful in itself, it is a warning sign of contamination that can disrupt disinfection, damage aquatic ecosystems, and impede filtration systems. Photometric methods, including colorimetric and spectrophotometric techniques, assess water quality by analyzing how light interacts with a sample. However, turbidity can have a considerable impact on the accuracy of these assessments by: Several approaches can reduce the impact on photometric analysis: MACHEREY-NAGEL provides devices to overcome turbidity challenges in photometric water analysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their extensive use has left a lasting mark on both the environment and public health. The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Environment Agency (EA) are reviewing PFAs risks to guide REACH UK on potential updates to chemical safety laws. Ensuring the safety of our food remains a fundamental public health priority. Experts say wider quality and safety checks are needed on more food products as shifting industrial processes alter environmental conditions. Since the 1960s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized some PFAs in food packaging for their non-stick, grease-proof, and water-resistant properties. The highest PFA concentrations are often found in molded fiber packaging such as takeaway bowls, plates, and food boxes. In this regard, a useful Application Note for Method C-010.02 has been published. The updated C-010.02 method offers a fast, reliable way to measure PFAs in foods from dairy to baked goods, eggs, and vegetables.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tired of the limits that come with purchasing conventional reference materials from stock catalogs? Many chemists avoid the tedious process entirely, instead mixing their own analytical standards in-house. However, this approach adds extra workload and considerable risk. Custom certified reference materials (CRMs) from Inorganic Ventures are a simpler and faster approach to obtain the appropriate analytical standard reference material for your unique use case. Inorganic Ventures always encourages its clients to share the responsibility for establishing calibration standards. Allow Inorganic Ventures to handle the burden of creating custom analytical standards depending on your specific requirements. This saves time and removes the risks of blending standards by hand. Not sure that custom CRMs outperform analytical standards mixed in-house? Here are six reasons why you should trust Inorganic Ventures to create calibration solutions for your workflow rather than blending them yourself. Combining single-element analytical standards into a viable solution requires both resources and time. These costs mount quickly into a significant ongoing expense. Its CRMs are ready for instant use without any additional preparation, and each standard can be diluted directly from the bottle. When creating your own calibration standards, you are always responsible for providing verification. This requires a high level of confidence and organization. An audit can turn this into a high-pressure test of record-keeping. To err is human, and even experienced scientists make mistakes. When mixing analytical standards in-house, you will inevitably second-guess the validity of your data. Unfortunately, there is no margin for error in the analytical sector. Mixing errors, whether in amounts, matrix composition, or other factors, can quickly undermine accuracy. Common human errors that can jeopardize DIY standards include: Transpiration can progressively raise the concentration of your analytical standards over time. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this phenomenon when combining your own working standards in-house, as it is caused by water vapor penetration into the mixture, either through container walls or through the opening. Inorganic Ventures' proprietary packaging technology minimizes transpiration, preserving CRM integrity for years. Analytical standards packaged in this manner keep their integrity for up to four years after manufacturing. The time and expense savings associated with regular inventory refilling are completely removed, thus alleviating your storage worries. It is possible to reproduce these stringent cleaning conditions in your own lab, but this is just another example of the work and cost implications of mixing calibration standards oneself. Simple mistakes, such as going over volume, will necessitate boiling the concentrate, usually in glass, which may introduce more pollutants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite advances in insulin therapy and automated delivery systems, people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) still face a daily struggle: manually dosing insulin before meals. Current insulin options - rapid-acting or ultra-rapid analogs - are too slow to match the body's natural insulin response, making full automation elusive. Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, is developing a next-generation ultra-rapid insulin designed to dramatically accelerate insulin action and remove the need for user input at mealtime. When combined with advanced insulin delivery algorithms, this could make fully automated systems a reality and help patients manage their condition with fewer interruptions to daily life." Dr. Zhiqiang Cao, professor of chemical engineering and materials science, Wayne State University Since joining Wayne State in 2013, Cao has received more than $6 million in external funding for diabetes-related research, including multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health and Breakthrough T1D. Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State, praised the project's potential and the university's role in advancing human health through translational research. "Type 1 diabetes affects millions of individuals and families, often beginning in childhood," said Obasi. Dr. Ali Abolmaali, dean of the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, said Cao's work exemplifies the college's commitment to solving real-world health challenges. "This project is a testament to how engineering research can directly improve lives," said Abolmaali.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although modern colonoscopy has greatly improved the early detection of precancerous lesions, determining which ones are likely to become cancerous remains a challenge-especially during the procedure itself. A team led by researchers at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal tested an advanced imaging method that uses the natural glow (or autofluorescence) of tissues when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. Importantly, this approach doesn't require any dyes or contrast agents. By analyzing how long this autofluorescence lasts-called "fluorescence lifetime"-the researchers could detect subtle differences in the tissue's biochemistry. Combined with machine learning, this label-free method could distinguish benign from malignant lesions in real time. The researchers collected fresh tissue samples from 117 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. They scanned each specimen using a fiber-optic probe and a dual-laser autofluorescence lifetime system, which illuminated the tissue at two different wavelengths (375 nm and 445 nm) to excite various molecules like collagen and cellular coenzymes. This setup captured data from multiple optical channels, tracking how each type of tissue responded to the light over time. Using an ensemble learning technique known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), the model was trained to recognize patterns in the spectroscopic data that correspond to benign or cancerous tissue. In practical terms, this means the system was able to identify cancerous tissues with high reliability based only on their autofluorescence signatures. Even when applied to individual measurement points-rather than larger tissue regions-the model generated useful probability maps that highlighted tumor areas. These findings suggest that the technology could one day guide doctors during colonoscopy or surgery, helping them decide which lesions to remove and where to focus their attention. Although more work is needed to improve accuracy, especially for early or borderline lesions, and to expand testing to larger and more diverse patient groups, this research marks an important step toward integrating real-time, AI-guided optical diagnostics into routine colorectal cancer care. It could eventually help reduce unnecessary biopsies, shorten procedures, and ensure that dangerous lesions aren't missed. Lagarto, J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition with significant health implications worldwide. In Nigeria, data on its prevalence and characteristics are limited, highlighting the need for comprehensive studies to better understand its epidemiology and clinical features in the region. This study aimed to assess the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and management challenges of IBD among patients undergoing colonoscopy in Nigeria. Over five years (2019–2024), a multicenter, cross-sectional survey was conducted involving clinicians across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. Data collection was conducted in two phases via Google Forms, focusing on care practices and detailed case information, including demographics, clinical features, histology, and treatment. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and tests for associations, with significance set at p < 0.05. A total of 459 suspected IBD cases (9.7%) were identified among over 4,700 colonoscopies, with histological confirmation in 208 cases (4.4%), indicating the prevalence of IBD in the Nigerian patient population. Regional variations were observed, with higher diagnosis rates in some zones (North-West: 14.9%; South-East: 1.4%). Endoscopic findings frequently showed pan-colitis (62%), with significant regional differences (p < 0.001), and management mainly involved medications such as acetylsalicylic acid derivatives (60.0%), with surgical options rarely employed (0.6%). Challenges included high medication costs and limited availability, which affected nearly half of the patients (49.4%; 46.2%). The findings of this multicenter survey illuminate the pressing issues surrounding IBD in Nigeria, drawing attention to its prevalence, complex clinical presentations, and significant management challenges. The data reveal critical similarities and differences compared to findings in West Africa, other regions of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Demographic trends indicate a younger population affected by IBD in Nigeria, consistent with regional observations. However, disparities in clinical presentations, treatment modalities, and barriers to care highlight broader challenges within the Nigerian healthcare system that warrant urgent attention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Food allergies affect more than half a billion people worldwide. In severe cases, even a small bite of the wrong food can trigger anaphylaxis - a rapid, body-wide allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing, a dangerous drop in blood pressure and even death. Scientists have long understood how injected allergens - like those in lab tests or insect stings - trigger anaphylaxis. But researchers have puzzled over how anaphylaxis begins in the gut after eating a food allergen. Now, Arizona State University researchers, in collaboration with a team led by Yale University and other partners, have pinpointed a surprising culprit: specialized immune cells in the intestine that produce powerful chemical messengers. They're already known to play a role in asthma attacks. This study shows they are also key drivers of severe food allergy reactions that start in the gut. Our study shows that when allergens are ingested, a specialized set of mast cells in the gut don't release histamine - instead, they produce lipid-based molecules called leukotrienes. These molecules, rather than histamine, trigger anaphylaxis in the gastrointestinal tract." Florsheim is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes and assistant professor with the School of Life Sciences at ASU. When these cells detect an allergen via antibodies called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, they burst open, releasing chemicals that cause swelling, low blood pressure and other symptoms. In the bloodstream, the most important of these chemicals is histamine, which is why antihistamines can help in some allergic situations. Instead, they ramp up production of cysteinyl leukotrienes, a family of inflammatory lipids already known to constrict airways in conditions like asthma. These cues shift the cells' activity, so they make more leukotrienes and less histamine. Detailed genetic and chemical analyses showed that intestinal mast cells come in several subtypes. Compared to mast cells elsewhere in the body, mast cells in the gut were primed to make leukotrienes. Previous research found that blocking the IgE pathway - either by removing IgE antibodies or the receptor they bind to on mast cells - protected against developing severe symptoms. The results showed the drug reduced allergy symptoms and provided protection from a dangerous drop in body temperature - a hallmark of anaphylaxis. That finding showed that the gut pathway is different from the whole-body allergic pathway and has its own chemical drivers. Current emergency treatments for severe allergic reactions, such as epinephrine, are aimed at quickly reversing symptoms once anaphylaxis starts. Antihistamines can help in mild reactions, but they are far less effective for preventing severe events - especially those triggered by food. However, drugs that block leukotriene production (like zileuton) or leukotriene receptors (such as montelukast, also commonly used for asthma) are already approved for other uses, which could speed up testing for food allergy applications. "This finding highlights the gut as unique in how it senses allergens and potentially other harmful environmental challenges, such as food additives," Florsheim says. "It also helps explain a long-standing puzzle: why levels of food-specific antibodies, especially IgE, do not reliably predict the risk of food allergy." The researchers plan to follow up by studying whether similar mast cell populations and leukotriene-driven pathways exist in human intestines, and whether blocking them can reduce or prevent severe reactions in people with life-threatening food allergies. Intestinal mast cell–derived leukotrienes mediate the anaphylactic response to ingested antigens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For women diagnosed with early breast cancer, the long-term risk of developing a second primary cancer is low (around 2-3% greater than women in the general population), finds a study published by The BMJ today. The researchers say this information can help reassure many breast cancer survivors who believe their risk of a second primary cancer is much higher than these results suggest. Breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers, but risk estimates from previous studies are inconsistent. The risk and type of a second cancer can also be affected by the initial treatment received, as well as social, lifestyle and genetic factors. Their findings are based on 476,373 women diagnosed in England from 1993 to 2016 with early invasive breast cancer at ages 20-75 years who underwent surgery. Over a follow-up period of up to 20 years, 64,747 women developed a second primary cancer, but the absolute excess risks compared with risks in the general population were small. By 20 years, 13.6% of women had developed a non-breast cancer (mainly womb, lung or bowel cancer), 2.1% more than expected in the general population, and 5.6% had developed a contralateral breast cancer (on the other side of the body), 3.1% more than expected. When patients were grouped by age at first breast cancer diagnosis, the excess risk of a second non-breast cancer varied little across age groups. For a woman diagnosed when aged 40, her estimated risks of developing a second cancer by the age of 60 are 6% for both non-breast and contralateral breast cancer compared to 4% and 2% respectively for women in the general population. Based on these results, the researchers estimate that around 7% of excess second cancers may be due to the use of adjuvant therapies, but note that their benefits outweigh this small risk in almost all circumstances where these treatments are recommended. The authors acknowledge that their findings may be affected by incomplete cancer registry data for some variables. What's more, they did not have information on family history, genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices such as smoking. However, this long-term study describes the development of second cancers according to multiple patient, tumour and treatment characteristics amongst all women with early invasive breast cancer so the findings can reliably inform breast cancer patients and the clinicians who treat and support them. They are also relevant to clinical practice and policy, and may help inform the design of future studies to assess cancer risk. These results are reassuring and should be shared widely, say patients in a linked opinion article, who note that finding detailed information on the risks of second cancers after breast cancer was particularly difficult. Such information should be available and offered by clinicians at the time that adjuvant therapies are discussed. McGale, P., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators at Mass General Brigham and the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Center for Outcomes Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have uncovered how patients' healthcare spending has changed following the implementation of the No Surprises Act in 2022, a bipartisan law prohibiting unexpected or "surprise" bills after patients receive out-of-network medical care. "One in five insured adults in the U.S. incurred surprise bills before the No Surprises Act, and these bills frequently exceeded thousands of dollars, resulting in substantial financial hardship among patients," said lead author Michael Liu, MD, MPhil, a clinical fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system and research fellow at the Smith Center. Liu and his colleagues analyzed data on 17,351 adults aged 19-64 years with direct-purchase private insurance. Some resided in intervention states that gained protections from the No Surprises Act and others resided in control states that already had laws providing comprehensive surprise billing protections and therefore did not gain additional protections from the law. Although experts initially projected that premium spending (fixed monthly payments to insurance companies) would decline because the law was supposed to promote fair payment negotiations between insurers and providers, the researchers observed that such spending was unchanged after the law. "This finding is in line with anecdotal reports that providers-especially those backed by private equity firms-are leveraging loopholes and unfair tactics to secure higher payments at the expense of patients and the healthcare system," said Liu. Importantly, the No Surprises Act did not meaningfully reduce high burden medical spending, defined as a family spending more than 10% of their income on health care, suggesting that opportunities remain to build upon the law and pursue additional policy strategies to reduce healthcare-related financial strain, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

Over time, this binge–purge cycle harms both physical and mental health of the individual, leading to problems like dehydration, low blood pressure, depression, and even self-harm. BN mostly affects young women and often begins in their teenage years, with studies showing that up to three percent of women may experience BN at some point in their lives, putting them at higher risk if left untreated. BN is thought to develop from harmful learned habits that can be changed with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, for many people, especially those living far away from specialist clinics, accessing face-to-face therapy is not always easy or even possible. Now, in the first study of its kind conducted in Asia, an international team of researchers have shown that CBT can also be effective when delivered online. Their findings suggest that guided internet-based CBT (ICBT) can help people who otherwise struggle to get specialist care. "We undertook this study to lower barriers to accessing specialist care and help create a society where people can receive high-quality treatment regardless of where they live. By establishing a specialist online therapy that can be delivered at home, even patients in remote areas or with busy schedules will find it easier to continue treatment, supporting early intervention and preventing progression to more severe forms," explains Dr. Hamatani as she speaks of the motivation behind the study. To this end, they recruited 61 women between the age of 13–65 years (average age: 28 years), who were randomly assigned either to an intervention group that received guided ICBT or to a control group that continued with usual care. The program lasted 12 weeks, during which participants in the ICBT group worked through weekly online modules adapted for Japanese patients and received support from a therapist through an online platform. When the researchers compared the results at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention, they found that women in the ICBT group showed significantly reduced binge eating and compensatory behaviors compared to those in the usual care group, with an average decrease of about 10 episodes in total. Participants also reported feeling more satisfied with the online program, with more than 75% stating they would return to this treatment program if they needed help again. These findings strongly make the case for continued support as essential for treating BN and preventing the condition from becoming more severe. "With insurance support and integration into healthcare systems, this approach could reach many more people and play a key role in treating BN," highlights Dr. Hamatani. Developing a system based on this study could potentially lead to high-quality care, promoting equitable mental healthcare and improving the overall quality-of-life among patients with BN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel, multi-analyte test developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, its Ludwig Center and the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurosurgery can accurately identify brain cancers using small samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a promising new tool to guide clinical decision-making. The findings, supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, were published Aug. 25 in Cancer Discovery and demonstrate that combining multiple biological markers, including tumor-derived DNA and immune cell signatures, is more effective for diagnosing central nervous system cancers than using any one marker alone. "This study highlights how much more information we can gain when we evaluate several analytes together," says senior study author Chetan Bettegowda, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Cushing Professor and Director of the Department of Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, director of the Reza Khatib Brain Tumor Research Center at Johns Hopkins, medical director of the Ludwig Center, and a senior author on the study. To evaluate the potential of a multi-analyte approach, investigators analyzed 206 CSF samples, including samples from patients with high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, metastases and central nervous system lymphomas. In combination, these markers identified brain cancers with more than 80% sensitivity (ability to detect cancer) and 100% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer-free) in the validation cohort. The 100% specificity means no false positives were recorded among individuals with noncancerous conditions. Investigators say this ability to categorize T and B cell populations in the CSF provides insights into both disease presence and immune response. Many patients with brain lesions face invasive diagnostic procedures to confirm a cancer diagnosis. A tool like this could help us make better-informed decisions about who really needs a biopsy and who doesn't." Christopher Douville, M.D., assistant professor of oncology and senior study author The multi-analyte approach, they say, enables clinicians to better detect cancer and better understand the disease status, supporting a more tailored approach to patient care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists in Australia are launching one of the most comprehensive trials to date to test whether ditching plastics in food, personal care, and household products can lower internal chemical loads and improve markers of cardiometabolic health. Protocol: Randomised controlled trial of a low plastic diet and lifestyle intervention for adults with cardiometabolic risk factors: the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial – a protocol. In a recent public health protocol published in BMJ Open, researchers describe the PERTH (Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health) trial, a new randomized controlled study protocol designed to investigate whether a comprehensive, 4-week "low-plastic" diet and lifestyle intervention can reduce exposure to plastic-derived chemicals. These chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors with documented links to obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The PERTH trial examines whether a cohort of 60 adults with cardiometabolic risk factors, provided with all-plastic-free food, cookware, and personal care products, can demonstrate measurable reductions in plastic-associated chemical excretion and exploratory changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers. Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, plastics from food packaging, kitchen utensils, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies can be found everywhere and comprise an inescapable part of modern life. Alarmingly, in addition to their ecological and environmental impacts, a growing body of scientific literature reports extensive physiological concerns associated with them. Two classes of chemicals commonly used in plastics: 1. bisphenols (like Bisphenol A [BPA]) and 2. phthalates (like diethyl phthalate [DEP]) are known endocrine disruptors. Observational research has linked higher exposure to these “plastic-associated chemicals (PACs)” with various adverse physiological outcomes, including obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Clinical evidence suggests these outcomes substantially increase individuals' risk and severity of cardiometabolic disease. Unfortunately, whether actively and drastically reducing PAC exposure can reverse previous harm remains to be investigated through controlled intervention studies. The present public health protocol details the proposed methodology of the Plastic Exposure Reduction Transforms Health (PERTH) trial, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of a low-plastic lifestyle intervention on measurable health outcomes in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors. The study will involve 60 community-dwelling adults (aged 18–60 years) in Perth, Australia, who have established cardiometabolic risk factors. The intervention period will last four weeks, during which time the intervention cohort participants will receive a comprehensive, all-inclusive low-plastic lifestyle package. Delivering all food and beverages in plastic-free packaging, 2. Replacement plastic-free kitchenware (e.g., stainless steel pots, glass containers), 3. Interventional group participants will receive detailed instructions on how to minimize plastic exposure in their daily lives. In contrast, the control group will be asked to maintain their routine lifestyle and dietary patterns. Study outcomes will be measured by evaluating the change in a composite z-score of urinary bisphenol concentrations (BPA and BPS) between participants in the intervention and control groups. Participants will also collect their own stool and nasal lavage samples to support exploratory analyses. Impressively, pilot trials have already revealed that BPA was detectable in over 91% of urine samples derived from healthy (no cardiometabolic disease) adults, confirming that PAC exposure is widespread in Australia. These pilots further demonstrated that a 7-day low-plastic intervention could significantly reduce urinary PAC levels, providing a strong basis for this larger, longer trial. Notably, while laboratory staff will be blinded to participant allocation, both participants and investigators cannot be blinded due to the nature of the intervention. Finally, the PERTH study leverages the Plastic-Associated Chemical-exposure Questionnaire (PACeQ) to meticulously track and assess all potential routes of plastic exposure (ingestion, inhalation, and absorption), ensuring robust and trustworthy results. The PERTH trial is a critically important study that will provide the first protocolised attempt to test the causal effects of whether a comprehensive reduction in exposure to everyday plastic chemicals can lead to exploratory improvements in cardiometabolic health markers. Study outcomes have the potential to significantly impact public health guidelines, inform regulatory policy on the use of chemicals in consumer products, and empower individuals with practical, evidence-based strategies to reduce their body's plastic burden. While the study's Australian focus prevents its global generalizability, it comprises the first significant step from observational links to real-world interventions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From "no added sugar" to "organic goodness," infant and toddler foods in New Zealand are overloaded with promotional claims, many of which may mislead parents and blur the line between marketing and nutrition. Study: Cluttered with claims: Composition, nutrition, health and marketing claims on commercial infant and toddler foods in New Zealand. In a recent study published in the journal Nutrition & Dietetics, researchers found that all commercial toddler and infant food products in New Zealand had multiple on-pack claims. Nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life can influence health and well-being. Early life is a period of rapid growth and could shape healthy eating patterns. Therefore, optimal nutrition in early childhood is central to healthy growth, development, and well-being. The Nutrient and Promotion Profile Model (NPPM) of the World Health Organization provides a framework for developing effective policy and legal measures to ensure the sale of appropriate toddler and infant foods. NPPM recommends that commercial toddler and infant foods not carry nutrition, health, composition, or marketing claims. The paper highlights a key regulatory gap, as the current Australia-New Zealand Food Standards Code does not address marketing claims (such as those related to taste or convenience). Infant and toddler food labeling has been identified as an area of concern by the Food Regulation Standing Committee (FRSC) of New Zealand and Australia, as caregivers struggle to determine which foods align with the Healthy Eating Guidelines for New Zealand Babies and Toddlers. "Free from" claims for artificial flavors and colors topped the list, appearing on 72% and 71% of products respectively, even more than "no added sugar" (53%). The present study aimed to identify on-pack claims on commercial toddler and infant foods in New Zealand. First, all relevant toddler and infant food products were identified through the Nutritrack database. Data were annually collected from four major supermarket chains in New Zealand. Images of foods and beverages were taken, and data from the photos were entered into a database. To account for products new to the market since the last data collection, this was supplemented by an online supermarket search in January 2024, which identified 21 additional products. Products were classified into 59 categories and 15 food groups. The study used products categorized as baby foods, which included products indicated on-pack as intended for toddlers and infants. Additionally, the food groups of dairy and snack foods were examined to identify other foods suitable for toddlers and infants. Infant products were defined as those intended for ages < 12 months. Toddler products were those designed for ages 12 to <36 months. The presence/absence of nutrition, composition, marketing, and health claims was identified. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the frequency of claims by food category and overall. Snacks and finger foods displaying vegetable images often relied on powdered forms, contributing to their low average vegetable content of just 11.4%. The researchers identified 210 toddler and infant food products. On average, each product had 7.5 unique claims. Further, “free from” claims, relating to the absence of ingredients generally perceived to be harmful, were the most prevalent nutrition or composition claims found on 97% of products; “free from” claims most commonly referred to added sugars, flavors, colors, salt, and preservatives. Approximately 68% of products featured words such as "fresh," "organic," "natural," or "real" on their packaging. The most common health claim was related to beneficial health and development, and these claims were more than twice as prevalent on toddler foods (found on 33% of products) compared to infant foods (15%). The most common marketing claims were related to ideal texture, taste, optimum feeding, high quality, and lifestyle or convenience. Most products were savory meals or purees, containing an average of 49% vegetables. For example, a product named ‘Organic Lamb and Garden Vegetables' implied that lamb was the main ingredient, when in fact it contained only 10% lamb compared to 90% vegetables. Commercial foods for infants and toddlers in New Zealand were saturated with claims, with all products featuring at least three unique claims. Composition and nutrition claims were the most common category. Besides, a combined 88% of products featured vegetable and/or fruit imagery. Similar types and numbers of claims were found on infant and toddler foods, except for health claims that were more prevalent on toddler foods. The paper notes that previous research confirms these claims can be powerful, with one study finding that ‘free from' claims can promote inaccurate perceptions of a product's healthiness and influence purchasing choices. Overall, regulations are needed to restrict the use of claims and align them with best practices, thereby preventing caregivers from being misled by these promotional messages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A landmark UK Biobank study reveals that not all additives are equal: while sugars, sweeteners, and flavorings drive higher mortality, gelling agents may offer protection, reshaping how we view the risks of ultra-processed foods. In a recent article in the journal eClinicalMedicine, researchers in Germany investigated whether specific markers of ultra-processing (MUPs) are associated with mortality, beyond the established links between ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and poor health. Their findings indicate that certain types of sugar, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavor enhancers, and flavors were associated with a higher risk of mortality, as was overall UPF intake. Flavour additives dominated UK supermarket foods, appearing in 13.6% of total food intake on average, more than any other MUP category analyzed in the study. UPFs are highly industrially processed items that are typically rich in fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients such as fiber, protein, and vitamins. These foods are marketed aggressively and valued for their convenience, often replacing healthier dietary options. This trend is concerning, as UPFs have consistently been associated with obesity, weight gain, and numerous negative health outcomes. Consequently, several national dietary guidelines recommend limiting UPF intake. Food processing is commonly classified using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods into four groups. UPFs fall under NOVA group 4 and can be identified through MUPs. A food is classified as UPF if it contains at least one MUP. Although UPFs have been strongly linked to mortality, no studies have directly examined whether specific MUPs contribute equally to these risks. Assessing portion sizes required creative solutions: When packaging data was unavailable, researchers turned to the UK Food Standards Agency's standard portion guides to estimate grams consumed. Researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study of over 500,000 adults recruited between 2006 and 2010. For this study, 186,744 participants aged 40–75 years were included after applying exclusions for missing information, implausible dietary reports, and pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes or malabsorption disorders. Dietary intake was assessed using up to five 24-hour web-based food recalls completed per participant. Ingredient lists were analyzed for 57 possible MUPs grouped into nine categories, with 37 of these found in at least one product. For each food item, a Marker Likelihood Index (MLI) was calculated based on the proportion of commercial products containing a specific MUP. Statistical analyses used Cox proportional hazard regression models with penalized cubic splines to examine associations between MUP intake and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, alcohol intake, BMI, ethnicity, health status, education, psychiatric history, income, physical activity, blood pressure, sex, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation. Even cumulative exposure to multiple MUPs mattered: Total intake across all markers showed a significant link to higher mortality risk, beyond individual MUP effects. The participants were 58 years old on average, and 57% were female; UPF intake accounted for an average of 20.0% of their total food intake. Higher UPF consumption was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk (HR-nadir) at 18% TFI and risk rising beyond that intake level. When examining specific MUPs, five categories – flavour, flavour enhancers, colouring agents, sweeteners, and varieties of sugar – showed strong positive associations with mortality risk at specific intake levels: In contrast, no associations were observed for processing aids, modified oils, protein sources, or fibre. At the individual level, 13 specific MUPs were significantly related to mortality. Notably, gelling agents (processing aids) showed an inverse association with mortality risk. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results, especially for UPF, flavour, coloring agents, and sweeteners. Results held firm after excluding early deaths: Sensitivity analyses removed participants who died within 2 years of dietary assessment, reducing concerns about reverse causation. This exploratory study is the first to assess broad categories and specific MUPs in relation to mortality, showing associations between higher mortality risk and both overall UPF intake as well as several MUPs (flavors, flavor enhancers, coloring agents, sweeteners, and sugars). The findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence linking these additives to weight gain, metabolic disruption, and alterations in gut microbiota. The inverse association for gelling agents (possibly due to pectin content) highlights significant variation in health effects across additives. Strengths include the large cohort size, extended follow-up, and novel MUP-based classification using commercial product analysis, which enhances objectivity compared with predefined UPF food lists. However, as an exploratory analysis, limitations include reliance on self-reported dietary data, potential residual confounding, limited power for rarer MUPs, and the ‘healthy volunteer' bias of the UK Biobank. These results highlight specific MUPs, such as flavorings, colorings, sweeteners, certain processing aids (e.g., thickeners), and sugars, as potential drivers of UPF-related health risks.
