                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Education Department said Thursday that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX protections against sex-based discrimination in education by creating all-gender bathrooms and allowing students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. The finding followed an unprecedented probe of Denver's East High School that marked a sharp departure from the department's investigations under former Democratic President Joe Biden. It's part of a push by President Donald Trump's Republican administration against local and state policies that make allowances for transgender students. The investigation in Denvber began after the school district converted a girl's restroom into an all-gender restroom while leaving another bathroom on the same floor exclusive to boys in January. The school district has said that was done as a result of a student-led process and the bathroom had 12-foot (3.6-meter) tall partitions for privacy and security. The school district later added a second all-gender restroom on the same floor which it said was meant to address concerns of unfairness. At the time it said that students would also continue to have access to gender-specific restrooms and single-stall, all-gender bathrooms. The Education Department said it offered the school district a chance to voluntarily make changes, including converting multi-stall, all-gender bathrooms back to ones designated by gender, within 10 days or risk unspecified enforcement action. It also wants the district to use biology-based definitions for the words “male” and “female” in all policies and practices related to Title IX and to rescind any policies or guidance allowing students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex. “Denver is free to endorse a self-defeating gender ideology, but it is not free to accept federal taxpayer funds and harm its students in violation of Title IX,” Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department's Office for Civil Rights, said in a news release. Denver Public Schools officials said they had received the results of the investigation and were “determining our next steps.” The Trump administration has launched about two dozen investigations of transgender policies in schools, including access to sports, locker rooms and bathrooms, according to data compiled by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit news organization. Trump signed an executive order in February to block trans girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Supporters said the move restored fairness in athletic competitions, but opponents called it an attack on transgender youth. Federal officials in June determined that California's Department of Education violated civil rights law by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams. Officials under Trump also have sued Maine over the participation of transgender athletes in girl's sports and last month launched an investigation into Oregon's Department of Education, following a complaint from a conservative group about transgender girls on girls sports teams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police said Thursday that the shooter who killed two Catholic school students and wounded 18 other people inside a church idolized mass killers. The shooter who killed two children and injured 18 worshippers attending Mass at a Minneapolis Catholic school was quiet and seemed to resent school as an eighth grader there seven years ago, a former classmate said. Officials identified the shooter as Robin Westman, 23, and said Thursday that Westman was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School. YouTube videos allegedly posted by the shooter suggest Westman experienced depression and expressed admiration for at least a dozen other acts of mass violence, but didn't spell out any specific ideology. Armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol, Westman approached the side of the church at Annunciation Catholic School and fired more than a hundred rounds through the windows just before 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. In response to a request for any records of police contact with the shooter in the last decade, the Eagan Police Department, southwest of Minneapolis, sent two heavily redacted documents. The first from 2018 is listed as a mental health call for a welfare check for a child with parents Mary Grace Westman and James Westman, but the case narrative was redacted. Officials have recovered hundreds of pieces of evidence from the church and three associated residences in the area, including additional writings and electronic devices, O'Hara said. Authorities also were scouring the videos, now removed from public view, and other online content. The FBI is investigating Wednesday's shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, officials said. Law enforcement officers gather outside the Annunciation Church's school in response to a reported mass shooting, Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, in Minneapolis. Lily Kletter, 22, couldn't figure out why Robin Westman's face looked so familiar until she looked back at a photo from the Annunciation Class of 2017. “I didn't know them super well, but they were in my grade,” Kletter said of Robin Westman, known to classmates as Bob. Their class was small, about 50 kids, most of whom had known each other since they were little, Kletter said. “I remember they had a crazy distaste for school, especially Annunciation, which I always thought was pretty interesting because their mom was on the parish board,” she said. “I remember this one time, like, them hiding in the bathroom for a really long time because … they didn't want to go to Mass.” Kletter remembers Robin's mom, Mary Grace, even more. Kletter said their school curriculum included confirmation, one of Catholicism's seven sacraments, often seen as the “sacrament of maturity' where young people declare their faith. Mary Grace Westman led some of the classes on how faith could be weaved into their lives, Kletter said. “They sat in the back quietly,” she said. A phone call and text message to a cellphone number listed as belonging to Mary Grace Westman was not answered Wednesday afternoon. Officials also have not yet successfully reached the shooter's mother, O'Hara said on Thursday. Associated Press reporters unsuccessfully attempted to reach the shooter's father at an address listed as his residence. Phone calls and text messages to numbers associated with Robin Westman's siblings also were not answered. Police have not yet identified any particular grievance or triggering event with the church, O'Hara said. Westman's uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, told The Associated Press he barely knew Robin Westman — the youngest child of one of his sisters — but was watching coverage of Wednesday's tragedy. “I wish he had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer added. A spokesperson for RISE, a medical marijuana dispensary company, confirmed that Westman worked at one of its Minnesota dispensaries for “several months this year,” but said Westman was not employed with RISE at the time of the shooting. Police said they were aware of videos and writings that may have come from the shooter. On a YouTube channel titled “Robin W” there were at least two videos posted before the channel was taken down by site administrators. On display throughout the videos are specific references to more than 15 different perpetrators and episodes of mass violence in the U.S. and abroad, both recent and from before the shooter was born. The weapons and magazines were tagged with graffiti showing a fascination with people who had committed acts of public violence and included things like, “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” The video also shows a letter written to the person's family, apologizing for what the shooting will mean for them, expressing love for them and saying to change their name and “move on.” The letter noted that they long felt depression and had suicidal thoughts and have thought about doing this for a long time, but only recently decided to carry out the shooting. A second, almost 20-minute-long video shows nearly 200 pages of two different journals mostly written in what appears to be the Cyrillic alphabet.

A federal judge on Thursday ruled the Trump administration's effort to remove Michael Abramowitz as director of Voice of America was “plainly contrary to the law.”

United States District Judge Royce Lamberth handed down a decision stating Abramowitz cannot be removed from his position without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board, which President Donald Trump dismissed in January. 

After starting his second term, Trump dispatched Kari Lake to target the U.S. Agency for Global Media, a government-funded media outlet encompassing VOA. The Trump administration believes USAGM and VOA are corrupted institutions that have strayed from their founding mission and become partisan arbiters of biased information. 

Abramowitz, along with hundreds of other VOA employees, was placed on administrative leave earlier this year after Trump issued an executive order seeking to trim USAGM to its “minimum presence and function required by law.” Lake has sought to fire hundreds of USAGM employees since Trump took office, as she has become the president's top henchman in seeking to root corruption out of the media department by essentially shutting it down. 

Lamberth's ruling on Thursday comes after Abramowitz sued Lake, arguing that her move to fire him was illegal. 

The judge ordered Abramowitz's reinstatement, saying the director must remain in his role until he can be lawfully removed by the broadcaster's board, which suggests Trump could be forced to reinstate all the members of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board he fired in January.

“To the extent the Board's current lack of quorum institutes a practical barrier to removing Abramowitz, the Broadcast Act gives the President a straightforward remedy: replacing the removed members,” Lamberth wrote. 

JUDGE BLOCKS KARI LAKE AND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM PULLING RADIO FREE EUROPE FUNDING

In a separate ruling on Monday, Lambirth ordered Lake to submit to questioning under oath regarding accusations she is violating mandates not to dismantle VOA. 

In turn, Lake has blasted the Washington, D.C., judge, saying she's “got a judge who's threatening me with contempt of court, throwing me in prison, if I don't produce more of the propaganda that he wants me to produce.” </p>

Senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports the latest on the feud between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. There is no reason for Americans to live in fear as President Donald Trump floats mobilizing National Guard troops to other cities to address crime like he has in Washington, the White House insists. JB Pritzker, have made it clear they aren't interested in receiving National Guard troops in Chicago, the White House said it would welcome requests from Republican and Democratic leaders for additional law enforcement support to reduce crime in American cities. "This is our message to Americans in Democrat-run cities nationwide: decline is a choice," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday. "You don't have to live in constant fear of being robbed, raped or murdered. Armed National Guard members patrol near the U.S. Capitol as security tightens after President Donald Trump's deployment order. "Governor Pritzker should spend less time demonizing the police, more time trying to recruit more police and more time trying to call the president of the United States to get crime in his city under control," Leavitt said. Pritzker, a Democrat who hasn't ruled out running for president in 2028, has pushed back against the possibility of National Guard troops arriving in Chicago to address crime and said Monday the move would be "unconstitutional" and "un-American." "Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish its dissidents and score political points," Pritzker said. "If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is — a dangerous power grab." JB Pritzker delivers remarks in Chicago alongside Mayor Brandon Johnson and other officials after reports the White House was preparing to deploy National Guard troops to the city. Meanwhile, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement Friday that crime is down in Chicago and said the city in the past year has reduced homicides by more than 30%, robberies by 35% and shootings by almost 40%. "For 13 consecutive years, Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city," Leavitt said Thursday. "This is JB Pritzker's legacy, by the way." "He should put politics aside," Leavitt said. "He should pick up the phone and call this president, who would be more than happy to do right by law-abiding American residents in the city of Chicago. Chicago does not have the most murders per capita and isn't listed in the top five cities for murder per capita in compilations of 2024 FBI data. Trump disclosed plans Aug. 11 to mobilize troops from the D.C. National Guard and to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital. Since then, Trump has indicated he might dispatch National Guard troops to other cities in the U.S., including Chicago. "We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less," Trump told reporters Monday morning. "But within one week we'll have no crime in Chicago, like no crime in D.C."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) slammed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday, telling him to “shut up” for suggesting that psychiatric drugs taken by children could be connected to school shootings, including the shooting in Minneapolis on Wednesday. A gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School, killing two children and injuring 17 other people. “I dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don't kill kids, antidepressants do,” Smith said on X. Fox & Friends cohost Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if his agency is examining possible connections between mass shootings and “drugs that are used in order to make that [gender] transition” happen. Robin Westman, the 23-year-old gunman in the Minnesota shooting, was born male and at 17 years old, applied for a name change to reflect a gender identity transition to female. “Many of [the drugs] have black box warnings that warn of suicidal ideation and homicidal ideation, so we can't exclude those as a culprit.” Kennedy has long been a critic of SSRIs and pushed a similar theory last year when he told Tesla CEO Elon Musk during an X Spaces conversation that “prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events.” According to public health and medical researchers, SSRIs are prescribed for depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders, which are diagnoses common among transgender people. The drugs are not used to treat gender dysphoria specifically. Medical studies show that most mass shooters suffer from untreated mental illness, and that there is no evidence connecting psychiatric drugs to mass shootings. It is currently unknown if Westman took SSRIs or underwent hormone therapies. The shooting has stirred up national conversations around gun violence, with Democrats arguing that the real cause of mass shootings is easy access to high-powered firearms. More guns than people,” Smith said in a follow-up post on X. The report defines a “mass shooting” as “four or more people shot and killed, excluding the shooter, in a public location, with no connection to underlying criminal activity, such as gangs or drugs.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that mandates all federal buildings “embrace classical architecture.” “In the District of Columbia, classical architecture shall be the preferred and default architecture for Federal public buildings absent exceptional factors necessitating another kind of architecture,” reads a White House fact sheet on the order, which specifically takes aim at brutalist architecture. Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, whose organization helped the White House with drafting Thursday's executive order, told CNN that he is “overjoyed” by the president's order. “The president is to be commended for requiring that new federal buildings be noble, beautiful and admired by the general public, as the executive order recognizes, and as our organization has long been advocating,” Shubow said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Classical public architecture is time honored, timeless, and the mode most associated with our national values and a form of government is quite simply, the architecture of American democracy.” Construction is also set to begin in September on a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, fulfilling the president's 15-year ambition to construct an event space on the White House grounds that expands the building's entertaining capacity — but also resembles the gilded spaces of his private clubs. Renderings provided by the White House depict a vast space with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, gold floor lamps and a checkered marble floor. And inside the White House, the Oval Office itself has been adorned with lashings of gold decoration, which Trump ordered up from a craftsman in Florida who'd worked on his Palm Beach estate, people familiar with the matter said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The center may soon be completely empty as a judge upheld her decision late Wednesday ordering operations to wind down indefinitely. A protester stands outside the migrant detention dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Facility, July 12, 2025, in Ochopee, Fla. (AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez, file) An Associated Press analysis of publicly available state spending data showed that Florida has signed at least $405 million in vendor contracts to build and operate the facility, which officials had initially estimated would cost $450 million a year to run. A previous AP review found that as of late July, the state had already allocated at least $245 million to run the site, which opened July 1. President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. It's also facing several legal challenges, including one that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled on late Wednesday. When asked, the Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say how many detainees remained and how many had been moved out since the judge's temporary injunction last week. “DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities,” the department said Thursday in an emailed statement. Environmental activist Jessica Namath, who has kept a nearly constant watch outside the facility's gates, said Thursday that fellow observers had seen metal framing for tents hauled out but no signs of the removal of FEMA trailers or portable bathrooms. “It definitely seems like they have been winding down operations,” Namath said. Detainees and advocates have described toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, although officials dispute such descriptions. The facility was already being emptied of detainees as of last week, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to a rabbi about chaplaincy services. Funding is central to the federal government's arguments that Williams' order should be overturned by an appellate court. Homeland Security attorneys said in a court filing this week that federal environmental law doesn't apply to a state like Florida, and the federal government isn't responsible for the detention center since it hasn't spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of the detention center. “No final federal funding decisions have been made,” the attorneys said.

Fox News' Carley Shimkus reports on the accusations against Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen DeGeneres faces renewed criticism after fresh accusations surfaced this week about her alleged toxic behavior on her long-running daytime talk show. A former cameraman on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" accused the television host of fostering a hostile workplace where staffers lived in fear and sometimes had to give up family commitments. According to staffers, DeGeneres, 67, disliked male employees and allegedly turned cold when they interacted with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, 52. Crew members also recalled what insiders called the infamous "Ellen gaze." Ellen DeGeneres faces new accusations of toxic workplace behavior from former talk show employees who describe a hostile environment. One former staffer described the look as "a queen searching for her next execution," adding, "She was terrifying." De Rossi was described as "nice" and approachable with the crew, but employees said their jobs felt at risk if DeGeneres saw them chatting with her spouse. "We went through a lot of male employees," the former staffer continued, alleging that DeGeneres once burned through nine stage managers in a single season. "We had a feeling she really didn't like guys." Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres married in 2008. Celebrity guests also faced difficulties on the set of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," according to former employees. The insider claimed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment in which he embarrassed DeGeneres by saying she used rancid meat during a demo. They were doing a food test together, and Ellen offered him a sample first," the former employee recalled. It was about eight seasons before he came back." The insider claimed to the Daily Mail that celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment. One senior employee was allegedly asked to postpone a child's bone marrow transplant to avoid disrupting the show's production schedule. It remains unclear whether DeGeneres was aware of the situation. Ellen DeGeneres confirmed her move to the U.K. was made permanent after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election. In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. The uproar led to an internal investigation. In July 2020, BuzzFeed News reported that current and former employees blamed three producers for creating a culture of fear. In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. She referenced the allegations in her 2024 comedy special, "Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval." There, she said, "I got kicked out of show business for being mean. Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown. By 2025, DeGeneres had moved to the U.K. countryside, claiming she was the victim of "misogynistic" backlash after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surface Transportation Board to break a 2-2 tie before the body considers the largest railroad merger ever proposed. Board member Robert E. Primus said on LinkedIn that he received an email from the White House Wednesday night terminating the position he has held since he was appointed by Trump in his first term. Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific's acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition. He was named Board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Board member Patrick Fuchs to Chairman. This follows Trump's previous firings of board members at the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Reserve, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are all supposed to be independent agencies. “Robert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.” ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Primus said he doesn't think the firing is valid because the White House didn't offer any cause for it, and he plans to fight. He also rejected their explanation for the move because he has long tried to encourage railroads to serve every industry better and help them grow, but he has already been removed from the STB website. “I've been pro growth across the board in terms of encouraging growth in the freight rail network, which in turn will grow our national economy. So if that's not being in line with America first, then I don't know what America he's saying is first,” Primus said to The Associated Press. He said the firings at all these agencies threaten their independence and credibility. Primus said in his tenure the STB always strove to be impartial and apolitical. Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who serves on the Commerce Committee, said it's clear that “Donald Trump is trying to stack the deck so the federal government rubberstamps the merger as a huge favor for Wall Street and wealthy railroad owners.” She said Primus has been a fair regulator who worked hard to make sure railroads delivered for their customers and focused on safety. “The explanation provided for this decision — that his position has been “eliminated” — is nothing short of outrageous. Appointed bodies established through federal code are not designed to be erased at the whim of powerful corporate interests,” said the SMART-TD union that represents concductors. “This action is unprecedented, unlawful in spirit, and reeks of direct interference from hedge funds and the nation's largest rail carriers.” He hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal, but he doesn't think mergers will necessarily improve competition.</p>

Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham also weighs in on the aftermath during 'America's Newsroom.' Vice President JD Vance slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Thursday after she criticized prayer in the aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota. "We pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action," Vance said, adding, "Why do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?" Vance speaks to supporters of President Donald Trump at an event on August 21, 2025, in Peachtree City, Georgia. In a follow-up post, Vance wrote, "Of all the weird left wing culture wars in the last few years, this is by far the most bizarre. ‘How dare you pray for innocent people in the midst of tragedy?!' Police have identified the shooter responsible for opening fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, when they said two children were killed and 17 others were injured during morning Mass. Vance's remarks came in direct response to Psaki's Wednesday post slamming people for offering thoughts and prayers in response to the tragedy. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sparked a firestorm with her comments on the shooting at a church in Minneapolis. She wrote, "Prayer is not freaking enough. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. In a separate post, Psaki also used the tragedy to criticize the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. "When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The surge in federal law enforcement in Washington, DC, has “enhanced” the capacity of local police officers and led to fewer crimes, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said this week while adding that it had also contributed to a “break in trust” between police and residents. “Since the beginning of this federal surge of officers, it has always been my focus on – we didn't ask for any federal officers, we're driving crime down – but while they're here, how can we most strategically use them to accelerate the work that MPD has done?” Bowser said. “We think that there's more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior,” Bowser said at a press conference Wednesday. She continued, however, to criticize certain aspects of the administration's law enforcement surge and police takeover, saying that it led to a “break in trust” between police and the community. Bowser added that states sending their National Guard members to DC – like six Republican-led states have done so far – has “not been an efficient use of those resources.” Experts have estimated, as CNN reported, that the ongoing National Guard deployment is costing roughly $1 million per day. The mayor's positive review of the surge in law enforcement Wednesday came under fire by local politicians, with one DC councilmember, Zachary Parker, for instance, saying in a social media post on X that city leaders should be “unequivocal” that the federal surge and National Guard deployment are wrong. Bowser added Thursday, “Our north star is protecting Home Rule and the district's autonomy, in all things, especially during this last eight months where it has been clear our autonomy has kind of been in the crosshairs.” The DC mayor has often tried to communicate multiple messages at a time. Meanwhile, polling has shown that DC residents feel less safe after the federal takeover. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday also found that just 36% of Americans support “federal officials bringing the Washington, DC local police under federal control citing a public safety emergency,” and only 38% of Americans support “deploying National Guard troops from other states to Washington, DC, for law enforcement efforts.”</p>

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley said she would have taken the New York Knicks head coaching job if it had been offered. Staley, 55, interviewed for the position before the Knicks hired Mike Brown in July. "I would have had to do it. To break (that door) open," Staley said on the "Post Moves" podcast. But it's the freaking New York Knicks." South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley reacts during the semifinal of the NCAA Women's Tournament against the Texas Longhorns at Amalie Arena on April 4, 2025, in Tampa, Florida. Staley was one of many candidates the Knicks interviewed for their head coaching vacancy. The Knicks also interviewed former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, former Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori. Staley said she thought she did well in the interview but questioned whether she hurt her chances by asking the Knicks how they would handle the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach. "How, if you hired me as the first female head coach in the NBA, would it impact your daily job? There's going to be the media and all this other stuff that you have to deal with that you didn't have to deal with and don't have to deal with when you hire a male. That got them to thinking, ‘Maybe she's right.'"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president of Argentina is blaming a recent attack by protestors on the ideology of his predecessor and political adversary. Argentinian President Javier Milei was pelted with rocks during a campaign stop on Wednesday during a campaign stop at the Lomas de Zamora district of Buenos Aires. Milei later took to social media to blame the scuff-up on his rival, former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. “Civilization or barbarism,” he said on social media with a photo taken at the scene showing a rock flying towards him. The president spent the subsequent hours retweeting messages of support and admonishments of “Kirchnerism” from political allies. Audio recordings have emerged in which Diego Spagnuolo, head of the country's disability agency, alluded to Karina Milei accepting bribes. “Everything he says is a lie,” Javier Milei said of Spagnuolo in comments to the press on Wednesday. La Libertad Avanza, Milei's libertarian party is holding a significant lead in the polls ahead of the midterm elections set to be held in October. A survey conducted by AtlasIntel for Bloomberg News found just under 39% of respondents planned to vote for Milei's party, compared to just 28% intending to vote for its main rival, Union por la Patria. The president's libertarian policies have resulted in noticeable drops in poverty and inflation, while unemployment remains a hurdle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday has triggered a renewed fight over responses to mass shootings. Many on the Left have long criticized offering “thoughts and prayers” in response to tragedies as a shallow expression that distracts from implementing concrete solutions, such as gun control. Many on the Right have bashed the Left for its perceived insensitivity to religious beliefs, and counter that offering prayers is a kind and impactful way to provide comfort and express solidarity. The debate was first sparked after the Sandy Hook shooting in 2011, and has arisen after nearly every mass shooting since. “Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now: these kids were literally praying … They were in a church,” he said, though he trailed off without making his intentions explicit. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki was more overt in her attack, dismissing thoughts and prayers altogether. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers,” she said in a post on X. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Most of the comments were negative, with Federalist CEO Sean Davis comparing her to a demon. In an appearance on CNN, conservative commentator Scott Jennings said, “I think it's wrong, frankly, to vilify or attack people of faith. I think thoughts and prayers are the most solid on days of tragedy for people who live their faith every day.” “And I think on a day like today, particularly in a church community, there are probably people praying harder for comfort today than they have ever prayed in their life. And so I think, and I've heard others on the left today go down this line of attack against people of faith, sort of denigrating the idea that they might want to pray today. And so I think his statements were misguided,” he added. Jennings also argued that prayer is a good way to increase empathy and understanding for victims' families, urging people to spend 10 seconds in silence to think about the Minneapolis victims and their families. “Perhaps, sir, you're trying too hard to please a political base. My advice, offered humbly, is to shut up for a few hours and try not to offend anyone else as they grieve and recover from this tragic moment,” he added. Vice President JD Vance also chimed in, disputing the basis for arguments against offering prayers in response to a tragedy. “It is shocking to me that so many left wing politicians attack the idea of prayer in response to a tragedy. Literally no one thinks prayer is a substitute for action. It is shocking to me that so many left wing politicians attack the idea of prayer in response to a tragedy.Literally no one thinks prayer is a substitute for action. Left-wing social media personality Brian Krassenstein made a similar post to Psaki, disputing the effectiveness of prayer. He went a step further to argue that it is the problem. If prayer worked, a house of prayer wouldn't have just experienced this tragedy,” he wrote, drawing a similarly negative reaction. CNN host Dana Bash also dismissed prayer in an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). These kids were literally praying when they were murdered through a church window,” Bash said, with Klobuchar audibly agreeing with her. MSNBC host Michael Steele gave similar remarks, though he more openly attacked prayer by calling it a “lie” in an interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). The lie of that,” he said, arguing that those praying are standing in the way of solutions. Some right-wing commentators accused the Left of double standards, arguing that it only felt emboldened to attack prayer because it is Christians who are concerned. “Imagine if Muslims were murdered while saying their prayers. Do you think any Democrat would be trashing prayer in the aftermath? They have no fear demeaning Christians, though, and that's a problem,” RedState writer Bonchie said. Non-Christians also chimed in to defend prayer at a time of tragedy. Jewish columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon voiced outrage at Frey's comments, comparing his rhetoric with that of the shooter. “I am just gobsmacked that in their effort to immediately politicize a horrific tragedy in which children were murdered at prayer, the line that Democrat after Democrat seems to have chosen is ‘Where is your God?' Pope Leo XIV sent a papal telegram to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of Minneapolis, expressing his “heartfelt condolences and the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.” In a statement, Daniel Brum, Orthodox Church of America's archbishop of Chicago and the Midwest, expressed his condolences and defended prayer. “Many dismiss the phrase ‘thoughts and prayers,' but as Christians, we know prayer is essential. Today, as we mourn, let us also commit to action so that all children of God may live together in the peace that comes only from Christ,” Brum said. It is the very place we meet Christ, who Himself was unjustly slain. We cling to Christ, who has conquered death,” it said in a post on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Veterans Affairs has transferred nearly $2 billion in funding for its health care system to pay for care from private providers, the agency told CNN. The reallocation represents a transfer of nearly 5% of the VA's total budget for money allocated to private care. Unusually, it was made without a formal request for approval from Congress, as is the normal procedure followed by previous administrations, including during the first Trump administration. The money shift comes amid a larger trend to increase private care options for veterans, which has drawn mixed results for the VA and the veterans it serves, and has added fuel to long simmering political tensions between Democrats and Republicans over management of the vast agency that provides health care to millions of American veterans. Ultimately, though, the changes in how the VA funds and shapes care delivery affect veterans, who have long had divided views on services. Congress was notified of the VA's intent to make the change in a letter to members in early July. “The transfer of funds will not have an adverse impact on Veterans' care in VA health care facilities, and will improve Veterans' care by expanding access through VHA's community partners,” said VA Secretary Doug Collins in the letter, which was seen by CNN. The funding move puts more money into a system that's already in place in the VA, where VA doctors send some veteran patients to private facilities if the VA cannot offer certain services, or does not have facilities within certain distances of veterans' homes. However, critics in Congress noted that transfer had to do with a shortfall at the end of a fiscal year, and that any move of money over 1% of an appropriated category requires congressional approval, which was sought and given in the case of the Biden transfer. Asked why, Kasperowicz said Collins's letter “should speak for itself”. “VA-purchased care,” which civilian medical care for VA patients is known as, has grown as a proportion of the VA's budget every year since 2015 and now accounts for about 25% of the VHA's current fiscal year budget. For some veterans, using private care could mean more choices in services or shorter wait times. “Better-funded community care means veterans get greater choice for the care they've earned,” said John Byrnes, Strategic Director for Concerned Veterans for America, in a statement to CNN. A spokesperson for Rep. John Carter (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Appropriations, said: “These resources are needed to support care provided by community partners.” The move “will not affect VA care at VA facilities,” she added. But critics - like Gordon - are worried about potential drawbacks. The private health care system in the US is already under strain, she says, and an influx of hundreds of thousands of veterans could add to the burden. “America is suffering from a shortage of primary care providers, which are absolutely key to providing care, and they are the backbone of the kind of care veterans get in the VA,” Gordon says. Liam Rose, a health economist at Stanford University who receives grants from the VA, said: “The difficult part for VA is that as it becomes more generous with access to private providers, it sees increased costs both from individuals that would not have had access and from individuals that can now use VA as the payer for care they would have received otherwise.” When CNN recently visited several Veterans' halls near Washington, DC, and in central Virginia, opinions were divided over the quality of the VA system. However, she said she could see how the system could be confusing for veterans who are less tech-savvy, she said, for example, because the VA's alerts for appointments with private providers are sometimes not clear on specifically where the patient should go. Many veterans who spoke to CNN in recent months said that while the VA health care system can be somewhat unwieldy, and can take a frustratingly long time to be admitted into, once someone is in the system, the care is very good. According to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a national non-profit group for veterans, less than a third – 31% – of its members who had experience with VA community care felt that private community care providers understood their medical needs, and only 14% said they had confidence that private and VA teams coordinated properly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Earlier this month, Katie Miller launched her new podcast with a specific origin myth. Miller, a former Trump administration official and wife of Stephen Miller, declared that by creating a lifestyle podcast for conservative women, she was filling a hole in the media ecosystem. “For years, I've seen that there isn't a place for conservative women to gather online,” Miller said in a video posted to X. Her caption added, “As a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn't a podcast for women like myself.” Conservative women have arguably never had more places to gather online and talk about their lifestyle concerns — especially when it comes to motherhood and wellness. This media ecosystem has recently been dubbed the “womanosphere,” and it is booming. They can get their celebrity gossip with a healthy strain of reactionary conspiracy theories from Candace Owens. They can get anti-feminist cultural commentary from YouTubers like Brett Cooper. They can get MAHA-inflected health care advice from Alex Clark's Culture Apothecary talk show. They can watch the agrarian fantasies of tradwives like Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman. And they can listen to conservative women's lifestyle podcasts, like Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey's Relatable. Many of these women, by dint of their jobs as full-time content creators and podcasters, are also working moms, as they are happy to discuss at length in their content. Still, the sense that Miller is operating from a defensive crouch, grabbing for access to a feminine frivolity she feels she has been denied, suffuses her new show, The Katie Miller Podcast. “Conservative women never get asked these questions,” Miller adds. It's hard to know what exclusion Miller is referring to exactly (what is Ivanka Trump's brand if not being a conservative woman with beauty secrets? ), but the idea that it might be true seems necessary to Miller's conception of her project. A transgressive posture is one of the characteristics of the womanosphere: an implication that they are saying hard truths and asking tough questions about things the liberal elites don't want women to know, that they are reclaiming their due from the cultural gatekeepers who didn't want them to have it. As the womanosphere booms, it's taken on an odd, fraught position. Listening to (or watching) Miller's podcast isn't interesting because of the beauty secrets divulged; it's revealing because of the glimpse it gives us into Republicans' current vexed relationship with femininity. To give Miller her due, it's true that there are few spaces these days for conservative women in traditional media, like old-school glossy magazines. Lifestyle media for women has long been inherently conservative-leaning, with its focus on dieting and man-catching and home-building, but the post-Jezebel generation of women's media took on an explicitly feminist lens. Even the flagship Vogue, which generally dedicates a cover to the sitting first lady, declined to feature Melania Trump during Donald Trump's first term and, so far, his second as well. Miller's podcast fits neatly into the flourishing new ecosystem. There is no feasible way to build a lucrative career out of being an anti-woke woman, and failing to land a feature in Vogue is censorship at its finest. “The Soy Right is being oppressed and they want you to know it,” she wrote. … While the right is winning cultural and political victories nonstop lately, that's not enough. Meanwhile, harping on the false idea that there's a hole in the marketplace allows her podcast to take on a sense of heightened importance. If the world were fair, Miller implies, someone else would have asked her to describe her beauty routine a long time ago. This idea that Republican women are never given credit for their beauty stands uneasily next to recent Republican attempts to claim the existence of beautiful women as a win for their own side. Over the past two years, the right has variously claimed Sydney Sweeney, Hawk Tuah Girl, and sorority rush videos as cultural phenomena that are by their nature Republican-coded and surely infuriate the left. In the manosphere, the obsession with hot girls shades into raunch culture, a performative, overwhelming ocean of sleaze in which the supposed celebration of hot girls also runs right alongside an attitude of degradation. The nascent womanosphere, however, tends towards purity culture, an obsession with Christian virtue and righteousness that is the mirror image of raunch culture. Miller makes much of her status as a wife and mother. Her fellow womanosphere podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey calls out listeners for watching movies about “hot and heavy sinful romance” rather than focusing on “the Biblical marriage that God has called you into.” Brittany Martinez, the founder of Evie magazine, says she started her publication after watching the traditional glossies “encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications.” As I've discussed extensively before, while purity culture and raunch culture might appear to oppose one another, they're two sides of the same coin, united by a shared premise that women's sexuality should always exist in service to men. They are also a trap: The raunchy cool girls get called sluts. The only way to play the game and win is to somehow be both raunchy and pure at the same time, an impossible status that was only ever held, very briefly, by a young Britney Spears before the world crashed down around her. The womanosphere is animated by a sense of a broken promise: that these women were told they would receive attention and credit that never came. The Katie Miller Podcast says it's an attempt to rectify that broken promise. In reality, however, it's just one more entry into a crowded conservative media landscape, powered by the same old warped sense of victimization. ﻿NFL dance squads and sorority rush dances have become the front lines of gender anxiety. Pumpkin spice is America's most hatable seasonal flavor. But Starbucks is leaning in even more heavily this year. ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just when Manchester United fans thought it couldn't get any worse, up steps fourth-division side Grimsby Town to plunge the once-great club even further in the mire. The League Two minnow – sitting three divisions below Manchester United – was well worthy of its League Cup win on Wednesday, beating Ruben Amorim's team 2-2 (12-11) in a marathon penalty shootout that came after a rollercoaster game at Grimsby's Blundell Park. Two late goals from the Red Devils, though, looked to have denied Grimsby a historic victory, but the underdog bit back in an astonishing shootout which United manager Amorim couldn't bring himself to watch. And while the night should be remembered for the Grimsby Town celebrations at full-time – it is arguably the greatest result in the club's history – it's hard not to question what on earth is going on at United. “I just want to apologize to our fans,” a furious Amorim told ITV Sport after the humiliating defeat. He later added to reporters: “We were completely lost and it's hard to explain and that's why I think they spoke really loud. “I know the best team won today. It was really fair the football today.” The Portuguese manager has now been at Manchester United for nine months and pressure to get results is looming larger than ever – he has so far overseen just 16 wins in 44 games. Given he arrived part-way through last season and told fans he would need time to implement his style of play, many gave him some leeway for the team's disastrous 15th-place finish in the league. But after an entire preseason schedule and backing in the transfer market – the club has signed an entirely new frontline in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Šeško and Matheus Cunha – there is very little credit left in the bank. To put it simply, there is still so much wrong with the team which has picked up just one point from its first two Premier League games of the new season. The goalkeeper situation, for one, has become untenable. Both new signings, Cunha and Mbeumo, missed vital penalties in Wednesday's defeat. “It was obviously not good enough today,” United defender Diogo Dalot told ITV Sport. “We cannot give up, whatever the situation but, like I said, it's not good enough and I think its something we need to look deeply into ourselves. Amorim was praised on his arrival at the club for having a distinct style of play. The 3-4-3 formation had worked so well at his former club, Sporting CP, and many felt a strong identity was exactly what a rudderless Manchester United needed. But Amorim's dedication to his system, which was once deemed a strength, is now turning into a weakness. Even if it's not working, or if the players are struggling to adapt, the manager is seemingly not changing his mind. Last season, the Portuguese boss said things would get worse before they got better. “It's not about the formation,” Amorim insisted again on Wednesday. There is still a week left in this summer's transfer window and Manchester United will likely be busy – perhaps more so with outgoings. There are still several players, including Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, who are seemingly surplus to requirements at United, as Amorim looks to freshen up a team which has been thrown from one disaster to the next in recent years. The club's new minority owner, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has backed the need for change, investing in a renovated training center and promising to build a new world-class stadium. Already, though, this ‘new' Manchester United has lurched into its latest calamitous chapter. Next up for the team is a Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Nothing but a comfortable win will ease the growing pressure on Amorim and his job as manager of the Red Devils.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In 1990, Playboy published an interview with Donald Trump in which the future president offered his thoughts on foreign affairs, the death penalty, and why he puts his name on everything. He also reflected on the meaning — or, perhaps, meaninglessness — of life. You know, it is all a rather sad situation,” he said. It's no secret that every president cares about how they'll be remembered. But that pithy, 35-year-old quote explains a whole lot about Trump, his rise to power, and how he governs today. He doesn't only want a legacy, be it good or bad. What Trump really wants is to — in some way or another — live forever, and he's only just getting started. By now, Trump's imprint on the world is indelible. His ability to wiggle out of legal consequences for his corruption and lawlessness has ushered in a new era of presidential immunity. But to fully understand Trump's broader political project and how he has successfully transformed America, you have to recognize that he isn't only a political figure, but something much bigger: a cultural icon in the crudest sense. It's that side of Trump that begins to explain one of the weirdest aspects of his presidency: his focus on aesthetics and how aggressively he is forcing his particular style and taste onto America. Whether it's making the White House look more like his private residences or turning the arts into his own pet project, Trump is trying to fundamentally change how America's government is perceived. Put another way, when we look at the government's buildings and institutions, Trump wants us to see only him — even after he's gone. It's not entirely accurate to say that Trump has always sought fame. He injected himself into the American zeitgeist decades ago, giving tabloids enough gossip to fill their pages with scandal after scandal since the 1970s. That never-ending pursuit of omnipresence has shaped Trump's political career and presidencies, perhaps more than anything else. He sought to befriend Hillary Clinton — donating to her Senate campaigns and the Clinton Foundation — before eventually running against her in 2016. And while there are some policies and ideas that Trump has long been committed to, like tariffs or racist conspiracy theories, he has always been more devoted to himself than any policy agenda. Trump's political project, in other words, is to rebrand America. He's seemingly not so desperate to eke out wins for the Republican Party so much as he is trying to remake America in his own image. Gone are the days where America is promoted as an idea — a nation of immigrants or an unfinished project that every generation of Americans strives to improve — because in his eyes, America is Trump. A lot of what Trump values today — real estate, television ratings, Time magazine covers — can be traced back to that era, when all of those things, at least to Trump and those running in his circles, were markers of clout. That period was defined by greed and ostentatious displays of wealth. In the Playboy interview, Trump was specifically asked about why he feels so comfortable showing off his riches, especially given how much poverty could be seen on the streets. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. Trump's quest to own the famed Plaza Hotel in New York City, which he bought for $400 million in 1988, ended in spectacular failure, with the hotel filing for bankruptcy just a few years after the purchase. I have many assets like that and the end result is that they are always much more valuable than what you paid for them.” Just like that venture, Trump's vision for America today is remarkably shallow. It doesn't matter how functional America's institutions or even economy actually are. And a shiny veneer that flaunts wealth and military might — be it through a gilded White House or a B-2 stealth bomber flyover — is perfectly adequate, even if it's entirely hollow or bankrupt on the inside. In both terms, he has issued executive orders to change the look of federal buildings, discarding new architectural styles and instead promoting grand neoclassical buildings that mimic ancient empires. The move showed how invested Trump personally is in the culture wars, so much so that he wants to be directly involved in decisions about what kind of art Americans should enjoy. Trump is now even planning on hosting the Kennedy Center Honors this year, saying he was “very involved” in selecting the honorees. And, according to the New York Times, Trump has considered giving posthumous awards to Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth. For instance, he issued an executive order that discourages the Smithsonian Institution from putting up displays that portray America and its past negatively. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said in a recent social media post. “We have the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.” To be sure, the United States has always been deeply invested in how it is perceived, both domestically and abroad, and has always projected itself as the “shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan often liked to say. And while there's no shortage of big egos among presidents, they often, at the very least, tried to gesture that America was bigger than just them. What is different about Trump is that he is not so interested in the idealistic vision of America — or in presenting America as an idea, a neverending endeavor of creating a more perfect union. He's only interested in grandeur and the authoritarian tendency to so thoroughly intertwine himself with his country that the two can't be separated. And whether it's the Oval Office redesign, the Kennedy Center takeover, or — in quintessential dictatorship fashion — banners of Trump's portrait cropping up around the nation's capital, the message Trump is sending is clear: We are changing how America is perceived, we will aggressively flaunt our power and wealth, and we will iconize Trump so that he becomes just as much of a symbol of the United States as its own flag. On the one hand, Trump's fixation on aesthetics can seem inconsequential — moves that can be easily undone by a future administration. On the other hand, they're a window into Trump's broader political project. After all, the way Trump is imposing his style and taste onto the American public is a projection of his ideals, and an attempt to change not just America's politics but its culture, too. There are two major components of Trump's attempt to rebrand America. Take Trump's desire to reinforce gender norms and project a certain type of hypermasculinity, all of which permeate his entire aesthetic. Some parts are less subtle than others: Kicking off his Kennedy Center takeover, for example, Trump announced on social media in February that he would “immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” That vision, apparently, had a lot to do with drag shows. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” he added in another post. His now-famous photo after he was almost assassinated last year — with his fist pumped in the air and blood dripping down his face as he yelled, “Fight, fight, fight” — was turned into a painting that replaced a portrait of Barack Obama in Trump's White House. The Department of Homeland Security in particular has been fond of sharing nostalgic paintings — like John Gast's “American Progress,” representing the imperialist manifest destiny doctrine, or Thomas Kinkade's “Morning Pledge,” depicting American schoolchildren gathered around the US flag in an idyllic suburb — with not-so-subtle captions like “Protect the Homeland” or “Remember your Homeland's Heritage.” (In a recruitment ad for Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS also posted on X, “Defend your culture!”) And there seems to be an everlasting nostalgia for a whiter America in Trump's White House, even in rhetoric articulated by top officials like Stephen Miller. Ultimately, this is all reflected in Trump's policy agenda. This is the kind of America that, as noted above, Miller and DHS are trying to promote. It's also the America that Trump feels comfortable being associated with. And that part has to do with reviving the old American ideal of individualism and self-reliance, the false notion that the most successful Americans are somehow self-made, and that there is no collective ideal worth pursuing more than one's own individual success. Trump's whole aesthetic, and the way he's specifically projecting his style onto American government, is a celebration of that philosophy. That individualistic philosophy is why Trump is so invested in remodeling the White House, the Kennedy Center, and even museums in his own style — to exhibit his image as the greatest marker of success. It's why, on the right, there's such an overwhelming cult following around a single individual. There's an obsession with personifying America, and Trump desperately wants to be that personification. And Trump seems to believe — or at the very least wants to convey — that he's the fittest of us all. Much of what has informed Trump's whole philosophy is his simplistic idea of success: that his many failures aren't necessarily a reflection on him, but that his success and wealth were achieved solely because of him. Because in Trump's world, so long as you amass an enormous amount of wealth and power (as both he and America have), then it's all worth showing off. It's like he told Playboy back in 1990: “Let me tell you, a display is a good thing…It's very important that people aspire to be successful. That's why Trump doesn't just want to be a political or historical figure, but a cultural icon that can represent American greatness long after he's gone. He wants the whole world to forever look at him. Trump is seizing on a flimsy pretext to fire one of the Fed's seven governors.﻿ Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. If Trump doesn't like you, Bill Pulte may be looking into your mortgage soon.</p>
