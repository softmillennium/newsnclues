                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has put a stop to further expansion of the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades and dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” ordering that its operations wind down within two months. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration The center may soon be completely empty as a judge upheld her decision late Wednesday ordering operations to wind down indefinitely. A protester stands outside the migrant detention dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Facility, July 12, 2025, in Ochopee, Fla. (AP Photo/Alexandra Rodriguez, file) Built in just a few days, the facility consists of chain-link cages surrounding large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. An Associated Press analysis of publicly available state spending data showed that Florida has signed at least $405 million in vendor contracts to build and operate the facility, which officials had initially estimated would cost $450 million a year to run. A previous AP review found that as of late July, the state had already allocated at least $245 million to run the site, which opened July 1. President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. It's also facing several legal challenges, including one that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled on late Wednesday. When asked, the Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say how many detainees remained and how many had been moved out since the judge's temporary injunction last week. “DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities,” the department said Thursday in an emailed statement. Environmental activist Jessica Namath, who has kept a nearly constant watch outside the facility's gates, said Thursday that fellow observers had seen metal framing for tents hauled out but no signs of the removal of FEMA trailers or portable bathrooms. “It definitely seems like they have been winding down operations,” Namath said. Detainees and advocates have described toilets that don't flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, although officials dispute such descriptions. The facility was already being emptied of detainees as of last week, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to a rabbi about chaplaincy services. Funding is central to the federal government's arguments that Williams' order should be overturned by an appellate court. Homeland Security attorneys said in a court filing this week that federal environmental law doesn't apply to a state like Florida, and the federal government isn't responsible for the detention center since it hasn't spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of the detention center. “No final federal funding decisions have been made,” the attorneys said.

Fox News' Carley Shimkus reports on the accusations against Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen DeGeneres faces renewed criticism after fresh accusations surfaced this week about her alleged toxic behavior on her long-running daytime talk show. A former cameraman on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" accused the television host of fostering a hostile workplace where staffers lived in fear and sometimes had to give up family commitments. According to staffers, DeGeneres, 67, disliked male employees and allegedly turned cold when they interacted with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, 52. Crew members also recalled what insiders called the infamous "Ellen gaze." Ellen DeGeneres faces new accusations of toxic workplace behavior from former talk show employees who describe a hostile environment. One former staffer described the look as "a queen searching for her next execution," adding, "She was terrifying." De Rossi was described as "nice" and approachable with the crew, but employees said their jobs felt at risk if DeGeneres saw them chatting with her spouse. "We went through a lot of male employees," the former staffer continued, alleging that DeGeneres once burned through nine stage managers in a single season. "We had a feeling she really didn't like guys." Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres married in 2008. Celebrity guests also faced difficulties on the set of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," according to former employees. The insider claimed celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment in which he embarrassed DeGeneres by saying she used rancid meat during a demo. They were doing a food test together, and Ellen offered him a sample first," the former employee recalled. It was about eight seasons before he came back." The insider claimed to the Daily Mail that celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was banned from returning after a tense cooking segment. One senior employee was allegedly asked to postpone a child's bone marrow transplant to avoid disrupting the show's production schedule. It remains unclear whether DeGeneres was aware of the situation. Ellen DeGeneres confirmed her move to the U.K. was made permanent after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election. In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. The uproar led to an internal investigation. In July 2020, BuzzFeed News reported that current and former employees blamed three producers for creating a culture of fear. In 2022, "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ended after 19 seasons. She referenced the allegations in her 2024 comedy special, "Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval." There, she said, "I got kicked out of show business for being mean. Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown. By 2025, DeGeneres had moved to the U.K. countryside, claiming she was the victim of "misogynistic" backlash after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surface Transportation Board to break a 2-2 tie before the body considers the largest railroad merger ever proposed. Board member Robert E. Primus said on LinkedIn that he received an email from the White House Wednesday night terminating the position he has held since he was appointed by Trump in his first term. Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific's acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition. He was named Board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Board member Patrick Fuchs to Chairman. This follows Trump's previous firings of board members at the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Reserve, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are all supposed to be independent agencies. “Robert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.” ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Primus said he doesn't think the firing is valid because the White House didn't offer any cause for it, and he plans to fight. He also rejected their explanation for the move because he has long tried to encourage railroads to serve every industry better and help them grow, but he has already been removed from the STB website. “I've been pro growth across the board in terms of encouraging growth in the freight rail network, which in turn will grow our national economy. So if that's not being in line with America first, then I don't know what America he's saying is first,” Primus said to The Associated Press. He said the firings at all these agencies threaten their independence and credibility. Primus said in his tenure the STB always strove to be impartial and apolitical. Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who serves on the Commerce Committee, said it's clear that “Donald Trump is trying to stack the deck so the federal government rubberstamps the merger as a huge favor for Wall Street and wealthy railroad owners.” She said Primus has been a fair regulator who worked hard to make sure railroads delivered for their customers and focused on safety. “The explanation provided for this decision — that his position has been “eliminated” — is nothing short of outrageous. Appointed bodies established through federal code are not designed to be erased at the whim of powerful corporate interests,” said the SMART-TD union that represents concductors. “This action is unprecedented, unlawful in spirit, and reeks of direct interference from hedge funds and the nation's largest rail carriers.” He hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal, but he doesn't think mergers will necessarily improve competition.</p>

A sign marks the town limit of Newbern, Ala., population 133 people, on July 27, 2023. A sign stand outs City Hall in Newbern, Ala., population 133 people, on July 27, 2023. NEWBERN, Ala. (AP) — The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after white residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve. Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent's 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government that drew national attention. Now, there ain't no doubt what they want for this town,” Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's “hand-me-down governance” and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020. What the town had been without is elections. Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held “hand-me-down” positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and “fraudulently re-appointed themselves as the town council.” “I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,” said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle. Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was “invalid.” Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, credited “Mayor Braxton's refusal to allow his constituents to be disenfranchised.” The group endorsed Braxton in the race. Braxton had one challenger this time — a white auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole. The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any “doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.” “It feels good the second time,” Braxton said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image released by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, shows a Ryobi-branded electric pressure washer. (the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — About 780,000 pressure washers sold at retailers like Home Depot are being recalled across the U.S. and Canada, due to a projectile hazard that has resulted in fractures and other injuries among some consumers. According to a Thursday recall notice published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, TTI Outdoor Power Equipment is recalling certain models of its Ryobi-branded electric pressure washers because the products' capacitor can overheat and burst, “causing parts to be forcefully ejected.” That poses serious impact risks to users or bystanders. To date, the CPSC notes, the power tool and equipment company has received 135 reports of capacitors overheating in the U.S. — including 41 reports of explosions that resulted in 32 injuries and/or fractures to consumers' fingers, hands, face and eyes. A corresponding notice from Health Canada noted that no additional incidents were reported in Canada. Consumers in possession of the now-recalled pressure washers are urged to stop using them immediately and visit Ryobi's recall website to learn about how to receive a free repair kit, which includes a replacement capacitor. The Ryobi washers under recall have model numbers RY142300 and RY142711VNM. In the U.S. these products were sold at Home Depot and Direct Tools Factory Outlet between July 2017 and June 2024, the CPSC notes, for about $300 to $400 in stores and online. Beyond Thursday's pressure washer recall, TTI also recalled Ryobi-branded mowers and hedge trimmers earlier this year — due to fire and laceration hazards, respectively.</p>

Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham also weighs in on the aftermath during 'America's Newsroom.' Vice President JD Vance slammed MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Thursday after she criticized prayer in the aftermath of the Annunciation Catholic School shooting in Minnesota. "We pray because our hearts are broken. We pray because we know that God works in mysterious ways, and can inspire us to further action," Vance said, adding, "Why do you feel the need to attack other people for praying when kids were just killed praying?" Vance speaks to supporters of President Donald Trump at an event on August 21, 2025, in Peachtree City, Georgia. In a follow-up post, Vance wrote, "Of all the weird left wing culture wars in the last few years, this is by far the most bizarre. ‘How dare you pray for innocent people in the midst of tragedy?!' Police have identified the shooter responsible for opening fire at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis on Wednesday, when they said two children were killed and 17 others were injured during morning Mass. Vance's remarks came in direct response to Psaki's Wednesday post slamming people for offering thoughts and prayers in response to the tragedy. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sparked a firestorm with her comments on the shooting at a church in Minneapolis. She wrote, "Prayer is not freaking enough. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. In a separate post, Psaki also used the tragedy to criticize the Trump administration's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. "When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy."

South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley said she would have taken the New York Knicks head coaching job if it had been offered. Staley, 55, interviewed for the position before the Knicks hired Mike Brown in July. "I would have had to do it. To break (that door) open," Staley said on the "Post Moves" podcast. But it's the freaking New York Knicks." South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley reacts during the semifinal of the NCAA Women's Tournament against the Texas Longhorns at Amalie Arena on April 4, 2025, in Tampa, Florida. Staley was one of many candidates the Knicks interviewed for their head coaching vacancy. The Knicks also interviewed former Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, former Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori. Staley said she thought she did well in the interview but questioned whether she hurt her chances by asking the Knicks how they would handle the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach. "How, if you hired me as the first female head coach in the NBA, would it impact your daily job? There's going to be the media and all this other stuff that you have to deal with that you didn't have to deal with and don't have to deal with when you hire a male. That got them to thinking, ‘Maybe she's right.'" South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley during the national championship game against the Connecticut Huskies at Amalie Arena on April 6, 2025, in Tampa, Florida. "So, I shot myself in the foot by being inquisitive and asking all those darn questions," Staley said. University of South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley answers a question during the University of Mount Union's Schooler Lecture speaker series on April 23, 2025, in Alliance, Ohio. Staley is one of the most successful college basketball coaches of all time. She has won three national championships, reached seven Final Fours and been named AP Coach of the Year twice. She coached at Temple for eight seasons before joining South Carolina ahead of the 2008-09 season and is set to enter her 18th season with the Gamecocks.

Hollywood star George Clooney, 64, skipped a string of major appearances at the Venice Film Festival, as he battles a sinus infection, his rep confirmed with Fox News Digital. "George has been diagnosed with a sinus infection and is under doctor's orders to cut back all activities today," Clooney's rep said Thursday. Clooney was a no-show at a press junket for "Jay Kelly," his latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, and missed a high-profile dinner with co-stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern. George Clooney is seen at Hotel Excelsior during the 82nd Venice International Film Festival on Aug. 27, 2025, in Italy. The "Ocean's Eleven" actor was reportedly seen boarding a water taxi at approximately 4 p.m. local time Wednesday as he quietly left the Hotel Excelsior to rest up — skipping nearly every major press obligation for the day.

"As you may know, George Clooney is not going to be here because he has a bad sinus infection. We really hope, and I think he should be on the red carpet tonight. Director Baumbach lightened the mood, and quipped, "Even movie stars get sick." Clooney arrived in Venice on Tuesday with his wife, Amal. The couple arrived by boat in elegantly coordinated Italian Riviera–inspired ensembles. Amal Clooney and George Clooney arrive in Venice ahead of the 82nd Venice International Film Festival on Aug. 26, 2025. Amal stunned in a chic light-yellow dress, with a halter top and gold belt cinched at the waist. She accessorized with gold earrings and a white mini-purse, as the Hollywood couple walked hand in hand through the Venice streets. The Oscar winner stepped out in a fitted black polo, beige slim-fit pants and brown suede loafers, completing the look with a matching belt and sunglasses. It's still dark on top, but it's gray at the bottom," he said during an appearance on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" where he wore a hat to "hide" the growth. Clooney admitted he hadn't dyed his hair in two months, since the beginning of the production. "So you get that really nice-looking grow-out of gray," he said. Three years later, in 2017, they welcomed twins Alexander and Ella. Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an Entertainment Writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez's lawyers rejected her firing by the Trump administration, arguing that only President Donald Trump himself could fire her. Later that evening, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that Monarez was “no longer” head of the CDC after a protracted disagreement with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. In a statement early Thursday morning, Monarez's lawyers once again rebuffed the White House after it said she had been “terminated.” We have notified the White House Counsel of our position,” he added. Zaid is a longtime critic of Trump, representing many disaffected staffers suing the administration during his second term. Her lawyers argued she was being targeted for refusing “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives.” Monarez had sent a note to CDC employees on Aug. 12, shortly after a shooting targeting CDC headquarters, warning that the “dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.” The Trump administration sought her resignation on Wednesday, though she refused to do so. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner roughly an hour later that Monarez had been terminated. “As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brandishing his loyalty to President Donald Trump and keeping retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) at arm's length has proven to be an early, lucrative campaign fundraising tactic for Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) in his quest to replace the former Senate GOP leader. “I don't just talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr, serving his seventh term, told the Washington Examiner in an interview. But despite his close relationship with the president and backing from a string of MAGA allies in Congress, Barr remains in pursuit of the coveted Trump endorsement. So too are the two men with whom he's locked in a bitter primary challenge for Kentucky's open Senate seat next year, being vacated by McConnell: former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and wealthy businessman Nate Morris. Discussions with Trump or those in his orbit are to remain “private conversations,” Barr said. “There's politicians who like to talk about supporting President Trump,” Barr said. “There's politicians who like to talk about the One Big, Beautiful Bill. Although limited independent polling on one of the nastier Republican Senate primaries of the 2026 midterm elections, surveys earlier this year suggested Cameron had a commanding double-digit lead. In a statement to the Washington Examiner, Morris condemned Barr as a phony MAGA loyalist, citing episodes like donating through his leadership PAC to now-former House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and accused him of flip-flopping on issues now that he's running for higher office. Barr tried for years to sabotage President Trump's tariff agenda. He spent millions of taxpayer dollars on DEI nonsense,” Morris said. “Barr even called people who want to deport illegals ‘nativists' and funded Congress's latest attempt at mass amnesty. Opponents have criticized Morris for a 2021 campaign donation to former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, who went on to run for president against Trump, and his past promotions of DEI as a former CEO. Cameron was once considered his protege, and Barr previously referred to him as a “mentor.” “He's a creature of D.C. who spent decades shaking down Big Banks and Big Pharma for checks to fund his re-brand from moderate RINO to whatever this is now,” Cameron Campaign Manager Taylor Zanazzi said in a statement. Analysis by Govtrack.us, an independent Congress tracker, rates Barr as skewed the farthest politically right among his House colleagues from Kentucky. There is no direct comparison available for Cameron and Morris. The Republican trio has sought to tap into their most conservative ideologies while keeping a safe distance from McConnell, who has a prior relationship with all three from his decades atop Kentucky GOP politics. Morris has went a step further in seeking to keep distance from McConnell. An establishment figure with an icy relationship toward Trump, McConnell has proven to be a political liability in a modern-day Republican primary, even if that race is for the very seat he's vacating. But it offers a window into where supporters and potential voters are most eager to put their money, and it could play a role in who other influential Republicans choose to back. Fundraising data available through June showed that Barr raised a hefty $6.1 million, compared to Cameron's roughly $530,000. He launched a seven-figure ad buy just days after declaring his candidacy in July. McConnell has shown no desire to get involved in the chaotic three-way contest. Wealthy party donors linked to McConnell and other GOP leaders have already put millions of dollars into kneecapping Morris's candidacy. What I do know about are my donors,” Barr said. 1, that I'm a proven ‘America First' conservative who believes in limited government, free enterprises, strong national defense.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Earlier this month, Katie Miller launched her new podcast with a specific origin myth. Miller, a former Trump administration official and wife of Stephen Miller, declared that by creating a lifestyle podcast for conservative women, she was filling a hole in the media ecosystem. “For years, I've seen that there isn't a place for conservative women to gather online,” Miller said in a video posted to X. Her caption added, “As a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn't a podcast for women like myself.” Conservative women have arguably never had more places to gather online and talk about their lifestyle concerns — especially when it comes to motherhood and wellness. This media ecosystem has recently been dubbed the “womanosphere,” and it is booming. They can get their celebrity gossip with a healthy strain of reactionary conspiracy theories from Candace Owens. They can get anti-feminist cultural commentary from YouTubers like Brett Cooper. They can get MAHA-inflected health care advice from Alex Clark's Culture Apothecary talk show. They can watch the agrarian fantasies of tradwives like Ballerina Farm's Hannah Neeleman. And they can listen to conservative women's lifestyle podcasts, like Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey's Relatable. Many of these women, by dint of their jobs as full-time content creators and podcasters, are also working moms, as they are happy to discuss at length in their content. Still, the sense that Miller is operating from a defensive crouch, grabbing for access to a feminine frivolity she feels she has been denied, suffuses her new show, The Katie Miller Podcast. “Conservative women never get asked these questions,” Miller adds. It's hard to know what exclusion Miller is referring to exactly (what is Ivanka Trump's brand if not being a conservative woman with beauty secrets? ), but the idea that it might be true seems necessary to Miller's conception of her project. A transgressive posture is one of the characteristics of the womanosphere: an implication that they are saying hard truths and asking tough questions about things the liberal elites don't want women to know, that they are reclaiming their due from the cultural gatekeepers who didn't want them to have it. As the womanosphere booms, it's taken on an odd, fraught position. Listening to (or watching) Miller's podcast isn't interesting because of the beauty secrets divulged; it's revealing because of the glimpse it gives us into Republicans' current vexed relationship with femininity. To give Miller her due, it's true that there are few spaces these days for conservative women in traditional media, like old-school glossy magazines. Lifestyle media for women has long been inherently conservative-leaning, with its focus on dieting and man-catching and home-building, but the post-Jezebel generation of women's media took on an explicitly feminist lens. Even the flagship Vogue, which generally dedicates a cover to the sitting first lady, declined to feature Melania Trump during Donald Trump's first term and, so far, his second as well. Miller's podcast fits neatly into the flourishing new ecosystem. There is no feasible way to build a lucrative career out of being an anti-woke woman, and failing to land a feature in Vogue is censorship at its finest. “The Soy Right is being oppressed and they want you to know it,” she wrote. … While the right is winning cultural and political victories nonstop lately, that's not enough. Meanwhile, harping on the false idea that there's a hole in the marketplace allows her podcast to take on a sense of heightened importance. If the world were fair, Miller implies, someone else would have asked her to describe her beauty routine a long time ago. This idea that Republican women are never given credit for their beauty stands uneasily next to recent Republican attempts to claim the existence of beautiful women as a win for their own side. Over the past two years, the right has variously claimed Sydney Sweeney, Hawk Tuah Girl, and sorority rush videos as cultural phenomena that are by their nature Republican-coded and surely infuriate the left. In the manosphere, the obsession with hot girls shades into raunch culture, a performative, overwhelming ocean of sleaze in which the supposed celebration of hot girls also runs right alongside an attitude of degradation. The nascent womanosphere, however, tends towards purity culture, an obsession with Christian virtue and righteousness that is the mirror image of raunch culture. Miller makes much of her status as a wife and mother. Her fellow womanosphere podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey calls out listeners for watching movies about “hot and heavy sinful romance” rather than focusing on “the Biblical marriage that God has called you into.” Brittany Martinez, the founder of Evie magazine, says she started her publication after watching the traditional glossies “encourage casual sex and lie to readers about its emotional ramifications.” As I've discussed extensively before, while purity culture and raunch culture might appear to oppose one another, they're two sides of the same coin, united by a shared premise that women's sexuality should always exist in service to men. They are also a trap: The raunchy cool girls get called sluts. The only way to play the game and win is to somehow be both raunchy and pure at the same time, an impossible status that was only ever held, very briefly, by a young Britney Spears before the world crashed down around her. The womanosphere is animated by a sense of a broken promise: that these women were told they would receive attention and credit that never came. The Katie Miller Podcast says it's an attempt to rectify that broken promise. In reality, however, it's just one more entry into a crowded conservative media landscape, powered by the same old warped sense of victimization. ﻿NFL dance squads and sorority rush dances have become the front lines of gender anxiety. Pumpkin spice is America's most hatable seasonal flavor. But Starbucks is leaning in even more heavily this year. ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just when Manchester United fans thought it couldn't get any worse, up steps fourth-division side Grimsby Town to plunge the once-great club even further in the mire. The League Two minnow – sitting three divisions below Manchester United – was well worthy of its League Cup win on Wednesday, beating Ruben Amorim's team 2-2 (12-11) in a marathon penalty shootout that came after a rollercoaster game at Grimsby's Blundell Park. Two late goals from the Red Devils, though, looked to have denied Grimsby a historic victory, but the underdog bit back in an astonishing shootout which United manager Amorim couldn't bring himself to watch. And while the night should be remembered for the Grimsby Town celebrations at full-time – it is arguably the greatest result in the club's history – it's hard not to question what on earth is going on at United. “I just want to apologize to our fans,” a furious Amorim told ITV Sport after the humiliating defeat. He later added to reporters: “We were completely lost and it's hard to explain and that's why I think they spoke really loud. “I know the best team won today. It was really fair the football today.” The Portuguese manager has now been at Manchester United for nine months and pressure to get results is looming larger than ever – he has so far overseen just 16 wins in 44 games. Given he arrived part-way through last season and told fans he would need time to implement his style of play, many gave him some leeway for the team's disastrous 15th-place finish in the league. But after an entire preseason schedule and backing in the transfer market – the club has signed an entirely new frontline in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Šeško and Matheus Cunha – there is very little credit left in the bank. To put it simply, there is still so much wrong with the team which has picked up just one point from its first two Premier League games of the new season. The goalkeeper situation, for one, has become untenable. Both new signings, Cunha and Mbeumo, missed vital penalties in Wednesday's defeat. “It was obviously not good enough today,” United defender Diogo Dalot told ITV Sport. “We cannot give up, whatever the situation but, like I said, it's not good enough and I think its something we need to look deeply into ourselves. Amorim was praised on his arrival at the club for having a distinct style of play. The 3-4-3 formation had worked so well at his former club, Sporting CP, and many felt a strong identity was exactly what a rudderless Manchester United needed. But Amorim's dedication to his system, which was once deemed a strength, is now turning into a weakness. Even if it's not working, or if the players are struggling to adapt, the manager is seemingly not changing his mind. Last season, the Portuguese boss said things would get worse before they got better. “It's not about the formation,” Amorim insisted again on Wednesday. There is still a week left in this summer's transfer window and Manchester United will likely be busy – perhaps more so with outgoings. There are still several players, including Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, who are seemingly surplus to requirements at United, as Amorim looks to freshen up a team which has been thrown from one disaster to the next in recent years. The club's new minority owner, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, has backed the need for change, investing in a renovated training center and promising to build a new world-class stadium. Already, though, this ‘new' Manchester United has lurched into its latest calamitous chapter. Next up for the team is a Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Nothing but a comfortable win will ease the growing pressure on Amorim and his job as manager of the Red Devils.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ongoing National Guard mission in Washington, DC, as part of President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in the city, is costing roughly $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN. Kate Kuzminski, director of studies at the Center for New American Security, told CNN that rough calculations show the mission is likely costing more than $1 million a day, when taking into account the pay for more than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed, housing, travel, food, fuel, and other logistical needs. That estimate is drawn from costs from the 2020 mobilization of roughly 5,000 National Guardsmen to DC, which was estimated to cost more than $2 million a day. Retired Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously served as the chief of force structure and investment division at the Office of Management and Budget, also told CNN the estimated cost comes to roughly $1 million a day. Those estimates don't include the costs from other federal law enforcement agencies involved in the mission. The Pentagon and National Guard did not provide cost estimates for the mission, despite having been able to do so for a similar mission just two months ago. “We won't know the total cost until the mission concludes,” a defense official told CNN on Wednesday. It's not unusual to not have a firm idea of the final price tag for a mission like the one ongoing in DC, as logistical needs can adjust over time, and it remains unclear if service members' orders will be extended or not. Two US officials told CNN there was likely a rough estimate available for the DC mission, or one being calculated, but that only the most senior levels had permission to speak about it due to the political nature of the mission and the White House's involvement. “We know that funding is made available, we just don't know the estimate or who's approving it or how much is available,” the second US official said, adding that “everybody wants to have their hands in” communication surrounding the mission due to the White House's interest in it. A third US official said it's likely a mixture of both — that a cost estimate is generally still being calculated, but that until senior levels of the Pentagon or White House determine they want to release that information, it won't be shared. Still, the Pentagon was able to give a cost estimate for the LA mission in June just three days after roughly 4,000 Guardsmen were mobilized to assist law enforcement. “The current estimated cost is $134 million which is largely just (temporary duty) cost, travel, housing, food, etc.,” Bryn MacDonnell, a special assistant to the secretary of defense and official performing the duties of the under secretary of defense, told Congress on June 10. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum mobilizing the first batch of 2,000 Guardsmen on June 7. As of Tuesday morning, there were 2,254 National Guard troops in DC — more than 1,300 of them from the six states who sent personnel to support the DC National Guard. While some troops are stationed through the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, soldiers and airmen have also begun helping with “beautification projects,” doing things like picking up trash, replanting grass, and spreading mulch. In addition to the service members' pay during the mission while they are on orders, the total cost of the mission also includes basic logistical needs like hotel rooms for out-of-state troops, food and water, fuel for vehicles, laundry service, and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In 1990, Playboy published an interview with Donald Trump in which the future president offered his thoughts on foreign affairs, the death penalty, and why he puts his name on everything. He also reflected on the meaning — or, perhaps, meaninglessness — of life. You know, it is all a rather sad situation,” he said. It's no secret that every president cares about how they'll be remembered. But that pithy, 35-year-old quote explains a whole lot about Trump, his rise to power, and how he governs today. He doesn't only want a legacy, be it good or bad. What Trump really wants is to — in some way or another — live forever, and he's only just getting started. By now, Trump's imprint on the world is indelible. His ability to wiggle out of legal consequences for his corruption and lawlessness has ushered in a new era of presidential immunity. But to fully understand Trump's broader political project and how he has successfully transformed America, you have to recognize that he isn't only a political figure, but something much bigger: a cultural icon in the crudest sense. It's that side of Trump that begins to explain one of the weirdest aspects of his presidency: his focus on aesthetics and how aggressively he is forcing his particular style and taste onto America. Whether it's making the White House look more like his private residences or turning the arts into his own pet project, Trump is trying to fundamentally change how America's government is perceived. Put another way, when we look at the government's buildings and institutions, Trump wants us to see only him — even after he's gone. It's not entirely accurate to say that Trump has always sought fame. He injected himself into the American zeitgeist decades ago, giving tabloids enough gossip to fill their pages with scandal after scandal since the 1970s. That never-ending pursuit of omnipresence has shaped Trump's political career and presidencies, perhaps more than anything else. He sought to befriend Hillary Clinton — donating to her Senate campaigns and the Clinton Foundation — before eventually running against her in 2016. And while there are some policies and ideas that Trump has long been committed to, like tariffs or racist conspiracy theories, he has always been more devoted to himself than any policy agenda. Trump's political project, in other words, is to rebrand America. He's seemingly not so desperate to eke out wins for the Republican Party so much as he is trying to remake America in his own image. Gone are the days where America is promoted as an idea — a nation of immigrants or an unfinished project that every generation of Americans strives to improve — because in his eyes, America is Trump. A lot of what Trump values today — real estate, television ratings, Time magazine covers — can be traced back to that era, when all of those things, at least to Trump and those running in his circles, were markers of clout. That period was defined by greed and ostentatious displays of wealth. In the Playboy interview, Trump was specifically asked about why he feels so comfortable showing off his riches, especially given how much poverty could be seen on the streets. It's very important that people aspire to be successful. Trump's quest to own the famed Plaza Hotel in New York City, which he bought for $400 million in 1988, ended in spectacular failure, with the hotel filing for bankruptcy just a few years after the purchase. I have many assets like that and the end result is that they are always much more valuable than what you paid for them.” Just like that venture, Trump's vision for America today is remarkably shallow. It doesn't matter how functional America's institutions or even economy actually are. And a shiny veneer that flaunts wealth and military might — be it through a gilded White House or a B-2 stealth bomber flyover — is perfectly adequate, even if it's entirely hollow or bankrupt on the inside. In both terms, he has issued executive orders to change the look of federal buildings, discarding new architectural styles and instead promoting grand neoclassical buildings that mimic ancient empires. The move showed how invested Trump personally is in the culture wars, so much so that he wants to be directly involved in decisions about what kind of art Americans should enjoy. Trump is now even planning on hosting the Kennedy Center Honors this year, saying he was “very involved” in selecting the honorees. And, according to the New York Times, Trump has considered giving posthumous awards to Luciano Pavarotti, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth. For instance, he issued an executive order that discourages the Smithsonian Institution from putting up displays that portray America and its past negatively. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,” Trump said in a recent social media post. “We have the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, and we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.” To be sure, the United States has always been deeply invested in how it is perceived, both domestically and abroad, and has always projected itself as the “shining city upon a hill,” as Ronald Reagan often liked to say. And while there's no shortage of big egos among presidents, they often, at the very least, tried to gesture that America was bigger than just them. What is different about Trump is that he is not so interested in the idealistic vision of America — or in presenting America as an idea, a neverending endeavor of creating a more perfect union. He's only interested in grandeur and the authoritarian tendency to so thoroughly intertwine himself with his country that the two can't be separated. And whether it's the Oval Office redesign, the Kennedy Center takeover, or — in quintessential dictatorship fashion — banners of Trump's portrait cropping up around the nation's capital, the message Trump is sending is clear: We are changing how America is perceived, we will aggressively flaunt our power and wealth, and we will iconize Trump so that he becomes just as much of a symbol of the United States as its own flag. On the one hand, Trump's fixation on aesthetics can seem inconsequential — moves that can be easily undone by a future administration. On the other hand, they're a window into Trump's broader political project. After all, the way Trump is imposing his style and taste onto the American public is a projection of his ideals, and an attempt to change not just America's politics but its culture, too. There are two major components of Trump's attempt to rebrand America. Take Trump's desire to reinforce gender norms and project a certain type of hypermasculinity, all of which permeate his entire aesthetic. Some parts are less subtle than others: Kicking off his Kennedy Center takeover, for example, Trump announced on social media in February that he would “immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” That vision, apparently, had a lot to do with drag shows. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” he added in another post. His now-famous photo after he was almost assassinated last year — with his fist pumped in the air and blood dripping down his face as he yelled, “Fight, fight, fight” — was turned into a painting that replaced a portrait of Barack Obama in Trump's White House. The Department of Homeland Security in particular has been fond of sharing nostalgic paintings — like John Gast's “American Progress,” representing the imperialist manifest destiny doctrine, or Thomas Kinkade's “Morning Pledge,” depicting American schoolchildren gathered around the US flag in an idyllic suburb — with not-so-subtle captions like “Protect the Homeland” or “Remember your Homeland's Heritage.” (In a recruitment ad for Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), DHS also posted on X, “Defend your culture!”) And there seems to be an everlasting nostalgia for a whiter America in Trump's White House, even in rhetoric articulated by top officials like Stephen Miller. Ultimately, this is all reflected in Trump's policy agenda. This is the kind of America that, as noted above, Miller and DHS are trying to promote. It's also the America that Trump feels comfortable being associated with. And that part has to do with reviving the old American ideal of individualism and self-reliance, the false notion that the most successful Americans are somehow self-made, and that there is no collective ideal worth pursuing more than one's own individual success. Trump's whole aesthetic, and the way he's specifically projecting his style onto American government, is a celebration of that philosophy. That individualistic philosophy is why Trump is so invested in remodeling the White House, the Kennedy Center, and even museums in his own style — to exhibit his image as the greatest marker of success. It's why, on the right, there's such an overwhelming cult following around a single individual. There's an obsession with personifying America, and Trump desperately wants to be that personification. And Trump seems to believe — or at the very least wants to convey — that he's the fittest of us all. Much of what has informed Trump's whole philosophy is his simplistic idea of success: that his many failures aren't necessarily a reflection on him, but that his success and wealth were achieved solely because of him. Because in Trump's world, so long as you amass an enormous amount of wealth and power (as both he and America have), then it's all worth showing off. It's like he told Playboy back in 1990: “Let me tell you, a display is a good thing…It's very important that people aspire to be successful. That's why Trump doesn't just want to be a political or historical figure, but a cultural icon that can represent American greatness long after he's gone. He wants the whole world to forever look at him. Trump is seizing on a flimsy pretext to fire one of the Fed's seven governors.﻿ Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. If Trump doesn't like you, Bill Pulte may be looking into your mortgage soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School. Westman shared a “manifesto” on social media that is being investigated, police said. It has prompted some Democrats to renew calls for gun control. Our live coverage of the Minneapolis school shooting is now here. The first was at about 2 p.m. on Tuesday in south Minneapolis, when a shooter killed one person and wounded six others, KARE reported, citing police. Minneapolis Police said Wednesday they did not know if the three shootings were connected. DNC chair Ken Martin announced the shooting had occurred “no more than 10 minutes from where we are now” and urged anyone with medical training to help if they could. The DNC meeting's closing session, which was scheduled to last three hours, ended after less than 12 minutes. Martin, a native of Minnesota, began the shortened session by saying, “We are heartbroken.” “This is the first week of school for students at Annunciation. These families woke up this morning to celebrate milestones in their children's lives,” Martin said. Democratic leaders opened this week's summer meeting by honoring Hortman's legacy. Many Democrats are renewing calls for new gun control measures in the wake of Wednesday's shooting. “It's so riveting hearing about any school shooting no matter what profession you're in, but when you work in a school, it hurts just a little bit more,” they said. “My teaching community is constantly reminded about how, one day, we may need to stand in between these children and violence,” Paulson added. Paulson shared video from one of several vigils were held across the Twin Cities Wednesday evening. The video, from Minneapolis' Lynnhurst Park, shows residents standing in silence and holding candles while music plays over loudspeakers. Vincent Francoual, a prominent Minneapolis chef, told CNN's Laura Coates his daughter, who was in Mass at Annunciation Catholic School, is traumatized after surviving the deadly shooting. There have been 44 US school shootings this year, according to a CNN analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety. That number is one higher than the number of school shootings, 43, that had happened at this point in the year in 2024. The years since the pandemic have seen a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 all setting records since at least 2008, when CNN began tracking such events across public and private K-12 schools and colleges/universities across the United States. An uncle of the Minneapolis shooter has called today's attack at a Catholic school Mass “an unspeakable tragedy,” according to the Associated Press. He said he did not know the shooter, Robin Westman, well and last saw his relative at a family wedding several years ago. “I wish (Westman) had shot me instead of innocent schoolchildren,” Heleringer said. This post has been updated with more information from AP. The family of former Democratic Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, who were killed in June during a series of attacks, said today's shooting was a “senseless act of violence” and called on elected officials to act on “common-sense measures.” “Mark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that families should be safe in their homes,” the statement says. “We hope this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common-sense measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said locked doors during Mass may have helped prevent an already “unthinkable” tragedy at Annunciation Catholic Church from becoming even worse. “A number of the doors had been locked once Mass began, which is part of their normal procedure,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Trump wrote that early warning signs “are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions.” “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society — beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Fourteen other children and three elderly parishioners were wounded while marking the first week of class at Annunciation Catholic School. “I don't have information about where specifically those weapons were purchased, but they were purchased lawfully,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. The state doesn't differentiate between open and concealed carry. Local and federal investigators searching for a motive in the deadly Minneapolis shooting have conducted four search warrants at several locations, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. “One is the church, and then there are three residences in the Twin Cities metro that are associated with the shooter,” O'Hara told CNN's Kaitlan Collins tonight, adding that at least one scene is still being processed. “What we've seen so far is just a variety of hate,” said O'Hara. Earlier Wednesday, O'Hara said the shooter, Robin Westman, released a “manifesto” on YouTube that “included some disturbing writings.” It was just before 8:30 a.m. when young children were attending Mass at a beloved Catholic school in Minneapolis to mark the first week of classes. Moments later, those students and their families' lives were forever changed after a shooter killed two praying children and injured more than a dozen other people. CNN's Tori B. Powell, Aditi Sangal, Chris Boyette, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Chelsea Bailey, Andi Babineau, Morgan Rimmer, Jill Martin, Samantha Waldenberg, John Miller, Mark Morales, Holmes Lybrand, Barbie Latza Nadeau, Michael Rios, Emma Tucker, Matt Lait, Taylor Romine contributed reporting. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett about the mass shooting that killed two Catholic school children attending mass in Minneapolis, calling for love rather than hatred in the wake of this tragedy. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed gratitude for Annunciation Catholic School staff, who he said “threw their bodies on top of children” to protect them as a shooter opened fire this morning. “They did the right thing to protect what could have been so many more children dead,” Frey said of school faculty tonight at a vigil in the community. Annunciation Catholic School alumni Kailee Poling, 27, said she was attending the vigil with her husband and daughter. Poling, who attended the school from first through eighth grades, spoke through tears as she said, “you never think it's going to happen in your community.” “Being a parent, I just can't imagine what those kids went through this morning,” she said. “Annunciation is such a tight knit community that when I heard the news, I was just really impacted knowing it's so close to home and knowing it's a community I've been a part of for so long.” Paul Hartzheim, 48, said he attended the vigil to be connected to his community in Minneapolis where he's lived his entire adult life. Vigil attendee Rhonda Miska, 45, serves at another Catholic parish said she came to support her fellow Catholics after the tragedy. Laura Pueringer, 31, from Richfield, went to Annunciation's sister school and said she was reflecting on the moments she learned about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and 9/11 after today's shooting, which propelled her to attend the vigil to call for change. Klobuchar said this is a crucial moment for change, saying that children praying during a new school year shows how desperately it's needed. “These kids praying in a church, packed into the pews, joyful about their first week in school, their new teacher, and then getting shot through church windows. If that isn't enough to move people that we have to make some changes in this country, I don't know what is,” she said. The vigil is taking place at the gymnasium of Academy of Holy Angels High School, which was seen packed with people in attendance. Tim Walz and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar are present at the vigil. One mother, whose two kids survived the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School today, expressed relief that her children were not hurt, but anger at the long trend of gun violence in schools. “I have such mixed feelings right now, so many of them. But I am just incredibly grateful that this school did and had been preparing and also just incredibly sad and angry that this has to be a thing in any school,” Carla Maldonado told CNN, getting emotional. The school has active shooter drills “very often,” her husband, Pedro Maldonado, said. Carla Maldonado said when they arrived to the church earlier today, her husband began yelling for their two children. Carla Maldonado said school shootings and gun violence in classrooms is starting to feel like a “broken record.” The mother pointed out that she's not the first parent to have these kinds of feelings and fears.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Transportation announced Wednesday it is planning to reclaim management over Washington's Union Station, a move that comes after President Donald Trump's escalated deployment of troops in the nation's capital. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the train station “has fallen into disrepair,” in a statement. “By reclaiming station management, we will help make this city safe and beautiful at a fraction of the cost.” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN that the transportation department wants to “restore (Union Station) has a transportation hub that benefits our nation's capital.” He added: “President Trump pledged to Make DC Safe & Beautiful Again, and under Secretary Duffy's leadership, the Department of Transportation is taking historic action to reinvest in Union Station.” Trump said last Friday he will also be asking Congress for $2 billion to make DC “beautiful.” Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was supportive of the president's efforts to improve infrastructure in the district, adding that if it takes on a larger role in Union Station, it could “be a very significant and good investment for the region.” “If it's about what Union Station needs for its total transformation, that would be an amazing initiative for the federal government to take on,” the Democrat said at a separate news conference. The department of transportation has owned Union Station since the early 1980s but its control has been gradually reduced under various agreements and leases. National Guard troops in Washington, DC, begin carrying weapons Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week authorized members of the National Guard deployed to the capital to begin carrying weapons, marking a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon that previously indicated National Guard members could be armed if circumstances warranted. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites specifically they'll be assisting with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a new order from a Utah judge, who ruled that the state's congressional map must be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections, was “absolutely unconstitutional.” “How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. United States District Judge Dianna Gibson took issue with Utah's all-Republican House delegation, saying the Republican-controlled state legislature illegally overruled a 2018 ballot measure designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. “How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices, and weaken the rule of law.” Utah, a predominantly Republican state, backed Trump by more than 20 points in the last presidential election. However, Salt Lake County remains a Democratic stronghold that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last November. Redistricting has triggered an intense battle between Republicans and Democrats over who can constitute the House majority. Texas started aggressively redistricting to strip Democrats of five seats, followed by California's efforts to raise the issue for a popular vote this fall. Other states, such as Maryland and New York, are considering similar plans.</p>
