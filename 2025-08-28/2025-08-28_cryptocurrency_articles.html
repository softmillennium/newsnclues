                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a US financial regulator, announced on Thursday that offshore crypto exchanges now have a pathway to legally serve US-based clients by registering under the Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) framework. Allowing offshore exchanges to serve US residents can potentially increase liquidity in the crypto markets and remove the silos that have kept crypto trapped within regions. Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, is currently inaccessible to US residents. This keeps US residents in a walled garden of crypto companies eligible to do business in the United States. Related: CFTC seeks to allow spot crypto trading on registered exchanges The lack of clear regulations caused an exodus of crypto companies from the US between 2021 and 2024, and led to a majority of crypto trading volume occurring on offshore exchanges. Edwin Mata, an attorney and CEO of tokenization platform Brickken, told Cointelegraph that ambiguous regulations have fragmented the policy landscape in the US. The CFTC is accepting public feedback for its crypto policies to craft regulations that will protect financial market participants without creating an undue burden that drives innovative projects offshore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the financial industry, security has always been about staying one step ahead of attackers. For years, firms relied on perimeter defenses: firewalls, intrusion detection, layered passwords. That is why zero-trust security has become a standard in digital infrastructure. This requires fine-grained access controls, maintaining constant authentication, and following the principle of least privilege. However, even zero-trust has limitations, particularly in environments that process massive volumes of sensitive financial data. Managing dynamic access policies at scale is challenging, and insider threats persist as a risk when administrators themselves hold too much centralized power. Now, new research suggests that blockchain may help solve those problems by embedding zero-trust controls directly into distributed ledgers like Ethereum. The migration of financial services to API-driven ecosystems has accelerated both innovation and vulnerability. Open banking and open finance require banks to share customer data with third parties through APIs, which can number in the thousands across a large institution, with each API call representing a potential attack surface. Zero-trust approaches aim to manage this sprawl by authenticating every request in real-time, regardless of its origin. Yet in practice, most implementations rely on centralized systems and policy engines. Employees at payment processors, digital banks, and crypto exchanges often have access to transactional data, customer KYC documents, or even private keys. High-profile failures, such as rogue employees at exchanges siphoning funds or misuse of this data in open banking, have made regulators wary. Embedding zero-trust controls into blockchain could assuage these risks in three key ways: Of course, the blockchain-zero-trust hybrid is not a silver bullet. These are non-trivial hurdles, bit if they can be addressed, the potential payoff is significant. This research is timely as fintechs are already experimenting with blockchain in adjacent security domains. Zero-trust was the first step, shifting the mindset from “keep attackers out” to “verify everything, always.” Blockchain may represent the next step, transforming security from a matter of policy enforcement to a matter of mathematical guarantee. Today, firms spend billions on overlapping security solutions, audits, and compliance. A shared blockchain-based access control layer could reduce redundancy, streamline regulatory reporting, and standardize best practices. Combining the two may feel ambitious today, but it could quickly become necessary as data sharing explodes with open finance, embedded payments, and tokenized assets. The research is still experimental, but the concept is clear: Ethereum-based smart contracts could anchor a new generation of transparent, auditable, tamper-resistant access control systems for fintech. In a sector where reputations can be lost overnight after a breach, that kind of trust may prove to be the most valuable asset of all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase's Layer-2 network, Base, has become one of the most active blockchain ecosystems by NFT trading volume, surpassing Solana and Abstract. DappRadar's blockchain analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a recent research report that Base has become a popular place for creators, thanks to cheap mints, creator-friendly tools, and “speculation around a potential airdrop.” “Base NFTs hit $122M in trading volume and 6.7M sales in 2025, with June marking a breakout moment (+336% MoM volume),” Gherghelas noted. The surge has been fueled by top collections such as DX Terminal, Onchain Gaias, Oracle Patron, Based Punks, and Get Based, blending retro-futuristic art, interactive gameplay, and, in the case of Onchain Gaias, the ability for holders to train AI-enabled agents across Web3 ecosystems. The main driver behind Base's NFT boom is Zora, an open-source NFT protocol that lets creators launch low-cost NFTs and drops on Base for less than one U.S. dollar, while also offering an ERC-20 layer for creator tokens. “Since July alone, Zora on Base has recorded 1.6 million tokens minted, generating $470 million in trading volume and $3.4 million in creator royalties,” Gherghelas wrote. Data from DefiLlama shows that starting in July, Zora's revenue jumped to $4.7 million, marking a more than 312,000% increase compared to Q4 2024. Amid the recent uptick in NFT activity, OpenSea has overtaken Blur over the past 90 days, with trading volume of $389 million, compared to Blur's $312 million, according to Token Terminal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Saylor's high-stakes Bitcoin strategy is facing a sharp market backlash, as shares of Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) formerly MicroStrategy have fallen 15% this month. Once celebrated as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company's premium over its Bitcoin assets has eroded to 1.57, down from 3.4 after Donald Trump's re-election. A key pressure point stems from tepid demand for Strategy's newly issued preferred stock, which raised only $47 million, falling short of expectations and forcing a return to common-share issuance despite earlier promises to limit dilution. The model Saylor popularized borrowing and raising equity to accumulate Bitcoin has inspired other treasury-focused firms that now collectively hold more than $108 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, or roughly 4.7% of its supply. Analysts note that the emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has intensified competition by offering direct exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage, or share dilution. Nearly one-third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings, leaving smaller players especially vulnerable due to liquidity constraints and heavier reliance on convertible debt. Investor sentiment is also shifting toward alternative digital assets, with Ether-focused treasuries committing more than $19 billion as attention diversifies. While Bitcoin prices remain supported by institutional allocations, many newer entrants have bought at levels above $100,000 and lack the business fundamentals to withstand volatility. Critics warn that if Bitcoin's price were to fall sharply, enthusiasm for treasury-style strategies could fade quickly, compressing valuations across the sector. Supporters of Strategy, however, argue that maintaining capital flexibility may still benefit the company, particularly if it secures inclusion in the S&P 500 or if Bitcoin rallies strongly again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aug. 28 (UPI) -- Buenos Aires has allowed certain local taxes, vehicle registrations, driver's licenses and fines to be paid with cryptocurrency for the first time as part of an effort to position the Argentine capital as a leader in using digital currency. "The digital economy requires us to update and adapt with a government that is modern, agile, efficient and smart," Macri said. He added that new tax measures are being introduced to give businesses a friendlier regulatory framework, including simpler tax filings and changes in how some taxes are calculated. The shift reflects the fact that both companies and individuals use cryptocurrencies in daily life, including to receive payments from abroad. As of 2024, about 10,000 Argentines were receiving salaries from abroad through crypto, PayPal or Brazil's central bank payment system, PIX. Buenos Aires also has more than 10 million crypto accounts, representing 22% of those opened in Latin America. "The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Argentina is not new," said Carlos Torres, lead partner of the Payments Practice at consulting firm EY. He explained that the trend has been growing for several years as a result of Argentina's economic troubles. "It has been driven mainly by inflation, economic instability and currency volatility, where cryptocurrency was seen as a refuge in the national context," he said. Francisco Diaz, director of the business school at Universidad Mayor in Chile, said restrictions on the foreign exchange and international capital markets pushed Argentines to seek creative solutions for using foreign currency. "Cryptocurrencies, particularly the more stable ones -- stablecoins -- have been widely adopted in recent years as a means of payment, a tool for receiving funds from abroad, for transactions and as a way to save in assets less exposed to inflation. Analysts say the outlook is favorable for Buenos Aires to become a leading city in crypto. "The use of cryptocurrencies reduces transaction costs and makes it easier to create new financial instruments, but it also increases the risks of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering," Diaz said. Recently, Argentina's Office of Economic Crime and Money Laundering reported a rise in the use of digital assets and virtual platforms to launder illicit funds or justify profits, mainly from drug trafficking. "It is the responsibility of governments and regulatory institutions, such as central banks, to create a framework that ensures transparency, traceability and cybersecurity. Digital technologies such as blockchain can facilitate traceability," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four crypto whales have scooped up over $350 million of Ethereum's native token, ETH, in the past two days, raising questions about what it means for its price. Precisely, an Arkham Intelligence analyst spotted four addresses with similar patterns and time schedules purchasing $357.24 million of ETH from FalconX, an “institutional crypto prime brokerage,” as described by the company itself. On a similar note, inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have skyrocketed to a total of $1.83 billion during the last five trading sessions, as Coinspeaker reported earlier today. The institutional activity is not only around ETH but also on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all with significant purchases in what looks like a bottom. For example, Smarter Web Company purchased 45 BTC at around $111,000 each, and Bitplanet will deploy $40 million into Bitcoin, becoming South Korea's first institutional BTC treasury. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $4,747 per token, testing a potential support level. If this price support holds, ETH could bounce back up, consolidating the thesis of a potential bottom marked by large institutional and crypto whale purchases. Interestingly, Ethereum could have indeed formed a bottom on August 26—since Arkham spotted the four whales that started buying—at around $4,320. Whether a bottom will form at these levels is yet to be seen, but crypto whales and institutions apparently believe this will be the case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traders are asking the question: are SHIB and DOGE slipping because capital is rotating into what could be the next big altcoin breakout? Shiba Inu has long been a crowd favorite, but its chart suggests hesitation. Trading around $0.00001250 currently, SHIB has developed a Cup and Handle pattern that can accelerate to $0.0000239 in case the resistance at $0.00001710 is breached. The average daily trading volume increased by 118 percent to $361 million signaling that there are still buyers out there. According to analysts, whale wallets have been dispensing rather than hoarding tokens, which is a burden to long-term growth. While optimism remains in pockets of the community, some holders are already diversifying into Remittix, which promises more than speculative rallies. Technical charts show a symmetrical triangle forming, with $0.25 as the ceiling that must be broken for DOGE to rally higher. Open interest in DOGE contracts dropped 5 percent to $3.26 billion, while $19 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours. This sharp decline reflects weak conviction among traders. Despite Dogecoin's resilience as a top meme coin, investor capital is clearly rotating toward alternatives offering real-world utility, with Remittix emerging as the standout choice. Unlike meme coins, Remittix is building real utility, enabling cross-border payments and providing a mobile-first experience. This has positioned it as more than just hype, it's a working PayFi solution that institutions and individuals can both use. These drivers explain why many investors believe Remittix could deliver 100x returns, similar to Shiba Inu in its early days, while also offering real-world use cases that DOGE never achieved. The story unfolding here is about market rotation. As traders grow cautious about the Dogecoin price and Shiba Inu's ability to sustain momentum, Remittix is emerging as the alternative with substance. By combining viral growth with genuine utility, it has managed to attract not just retail speculation but also early institutional curiosity. If this continues, it could set a new standard for how PayFi tokens dominate the next cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move capped a V-shaped recovery that began with an overnight retreat to support levels around $4.98, where a high volume of buying activity took hold, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. After dipping from $5.07, ICP consolidated within the $4.98-$5.00 zone, establishing a base reinforced by trading volume of 372,179 units, substantially above average levels. ICP rose through multiple resistance barriers to touch $5.13, with the final advance fueled by a 272,186-unit volume spike. Resistance that had previously formed near $5.11 was breached, suggesting sellers were losing control of the near-term trend. The recovery and heavy accumulation at support levels may position ICP for further gains, with the next technical target in sight around $5.18 based on Fibonacci extension levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ECM Blockchain has set a new milestone as the first blockchain project initiated by Bangladeshi entrepreneur Tanvirul Islam Prince with global reach. Often described as Bangladesh's 1st blockchain initiative on a global scale, ECM Blockchain is being developed as a next-generation distributed ledger network designed to deliver fast, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure for real-world applications. Its young, tech-savvy population has embraced areas such as software development, fintech solutions, mobile applications, and digital entrepreneurship, earning recognition on the global stage. Bangladesh has also seen several blockchain-related initiatives in recent years: While these reflect Bangladesh's interest in blockchain, they have largely been pilot projects, academic programs, or localized applications. None have yet positioned Bangladesh as a global player in blockchain technology. The ECM Blockchain marks a turning point - standing as the first blockchain project from a Bangladeshi founder with true global reach, already deploying live projects and preparing to launch a full-scale blockchain network. Though ECM Blockchain is designed as a global network, it also holds significant potential benefits for Bangladesh: This ecosystem demonstrates how a Bangladeshi-founded blockchain can scale globally by powering diverse applications across finance, commerce, and digital innovation. In addition, several upcoming projects are positioned to expand ECM's global reach: All of these projects are designed to run on or integrate with the ECM Blockchain mainnet, scheduled for launch in Q4 2025. This combination of live applications and future projects positions ECM as one of the first blockchain networks from Bangladesh to demonstrate adoption and readiness on a global stage. The ECM Blockchain is being developed with a focus on transparency, scalability, and security. Its architecture is designed to support high transaction throughput, low latency, and reliable performance, making it suitable for applications ranging from e-commerce to supply chain and financial services. The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is currently live, with 48 million tokens available at $1.20 each out of a total supply of 200 million ECM. As cryptocurrency trading and ICOs are not permitted under current Bangladeshi regulations, the ECM ICO is being conducted internationally only, targeting global investors and markets outside Bangladesh. Full ICO details, including tokenomics and roadmap, are available at ecmcoin.com. Built as a Layer-2 (L2) based chain, it is designed to deliver low-cost and faster transactions, making it highly efficient for real-world applications. The blockchain powers an ecosystem of projects including MyCoinPoll, bCoinMart, AndroMarkets, CryptoCoinEarning, and Androverse, with a mainnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- U.S. government publishes GDP data on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, endorsing crypto technology under Trump's administration. - The initiative adds blockchain as a data verification channel without replacing existing methods, led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. - Trump's crypto-friendly policies include dismissing BLS head over data disputes and expanding family-backed crypto ventures like World Liberty Financial. - Global blockchain adoption grows as crypto industry becomes a political force, with $133M+ spent on pro-crypto election campaigns in 2024. - Commerce plans to expand blockchain use across government departments, reflecting Lutnick's vision for decentralized data distribution. Officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce stated that this initiative will add a new channel for releasing economic data but will not replace existing methods. Today, blockchain applications extend far beyond their origins in cryptocurrency and are increasingly used for trading various assets, including money market funds and stocks. In its initial phase, this U.S. government initiative will cover nine blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This policy shift comes just weeks after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that job growth in recent months was significantly lower than previously announced figures. Earlier this year, spurred by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration's "Department of Government Efficiency" also looked into using blockchain to reduce costs and increase government transparency. Lutnick previewed this change during a White House cabinet meeting on Tuesday, telling Trump that departmental statistics would begin to be released via blockchain "because you are the 'crypto president.'" Trump, once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now become a supporter of the industry—during his 2024 campaign, he pledged to reduce regulatory burdens hindering its development. Upon taking office, he quickly took action to fulfill some of these promises: for instance, the Trump administration has established Bitcoin reserves and accumulated cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana; appointed crypto-friendly agency heads who have terminated enforcement investigations against companies like Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange; and signed a stablecoin regulatory bill—stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value pegged to underlying fiat currencies. The Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency has also expanded significantly, spanning businesses such as Bitcoin mining and stablecoin issuance. Next week, a cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial, a company backed by the Trump family, will begin trading on centralized exchanges. This stands in stark contrast to the administration of former President Joe Biden, whose regulatory agencies generally maintained a skeptical stance toward the cryptocurrency industry in recent years. Years ago, many commercial attempts to deploy blockchain technology failed because they focused on applications using private blockchains—operated by companies that often had policy disagreements, leading to higher costs and greater implementation challenges. However, under Lutnick's push, the Department of Commerce chose to utilize public blockchains like Ethereum, maintained by computers around the world and updated by volunteer programmers. Officials stated that cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini are all participating in the Department of Commerce's initiative. Kraken and Gemini are planning to go public in the coming months. The cryptocurrency industry has become a political force to be reckoned with: investors and corporate executives exert influence through well-funded political action committees, similar to how traditional financial industries like banking wield power in Washington. According to data analyzed by OpenSecrets, the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase, contributed over $133 million to three super PACs supporting "pro-crypto" candidates in the 2024 election. Companies like Kraken and Coinbase also donated $1 million each to Trump's inauguration in January. Lutnick hinted earlier this week that the potential applications of cryptocurrency extend far beyond publishing economic indicators. During a meeting with Trump and other federal agency leaders on Tuesday, Lutnick said, "We will integrate GDP data into the blockchain to demonstrate its role in data distribution. By continuing, I agree to the Market Data Terms of Service and Privacy Statement</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home > Economy > Morocco's Digital Currency Revolution: Expert Analysis of the e-Dirham Initiative Morocco's e-Dirham initiative represents far more than simple currency digitization. Rabat — As the world is undergoing a massive digital monetary transformation, Morocco is looking to establish itself as a regional and continental model of financial modernization, inclusion, and sovereignty. In an interview with Morocco World News (MWN), economist expert Aicha El Alaoui, a Professor at Sultan Moulay Slimane University in Beni Mellal, provides crucial insights into this transformative project that could reshape Morocco's economic future. At a recent seminar of the African Central Banks Association (ABCA) in Rabat, BAM Governor Abdellatif Jouahri confirmed that the central bank has already conducted its first pilot focused on peer-to-peer retail payments. This measured approach reflects Morocco's commitment to prudent yet ambitious modernization of its national payment system, with financial inclusion as a primary objective. According to El Alaoui, the e-Dirham could serve as a strategic lever for modernizing Morocco's monetary system with far-reaching implications. This democratization of payments would, El Alaoui said, particularly benefit various categories of workers and employers, including those in the informal sector, small businesses, and cooperatives, as well as different territories across the country, including rural, mountainous, and Saharan areas, while reducing dependence on cash usage. In an era where private cryptocurrencies and digital dollarization pose threats to national currencies, the e-Dirham represents a crucial defense mechanism. This transformation would significantly impact diaspora remittances and regional trade. This, coupled with the North African country's strategic location, would boost commercial exchanges and consolidate Morocco's position as a strategic financial hub between Africa and Europe. Despite its promise, the e-Dirham faces significant challenges that require rigorous management. While facilitating fraud prevention, complete traceability of transactions raises important privacy concerns. “This requires a delicate balance, such as establishing limits for anonymous transactions similar to China's e-yuan,” she suggests. Massive bank disintermediation, with deposits transferring to BAM, could reduce banks' credit capacity and slow investment. Additionally, the instant convertibility of deposits to CBDC could, during crises, amplify panic movements and accelerate digital “bank run” phenomena. The choice of distribution model represents a strategic balance between monetary sovereignty and financial stability. While a direct model where BAM would manage citizens' digital wallets would allow optimal money supply control and homogeneous technological implementation, it carries three major risks: disproportionate operational burden for the central bank, accelerated banking disintermediation, and limited innovation capacity in financial services. This approach offers two major advantages: preserving the banking ecosystem while deposits remain on banks' balance sheets, allowing them to maintain their role in financing the economy, and accelerated innovation, with institutions able to develop hybrid services combining traditional dirhams and e-Dirham. Morocco's reopening to Africa offers a strategic opportunity to integrate the e-Dirham with other African CBDCs and platforms like PAPSS (Pan-African Payment and Settlement System). “By reducing dependence on the dollar and euro, decreasing transaction costs, and accelerating diaspora fund transfers, this initiative would strengthen Morocco's position as a continental financial hub,” El Alaoui explains. In a geopolitical context marked by Sino-American rivalry and the emergence of a multipolar economic order, developing autonomous monetary infrastructures has become imperative for Africa. BAM's existing initiatives provide a solid foundation for successful e-Dirham deployment. The Morocco FinTech Center could play a key role as an experimentation platform, enabling digital currency testing in collaboration with local startups and adapting solutions to Moroccan market specificities. Advanced technologies like electronic signatures and biometrics could guarantee secure authentication, fundamental for establishing user confidence. For inclusive and equitable adoption, the expert believes that several major challenges must be addressed. First, improving access to affordable, reliable internet across the Moroccan territory, particularly in rural and mountainous areas. Second, strengthening digital skills among populations and local professionals is essential for creating an ecosystem capable of supporting this innovation. As El Alaoui notes, referencing King Mohammed VI's latest Throne Speech: “There is no place, neither today nor tomorrow, for a Morocco advancing at two speeds.” Developing a resilient and balanced FinTech ecosystem at the country's regional scale is crucial to avoid digital disparities and ensure inclusive, balanced, and fair growth. Morocco's e-Dirham initiative represents far more than simple currency digitization, with BAM hoping it will quickly start a comprehensive transformation tool for the country's financial landscape. As Morocco prepares for this digital monetary revolution, the expert analysis suggests that with proper implementation, the e-Dirham could become not just a digital currency but a genuine tool for equitable development and financial emancipation for all Moroccan citizens. Yet, as El Alaoui conceded, the journey ahead requires navigating complex technical, regulatory, and social challenges. With Morocco's established expertise in fintech, a measured approach to implementation, and a clear focus on inclusion, the e-Dirham could indeed position the country as an African pioneer in decentralized finance, while serving as a model for other emerging economies embarking on similar digital transformation journeys.

It means there are now an additional six days of FOMO ahead before the token is claimable by presale buyers and tradable on exchanges. If you are looking for belief-driven, community-powered value, in what crypto influencer Murad Mahmudov identifies as the meme-led supercycle for crypto, you might do well to follow the example of one whale who has just ponied up $19k in the T6900 ICO. Earlier today a whale got in big with the T6900 token, which now has astute traders wondering aloud if famed meme coin booster Murad, credited with taking SPX6900 to escape velocity, is buying too. Murad is not just a meme coin bull; he is a massive SPX6900 shiller, which accounts for 94.34% of his known crypto wealth. Now market watchers are asking if Murad could be rotating some of that wealth into a rival ‘index' coin, TOKEN6900? The wallet holding his SPX has been inactive since 24 July 2024. He thinks it will eventually reach a market cap of $1 trillion to become “the biggest crypto since bitcoin”, even though he has nominally lost $1.23 million on the coin in the past seven days alone. It may be only a matter of time before Murad alerts those among his 740,000 followers on X who don't already know about the ticker T6900. Meme coins crystallize the otherwise latent or unrealizable values of what used to be called brand power.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hassan, a Cryptonews.com journalist with 6+ years of experience in Web3 journalism, brings deep knowledge across Crypto, Web3 Gaming, NFTs, and Play-to-Earn sectors. “Community alert: @web3 is linked to a team member of the Squiggles NFT rug and Raichu, who I previously posted about,” he wrote on X. Investigations at the time by YouTuber Coffeezilla and others suggested the collection's founders were frontmen for a group of serial scammers known as “NFT Factory LA.” The group was linked to multiple failed projects, including League of Sacred Devils, Lucky Buddhas, and Sinful Souls. Coffeezilla's reporting revealed that Squiggles' team allegedly manipulated sales volume using “shadow wallets” to create the appearance of demand. A single account reportedly spent over 800 ETH, more than $2 million, across hundreds of wallets that each purchased three Squiggles NFTs before relisting them on secondary markets. The same network of individuals has been tied to Raichu, also known as Ryan, a promoter who connected NFT projects with celebrities and influencers. 1/ Ever wonder who connected projects with the celebrities and influencers that promote crypto scams? Here's a breakdown on one of the people doing it known as Raichu (Ryan). ZachXBT documented Raichu's role in several rug pulls, including Baller Ape Club, which raised $2.6 million before its founder was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice, and Crazy Lemur Club, which disappeared with $320,000. He also linked Raichu to Ancient Cats Club, which allegedly stole $1.7 million, before its team moved on to launch other scams like Bored Bunny and Rich Dwarves Tribe. The project itself acknowledged in a statement that it anticipated controversy, referencing comparisons to previous hype-driven launches like $YZY, $Libra, and other tokens. The team claimed it had initially pursued a private fundraising round involving prominent investors but later refunded those contributions, insisting it wanted to “level the playing field” through a public presale. “Our mission is to let the people thrive, build with core DeFi principles, and create a culture that can sustain anything. While WEB3 positions itself as an attempt to “Make Crypto Fair Again,” critics argue that the involvement of known actors from past scams raises serious red flags. At press time, the WEB3 presale remains active, though questions about its legitimacy continue to grow across social platforms. The group also distanced itself from an individual named Arsalan, accused of trying to raise funds in its name. PeckShield data shows hackers stole $142 million in July 2025, up 27% from June. In total, $2.2 billion vanished in the first half of the year across 344 incidents, with wallet hacks accounting for $1.7 billion and phishing scams another $410 million. In June, he unmasked New Yorker Christian Nieves, who posed as Coinbase support staff to steal $4 million from users before gambling the funds away. 🕵 ZachXBT exposes 5 North Korean workers running 30+ fake identities to target crypto projects as anonymous source compromises DPRK IT worker devices, revealing $680K Favrr exploit.#NorthKorea #Lazarushttps://t.co/ZmPCIZmVpW More recently, on Aug. 13, he exposed a ring of five North Korean IT operatives who allegedly forged identities to secure developer jobs at crypto projects. The latest presale controversy shows how even high-profile projects remain vulnerable to reputational damage amid a widening climate of crypto fraud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>M0, a company that develops stablecoin infrastructure, announced Thursday that it had raised $40 million in a funding round led by the crypto venture capital firm Polychain and the fintech investor Ribbit Capital. Luca Prosperi, cofounder and CEO of M0, declined to specify his startup's valuation. The Series B round was for equity and locked stashes of the startup's cryptocurrency, or tokens that can only be sold after a set time period. M0 has raised almost $100 million in capital so far. “We cannot have 1,000 different Tethers and Circles,” Prosperi told Fortune, referring to the two largest issuers of stablecoins. “So what we did is create a layer where different issuers can come and connect and just ensure interoperability, liquidity among themselves.” M0 is the latest startup to rake in funding from venture capitalists hungry for exposure to one of the buzziest sectors in crypto. In June, Circle, the second largest stablecoin issuer next to Tether, went public in a blockbuster IPO that netted the company a market capitalization of now just over $30 billion. And in July, President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act into law, a bill that regulates and defines rules for the burgeoning stablecoin industry. The buzz has become so loud that Big Tech companies like Meta and Airbnb as well as banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their businesses. “Stablecoins are proliferating,” Josh Rosenthal, a general partner at Polychain, told Fortune. That ambition is partly why Prosperi called his startup, which aims to build what he calls the “layer zero of money,” M0. (That's not to mention that anything to the power of zero is one—just like the dollar value of one stablecoin, he said.) In 2023, he teamed up with his cofounder Gregory Di Prisco, who also worked at MakerDAO, to launch M0. Their startup develops technology lower on the stablecoin tech stack than, say, the stablecoin company Bridge, which was recently acquired by Stripe. M0 is building a network on which stablecoin issuers can deploy their tokens and not worry about the nitty gritty software decisions that go into transferring assets across blockchains like Ethereum or Solana or changing, say, Circle's token into PayPal's. For the time being, Prosperi isn't focused on making his company profitable. Just like Uber, which first expanded its operations across the U.S. before it paid attention to revenue, M0 aims to onboard as many stablecoin issuers onto its network as possible. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While mainstream attention focuses on established players, several overlooked sectors are quietly gaining momentum. Real-world asset tokenization projects, emerging layer 1 platforms, and select meme coins are beginning to capture serious investor interest. This article explores why these asset classes could become standout performers in the next market cycle. LINK floated between $23.52 and $28 this week, inching up 3.93% while staying above its 10-day average of $24.34. The 56 RSI and a mild MACD uptick hint that bulls still have energy, though no one is ready to chase at any cost. Zoom out one month and the picture looks brighter. The 100-day average sits at $24.82, almost level with the shorter trend line, so momentum is steady rather than overheated. Volume spikes have been modest, suggesting the move is driven by gradual accumulation instead of frantic hype. If momentum holds, a clean break above $28 puts $30 in play. Failure to clear $28 could send LINK back to $21.21, roughly a 15% slide, with a deeper dip toward $16.73 wiping out about 35%. Right now the bias leans upward thanks to recent gains and a neutral-to-bullish RSI, but traders need to see a daily close over $30 to confirm the next leg higher. Even with that short-term dip, the token still shows a 21.40% gain over the past six months, keeping it above both its 10-day and 100-day simple averages at $0.24. A slip to the first floor would shave about 12% from the current midpoint, while a drop to $0.18 would erase around 30% of recent gains. If buying volume grows, HBAR could test $0.31 within weeks, adding up to 20%. Traders watch that balance as the next move takes shape. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster, who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a target listing price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. And that's just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse's commitment to expanding its utility. It's a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won't last forever—so if you're interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. The recent record says buyers keep winning, so an advance to $234 looks doable. A clean break could lift SOL another 15-25% in the short run. Net take: trend up, but expect a breather before the next jump. It sits near its 10-day and 100-day averages around $4620, showing the rally still has a base. The fast oscillator is high at 85.31, flagging strong demand, while momentum adds 24.52. If buyers stay active, the first barrier sits at $5492.31. A clean break there points to $6383, about 30% above the current band. Given fresh double-digit gains and positive momentum, the path of least resistance is up. A push toward $5500 looks likely, and a sprint to $6400 cannot be ruled out once the market catches its breath. LINK, HBAR, SOL, and ETH offer solid upside in the ongoing 2025 surge, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) couples sports passion with meme energy, eyeing 20,000% gains through a community-led, media-backed roadmap.
