                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: When NBC's Chicago Med returns this fall for its eleventh season, it will be without one of its three remaining original cast members. Marlyne Barrett, who has played doting yet no-nonsense ER nurse Maggie Lockwood since the show's 2015 launch, is stepping back from the medical drama for personal reasons, sources tell Deadline. This is envisioned as a temporary leave, and the hope is for her to return at some point, I hear. As Deadline reported in June, the other two Chicago Med original cast members, series stars S. Epatha Merkerson (Sharon Goodwin) and Oliver Platt (Daniel Charles), are set to come back after their options for the 2025-26 season were picked up. And just this week, Deadline broke the news that fellow OG Nick Gehlfuss, who left after eight seasons, will make a return this season as a guest-star, reprising his role as Dr. Will Halstead. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Over the years, Barrett's Charge Nurse Maggie has become the eyes, ears and heart of Gaffney Medical's Emergency Department, endlessly dedicated to her position and loyal to all the physicians around her. In Season 5, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and eventually went into remission. Barrett announced her real-life diagnosis of uterine and ovarian cancer in July 2022. Chicago Med, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Allen MacDonald, Stephen Hootstein and Peter Jankowski.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. A major star for the majority of his adult life, Jay Kelly has so thoroughly subsumed himself into his classic screen persona — smirking, debonair, heroic — that he no longer seems to know who he is off set. More troublingly, the world-famous actor has come to like it that way. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.” That quote serves as an almost oppressively fitting epigraph for the misty-eyed Netflix movie that Noah Baumbach has made about one of the last true Hollywood stars — or two of them, I should say, as Jay Kelly is so transparent a stand-in for the actor who plays him that he and George Clooney share the same body of work. (No complaint here: “Funny People” is one of my favorite genres). Plath's words help to frame “Jay Kelly” as the story of a dashing sexagenerian who's known by everyone and no one in equal measure, but Baumbach's uncharacteristically precious screenplay, co-written with thee Emily Mortimer, has little trouble articulating that dilemma on its own terms. Related Stories That ‘Star Wars: Starfighter' First Look Is Our Line in the Sand: No More Black and White First Look Images! There's an immediately perceptible twinge of regret in Clooney's voice, like the kind of shooting pain that can't mean anything serious so long as you choose to ignore it, but the real wound of that double-bladed dialogue won't be felt until much later. No, the problem for Jay is that his memories are movies: They're frozen in time, shared by everyone who's seen them, and practically impossible to change once they've been cemented in the public imagination. On set, Jay has the power to go again. Which is to say that yes, “Jay Kelly” is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves. Baumbach lacks Sofia Coppola's singular ability to leverage a character's wealth for the wanting it reveals of them, but he, Mortimer, and Clooney share a vivid understanding of the resentments that can form in the space between who we are and how we're seen — and of how stardom can widen that space to the point that friendships and families are liable to fall into it unnoticed. It's a space that Baumbach explores here with an unusually gentle touch. On the one hand, the “Meyerowitz Stories” director has never been as allergic to sentimentality as his prickliest work might suggest, and I find it hard to begrudge any of the great filmmakers for going soft as they get older — we should all be so lucky to reach the back half of our lives and feel as if the world was a kinder, more loving place than we once thought. Here, Baumbach compensates for that sometimes clumsily overdrawn emotionality by rooting his film in a cragged bedrock of sadness — one that adds a serrated edge to the constant refrain of “I was too busy having sex with movie stars to spend time with my daughters” melancholy. Peter was desperately fending off irrelevance the last time they spoke, and had begged Jay to help him get his comeback project off the ground. Jay felt the project was too raw and vulnerable for his brand, and was unmoved by Peter's appeal to his filial duty. That suspicion furrows something deep behind Jay's eyes; it's a serious wrinkle on the face of someone whose job requires him to be a dimple-cheeked blank slate at all times, pliable enough to play a variety of parts but always recognizably “himself.” A whole team of people have devoted the best years of their lives to ensuring that Jay never has to feel anything worse than mild discomfort, his sweet if self-annihilating manager Ron Sukenick (Adam Sandler) chief among them, but they don't pick up on the aftershocks of Peter's death until after it's too late. The next thing Ron knows, Jay has a black eye, he's pulling out of the big new movie he's due to start in a few days, and he's loading his entire team onto a plane to France as part of a wildly ill-advised plan to crash his teenage daughter's European vacation and spend some quality time with her before she goes to college in the fall. And so an overnight train ride that puts Jay among the common folk becomes the venue for a head trip down memory lane, complete with Trafalmadorian flashbacks that taunt the movie star by denying him another take. By design, “Jay Kelly” strikes an uneasy balance between moving forward and being stuck in the past. The long and emotionally imprecise flashbacks — which find Jay revisiting the critical audition where he upstaged Timothy, a set romance he had with one of his co-stars, and a more recent therapy session that he attended with his semi-estranged adult daughter (Riley Keough) — are meant to act as headwinds for a story about a man careening out of control, but none of them crackle with Baumbach's usual wit, and all of them suffer from a slightly elevated tone that only serves the “unreality” of Jay's life by making every part of it even harder to believe. That Clooney is just playing a sadder, more blinkered version of himself — one who never found a lasting love, nor started a family he was interested in keeping — would seem to solve any issues of verisimilitude, and there are a number of sequences in “Jay Kelly” where his real-life fame adds credence to the chaos we're seeing on-screen (most of them having to do with a starstruck member of the public). There are also several moments in which the self-reflexiveness of Clooney's casting effectively baits us into believing that the Cary Grant of his day is baring his soul for our edification. That he's waving us backstage and confessing the awful truth that some part of ourselves always looked for behind every red carpet smile and Golden Globes acceptance speech. That money, looks, and an unimpeachable run across the six greatest seasons of any network drama ever made don't make him better than us, even though that third thing objectively does. The last of those moments is heartstoppingly transcendent, as Baumbach brings the full weight of Clooney's iconography to bear on Jay's most private misgivings. There's no use in faulting Clooney for his performance, as no one does Clooney better, and his leading man appeal — somehow wide-eyed and “aw shucks” at the same time — has seldom been used more acutely than it is here. Alas, his ineffable Clooney-ness also has the perverse effect of making “Jay Kelly” less convincing at the same time, at least so far as its lead character is being played by a man who makes all of his foibles that much harder to believe. I'm sure George Clooney has problems of his own, but no one would have a harder time inhabiting the problems that Corge Glooney is meant to have in this movie. That Jay Kelly's flaws clash against George Clooney's charms is precisely the point, of course — one is simply no match for the other. Some employees, like his publicist (Laura Dern), bail at the first sign of real trouble. Others, like Ron, are suffering from too great a sunk-cost fallacy to quit on him now. Sandler wears the shit out of a puffy Polo vest, and it's fun to see him lead with quiet resignation instead of unchecked rage, but I don't know if he's ever starred in a movie that's given him less to do. Getting close to other people was something that Jay always planned to do later, and the prospect of receiving a tribute from a Tuscan film festival is an unavoidable sign that he's running out of time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Merit's former broadcasting partners Trinity Broadcasting and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) have joined forces to accuse Phil McGraw of all sorts of shady shit, most notably that he swindled both organizations for millions and then used the bankruptcy to launch a new media venture, Envoy. But the materials PBR has managed to acquire are pretty damning. Text messages from Merit Street's chief operating officer Joel Cheatwood suggest a bankruptcy conspiracy, evidenced by the fact that he instructed employees to keep all communications off of their work emails. The texts (via The Independent) lay out a scheme to wind down operations at Merit Street while shifting staffers over to Envoy. He also texted that he and Merit's Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon needed to “be very careful with our public activities associated with Envoy since we are still full and active employees” of Merit, adding that any “[a]ctivities that would indicate we are more focused on Envoy could be problematic if called into question.” On June 30 (two days before the bankruptcy), Mr. Cheatwood instructed a colleague that ‘any communication involving timing of events, strategies, etc. we need to not use the merit street e-mail system. (PBR hasn't outright sued Merit Street, but accused the company of failing to pay millions in owed payments.) “The documents produced to date demonstrate that this bankruptcy was conceived as a scheme to divert the Debtor's employees and intellectual property to Envoy, a competing business Dr. Phil founded the day before this case was filed, and leave the Debtor's business as a shell with nothing more than a repeated loop of re-runs.” “By its own admission in a meet-and-confer between counsel on August 26, 2025, Peteski still has not produced all of Phillip C. McGraw's emails and text messages (despite his deposition being scheduled to begin in less than 48 hours from the time of such conference), nor has it produced all of the documents concerning Envoy,” Trinity stated in its own filing (via Deadline). The pattern is so striking that it is more than mere déjà vu; it is a deliberate rerun, scripted by parties who have decided that the Court's orders are optional guidance rather than binding directives.” September film preview: Leonardo DiCaprio endures One Battle After Another By Matt Schimkowitz August 26, 2025 | 7:00am Suggests Antidepressants Could Be the Reason for Mass Shootings, Ignores Guns</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hayley Williams of Paramore has released a new solo album comprised of the 17 tracks shared earlier this summer and the new bonus song “Parachute.” Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party is out now on streaming services, with physical releases arriving on November 7 via Post Atlantic—Williams' own label, started after her 20-year contract with Atlantic ended—and distributed by Secretly Distribution. Since granting the title track with a music video, Williams has also shared a visual for “Glum,” directed by AJ Gibboney and Zac Farro, which you can watch below. Back in 2020, Williams made her solo debut with the full-length album Petals for Armor. She followed it up with the three-track Petals for Armor: Self-Serenades EP that same year and Flowers for Vases / Descansos in 2021. She described the latter LP as “a prequel, or some sort of detour between parts 1 and 2 of Petals.” Afterward, Paramore wrote and released their fifth studio album as a band, This Is Why, in 2023.

Especially when it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” set we've seen in over six years? And now we have heard that the upcoming “Star Wars: Starfighter,” set in the years after “Rise of Skywalker,” has set much of the rest of its cast — Amy Adams, Aaron Pierre, Flynn Gray, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, and Daniel Ings join the already announced Ryan Gosling, Matt Smith, and Mia Goth — is going into production, and is giving us a first look.

That's kinda what Gosling and Gray are doing above. Look, a posed photo of the actors just being themselves isn't always terrible — the epochal 2014 “Force Awakens” cast photo was incredible, just to see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford occupy the same space once again, but that involved a level of interest that simply is not yet there for “Starfighter.” Three IndieWire staffers had strong thoughts about this “Star Wars: Starfighter” first look, and we're going to vent them like superheated plasma. Those require a higher level of interest to get me clicking. A “first look” image of the next “Star Wars” movie? There's no question that plenty of words and phrases have lost their meaning in recent years, and “first look” seems to be one of them, at least in the entertainment space. Well, for my money, it should be an actual production still, an initial peek not quite behind the curtain, but adjacent to it. that's always unclear) simply resting on a landspeeder, everything so dark and muddled that it's impossible to see much else? It's fine enough to mark the start of production with some glamour shots, but a “first look” this does not make, because it doesn't speak to the primary function of these kinds of photos: it doesn't tell me about the film itself. It doesn't even tell me about the making of this film (think about that recent first look for Richard Linkater's “Nouvelle Vague,” which captured the impish creative charm that runs through the final film). “Star Wars” films used to have some pop and pizzazz, but this first look? It's not just funny, it's fitting, that the very first reply on Discussing Film's tweet with the photo is “It is time for ‘Drive' in space.” Because there's almost nothing that actually connotes “Star Wars” here other than the vaguest outline of a landspeeder. Why is this in black and white other than because of some idea that black and white signifies importance? If this is really a set from the movie, it's the first glimpse of a “Star Wars” movie set in over six years — we deserve to see that in color. Gosling doesn't look like he's in a flight suit, and Flynn Gray looks like he's just Ezra from “Star Wars: Rebels” come to life, even though we know this movie will be set in a time when Ezra is a middle-aged man. What is there here to be really excited about? You couldn't even have a glimpse of an actual “Star Wars” starfighter in this first look at “Star Wars: Starfighter”? Maybe give us an A-Wing, to think outside the box a bit. Hell, throw Expanded Universe fans a bone and make it an E-Wing. I'm not saying that there needs to be some Easter Egg to suggest Gosling is playing Corran Horn (though, let's face it, any diehard “Star Wars” fan will tell you they could do a lot worse than adapting Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston's peerlessly great “X-Wing” books), but something to suggest, you know, intrigue. first looks at “Star Wars” movies back in the day. No one is going to ask “Who's that guy?” about this image. But, one day, our first breadcrumb arrived… and it was just a picture of Stallone standing in a suit, looking exactly like I imagine he looks when he goes out for coffee on a random Tuesday. Perhaps it was just a formative memory because it came early in my media career, but I remember being dumbfounded by the notion that a show whose entire appeal rested on a single star would announce itself with such a regular-ass picture of said star. (To give some reluctant credit, he was standing in Tulsa, but I feel that's a detail we could have inferred from the title.) Close friends of mine know not to bring up the “Tulsa King” first look around me anymore because it often devolves into a rant that has real potential to ruin a night. I'm not even sure that the difference between black-and-white or color matters. I simply have no desire to see A-list stars looking exactly like themselves in a movie before I have the chance to see a second of them in action. I don't think there's a single person who looks at these things who isn't already following movies closely enough to be aware of what's coming out. These photos aren't swaying anybody, no matter how devilishly handsome Ryan Gosling looks. Nobody on this planet is lacking for opportunities to see pictures of celebrities anymore. We can Google or stream anything at any time, and algorithms go out of their way to shove our favorite beautiful people in our faces at all hours of the day. I know attention spans are getting shorter, but I truly believe the human race is capable of waiting for a trailer. We need less stimulation and more patience, and these disingenuously named “first looks” are not helping us in either department.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hayley Williams has always been bold — from her brightly-hued hair dye to her kickass attitude as the lead singer of Paramore. When it comes to music, the singer is equally unafraid. But never has Williams sounded as brave as she does on her third album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. The song's chorus repeats one line over and over again (“Can only go up from here”) as Williams gives up on shooting for the moon and settles for a more modest version of fame. “Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party” and 16 other songs were surprise-released at the beginning of August after the singer initially uploaded the collection of songs on her website via an old-school web player. Despite being long enough for a full LP, the collection wasn't marketed as an album. But now, after Williams gave Ego Death a properly long name true to her emo roots, and an official track list, the project finally feels complete. The track list was a major piece of this puzzle. Once Williams uploaded the 17 singles to streaming platforms just a few days after the web player, fans immediately created their own track lists through playlists. An overzealous Haleyhead even compiled all of the fan-made trackl ists into a website. But one listen to Ego Death and it's apparent the unconventional rollout was by design. Every heartfelt lyric and song transition details how Williams has clawed her way out of major loss and grief to uncover a new version of herself. Not only did Williams finally select a track list and provide an album title, she also shared a new song, “Parachute.” It's cacophonous and raging with regret, packing its deepest blows in the second verse. That kind of romantic trauma is a theme throughout the record. It makes the wail she uncorked on Paramore's “All I Wanted” pale in comparison. It follows the tender “I Won't Quit on You,” a hopeful moment where Williams promises she won't give up on her relationship. But even so, with tracks like “Whim” and “Love Me Different,” the singer shows she's not afraid to open the metal cages to her black-tar heart and show all its boundless love. Throughout the album, there are similar hints of desired optimism. The sun peaks through the blinds and Williams is desperate to feel its warmth once more as she struggles with her loss. Even on some of the most depressing tracks, like the meditative “Glum” or antidepressant ode “Mirtzapine,” lyrics like “In the wake of your sunshine, I've never felt more glum” are pushed up against vibrant beats and clashes of powerful guitar. Hayley Williams Rocks Out to ‘Racist, Sexist Boy' with the Linda Lindas in London Hayley Williams Longs for Home in ‘Glum' Video David Byrne and Hayley Williams Soundtrack Netflix's ‘The Twits' With Original Songs But this album marks the first time Williams has ever owned her work outright, and who can blame her for wanting to make the most of that? (In 2024, the musician's decades-plus, controversial record contract with Atlantic ended.) Bruce Willis Is Living in a Separate Home Away From Family as Part of His Dementia Care Sends CDC Spiraling, Leading to Wave of Resignations With help from Paramore touring musicians Brian Robert Jones and Joey Howard, as well as Lorde producer Jim-E Stack, who has a hand in “True Believer,” every track is propulsive no matter if it's diving into synth-pop or alt-rock. Never has she sounded more certain or free. There is a kind of death here, one where the musician leaves behind bits of her past self, but more than anything, the album feels like a baptism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before releasing his great new album, Live Laugh Love, Earl Sweatshirt played it for fans at a Los Angeles listening party. Earl Sweatshirt is now giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the whole imposter process, via his new video for “Crisco.” The new video, from director, producer, and editor Jimmy Regular, begins with a simple message: “earl was not looking forward to performing at his album listening party. instead, he decided to cast someone to embody his overall essence on stage.” From there, we see that Sweatshirt, his mother, and Zack Fox auditioned four men to fill in for the rapper. The obvious candidate was Gary Murakami, who spent some time with Sweatshirt to see what living life as the Californian is really like. Watch the “Crisco” video below. “Crisco” is the second Live Laugh Love track to get a music video, following “Tourmaline.” The album follows 2022's Sick! and the Alchemist collaboration Voir Dire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Kristen Bell and Daniela Melchior are set to join David Harbour in the cast of Violent Night 2 for Universal Pictures and 87North. Tommy Wirkola will direct from a screenplay by Pat Casey and Josh Miller. Universal Pictures will release Violent Night 2 on Wednesday, December 4, 2026. While exact plot details are under wraps, Harbour's ass-kicking Santa Clause is back. The 2022 bare-knuckle holiday sensation Violent Night followed an embittered Santa, armed with lethal combat skills, who takes out a team of ruthless mercenaries to rescue a girl and her family. Now, it's time for not-so-jolly Saint Nick to suit up again. Everything We Know About 'Nobody Wants This' Season 2 So Far 'Nobody Wants This' Creator Erin Foster Talks Season 2 Timeline, Leighton Meester And Adam Brody Together On Screen Violent Night 2 will be produced by 87North founders Kelly McCormick and David Leitch through their first-look deal with Universal. Following breakout roles in The Suicide Squad and Fast X, Melchior most recently co-starred in the Amazon MGM Studios reimagining of Road House opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. Her upcoming slate includes Balls Up, a comedy directed by Academy Award winner Peter Farrelly (Green Book) in which she stars alongside Mark Wahlberg. She has also been cast in Sony Pictures' reboot of Anaconda, joining an ensemble that includes Jack Black and Paul Rudd. Bell most recently starred in the Netflix comedy series Nobody Wants This alongside Adam Brody, in which she also serves as an executive producer; a Season 2 is in the works. In 2019, Bell reprised her role as Anna in Frozen 2, which has earned over $1.45 billion at the global box office, surpassing the $1.2 billion Frozen earned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TIFF and NYFF are just around the corner, but we're finally starting to see trailers for some of the films that already made waves at festivals earlier this year. Filho and Wagner Moura left the Croisette with the Best Director and Best Actor awards respectively, so this is definitely one to look out for. The film's trailer portrays an energetic but chaotic vision of 1977 Brazil. “He arrives in Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes that the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.” Marcelo may also not be quite as much of a pacifist as he likes to envision himself. The Secret Agent is a Portuguese-language film, marking a return to Moura's native language after starring in English-language productions like Civil War and Dope Thief. “When I work in English or Spanish, the words don't come out of my mouth filled with memories the way they do in Portuguese. Filho, who previously competed at Cannes with 2016's Aquarius and 2019's Bacurau, also expressed a lot of pride in the film and its portrayal of his country. “Globalization standardized worldwide aesthetics, which made it even more beautiful to work on recreating 70s Recife.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peacock will become available in Amazon Channels, as the NBCUniversal streaming service pursues more bundles and channel deals. Prime Video Channels has become a major aggregator of streaming services, with HBO Max, Paramount+, Starz and Apple TV+ among the services offered, underscoring its effectiveness in driving subscriptions and Amazon's one-stop billing capabilities. First Look at 'Harlan Coben's Lazarus' Sees Sam Claflin Probe Father's Mysterious Death Karen Read Trial Drama Starring Elizabeth Banks in the Works at Prime Video Peacock has largely eschewed from participating in bundles and channels programs up to this point, but a source familiar with the talks says that the company is likely to become more aggressive in pursuing those sorts of arrangements moving forward, using the Amazon deal as a template. Peacock has shifted much of its focus to live sports, and will add the NBA this fall. With both Peacock and Fox One, Prime Video now provides access to four of the five national NFL packages (ESPN is still the lone holdout for now). “Millions of Amazon customers can continue to enjoy NBCUniversal's popular shows, films, and live events on Peacock via Fire TV or through Prime Video Subscriptions, or buying or renting on Prime Video, while also accessing Amazon's premier entertainment on Xfinity X1 — ensuring they can watch what they love, wherever and however they choose.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been two years since Tia Mowry's divorce from Cory Hardrict was made official. The actress, who starred in Hallmark's “A Gingerbread Christmas” in 2018, has acknowledged that she and Hardrict maintain a positive relationship. In an interview with Parents.com, she revealed what she views as the most crucial thing former couples need to remember. It keeps their nervous system calm and at ease when they see their parents are still together, we all come together as a family.” Her actions have proven that these aren't mere words. Earlier this year, she posted Instagram photos showing the exes celebrating their kids' birthdays together. But beyond co-parenting, she's also making sure to foster independence — no matter how challenging it may be. A recent event showed that her methods are working. When 7-year-old Cairo went to the school nurse after being hit with a ball, the nurse asked if she should call Mowry. “But I had to allow this opportunity for her to gain independence and say, ‘I got this. If her kids are uncomfortable with something, she doesn't expect them to do it. “I think growing up, it was definitely a cultural thing where it's like, ‘My house, my rules,'” she clarified. “I didn't want to do that with my children. “Sometimes I enjoy saying, ‘Did you put on your deodorant today?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The state saw a nearly 400 percent jump in applications to get filming subsidies. They're projected to generate $1.1 billion in economic activity across multiple industries with ties to the entertainment industry and employ 6,500 cast and crew members, as well as 46,100 background performers. Most of the filming is expected to take place in Los Angeles, where workers have been experiencing a shortage of jobs since the dual writers and actors strikes. This allotment of subsidies saw a nearly 400 percent increase in applications, according to the film commission. “Not only does this credit allow us to work with the best crews and craftspeople around but, more importantly, it allows us to create jobs and support the LA film community at a time when it's more important than ever.” There's a separate incentive for productions that relocate from another state to California, which Tom Segura's Netflix series Bad Thoughts is taking advantage of as it moves away from Texas. California has steadily been losing production as other regions beef up their incentive programs in a race to host Hollywood. One example: In June, Texas passed a law that increased by $100 million the amount allotted to movies and TV shows every two years.

Both knew the feeling of an extensive stay well: Post Malone previously … posted 14 weeks in charge via “Rockstar” in 2017-18, while Swae Lee and his brother Slim Jxmmi, as duo Rae Sremmurd, ruled for seven weeks with “Black Beatles” in 2016-17. Bruno Mars had much to like in 2017, as singles from his ‘90s R&B-inspired album, 24K Magic, reaped massive rewards. “That's What I Like,” the album's second single (after its title track), celebrated 10 weeks at No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2013, pushing its main creators, duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, to a banner breakout year. Follow-up single “Can't Hold Us” captured seven weeks at No. 1 later that year, and “Thrift Shop” wrapped 2013 as the year-end No. 1 track on the annual Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs recap. “Sure Thing” was already a hit upon its release, hitting No. 1 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for a week in 2011. An unexpected revival from TikTok in 2023, however, pushed it into the history books. In its run, the track surpassed two other of the genre's juggernaut tracks (Deborah Cox's “Nobody's Supposed To Be Here” and Mariah Carey's “We Belong Together”) as the longest-leading hit by a woman, a mark that Blige owned for the next 17 years. Erasing any notion of being a one-year wonder, Lil Nas X found more hits in 2021, including his smash collaboration with Jack Harlow. The rising talents' joint effort was a runaway success, posting 19 weeks at No. At the time, Lil Nas X owned the two longest leaders, with 2019's “Old Town Road” (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus) in first place, with 20 frames.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Summers and Copeland filed their lawsuit in London High Court, claiming they were never properly credited as songwriters on "Every Breath You Take." Sting is being sued by his former Police bandmates Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland over alleged missing royalties for their signature song “Every Breath You Take,” according to reports published by the Los Angeles Times and other titles. The pair also claim they never received royalties for their contributions to it. Here's What Selena Gomez Has to Say About Sharing Her Engagement Era With 'Bestie' Taylor Swift Drops Explosive Trailer Featuring Kim Kardashian, Drake & Elon Musk Released in 1983, “Every Breath You Take” logged eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, longer than any other single that year. It was the band's first and only leader on the chart, and won a brace of Grammy Awards, for song of the year and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals. The evergreen number grew wings when Summers' arpeggio was sampled on Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' Notorious B.I.G. tribute from 1997, “I'll Be Missing You.” In 2023, Puff Daddy went on the record as saying he pays Sting $5,000 every day for the use of that sample, a comment he later walked back. While terms of that deal were not disclosed, Billboard previously reported that Sting had been shopping a music asset bundle that produced an annual royalty income stream of about $12-$13 million and was looking at a roughly $360 million payday. With their bleach-blonde hair, tight performances, and collection of radio friendly hits, including “Roxanne,” “Message in a Bottle”, “Walking on The Moon”, “Don't Stand So Close to Me”, “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” “King of Pain” and more, The Police were arguably the biggest band in the world, certainly for an album cycle or two. The bandmates went their separate ways after completing the 1984 world tour in support of Synchronicity, before reuniting briefly in 1986 for a re-recording in “Don't Stand So Close To Me,” which appeared on a greatest hits collection. Sting is booked to perform at QPAC's Glasshouse Theatre in Brisbane next year, where he will present his musical The Last Ship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Aug. 26, the superstar couple announced their engagement via a gorgeous, flower-filled Instagram post captioned with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” While no details about the upcoming wedding have been shared publicly, it's no surprise that the suggestions are rolling on—and that includes a cheeky idea to host the wedding at a beloved college football stadium in Swift's home state of Pennsylvania. A post shared by Penn State University (@pennstate) Hours after Swift and Kelce revealed they were engaged, a post on Penn State University's Instagram page featured a photo from the proposal. The university's Nittany Lion mascot was then added in, with a bubble that read, “Congrats on your engagement! We have the perfect wedding venue to seat 107k of your closest friends.” A second slide showed photos from the couple's flower-filled engagement day, as well as shots of Swift performing in State College, PA.  Another photo featured reception tables, seemingly from past events at the school. For more than 60 years, Beaver Stadium has been home to the Nittany Lions at Penn State's University Park campus. The Bryce Jordan Center is a 15,261-seat arena on Penn State's main University Park campus. A post shared by Penn State Football (@pennstatefball) The Knot previously posted photos from the nuptials for two PSU alumni in 2015 after their wedding was held at their alma mater's Beaver Stadium.</p>
