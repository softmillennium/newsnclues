                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live Season 51 is going to look a lot different. “It'll be announced in a week or so,” said Michaels on Aug. 22, noting that this upcoming season he feels “the pressure to reinvent.” Here's everyone who has exited Saturday Night Live ahead of Season 51: Multiple outlets, including Variety and People, confirmed that Heidi Gardner won't be returning to SNL for Season 51. Gardner was an SNL staple and worked at the NBC show for eight years. The comedian participated in more sketches than any other cast member in Season 49, and was known for her “Weekend Update” character, teen movie critic Bailey Gismert. On Thursday, Aug. 28, several outlets confirmed that Longfellow was officially out ahead of SNL 51. He has yet to address his departure on social media. The news came as a surprise to some after LateNighter reported that Longfellow taped a screen test for the Weekend Update segment, which Colin Jost and Michael Che currently co-host. “I won't be returning to SNL next year,” he wrote on Instagram. Wakim shared that he found out about his departure while at Six Flags and went on an “emotional walk through Bugs Bunny Park and stared out across Daffy Duck Lake thinking about life.” Wakin also thanked SNL creator Lorne Michaels for believing in him and “changing my life.” ‘SNL' Parts Ways With Emil Wakim Amid Rumored Season 51 Cast Shakeup Devon Walker Exits ‘SNL' After Three Seasons: ‘Sometimes It Was Toxic as Hell' Pete Davidson Was ‘Embarrassed' by the Focus on His ‘Big Dick Energy' Walker joked that he's trying to be “in a prestige drama” next, “ideally something with Julianne Moore.” Yim and Baker, who were both writers on the show, are also departing Saturday Night Live. Yim was a part of the SNL writing room for five years. “I was the first-ever out trans person to be a writer for SNL.

And yet Amazon Prime Video via its subscriptions has “more than a 100” different streamers you've probably never heard of that you can get without needing a hundred different logins and passwords. On Thursday, Amazon and NBCUniversal announced that Peacock Premium would now be available as a subscription add-on via Prime Video. It means instead of subscribing directly to Peacock, you can get all of Peacock's content by adding it to your Prime membership (it's priced at $16.99 per month and $169.99 per year and is ad-free). That in itself isn't notable, but with Peacock joining the fray, it leaves Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu the only major streamers that you can't get on Amazon. Related Stories Spike Lee's Return to Katrina Is a Poignant, Cagey Prayer for a Brighter Future That Is Still Out of Sight ‘Chief of War' Demonstrates the Fine Art of Lighting Things on Fire HBO Max returned to Amazon not long ago after being away, and Apple TV+ joining the service was a big coup considering the two tech giants are massive competitors and that Apple fancies itself as its own one-stop shop for people to stream whatever they want. Some of the other subscriptions you can add include Paramount+, FOX One, MGM+, Crunchyroll, STARZ, BET+, AMC+, and BritBox, to name just a few. While those are all streamers that have their own apps you can subscribe to directly, Amazon also has plenty that don't have their own terrestrial apps you can download and are only available through places like Amazon or other channels. One we previously reported on was Wonder Project, which is the faith-based company behind “House of David,” and today they announced it launches on October 5, just to add to the hundreds of services. Because Amazon also offers many of these streamers as part of bundles, it makes it that much less likely that you cancel Amazon Prime entirely. It also helps Amazon as a brand, because although Peacock may officially be the home to “Poker Face” and “The Traitors,” if you're accessing those shows and HBO's and Paramount's all through one platform on Amazon, the average user begins to not even be able to tell the difference. Disney meanwhile has taken great pains (and billions of dollars) to merge the functionality of Disney+, Hulu, and the newly launched ESPN streamer into one place.

The Sphere Entertainment Co. executive chairman and CEO took part in a walkthrough of the experience with select press — alongside Sphere president and chief operating officer Jennifer Koester and visual effects specialist Ben Grossmann — and revealed that there is one specific A.I.-assisted change to keep an eye out for. “I won't tell you where, it's only for like two seconds,” as he asked reporters if they were familiar with Warner Bros. After an affirmative, he said, “[They] replaced the faces of two very short, two-second characters in the movie with mine and David. It adds buzz to the Sphere's already buzzing new attraction, which features an immersive adaptation of the classic film — like when that tornado hits Kansas, attendees will have wind whipping at their face, leaves flying in front of them and bolts of lightning puncturing the fog. We could either hire modern artists to reanimate those performances by hand, which we felt would destroy the integrity of the original performance,” or embrace “a new technology that allows you to train on things that existed before it, so that it can reproduce those things accurately. And then we tested it for two years to make sure that if we used A.I., we would actually have more integrity to the original performances than if we didn't, because the only other alternatives were computer graphics that would be humans manipulating the performance.” being used on the 1939 film, Grossmann noted that “the original work of art continues to exist” in many other places. models, which can be controversial, are fine tuned specifically and exclusively on the original material. So we've done all the things that people have been concerned about doing right and no one has done before.” and wants people to see the movie before they cast judgement. Grossmann responded, “I think [with] the controversy around A.I. replacing humans through technology, we ended up employing more artists on this project than I think Hollywood has employed in previous years, just to continue this journey,” working with more than 1,000 artists throughout the process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: When NBC's Chicago Med returns this fall for its eleventh season, it will be without one of its three remaining original cast members. Marlyne Barrett, who has played doting yet no-nonsense ER nurse Maggie Lockwood since the show's 2015 launch, is stepping back from the medical drama for personal reasons, sources tell Deadline. This is envisioned as a temporary leave, and the hope is for her to return at some point, I hear. As Deadline reported in June, the other two Chicago Med original cast members, series stars S. Epatha Merkerson (Sharon Goodwin) and Oliver Platt (Daniel Charles), are set to come back after their options for the 2025-26 season were picked up. And just this week, Deadline broke the news that fellow OG Nick Gehlfuss, who left after eight seasons, will make a return this season as a guest-star, reprising his role as Dr. Will Halstead. RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Over the years, Barrett's Charge Nurse Maggie has become the eyes, ears and heart of Gaffney Medical's Emergency Department, endlessly dedicated to her position and loyal to all the physicians around her. In Season 5, Maggie was diagnosed with cancer and eventually went into remission. Barrett announced her real-life diagnosis of uterine and ovarian cancer in July 2022. Chicago Med, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, is executive produced by Dick Wolf, Allen MacDonald, Stephen Hootstein and Peter Jankowski.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorne Michaels says he's feeling "pressure to reinvent this season" after the show's landmark 50th year. Ahead of the season 51 premiere of Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4, Lorne Michaels confirmed in an interview that a few familiar faces will not return to the cast this fall — and those exits are starting to be announced one by one. “I wanted people coming back and being part of [the 50th season],” Michaels told Puck. “So when Kate [McKinnon] hosted, Kristen [Wiig] and Maya [Rudolph] came back for it. And that meant there couldn't be those kind of disruptions or anything that was going to take the focus off [the 50th season].” Other vets in the mix: Weekend Update co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che, who both joined the cast in 2014; Mikey Day (2016); Heidi Gardner (2017); Ego Nwodim (2018); and Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang (both 2019). But who won't be back when the sketch comedy show returns to Studio 8H in October? Devon Walker joined the cast in 2022 as a featured player for season 48. On Aug. 26, Walker confirmed his exit from the show with an Instagram post captioned “me and baby broke up.” He expounded on his exit in a note posted to Instagram with the cheeky title “wait..did he quit or did he get fired?,” writing in part: “To me, jobs in this industry feel like a bunch of little marriages. Emil Wakim was one of three featured players added for season 50 (alongside Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline), so he only spent one season as part of the SNL cast. Wakim announced the news Aug. 27 on Instagram, writing in part: “i won't be returning to snl next year. i was at six flags celebrating my friends 36th birthday and went on a really emotional walk through bugs bunny park and stared out across daffy duck lake thinking about life. it was the most terrifying, thrilling, and rewarding experience of my life and i will miss it dearly and all the brilliant people that work there that made it feel like a home. thank u to lorne for taking a chance on me and changing my life.” Unlike Walker and Wakim, Longfellow did not announce his own departure; Deadline broke the news on Aug. 28 and Longfellow has yet to comment. Heidi Gardner is the longest-running cast member to exit so far, joining the show in 2017 as a featured player on season 43. She was promoted to full-time cast two years later, in 2019, spending eight seasons on the show. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

A major star for the majority of his adult life, Jay Kelly has so thoroughly subsumed himself into his classic screen persona — smirking, debonair, heroic — that he no longer seems to know who he is off set. More troublingly, the world-famous actor has come to like it that way. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.” That quote serves as an almost oppressively fitting epigraph for the misty-eyed Netflix movie that Noah Baumbach has made about one of the last true Hollywood stars — or two of them, I should say, as Jay Kelly is so transparent a stand-in for the actor who plays him that he and George Clooney share the same body of work. (No complaint here: “Funny People” is one of my favorite genres). Plath's words help to frame “Jay Kelly” as the story of a dashing sexagenerian who's known by everyone and no one in equal measure, but Baumbach's uncharacteristically precious screenplay, co-written with thee Emily Mortimer, has little trouble articulating that dilemma on its own terms. Related Stories That ‘Star Wars: Starfighter' First Look Is Our Line in the Sand: No More Black and White First Look Images! There's an immediately perceptible twinge of regret in Clooney's voice, like the kind of shooting pain that can't mean anything serious so long as you choose to ignore it, but the real wound of that double-bladed dialogue won't be felt until much later. No, the problem for Jay is that his memories are movies: They're frozen in time, shared by everyone who's seen them, and practically impossible to change once they've been cemented in the public imagination. On set, Jay has the power to go again. Which is to say that yes, “Jay Kelly” is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves. Baumbach lacks Sofia Coppola's singular ability to leverage a character's wealth for the wanting it reveals of them, but he, Mortimer, and Clooney share a vivid understanding of the resentments that can form in the space between who we are and how we're seen — and of how stardom can widen that space to the point that friendships and families are liable to fall into it unnoticed. It's a space that Baumbach explores here with an unusually gentle touch. On the one hand, the “Meyerowitz Stories” director has never been as allergic to sentimentality as his prickliest work might suggest, and I find it hard to begrudge any of the great filmmakers for going soft as they get older — we should all be so lucky to reach the back half of our lives and feel as if the world was a kinder, more loving place than we once thought. Here, Baumbach compensates for that sometimes clumsily overdrawn emotionality by rooting his film in a cragged bedrock of sadness — one that adds a serrated edge to the constant refrain of “I was too busy having sex with movie stars to spend time with my daughters” melancholy. Peter was desperately fending off irrelevance the last time they spoke, and had begged Jay to help him get his comeback project off the ground. Jay felt the project was too raw and vulnerable for his brand, and was unmoved by Peter's appeal to his filial duty. That suspicion furrows something deep behind Jay's eyes; it's a serious wrinkle on the face of someone whose job requires him to be a dimple-cheeked blank slate at all times, pliable enough to play a variety of parts but always recognizably “himself.” A whole team of people have devoted the best years of their lives to ensuring that Jay never has to feel anything worse than mild discomfort, his sweet if self-annihilating manager Ron Sukenick (Adam Sandler) chief among them, but they don't pick up on the aftershocks of Peter's death until after it's too late. The next thing Ron knows, Jay has a black eye, he's pulling out of the big new movie he's due to start in a few days, and he's loading his entire team onto a plane to France as part of a wildly ill-advised plan to crash his teenage daughter's European vacation and spend some quality time with her before she goes to college in the fall. And so an overnight train ride that puts Jay among the common folk becomes the venue for a head trip down memory lane, complete with Trafalmadorian flashbacks that taunt the movie star by denying him another take. By design, “Jay Kelly” strikes an uneasy balance between moving forward and being stuck in the past. The long and emotionally imprecise flashbacks — which find Jay revisiting the critical audition where he upstaged Timothy, a set romance he had with one of his co-stars, and a more recent therapy session that he attended with his semi-estranged adult daughter (Riley Keough) — are meant to act as headwinds for a story about a man careening out of control, but none of them crackle with Baumbach's usual wit, and all of them suffer from a slightly elevated tone that only serves the “unreality” of Jay's life by making every part of it even harder to believe. That Clooney is just playing a sadder, more blinkered version of himself — one who never found a lasting love, nor started a family he was interested in keeping — would seem to solve any issues of verisimilitude, and there are a number of sequences in “Jay Kelly” where his real-life fame adds credence to the chaos we're seeing on-screen (most of them having to do with a starstruck member of the public). There are also several moments in which the self-reflexiveness of Clooney's casting effectively baits us into believing that the Cary Grant of his day is baring his soul for our edification. That he's waving us backstage and confessing the awful truth that some part of ourselves always looked for behind every red carpet smile and Golden Globes acceptance speech. That money, looks, and an unimpeachable run across the six greatest seasons of any network drama ever made don't make him better than us, even though that third thing objectively does. The last of those moments is heartstoppingly transcendent, as Baumbach brings the full weight of Clooney's iconography to bear on Jay's most private misgivings. There's no use in faulting Clooney for his performance, as no one does Clooney better, and his leading man appeal — somehow wide-eyed and “aw shucks” at the same time — has seldom been used more acutely than it is here. Alas, his ineffable Clooney-ness also has the perverse effect of making “Jay Kelly” less convincing at the same time, at least so far as its lead character is being played by a man who makes all of his foibles that much harder to believe. I'm sure George Clooney has problems of his own, but no one would have a harder time inhabiting the problems that Corge Glooney is meant to have in this movie. That Jay Kelly's flaws clash against George Clooney's charms is precisely the point, of course — one is simply no match for the other. Some employees, like his publicist (Laura Dern), bail at the first sign of real trouble. Others, like Ron, are suffering from too great a sunk-cost fallacy to quit on him now. Sandler wears the shit out of a puffy Polo vest, and it's fun to see him lead with quiet resignation instead of unchecked rage, but I don't know if he's ever starred in a movie that's given him less to do. Getting close to other people was something that Jay always planned to do later, and the prospect of receiving a tribute from a Tuscan film festival is an unavoidable sign that he's running out of time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not surprising to see more Saturday Night Live staffers departing the show as Lorne Michaels commences his annual purge, but the latest name to be announced does come as a bit of a shock. Repertory player Michael Longfellow is officially out, Deadline reports. Longfellow didn't have much screentime in season 50—in May he joked that he only worked “like 12 hours a week”—but earlier this week, Late Nighter reported that the comedian had screen tested alongside writer KC Shornima to potentially take over the Weekend Update desk. Whether the new update means Michael Che and Colin Jost will stay in the job for at least another year is unclear, but Longfellow definitely won't be subbing in. Deadline did not specify whether Longfellow was fired or left of his own accord, and as of this writing, neither NBC nor Longfellow himself have commented on the departure. Longfellow follows writers Celeste Yim and Rosebud Baker as well as performers Devon Walker and Emil Wakim, the latter of which indicated in his post about the news that he was let go. It's a shame he won't be returning to the Weekend Update desk (much less running it) as he did have some memorable moments on the segment, including bits in which he discussed TikTok and Real ID, during his tenure. Ahead of the show's 50th anniversary special earlier this year, Longfellow offered some advice to new cast members, per Entertainment Weekly. You can stay up for two days in a row. “It's not fun, but you can do that.” Longfellow also works as a touring stand-up comic outside of SNL, but at least he can get a little more sleep going forward. We'll see what other cast members hit the road during SNL‘s great shake-up, which doesn't show any signs of slowing down over the next few days or weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal officials arrested two firefighters on Wednesday during what appeared to be an immigration raid on first responders combating the ongoing Bear Gulch wildfire in Washington state. According to a report from The Seattle Times, a spokesperson for the Incident Management Team responding to the blaze said that they were “aware of a Border Patrol operation on the fire.” According to sources who spoke to the Times — including firefighters who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — federal agents spent over three hours running identification checks on two contracted response crews. “You risked your life out here to save the community,” one firefighter said. “I asked them if his (family) can say goodbye to him because they're family, and they're just ripping them away,” the firefighter said. “And this is what he said: ‘You need to get the (expletive) out of here. The move to conduct immigration enforcement raids on an active emergency response, and on emergency responders themselves, is a stark departure from past Department of Homeland Security policies. Under the Biden administration, the department had clear policies stating that “absent exigent circumstances, immigration enforcement will not be conducted at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided.” In another departure, the DHS has moved to ban aid groups and state organizations receiving federal funds from providing emergency response assistance to undocumented migrants. The new guidelines, first reported on Wednesday by The Washington Post, state that groups may not “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration.” The guidance requires organizations to cooperate with ICE and immigration enforcement, forcing them to “provide access to detainees, such as when an immigration officer seeks to interview a person who might be a removable alien,” and prohibiting them from “harboring, concealing, or shielding from detection illegal aliens.” Bruce Willis Is Living in a Separate Home Away From Family as Part of His Dementia Care All the ‘Saturday Night Live' Cast and Writers Leaving Ahead of Season 51 At the same time, the administration has revoked guidelines preventing ICE and immigration officials from detaining migrants at hospitals, churches, schools, and even immigration hearings. For the Trump administration, the spaces and places where an already marginalized community are at their most vulnerable are hunting grounds for detention quotas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Merit's former broadcasting partners Trinity Broadcasting and Professional Bull Riders (PBR) have joined forces to accuse Phil McGraw of all sorts of shady shit, most notably that he swindled both organizations for millions and then used the bankruptcy to launch a new media venture, Envoy. But the materials PBR has managed to acquire are pretty damning. Text messages from Merit Street's chief operating officer Joel Cheatwood suggest a bankruptcy conspiracy, evidenced by the fact that he instructed employees to keep all communications off of their work emails. The texts (via The Independent) lay out a scheme to wind down operations at Merit Street while shifting staffers over to Envoy. He also texted that he and Merit's Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon needed to “be very careful with our public activities associated with Envoy since we are still full and active employees” of Merit, adding that any “[a]ctivities that would indicate we are more focused on Envoy could be problematic if called into question.” On June 30 (two days before the bankruptcy), Mr. Cheatwood instructed a colleague that ‘any communication involving timing of events, strategies, etc. we need to not use the merit street e-mail system. (PBR hasn't outright sued Merit Street, but accused the company of failing to pay millions in owed payments.) “The documents produced to date demonstrate that this bankruptcy was conceived as a scheme to divert the Debtor's employees and intellectual property to Envoy, a competing business Dr. Phil founded the day before this case was filed, and leave the Debtor's business as a shell with nothing more than a repeated loop of re-runs.” “By its own admission in a meet-and-confer between counsel on August 26, 2025, Peteski still has not produced all of Phillip C. McGraw's emails and text messages (despite his deposition being scheduled to begin in less than 48 hours from the time of such conference), nor has it produced all of the documents concerning Envoy,” Trinity stated in its own filing (via Deadline). The pattern is so striking that it is more than mere déjà vu; it is a deliberate rerun, scripted by parties who have decided that the Court's orders are optional guidance rather than binding directives.” September film preview: Leonardo DiCaprio endures One Battle After Another By Matt Schimkowitz August 26, 2025 | 7:00am Suggests Antidepressants Could Be the Reason for Mass Shootings, Ignores Guns</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hayley Williams of Paramore has released a new solo album comprised of the 17 tracks shared earlier this summer and the new bonus song “Parachute.” Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party is out now on streaming services, with physical releases arriving on November 7 via Post Atlantic—Williams' own label, started after her 20-year contract with Atlantic ended—and distributed by Secretly Distribution. Since granting the title track with a music video, Williams has also shared a visual for “Glum,” directed by AJ Gibboney and Zac Farro, which you can watch below. Back in 2020, Williams made her solo debut with the full-length album Petals for Armor. She followed it up with the three-track Petals for Armor: Self-Serenades EP that same year and Flowers for Vases / Descansos in 2021. She described the latter LP as “a prequel, or some sort of detour between parts 1 and 2 of Petals.” Afterward, Paramore wrote and released their fifth studio album as a band, This Is Why, in 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before releasing his great new album, Live Laugh Love, Earl Sweatshirt played it for fans at a Los Angeles listening party. Earl Sweatshirt is now giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the whole imposter process, via his new video for “Crisco.” The new video, from director, producer, and editor Jimmy Regular, begins with a simple message: “earl was not looking forward to performing at his album listening party. instead, he decided to cast someone to embody his overall essence on stage.” From there, we see that Sweatshirt, his mother, and Zack Fox auditioned four men to fill in for the rapper. The obvious candidate was Gary Murakami, who spent some time with Sweatshirt to see what living life as the Californian is really like. Watch the “Crisco” video below. “Crisco” is the second Live Laugh Love track to get a music video, following “Tourmaline.” The album follows 2022's Sick! and the Alchemist collaboration Voir Dire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Gosling stars in the Shawn Levy-directed Star Wars movie. Flynn Gray, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams are the new additions on the call sheet for the Lucasfilm feature, which is being directed by Shawn Levy and stars Ryan Gosling. Mia Goth and Matt Smith were already revealed to be in the cast, playing villains. “I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” said Levy in a statement. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. Star Wars shaped my sense of what story can do, how characters and cinematic moments can live with us forever. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.” Katee Sackhoff Says 'The Mandalorian' Ruined Her Confidence: "It Broke Me" Starfighter is a standalone film not connected to previous Star Wars movies or characters from the so-called Skywalker Saga, the films revolving around Luke Skywalker and his father, Anakin. The script, penned by Jonathan Tropper and which, of course, is being kept under wraps, is said to see Gosling's character protect a young charge from evildoers in a galaxy-spanning adventure. Actors Stateside and in the UK were in contention for months and months before casting Gray, who has appeared in one episode of Wednesday and an Irish crime show titled Borderline. Lucasfilm did not reveal plot or character details in Thursday's announcement. Bird is known for his work on The Inbetweeners series and movies, while Westman appeared with Claire Danes in period mini-series The Essex Serpent.

It keeps their nervous system calm and at ease when they see their parents are still together, we all come together as a family.” Her actions have proven that these aren't mere words. Earlier this year, she posted Instagram photos showing the exes celebrating their kids' birthdays together. But beyond co-parenting, she's also making sure to foster independence — no matter how challenging it may be. A recent event showed that her methods are working. When 7-year-old Cairo went to the school nurse after being hit with a ball, the nurse asked if she should call Mowry. “But I had to allow this opportunity for her to gain independence and say, ‘I got this. If her kids are uncomfortable with something, she doesn't expect them to do it. “I think growing up, it was definitely a cultural thing where it's like, ‘My house, my rules,'” she clarified. “I didn't want to do that with my children. “Sometimes I enjoy saying, ‘Did you put on your deodorant today?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Aug. 26, the superstar couple announced their engagement via a gorgeous, flower-filled Instagram post captioned with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” While no details about the upcoming wedding have been shared publicly, it's no surprise that the suggestions are rolling on—and that includes a cheeky idea to host the wedding at a beloved college football stadium in Swift's home state of Pennsylvania. A post shared by Penn State University (@pennstate) Hours after Swift and Kelce revealed they were engaged, a post on Penn State University's Instagram page featured a photo from the proposal. The university's Nittany Lion mascot was then added in, with a bubble that read, “Congrats on your engagement! We have the perfect wedding venue to seat 107k of your closest friends.” A second slide showed photos from the couple's flower-filled engagement day, as well as shots of Swift performing in State College, PA.  Another photo featured reception tables, seemingly from past events at the school. For more than 60 years, Beaver Stadium has been home to the Nittany Lions at Penn State's University Park campus. The Bryce Jordan Center is a 15,261-seat arena on Penn State's main University Park campus. A post shared by Penn State Football (@pennstatefball) The Knot previously posted photos from the nuptials for two PSU alumni in 2015 after their wedding was held at their alma mater's Beaver Stadium.</p>
