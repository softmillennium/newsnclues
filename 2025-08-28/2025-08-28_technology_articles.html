                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trolling, which resulted in the show getting review bombed, of course, is weird considering that both these major plot aspects are also present in Neil Druckmann's series of Naughty Dog games. “Because there's nothing I can do about it anyway. So I'm like, there's not really any point in reading or looking at anything,” Ramsey shared. But it doesn't affect the show; it doesn't affect how the show continues or anything in any way. So no, I just don't really engage.” Ramsey addressed how that vocal minority of vile-spewing can sincerely excuse themselves from engaging with season three, which will see showrunner Craig Mazin, helming solo after Druckmann stepped back, follow the show's antagonist Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who killed Joel (Pascal). The shift in leading characters will delve into Abby's world to inform her worldview. How Ellie comes into play is under wraps but Ramsey affirmed that they hope haters steer clear if they won't approach the story with an open mind: “You don't have to watch it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deal was structured in a way to penalize Intel if it spins out its foundry business unit, which makes custom chips for outside customers, within the next few years. Last week's deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. “I think from the government's perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn't want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said. Zinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week's deal, according to Reuters. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters today that the deal was still being ironed out. But this warrant also forces Intel to keep a business unit that is losing money. There have been calls from analysts, board members, and investors alike to spin out the struggling foundry unit, which looked like it might actually happen last fall, before Intel Foundry's architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, retired suddenly in December.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. From searching your files to scheduling haircuts to supporting emergency response — it's been a heck of an entrepreneurial journey for Max Keenan and James Liu. The young founders just raised $14 million for Aurelian, a Seattle-based company that uses AI and voice technology to help 911 call centers respond to non-emergency calls. After graduating from the University of Chicago, Keenan and Liu raised a pre-seed round for a company called Needl in 2022 and joined the prestigious Y Combinator accelerator. “We just didn't love our customers,” Keenan said. They sat down and asked themselves: what are we really trying to do here? “Our core framework for what we thought would make us happiest was if we were working with interesting tech for people who did meaningful work,” Keenan recalled this week in an interview with GeekWire. So they went back to the drawing board in 2023 and explored ideas around conversational AI, a technology that was rapidly improving thanks to advances in large language models. They started experimenting with salon booking — helping small businesses automate appointment scheduling and price quotes. But it was a different problem that led the entrepreneurs to 911 call centers. “She called the police department's non-emergency line and probably waited 30 or 40 minutes,” Keenan said. “Most are still working with on-premises software, and very few have gone fully into the cloud for their core systems,” Keenan said. Call centers connect their existing phone lines to Aurelian's AI assistant, which answers calls, gathers information, and asks follow-up questions. It can fully resolve non-emergency calls (stolen wallets, parking violations, noise complaints) without a human dispatcher or re-route to an appropriate worker. The tech can also handle language nuance (“robbery” vs. “burglary”) and vague location data. The idea is to help free up employees to address emergency calls with immediate needs while also reducing wait times for non-emergency requests. Since launching in May 2024, Aurelian has more than a dozen agencies across the U.S. using its product, including seven in Washington state. Aurelian was able to answer more than 500 calls about power outages in a 24-hour span. “We answered every single one of those calls instantly,” Keenan said. One call was from a woman who needed help with her husband's chair lift that was stuck halfway up the stairs. Aurelian is on track to automate more than one million calls each month. NEA led the Series A round, which included participation from several of the company's original investors — including Liquid 2 Ventures, Y Combinator, and Palm Drive Capital. “This was the first time we woke up every day excited to work with our customers,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fusion power startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised $863 million from a long list of investors that includes Nvidia, Google, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, and more. '” co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard told reporters in a call this week. “This round of capital isn't just about fusion just generally as a concept, but it's about how do we go to make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor.” Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) previously raised a $1.8 billion round in 2021. Fusion power has long been promised as a nearly limitless energy source, though it wasn't until recently that investors considered it a bet worth placing. The company expects to turn that device on later next year and achieve scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it. Assuming Sparc doesn't reveal any major problems, CFS expects to begin construction on Arc, its commercial-scale power plant, in Virginia starting in 2027 or 2028. The Sparc and Arc designs are both tokamaks, a type of fusion reactor that uses powerful superconducting magnets to confine and compress plasma. “We know that this kind of idea should work,” Mordijck said. No single investor led the round, and a number of existing investors increased their stakes, said Ally Yost, CFS's senior vice president of corporate development. The new investors include Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Nvidia's NVentures, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation. Such a broad base of investors may prove helpful as the company develops its supply chain and searches for partners to build its power plants and buy electricity from them. So far, the company has inked a deal with Google to buy 200 megawatts from Arc. As the first of its kind, Arc is likely to cost more than subsequent power plants, Mordijck said. It's also to have the receipts, know what these things cost.” Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is switching to a reusable cup program facilitated by Bold Reuse, a Portland-based startup, in the venue's ongoing bid to eliminate waste at sports and entertainment events. Fans will receive their drinks in durable cups that can be returned to collection bins throughout the stadium. The cups are collected, professionally sanitized and returned by Bold Reuse. Climate Pledge Arena has received accolades for its environmental efforts, and in 2023 became the first sports stadium in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from a nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings. The arena is named after The Climate Pledge, an initiative founded by Amazon and Global Optimism asking global corporations to become net zero carbon by 2040. Bold Reuse initially launched as GO Box in 2011, providing reusable takeout containers. Bold Reuse launched a pilot program with material science company Avery Dennison in June in which RFID tags are being implemented to track the entire lifecycle of reusable cups — from distribution and return to wash cycles and end-of-life. Earlier this month, Bold Reuse announced a new partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs — the first NFL team to offer reusable cups stadium-wide for every event.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An overly broad age assurance law in Mississippi is leading to arguments about which platforms — Bluesky, Mastodon, or others — offer the best solution for avoiding crackdowns on internet freedoms. The law, HB 1126, requires platforms to implement age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. Users in Mississippi soon scrambled for a workaround, which tends to involve the use of VPNs. However, others questioned why a VPN would be the necessary solution here. After all, decentralized social networking was meant to reduce the control and power the state — or any authority — would have over these social platforms. “There is nobody that can decide for the fediverse to block Mississippi.” This prompted a response from Techdirt founder and Bluesky board member Mike Masnick, who said Rochko's statement was “potentially misleading.” TechCrunch reached out to Mastodon to confirm whether it would comply with the law on the mastodon.social instance, and we didn't hear back by time of publication. Rochko and Masnick then engaged in a rather spicy back-and-forth, as others chimed in, with Rochko accusing Bluesky of having all its infrastructure run by one U.S. company — meaning Bluesky PBC, the company behind the Bluesky social app. He also said that it was “interesting” that this was the only time someone from Bluesky had said anything to him about “working together” — i.e. to fight such legislation — since Bluesky's launch nearly two years ago. “Well, I believe you have my e-mail address,” Rochko wrote. Instead of allowing people to run their own servers to create a community, Bluesky lets people run their own versions of the bits and pieces that make up its social networking infrastructure, like the PDS (personal data server), relay, moderation lists, or algorithm. That means the majority of Bluesky's users are relying on its own infrastructure. However, a community called Blacksky recently spun up its own PDS, so things are progressing on that front. In the meantime, these turf battles don't do anything to help the users of Mississippi who have been locked out of their preferred social networks. Without using a VPN, some users in the state report they've been able to access Bluesky through third-party clients like Graysky, Skeets, Klearsky, TOKIMEKI, Flashes, or forked versions of the Bluesky app, like Deer.social or Zeppelin. Rudy Fraser, Blacksky founder, confirmed to TechCrunch that his community doesn't plan on blocking any users based on where they're located, anywhere in the world. There's also a sideloaded version of Bluesky available, which was uploaded to the alternative app distribution platform AltStore. To sideload, first install AltStore on Mac or Windows with permissions and developer mode enabled. Still, these workarounds aren't necessarily permanent solutions, as the makers of the apps and clients have to decide for themselves whether they want to risk becoming a popular alternative for users in Mississippi that could catch legislators' attention. As it stands, the law broadly affects services that allow users to create profiles, post content, and interact with others on a social networking service — a broad definition. The latter is particularly challenging, as it includes a time limit for usage of social media sites. But overly broad laws also advantage the larger centralized platforms, which easily have the resources to comply, while smaller services like Bluesky just have to opt out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Marketing vet Brian Hall has left Google for a new, undisclosed position. “I'll be working in AI — directly or helping build the platforms to take advantage of it,” he wrote. Hall began his tech career at Microsoft in 1995 as a product manager for Windows and Internet Explorer. He stuck with the company for about 20 years, leaving as corporate vice president of hardware and devices. Saw was with Sprint for nearly seven years when T-Mobile acquired the company in 2020. Prior to Sprint, he was CTO at Bellevue's Clearwire for a decade. Saw is succeeding Ulf Ewaldsson, who joined T-Mobile in 2019 and was president of technology for more than two years. Callie Field, T-Mobile's business group president, is stepping down after more than two decades with the company.

These investors then voted on a short list of finalists, and the results were combined with PitchBook's “Venture Exit Predictor Tool” to produce the final ranking. The ranking, co-authored by Madrona, features a significant turnover rate with 27 new companies on the list, reflecting a rapid pace of innovation. The IA40 list highlights a small-but-impactful group of Seattle companies alongside a much larger representation from the Bay Area, which includes major players like OpenAI and Anthropic. GeekWire recently reported on the lack of superstar AI startups in the Seattle region, despite its brand as a global AI hub. Key takeaways from the IA40 report include the rise of next-generation user interfaces that are conversational and “agentic” — systems that can reason and execute autonomously. The report also highlights a multi-billion dollar opportunity in new AI tools for software development, along with the success of “service-as-software” business models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The investment was led by existing backers Meritech Capital Partners and Atomico, according to a statement released Thursday. The massive capital infusion positions it to take on its largest rival, Figma, which also uses a community-based model to create websites and design. It went public in 2023 and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this summer and now holds a lofty market cap of $37.68 billion. As the no-code and AI-driven design sector heats up, Framer's rapid valuation jump underscores investor enthusiasm for platforms that simplify web development using generative AI, making it a key player to watch as the industry continues to evolve. The company aims to attract larger enterprise clients as it scales. “Close to half of the latest Y Combinator batch launched with Framer, alongside global brands like Perplexity, Scale AI, Huel, Miro, Zapier, and Mixpanel,” Framer said in a statement. Venture capitalists see significant potential in AI-powered tools that enable rapid website creation and design, especially following the September 2023 IPO of Figma, which soared 250% on debut and has become a benchmark for the sector. It has since seen a rollercoaster ride for its share price. “Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said after Figma's IPO. “Because of this three-year bottleneck, tech IPO investors have been starved for new deals.” Venture capital firms invested approximately $162.8 billion across various deals in the first six months of 2025, according to data from PitchBook. Notably, about 30% of this funding was allocated to late-stage startups, reflecting a continued appetite among investors for established companies preparing for or already pursuing IPOs and acquisitions. Founded in 2014 in Amsterdam by by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk who had previously sold their company, Sofa, to Facebook, Framer initially focused on prototyping tools for website design. Over time, it expanded into web publishing and “no-code” development. The funding underscores a broader trend among technology investors betting heavily on startups that offer no-code or “vibe coding” features, which rely on generative AI models from providers like OpenAI. “We empower designers to publish websites without needing costly developers,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said in the statement today. Other startups in the space, such as Anysphere, which produces the AI coding assistant Cursor, are reaching hefty valuations on relatively modest revenue. Framer, on the other hand, generated around $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year and projects to double that figure in 2026, driven by growing demand for AI-enhanced design tools.

Ryan Gosling stars, and he'll be joined by Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams. “I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said on the official Star Wars website. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.” Above, you get our first glimpse of the film, featuring Gosling and Gray. In terms of the cast, Smith and Goth had been rumored, but several of the other names are brand new, and, among those, a few stand out. Aaron Pierre, who'll next be seen in the DC series Lanterns, is one. The talented Rebel Ridge actor is now also a DC and Star Wars guy. There's no word on who each is playing, but they are intriguing additions to the Star Wars universe. With Starfighter now in production, it's locking in on its release date of May 28, 2027, which is almost exactly 50 years after the release of the first Star Wars.

Spotted by @momomo_us, AMD has updated the OPN codes for some of its boxed Ryzen CPUs, with a new message highlighting the end-of-life status for Wraith Prism and Wraith Spire. Starting August, 2025, the cooler has been completely retired and will no longer come with processors such as the Ryzen 9 7900. AMD already moved away from including boxed coolers entirely with the Ryzen 9000 series, arguing that higher-end CPUs are paired with aftermarket solutions anyways. The only exception to this is the Ryzen 5 9600, which fittingly ships with a Wraith Stealth — so that's safe. Of the Ryzen 9000 series, only the Ryzen 5 9600 gets a Wraith Stealth cooler, but the Ryzen 7000 series fairs better with a handful of CPUs coming with in-box cooling. The Wraith Prism itself is an upgraded version of the original Wraith Max coolers that AMD shipped with its FX CPUs. While these coolers are technically nothing special, they still lowered the barrier to entry to a new platform. People previously using Intel processors, or building their first-ever PCs wouldn't have to worry about yet another component, avoiding the compatibility checks often needed before buying and pairing PC parts with each other. Nowadays, both AMD and Intel seem to have largely moved away from this model, forcing people to exclusively rely on a separate purchase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director Yorgos Lanthimos has made a habit of collaborating with Emma Stone specifically on dark comedy dramas with light sci-fi themes, such as 2023's Poor Things and 2024's Kinds of Kindness. And the trailer for their latest team-up, Bugonia, contains much of the same eclecticism, setting up a paranoia thriller that's equal parts about environmentalism and extraterrestrials. Bugonia, inspired by Korean director Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 sci-fi film, Save The Green Planet!, follows high-powered CEO Michelle (Stone), who is kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists who believe she's an alien tasked with destroying the Earth. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bugonia was initially developed by Hereditary and Midsommar director Ari Aster. As THR notes, this marks one of the rare instances in which Lanthimos will direct a film without having had a role in its early development. Despite not being involved in the initial work on the movie, Lathinmos said he felt drawn to its source material and screenwriter Will Tracy's fresh take on the tale. “I felt it was so funny and entertaining but also extremely impactful and made you really think about things deeply. Lanthimos didn't have any qualms about the film's prescience when it came to Bugonia‘s environmentalism messaging, THR reports. “Again, unfortunately, not much of the dystopia in this film is very fictional. Actually, it became more relevant as time went by. People need to choose the right path, otherwise, I don't know how much time [left] with everything that's happening in the world, with technology, AI, with wars, climate change, the denial of all these things and how desensitized we've become to all of these things. [The movie] is more of a reflection of our times and hopefully it will trigger people to think about what's happening today, all around the world.” “My personal belief is, yeah, for some people it might not be the right thing for them to see. Some people that don't like violence shouldn't see these things, but I also think we have an instinct in general to really close the book on things that are scary, that are hard to look at, hard to examine, hard to understand,” Plemons said. “For me as an actor, it is a way that I can try to make sense of some of these things and some of these people who are very difficult to understand. Given that the draw of Lanthimos' films is often that they are unsettling and occasionally uncomfortable while also being disarmingly funny, Bugonia is shaping up to be another return to form in a hat trick of sorts between its director and his muses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cuban said drug prices are opaque by design. “And we're adding the ability to pick it up in a local pharmacy,” Cuban added. To understand why Cuban's model is disruptive, it helps to know why drugs cost so much in the first place. But critics argue that prices are set to maximize profit and aren't directly tied to R&D costs. One 2021 study found that revenue from the top 20 best-selling drugs alone was enough for companies to wring a return from their R&D costs with billions left over. Cuban also pointed out another reason that drug prices skyrocket in the U.S.: artificial shortages. “Believe it or not, in this day and age, there are things like pediatric cancer drugs, Pitocin, sterile water, [and] this long list of drugs I can't even pronounce right, that go in short supply because the manufacturers want them to go in short supply, because that's how they jack up the price,” Cuban said. While there's limited direct evidence of intentional profiteering, it is true that during shortages, prices rise significantly. Cuban has a manufacturing plant in Dallas that's “all robotics driven.” “We created this factory where we can turn over a new drug in four hours and ship it out to hospitals,” he continued. “And so we're starting to attack those shortages.” While shipping drugs to patients has razor-thin margins, other aspects of Cost Plus Drugs, like drug manufacturing, are more profitable and help the business work toward profitability. Manufacturing is also another way to challenge the drug supply chain. But Cuban's strategy goes beyond just offering cheaper drugs — he says he's refusing to play by the rules entirely. I'm not going to work the way they want to do it, because that's not what's best aligned for patients.” Even Amazon, Cuban noted, fell into this trap. The tech giant has partnered with PBMs through Amazon Pharmacy, but that puts the big tech firm at a disadvantage because it's still “beholden to PBMs.” “Don't be dependent on them,” he said. “Because if I were 25 and starting this business, I probably would work through the pharmacy benefit managers because that's where the money is. How can I just get a small percentage of a $5 trillion market through technology, pricing, whatever it may be?” They can't react as quickly, and so that's always going to give the founder an edge.” Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Google is reportedly preparing to take a more proactive role in defending itself—and potentially other American organizations, U.S. infrastructure, etc.—from hackers. CyberScoop reported that Google Threat Intelligence Group vice president Sandra Joyce recently revealed that the company is planning to form a "disruption unit" in the coming months. “What we're doing in the Google Threat Intelligence Group is intelligence-led proactive identification of opportunities where we can actually take down some type of campaign or operation,” Joyce said. Joyce's revelation arrived at an event hosted by the Center for Cybersecurity Policy and Law, which published a report titled "To Hack Back, or Not Hack Back? That wouldn't necessarily allow companies like Google to contribute to offensive cyber operations, but it does show that such activity is a priority for this administration, at least. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" was followed by the Aug. 15 proposal of the "Scam Farms Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act of 2025," which, if passed, would "authorize the President of the United States to issue letters of marque and reprisal with respect to acts of aggression against the United States a member of a criminal enterprise or any conspirator associated with an enterprise involved in cybercrimes." Modern technology is no stranger to nautical metaphors — illegally procuring digital media is broadly known as "piracy," after all, and we still refer to products as being "flagship." But the Scam Farms Marque and Reprisal Authorization Act would rely on a practice that is quite literally from the "Age of Sail," as Wikipedia puts it, in an effort to discourage international cybercriminals from targeting American organizations. The current approach clearly isn't working; cybercriminals regularly target U.S. organizations with ransomware, steal their intellectual property, and in some cases siphon off money used to fund weapons programs.

But either way this is a massive change from the status quo, and if I were the one behind the hopefully metaphorical Guy Fawkes mask, I wouldn't be keen to find out what it looks like when the U.S. government and the companies it's been telling not to "hack back" finally decide to let loose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What appears to be a leaked shipping manifest may have given us the first glimpse at Intel's post-Arrow Lake ambitions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. If accurate, that would mark a sizable jump over the current top Arrow Lake-S and even Raptor Lake-S parts, both capped at 24 cores. While the document doesn't break down the core types, earlier Nova Lake mobile leaks pointed to a potential eight P-core, 16 E-core, and four low-power LP-E core configuration, which could carry over to desktop. While Arrow Lake's Core Ultra 9 285K sticks to the familiar eight P-core, 16 E-core layout, Nova Lake could tack on an additional cluster of efficiency-oriented silicon. This suggests that Intel is moving faster than expected to bulk up its desktop core counts, possibly to counter AMD's Zen 5-based Ryzen 8000 line-up. Arrow Lake has been a solid step forward with Lion Cove and Skymont cores, but on paper, its flagship doesn't dramatically outpace Raptor Lake in raw core/thread counts. Nova Lake, with Coyote Cove and Arctic Wolf cores built on Intel 18A and TSMC's 2nm process, looks like a genuine leap. Arrow Lake's 285K already brings updated Lion Cove P-cores and Skymont E-cores, but its overall positioning feels incremental. Nova Lake's additional cores, rumored cache upgrades, and next-gen node manufacturing look designed to reclaim ground in multi-threaded workloads, where AMD has pulled ahead. There are caveats: A 28-core desktop SKU will likely still only carry 8 P-cores, meaning single-threaded gains may come mostly from architectural uplift. And while the leaked TDP tops out around 150 W, Intel's history suggests final turbo power could creep far higher. Still, if this manifest holds up, Intel's 2026 line-up could be a very different beast from what we've seen in recent years, with Nova Lake representing a true generational leap.

Are you looking for a GPU deal for a new or existing build and want to have the latest generation of graphics cards in your system? Well, today we have one of the best bang-for-buck performers from Nvidia's AIB partner MSI. Hitting an all-time low price on Newegg, MSI's Shadow 2X OC Plus RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is now only $409.99 when you make use of the $20 rebate that Newegg is offering. The MSI Shadow 2X OC Plus RTX 5060 Ti 16GB features 4608 CUDA cores for graphics processing, a boost clock of 2602MHz, and, when using the MSI Center software, can utilize the "Extreme Performance" setting to reach a maximum clock speed of up to 2617MHz. The super-fast GDDR7 VRAM features memory speeds of 28 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, and with 16GB available, there is ample memory for compiling shaders and textures to achieve optimal game performance.

But let's look back a bit:In the early 1990s, Linus Torvalds started writing an OS kernel for 386-class PCs. The code didn't have to run as an "app" in some restricted sandbox under Microsoft's OS (not that back then, DOS or Windows were even in any way locked down the way modern operating systems are). Documentation for all the "standard" hardware like video, keyboard, hard disks, etc. was openly available, so it didn't have to rely on proprietary drivers.This is how it was at one time, and what should have remained the standard today, but instead it's turned into some utopian dream that those who grew up with "smart" devices can't even conceive as possible anymore.Google has taken what became of this code, and turned it into an "open" system that is pretty much designed to track every aspect of people's lives in order to more effectively target them with psychological manipulation, which is what advertisements really are. And you're not really getting "free stuff" in return for this invasion either, since pretty much everything you buy includes a hidden "tax" that goes to support this massive industry.

Apple too, they're the ones who normalized smartphones. There are definitely aspects of the iPhone that it is fair to criticize Apple for. I'm so excited that I might even jump back into open source development to make a new OS that isn't as bloated and slow as Android. There is a need for an OS that only gives you minimum capabilities, to run on cheaper, simpler, smaller devices. I would love to help make that a reality. My guess is, though, that the big limitation is getting something legally allowed to connect to the mobile networks; that's where they can make their money, and force people out of the market. They're being sold and enough people are buying them to keep these companies alive. Fairphone said they're not delivering to USA because they don't have the manpower, not because there's no demand. Every release again you see people asking in the comments when/if it'll finally be available to themThat's not to say it's a big market where you get big economy of scale benefits.

Only because those alternative mobile OSes were, frankly, crappy in comparison to iOS and Android.I don't recall Google or Apple doing anything particularly anticompetitive to cause any of those OSes to fail to keep up in the market, aside from just plain "being the 800lb gorillas in the room".

For a while, I had stopped flashing custom ROMs because the default Android experience was good enough for me, but it looks like this is now necessary again. Also we are obviously in dire need of legislation preventing such behavior. People use app stores because they are used for artificially worsened web pages. They are used to find apps with similar properties from app store.And Google search is artificially so bad that they won't even try it to find some  apps. And most won't use other search engines. And Google search is artificially so bad that they won't even try it to find some  apps. And most won't use other search engines. So really, people need to start rejecting poor quality or poorly performing web apps. The collective bar for “good enough” is far too low, and so cheapskates will continue to churn out garbage. Re SyncThing: there's the File System Access API. Also from a locally cached offline copy, of course. It'll need as much effort or maybe even more to port it to the web as it has taken to develop the Android app, but it's almost definitely possible, at least on Chrome.As part of Google's attempt to break free from the iOS app store, they accidentally invented an alternative to their own draconic measures.

I think Google already knows that developer attestations will be on that list and want to appear proactive instead of reactive.The point still stands - the DMA does not exist in a vacuum. Other EU laws affect how you interpret it, and you should assume that the EU will pass more laws in the future that also affect how you interpret it.

There may be concerns about the types of decisions that may arise from this, not merely from recognized malware. Certain governments may ask Google to regulate apps allowed on such devices via this approach.- Once this globally rolls out in 2027 it will mean the audience for apps from devs who don't agree to this will shrink dramatically. Only those presumably with AOSP based custom ROMs will be able to use those apps which may have a knock-on effect for dev motivation. - Unwillingness to give Google PII or just not tie a particular pseudonymous identity to that PII on Google.- It puts absolute control in Google's hands for whether any app is allowed to run on most devices.

Surely there's enough hardware expertise out there now for a startup to make a mass-market phone that runs Linux. What would a company fill in for these details for the developer deployment account they are using to deploy the apps made by their software team?Is the account that publishes Spotify or Facebook app etc really going to be personal information for some person? Is the account that publishes Spotify or Facebook app etc really going to be personal information for some person? If anything this just gives me more reasons to seriously look at linux phone options. It is people's link to financial, health, educational, and government services. Just as we lock down corporate PCs to avoid leaking corporate information, phones should be locked down to avoid leaking personal information. I would also be surprised if there weren't cell phone system-based fallbacks for emergency services. There are plenty of situations where GPS doesn't work.

You can sideload apps on non-google-certified android builds/installs just fine right? If you're going to publish an app that literally be installed on billions of devices, is this not a sensible measure? Why isn't Windows and Linux distros enforcing this as well is my question!Do you guys understand that people's lives are being ruined by malware? and the most popular way of deploying malware on the most popular platform (android) is sideloading apps!This is a similar situation as "Freedom of speech isn't freedom of reach". You can publish any android app you want, that doesn't give you the right to anonymously deploy those apps on everyone's personal tracking devices (phones).I get a petition to allow alternative attestation and verification authorities. I can't image the EU being ok with a US company collecting the IDs of all its developers.For about a decade now, on Windows, you are required to have an ID-verified code signing certificate so sign drivers for example. And that has dramatically reduced rootkit abuse on the platform. But this is a very sensible measure, one that will improve security in measurable and significant ways to millions of regular people.

To users what matters is impact not category. A persons entire life can be destroyed because of one side-loaded app, much less so with a windows rootkit (because you don't have phone number/2fa app,etc.. on your windows box).Users are free to buy devices that let them install any app. Google is responsible for the majority of users who don't care about installing apps from anonymous randos, but care much much more about their livelihoods and well being suffering at the hands of criminals!> Those targets are rapidly disappearing.

Maybe that's the disconnect here, because i don't think you/others lack empathy for regular people being victimized. You're incorrect about that figure, the people being actually impacted (not merely compromised but harmed, as in financial loss, job loss, harassment, or worse) is many times more than people who want to sideload apps.Educating people doesn't work. in the moment, you're sure it's legitimate, so you won't look for obvious signs of phishiness.They use a lure to establish trust in the context, so you guards are down. You know what made a difference with phishing? Trust senders, DKIM/SPF validation, url-rewriting with sandbox detonation and global-scale reputation analysis/response (it means as soon as you hit one person, your domain/infra gets burned globally) ,etc..It really frustrates me to no end, because it is the exact audience on HN that innovate and create software/apps but the level of ignorance on this subject is atrocious. in the moment, you're sure it's legitimate, so you won't look for obvious signs of phishiness.They use a lure to establish trust in the context, so you guards are down.

"There's many ways to combat crime" - name one effective way to combat sideloading of apps, that is anywhere as effective as id verification of devs? The line physically goes to a subscriber (yes, also with CGNAT: ISPs are required to keep logs for a reason). The police can do that in any country. Google isn't an elected government that I want to sit on that seat of powerBesides, criminals by definition don't care about laws. Photoediting an ID is not particularly hard, but quite illegal. Besides, criminals by definition don't care about laws. Photoediting an ID is not particularly hard, but quite illegal. The moment they use IPs to find devs and prosecute them , every malware dev will just use a vpn or Tor. or just use a compromised device to route their connection. This is a long running cat and mouse game.Criminals care about laws if breaking the law is difficult, because laws have consequences. ID verification isn't as simple as "hey, it's an ID, all is good", and now you're on the hook for the much more serious crime of faking IDs and defrauding. ID verification isn't as simple as "hey, it's an ID, all is good", and now you're on the hook for the much more serious crime of faking IDs and defrauding. It's a nightmare scenario, our lives locked in to total corporate control. What do we get in return for that? What you're suggesting is trading open platforms and open source and fortifying current marketplace monopolies for a marginal decrease in scams. And if we're at it, we should maybe also put camera's and microphones in everybody's houses so we can see what everyone's doing all the time, because many children are being hurt in houses you know.But don't worry, if you don't want all of this you can just get this degoogled phone just around the corner and it works perfect you know, because everybody is using them and there's a big market for it and it's very easy to use.Or maybe not But don't worry, if you don't want all of this you can just get this degoogled phone just around the corner and it works perfect you know, because everybody is using them and there's a big market for it and it's very easy to use.Or maybe not To a small group of people you know, nobody cares.
