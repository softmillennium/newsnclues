                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is switching to a reusable cup program facilitated by Bold Reuse, a Portland-based startup, in the venue's ongoing bid to eliminate waste at sports and entertainment events. Fans will receive their drinks in durable cups that can be returned to collection bins throughout the stadium. The cups are collected, professionally sanitized and returned by Bold Reuse. Climate Pledge Arena has received accolades for its environmental efforts, and in 2023 became the first sports stadium in the world to receive Zero Carbon certification from a nonprofit promoting sustainable buildings. The arena is named after The Climate Pledge, an initiative founded by Amazon and Global Optimism asking global corporations to become net zero carbon by 2040. Bold Reuse initially launched as GO Box in 2011, providing reusable takeout containers. Bold Reuse launched a pilot program with material science company Avery Dennison in June in which RFID tags are being implemented to track the entire lifecycle of reusable cups — from distribution and return to wash cycles and end-of-life. Earlier this month, Bold Reuse announced a new partnership with the Kansas City Chiefs — the first NFL team to offer reusable cups stadium-wide for every event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report from local venture capital firm Madrona features three Seattle-based startups among the top 40 private artificial intelligence companies globally. These investors then voted on a short list of finalists, and the results were combined with PitchBook's “Venture Exit Predictor Tool” to produce the final ranking. The ranking, co-authored by Madrona, features a significant turnover rate with 27 new companies on the list, reflecting a rapid pace of innovation. The IA40 list highlights a small-but-impactful group of Seattle companies alongside a much larger representation from the Bay Area, which includes major players like OpenAI and Anthropic. GeekWire recently reported on the lack of superstar AI startups in the Seattle region, despite its brand as a global AI hub. Key takeaways from the IA40 report include the rise of next-generation user interfaces that are conversational and “agentic” — systems that can reason and execute autonomously. The report also highlights a multi-billion dollar opportunity in new AI tools for software development, along with the success of “service-as-software” business models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The investment was led by existing backers Meritech Capital Partners and Atomico, according to a statement released Thursday. The massive capital infusion positions it to take on its largest rival, Figma, which also uses a community-based model to create websites and design. It went public in 2023 and debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this summer and now holds a lofty market cap of $37.68 billion. As the no-code and AI-driven design sector heats up, Framer's rapid valuation jump underscores investor enthusiasm for platforms that simplify web development using generative AI, making it a key player to watch as the industry continues to evolve. The company aims to attract larger enterprise clients as it scales. “Close to half of the latest Y Combinator batch launched with Framer, alongside global brands like Perplexity, Scale AI, Huel, Miro, Zapier, and Mixpanel,” Framer said in a statement. Venture capitalists see significant potential in AI-powered tools that enable rapid website creation and design, especially following the September 2023 IPO of Figma, which soared 250% on debut and has become a benchmark for the sector. It has since seen a rollercoaster ride for its share price. “Fast-growing software IPOs have been extremely rare during the past three years, so deals like this tend to get a lot of attention,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs, said after Figma's IPO. “Because of this three-year bottleneck, tech IPO investors have been starved for new deals.” Venture capital firms invested approximately $162.8 billion across various deals in the first six months of 2025, according to data from PitchBook. Notably, about 30% of this funding was allocated to late-stage startups, reflecting a continued appetite among investors for established companies preparing for or already pursuing IPOs and acquisitions. Founded in 2014 in Amsterdam by by Koen Bok and Jorn van Dijk who had previously sold their company, Sofa, to Facebook, Framer initially focused on prototyping tools for website design. Over time, it expanded into web publishing and “no-code” development. The funding underscores a broader trend among technology investors betting heavily on startups that offer no-code or “vibe coding” features, which rely on generative AI models from providers like OpenAI. “We empower designers to publish websites without needing costly developers,” CEO and co-founder Koen Bok said in the statement today. Other startups in the space, such as Anysphere, which produces the AI coding assistant Cursor, are reaching hefty valuations on relatively modest revenue. Framer, on the other hand, generated around $50 million in annual recurring revenue this year and projects to double that figure in 2026, driven by growing demand for AI-enhanced design tools.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lucasfilm just announced the cast of Star Wars: Starfighter, directed by Shawn Levy, which is now in production. Ryan Gosling stars, and he'll be joined by Flynn Gray, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, and Amy Adams. “I feel a profound sense of excitement and honor as we begin production on Star Wars: Starfighter,” Levy said on the official Star Wars website. “From the day Kathy Kennedy called me up, inviting me to develop an original adventure in this incredible Star Wars galaxy, this experience has been a dream come true, creatively and personally. To join this storytelling galaxy with such brilliant collaborators onscreen and off, is the thrill of a lifetime.” Above, you get our first glimpse of the film, featuring Gosling and Gray. In terms of the cast, Smith and Goth had been rumored, but several of the other names are brand new, and, among those, a few stand out. Aaron Pierre, who'll next be seen in the DC series Lanterns, is one. The talented Rebel Ridge actor is now also a DC and Star Wars guy. There's no word on who each is playing, but they are intriguing additions to the Star Wars universe. With Starfighter now in production, it's locking in on its release date of May 28, 2027, which is almost exactly 50 years after the release of the first Star Wars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some CPUs will now no longer have a bundled cooler When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Spotted by @momomo_us, AMD has updated the OPN codes for some of its boxed Ryzen CPUs, with a new message highlighting the end-of-life status for Wraith Prism and Wraith Spire. Starting August, 2025, the cooler has been completely retired and will no longer come with processors such as the Ryzen 9 7900. AMD already moved away from including boxed coolers entirely with the Ryzen 9000 series, arguing that higher-end CPUs are paired with aftermarket solutions anyways. The only exception to this is the Ryzen 5 9600, which fittingly ships with a Wraith Stealth — so that's safe. Of the Ryzen 9000 series, only the Ryzen 5 9600 gets a Wraith Stealth cooler, but the Ryzen 7000 series fairs better with a handful of CPUs coming with in-box cooling. The Wraith Prism itself is an upgraded version of the original Wraith Max coolers that AMD shipped with its FX CPUs. While these coolers are technically nothing special, they still lowered the barrier to entry to a new platform. People previously using Intel processors, or building their first-ever PCs wouldn't have to worry about yet another component, avoiding the compatibility checks often needed before buying and pairing PC parts with each other. Nowadays, both AMD and Intel seem to have largely moved away from this model, forcing people to exclusively rely on a separate purchase.

Your computer desires one, your phone another, and all of a sudden your bag is so heavy it's like carrying a brick with frustratingly knotted cables and big blocks. That's why taking along one charger to do it all is such a relief. That's a massive saving for something that will be capable of replacing several of your current chargers simultaneously. The best part about this charger is rather simple: instead of needing to carry multiple adapters, you simply need to carry this small block. For everyday phones like an iPhone, Galaxy, or Pixel, fast charging is expected to get you out of the worry mode about running out of battery sooner. We also love this model because of the port array: With three USB-C ports and one USB-A, you can charge four devices at once without slowing them down. So, imagine charging your laptop, phone, tablet and wireless earbuds all at once and watching them all hike back to 100%. It's handy for anyone who has to work with multiple devices every day. It protects the charger from overheating, saves energy wasted, and prevents your devices from exposure to hazardous fluctuations. Measuring just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches and with a foldable plug, it's easy to throw in a backpack or even a jacket pocket without worrying about carrying yet another bulky gadget. If you've ever struggled to fit multiple chargers into a power strip or crammed ones with awkward shapes into a small carry-on, you'll appreciate how neatly this block fits without hogging space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Credit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers' personal information. In a filing with Maine's attorney general's office on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers' personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations. In a separate data breach disclosure filed later on Thursday with Texas' attorney general's office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers' names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. When reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company's data breach, or say what types of customers' personally identifiable information were taken. It's the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting the insurance, retail, and transportation and airline industries. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters. You can also contact him by email, or to verify outreach, at zack.whittaker@techcrunch.com.

Nvidia has revealed a surprising partnership with an agricultural robotics company whose flagship product deals out instant laser death to fields full of weeds. The awe-inspiring Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2 packs in 24 high power lasers and 24 Nvidia GPUs to facilitate its claimed “10,000 weeds per minute” zapping performance. Though the claimed performance is amazing, we aren't talking about a compact, home garden-style device here. The flagship LaserWeeder G2 600 is a hulking tractor-pulled device spanning 20 feet. We note there are G2 models smaller than this flagship, but even the smallest G2 200 model is 110 x 85 x 127-inches and requires at least a 110hp tractor with 6,500 lbs lift capacity. The cut down size of the G2 200 reduces performance to 2,500 weeds per minute, which remains impressively rapid and equivalent to nearly 42 weeds per second. It highlights the trend of weeds becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides. It touts the sub-millimeter precision and identification accuracy of the Nvidia-accelerated ‘Large Plant Model' weed identification system, which ensures your crops don't fall to friendly fire. Interestingly, Carbon Robotics also aims to address the “global shortage of tractor drivers.” It is an autonomous retrofit for existing tractors, says the Nvidia blog. For extra safety, these autonomous tractors are said to be monitored via a remote operations center. Such robotic machinery surely comes with a lofty price tag. Also, those with experience of using devices which burn weeds will be aware that if a root survives, it sometimes doesn't take very long for it to spring right back up. Lastly, there is some added hazard here, due to the laser technology inadvertently injuring someone's eyes or skin. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thank you for calling Lockheed Martin, please hold When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An accident report has revealed that a U.S. Air Force pilot spent 50 minutes on a conference call with Lockheed Martin engineers ahead of his plane plummeting to the ground and exploding in a fireball. Thankfully, the unnamed pilot ejected safely with just minor injuries, reports CNN, but the $200 million F-35 fighter jet was destroyed. This incident took place on January 28, near Eielson Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. Investigations point towards the presence of water in hydraulic lines as the root cause of this military jet crash. The landing gear wouldn't retract correctly, so he sought to lower it again, but it then became locked at an angle, neither retracted nor correctly lowered… Running through operational check lists didn't remedy the situation. He managed to get a group of five Lockheed Martin engineers (the F-35's makers) to participate in a conference call. According to CNN's viewing of the incident report, five engineers were on the call: “a senior software engineer, a flight safety engineer, and three specialists in landing gear systems.” However, the nose wheel still couldn't be straightened. Things actually got worse after the two dummy landing attempts. Now, flying the plane with multiple system errors was bad enough, but the plane then became “uncontrollable” as it started to operate in “automated ground-operation mode.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. There should have been no water in these lines due to the extremely low temperatures aircraft endure at altitudes. Another F-35 at the same base was flown 9-days later, and suffered a similar hydraulic icing issue – but it was able to land safely. This might seem harsh on the pilot and engineers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's largest living fish has plenty to fear from people. New research shows that a large proportion of whale sharks at a popular and protected tourism region bear scars caused by human activity. A large group of marine scientists examined more than a decade's worth of whale shark sightings in the Bird's Head Seascape off Indonesia. Among other things, they found that over half of the sharks had injuries attributable to humans. Many of these injuries were preventable, the researchers say, and simple measures can be taken to ensure the safety of these gentle giants moving forward. “[The] high percentage of injured whale sharks shows that even in protected zones, the whale shark interactions with fishing gear and tourism still pose risks to them,” study author Edy Setyawan, lead conservation scientist at the Elasmobranch Institute Indonesia, told Gizmodo. Befitting its nickname, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is certainly hefty. Despite their size, though, they're no ferocious sea monster. These slow-moving fish are filter feeders that suck up their meals from the surrounding water. Whale sharks can be found in warm and tropical waters all over the world, but their numbers have dwindled dramatically in recent decades, and they're classified as an endangered species. They face several human-made threats, including hunting, climate change, and bycatching (being unintentionally caught by fishing boats). And even with ongoing conservation efforts, their recovery has been slow, partly because it can take up to 30 years for the sharks to reach sexual maturity. According to Edy Setyawan, previous studies looking at the population health of these sharks have been limited to short-term surveys or snapshots of a single location. Roughly 200 of these sharks sported visible injuries, they found. On the positive side, severe injuries, including amputation, caused by humans were relatively rare (17.7%). The most common human-associated injuries were caused by sharks colliding into boats and bagans—floating platforms adorned with nets and lights used for fishing. Fishing and marine tourism are important parts of the local economy, including whale shark sighting tours. And while the increasing popularity of these tours could lead to more injured sharks, the researchers argue this doesn't have to be inevitable. They lay out simple steps that can greatly cut down on whale shark injuries, such as stricter regulations that would compel bagan fishers and owners to remove the sharp edges from their platforms. Tourism-related measures, like limiting boat traffic, enforcing slow-speed zones, and promoting responsible diving and snorkeling practices, would further reduce harm, Setyawan said. They next plan to track the annual population trends of whale sharks living in the seascape via satellite tags, which should also help them answer important questions like whether these populations migrate elsewhere.

The remarkably stiff and durable teeth of a common mollusk species could offer invaluable insights for future technological advances, scientists say. A follow-up investigation strongly suggests these jellies are very much alive and swimming. Researchers have discovered a highly specialized community of sea creatures living 6 miles beneath the ocean surface—deeper than any found before. From Parisian bridges to Rome's Trevi Fountain, tourists love leaving behind mementos—but in Northern Ireland, they're eroding a 60-million-year-old landmark.
