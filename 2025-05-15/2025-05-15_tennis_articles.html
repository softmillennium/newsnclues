Sinner is now through to the semifinals of his home Masters 1000 event in Rome for the first time.© AFP or licensors Sinner had never lost a set to Ruud in their three previous meetings, but this was the first time they were playing on clay, and Ruud was at the top of his game, winning his last nine matches in a row to win Madrid—his biggest title—and reach the quarterfinals in Rome.But none of that mattered as an on-fire Sinner won the first eight games in a row for a 6-0, 2-0 lead before Ruud finally held to get on the board, 2-1, after which the Italian won another four games in a row to completely run away with it after just 63 minutes.Sinner finished the match with more than twice as many winners as unforced errors, 22 to 10, with the most damage coming from his forehand wing (13 winners to 6 unforced errors).He won 55 points in the match to Ruud's 22. "I was feeling great on court today, I think we all saw that," Sinner said in his on-court interview after the match. "My goal in this tournament was trying to understand where my level is, and it's raised day by day, so I'm very happy about that. It doesn't really matter the result, but what I felt today was very, very positive signs for me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It may just have been the most complete, brutal, frightening and clinical performance ever seen at the Rome Masters and possibly even in all of tennis. Experienced Sky Sports Tennis commentator described Sinner's opening few games in his 6-0, 6-1 demolition of Casper Ruud as ‘the best start to a match I've ever seen by any player” and it was hard to disagree with that assessment. Sinner's  demolition of world No 7 Ruud was so complete that when the battered victim of the Italian finally won a game in the second set, he raised his arms as if he were an amateur trying to win a point or two against a professional. Yet this is a player who won his first ATP 1000 title in Madrid earlier this month and has been a finalist at the French Open on two occasions. Jannik Sinner opens up about friendship with Jack Draper – ‘We are humble' Dan Evans lambasts Jannik Sinner's Rome return: ‘Pretty convenient' From the moment these two started trading blows in an Italian Open quarter-final that will have sent shockwaves through the men's locker room, it was clear that Sinner was on a different level. This looks like a player being propelled by something special and it may be that the extra ingredient driving him to what is undoubtedly the best performance in a single match of this tennis season so far is frustration. Sinner has now extended his winning record against Ruud to 4-0 and he explained that his experience of beating the Norwegian in the past game gave him inspiration to reach new heights in this meeting. These conditions, playing at night against Casper, are a bit better in my point of view because he can't make the ball bounce as much. The match can change very quickly… if I didn't serve well at 2-1, we're even again. This was as complete a performance as Sinner has ever delivered on a clay court against one of the grittiest players currently competing on this surface. It banished any doubts about Sinner's form after his lay off and if he continues to play at this level, the prospect of the Italian hero winning all four Grand Slam titles will begin to loom large.

However, he has recently made a statement to the contrary. ‘We played at the French Open before, so it'll be good to get out there and play with another fellow Aussie and have a bit of fun.' Nick Kyrgios then continued: 'I'm excited to get out there and play. We put a lot of work in – myself, Will [Maher], and the team. Me and James [Frawley] have been on the court pretty much every single day. I'm hitting the ball well, it's just a matter of playing matches. Partnering with Jordan Thompson will see him keep good company, as his compatriot is a finalist at Wimbledon and a winner of the US Open in doubles format. We have not seen much of Kyrgios this year, in what many hoped would be his first full year back on tour. However, it was always going to be unlikely that the 30-year-old flew back into action, especially given all the physical turmoil his body has suffered in recent years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 French Open is just a few weeks away, as players finish up their preparations ahead of the year's second Grand Slam. Italy's Lorenzo Musetti has been a revelation on clay in 2025, remarkably reaching the semi-finals of all three Masters 1000 events on the surface, and will likely be dangerous when he takes to the court in Paris. Musetti's countryman has only played three matches on clay since returning from his suspension, but world number one Jannik Sinner will still head to the French Open as one of the favorites. It's another name, however, that Roger Federer's former coach is picking to win the title, as he continues to rack up wins on the red stuff. “Casper Ruud has been playing with so much confidence these days,” he said. “It's great to hear him talk about his health and well-being, he talked very candidly about having to get things better in that hamster wheel, as he talked about, which is life on tour. Ruud was impressively solid during his fourth-round Italian Open win over Jaume Munar, advancing to the quarterfinals in straight sets. With that in mind, Annacone confidently made his pick for the French Open. Ruud has enjoyed real success at Roland Garros over the past three years, reaching two finals and one semi-final. No player has won more matches at the French Open since 2022 than Ruud, who has picked up 16 victories at the event. He'll travel to Paris as one of the pre-tournament favorites, but will first want to finish up his clay Masters 1000 campaign with a title in Rome. Earlier this month, Ruud beat Jack Draper to win his maiden Masters 1000 title at the Madrid Open. Backing that run up, Ruud has won his opening three matches at the Italian Open to extend his ATP Tour winning streak to nine. Playing some of the best tennis of his career, Ruud would likely have been considered the favorite for his quarterfinal match against any other opponent. Unfortunately for the Norwegian, he'll take on Sinner in the last eight, a man who has won his previous 24 matches, a run that extends back to last October. Sinner's latest win over Francisco Cerundolo was his most impressive since returning from suspension, taking down the Argentine in straight sets, 7-6, 6-3. The Italian has also beaten Ruud in each of their three previous meetings, a statistic he could well look to for confidence ahead of their quarterfinal match.</p>

The 22-year-old Chinese sensation produced one of the best performances of her season thus far to oust Sabalenka 6-4 6-3. During the loss, Sabalenka lost her cool at a rogue heckler on Centre Court.

Unfortunately, it was an off-colour evening for the Belarusian, who looked fatigued and out of ideas to counter Zheng's strong groundstrokes. This was when a moment of frustration resulted in a code violation for the defending US Open champion. Just as Qinwen was about to serve at 30-0, someone from the crowd yelled, “Come on Aryna – play tennis!” Sabalenka was having none of it, and made sure to dish out a fitting reply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis star Harmony Tan has expressed her disappointment at being excluded from the 2025 French Open. And the WTA contender feels especially slighted, given that numerous players ranked lower than her have been issued invites. A little more than three years have passed since Tan's sensational victory over Serena Williams during the first round of Wimbledon 2022. The Parisian claimed victory in a gripping 7-5, 1-6, 7-6(7) result, which preceded Williams' retirement from tennis just a few months later. Tan, 27, advanced to best Sara Sorribes Torbo and local favorite Katie Boulter in the following two rounds of that tournament. However, her remarkable Wimbledon run then came unstuck against American Amanda Anisimova. Despite not securing a Grand Slam win since that event, world No. And the omission is that much more hurtful given it's her home Grand Slam. "No Roland Garros for me this year," she posted on Instagram (via the Daily Express). Tan has participated in the French Open nine times to date. Out of those attempts, she has only made it past the first round on one occasion, with five of her attempts ending in qualifying losses. Of those nine wildcards invited to the women's qualifying draw, four are aged between 15 and 16 years old. Those girls are Ksenia Efremova (world No. 976), Cindy Langlais (unranked), and Daphnée Mpetshi-Perricard (No. Given that each sits considerably below Tan in the WTA pecking order, one can understand her frustration. Not to mention her suspicion that certain talents of a certain age demographic may have received preferential treatment. The 13-year WTA tour player was visibly upset about being excluded from Roland Garros this time around. Yet she concluded her message on an optimistic note, expressing her determination to continue competing. "Now I'm going to move on, keep smiling as usual and get back on the court with the same strength," she declared. Tan's disappointment is likely intensified after she recently clinched her 11th ITF title at the W50 Yecla in Spain. This victory was her first in more than a year, but the elation was short-lived due to the snub by event organizers in her own country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis star Harmony Tan has described her disappointment after not receiving an invite to the 2025 French Open. Tan's most famous moment as a tennis player to date came at Wimbledon 2022 when she beat Serena Williams in a three-set epic. Paris-born Tan triumphed 7-5, 1-6, 7-6(7) in their first-round encounter, and Serena retired a few months later. She went on to defeat Sara Sorribes Torbo in the second round before taking out home favourite Katie Boulter in the third. However, her Wimbledon dream, and by far her best performance at a major tournament, then came to an end against Amanda Anisimova.

A post shared by Harmony Tan (@tanharmony) This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Tan has competed in the French Open on nine occasions to date. Of those, she has progressed beyond the first round just once, with five of her appearances ending in qualifying defeats. The 13-year WTA veteran was clearly devastated to be left out of the running at Roland Garros altogether. However, she ended her post on a more positive note and said she was unwilling to give up the fight in her sport. "Now I'm going to move on, keep smiling as usual and get back on the court with the same strength," she added. Tan's rejection will feel that much more hurtful after she recently won her 11th ITF title at the W50 Yecla in Spain. It marked her first title in a little more than one year, but her joy has proved short-lived after being rebuffed by organisers in her home nation.

The 30-year-old has had a torrid time with foot, knee and wrist injuries following his surprise run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and has played only four singles matches this year, winning once at the Miami Open in March.

Kyrgios was not expected to compete on Parisian clay having last played at Roland Garros in a second-round loss eight years ago but said he had changed his mind with Thompson's regular doubles partner Max Purcell serving a doping ban.

"The French Open was never really on the cards," Kyrgios told The Canberra Times. "But after the stuff with Max Purcell, Jordan was looking for a partner and he asked me if I wanted to play.

"We've played at the French Open before, so it'll be good to get out there and play with another fellow Aussie and have a bit of fun."

While a Grand Slam singles title has eluded him, Kyrgios did capture the 2022 doubles crown at the Australian Open partnering countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis.

He's a major draw on and off the court at Grand Slams with his natural talent and unapologetic personality, which has also landed him in controversies in the past.

Despite question marks about his long-term future in the game, Kyrgios is expected to resume his singles career during the grasscourt swing next month ahead of Wimbledon.

The French Open begins on May 25.</p>

TV presenter Clare Balding has said she is “delighted” to announce her debut novel Pastures New.

The 54-year-old's book will tell the story of Alex, a journalist who has “perfected the art of dodging responsibility” until an unexpected letter turns her life upside down, when it is published by HarperCollins on September 12.

Speaking about the book, Balding said: “It has taken a few years and a lot of angst to produce Pastures New, my first novel, but I'm so delighted that HarperCollins will be publishing it this autumn.

“In writing it, I've tried to honestly represent the complicated relationship between family members, the way love can pop up in the most surprising places, the beauty of our landscape and the kindness of small communities.

“This is Alex's story – one of finding meaning in life and finding a group of people that help her feel she belongs.”

The book will see Alex inherit a crumbling sheep farm in Wales as she sets out to uncover the truth behind her mysterious inheritance.

Balding, who has presented coverage of the Olympic Games and Wimbledon tennis tournament for the BBC, published her autobiography, My Animals And Other Family, in September 2012, while a second non-fiction book, Walking Home: My Family And Other Ramblings, was published in September 2014.

Lynne Drew, general fiction publisher at HarperCollins, said: “I've been a fan of Clare's voice ever since reading her funny, honest and brilliant memoir, and the minute we started working together on Pastures New I rejoiced that she had brought that same astute and entertaining storytelling to her fiction debut.

“Her characters shine off the page, and this warm and witty read full of honesty and heart will utterly delight her many fans.”

Balding herself grew up in the Hampshire countryside as the daughter of racehorse trainer Peter Hastings-Bass, and has gone on to present the BBC's Sports Personality Of The Year and Channel 4's coverage of the Crufts dog show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper has become Britain's leading tennis talent and is now hunting for Grand Slam glory ahead of the upcoming French Open. His career has been on an upward trajectory ever since. Draper burst onto the wider scene last year when he secured his first ATP Tour title at the Stuttgart Open, triumphing over Matteo Berrettini in a gruelling final. This victory in Germany was followed by a significant win over Alcaraz at the Queen's Club Championships, highlighting his skill on grass courts. He clinched his first Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells, defeating Holger Rune in the final, which propelled him to a career-high ATP ranking of No.5. Express Sport takes a look into Draper's personal life... To date, Draper has amassed over £5m in career prize money. This momentum continued into 2025 with a landmark victory at the Indian Wells Masters. Away from the court, Draper has become a desirable figure for leading brands. These commercial partnerships have further bolstered his financial status and underscore his increasing appeal as one of Britain's most marketable young athletes. With his potent left-handed game, mental fortitude, and ongoing progress, Draper has emerged as a prominent figure in British tennis. Despite his rising fame, Draper has expressed a preference for authentic relationships over dating apps. For me, what matters most is someone with ambition, their own purpose in life, who is kind, non-judgmental, and upholds strong values." Persistent rumours have swirled around Draper's love life, including alleged romantic ties to Emma Raducanu. Yet, the duo have remained steadfast in affirming a platonic friendship. Gossip has recently emerged about Draper's closeness with American influencer KT Lordahl, who was spotted attending several games at the 2024 US Open. Despite having over a million followers on Instagram, the links to Draper are unconfirmed as he opts for discretion concerning his private affairs. In another significant step in his personal life, Draper has opted to move house, sharing quarters with his long-time mate and fellow tennis professional Paul Jubb. Draper and Jubb are housemates in south west London. Draper, who has recently flown the nest from his Surrey family home, is now living with Jubb, his old pal from their junior tennis days. This new living arrangement heralds an exciting new phase for Draper as he gets to grips with the challenges of owning a house. In a candid chat, he joked: "I'm enjoying being able to wash my own clothes. There's been the odd shrinking disaster, but we're back on track." Jubb, 25, hailing from Kingston upon Hull, boasts an impressive success rate in ATP Challenger and ITF Futures/World Tennis Tour finals: a formidable nine wins to just two defeats. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Alongside multiple ITF accolades and an ATP Challenger victory, he has also taken top players to the brink at Grand Slam events, signalling his considerable promise on the pro tour. As the offspring of Roger Draper, Jack comes from a sporting pedigree; his father made notable contributions as chief executive of Sport England from 2003 to 2006, stewarding the Lawn Tennis Association between 2006 and 2013, and later taking the reins at professional rugby league club Warrington Wolves from 2015 to 2017. The 55 year old played a pivotal role in boosting British Tennis memberships by an astonishing 500 per cent, and was instrumental in launching mini tennis programmes to encourage more people to take up the sport. Since 2018, Draper Sr has held the position of global business advisor for Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young tennis sensation Emma Raducanu has set the record straight on her coaching situation ahead of Wimbledon, leaving fans and critics alike buzzing with anticipation.

The young tennis prodigy emphasized the importance of feeling comfortable with her support team, a criterion that Petchey easily meets due to their pre-existing relationship. Raducanu's choice to stick with Petchey for the grass-court season has put an end to speculations about potential coaching changes, reaffirming her trust in the 54-year-old coach. With Raducanu fully embracing Petchey's coaching style and committing to their partnership, all eyes are now on the dynamic duo as they gear up for a promising run at Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was no praise for Lorenzo Musetti from Alexander Zverev after their Italian Open quarter-final with the latter quite uncomplimentary about his rival's game while the tournament balls also came under fire from the German. Musetti won his third match in a row against the second seed as he came back from an early break in the first set to win 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 and end Zverev's title defence in Rome. The Italian, who has reached the semi-final of all three ATP Masters 1000 clay-court events this year, now leads Zverev 3-1 in their head-to-head rivalry. When asked if Musetti changed his usual style of play during the clash at Foro Italico, Zverev was far from complimentary about his opponent. “Today was difficult for me to hit winners. Usually I should win that set and then we'll see. Generally speaking this is a subject we've had over the last three, four years now. Players are talking about it all the time,” Zverev said. “They say we play with the same ball in Monaco, Madrid, Munich. Then we come here and the ball is totally different. “Of course, for me, for my game style, today was not easy because at the end of the day I'm still somebody that tries to play aggressive. I'm still somebody that tries to serve very fast.

"Greatness does not make excuses they excuse opponents." "I'm really shocked, honestly, to see some of these names on here." Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas also feature on the elite list. Alexander Zverev has claimed Novak Djokovic's tennis ability is still "above everyone else's."</p>
