            Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, is at the center of another controversy, and this time it directly involves Mexico.
    


            MrBeast, who is by far the YouTuber with the most subscribers in the world (surpassing the second-place user by almost 100 million), published a video on May 10th in which he visited some of Mexico's most important archaeological sites, including Chichén Itzá in the state of Yucatán, home to the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid, known as El Castillo, one of the seven wonders of the modern world.
    


            MrBeast also visited the archaeological sites of Calakmul in the state of Campeche and Balamcanché in Yucatán.
    


            The video, which as of Wednesday afternoon has accumulated more than 55 million views, shows MrBeast and his team in the surroundings of Kukulkan, but also inside other archaeological structures, in cenotes and temples.
    


            Some of these sites are not permanently accessible to the public, as the Mexican government has acknowledged.
    


What is the controversy surrounding MrBeast in Mexico?



            The controversy centers on the fact that the YouTuber was allowed entry to sites considered sacred to Mexico's pre-Hispanic cultures, which in many cases are restricted.
    


            In one part of the video, MrBeast himself says: “I can't believe the government is letting us do this. It's truly crazy. Not even archaeologists are allowed in here.”
    


            In response to the controversy, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) – an agency attached to the Mexican government's Ministry of Culture – declared on Monday that both the visit and the recording were carried out through “formal requests.”
    


            These requests, however, were not made by MrBeast, but rather by “the federal Ministry of Tourism and the governments of” Yucatán and Campeche, the INAH indicated. In the description of his video, MrBeast claims that the publication is a “collaboration with the Mexican Ministry of Tourism.”
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that there were permits for the “broadcast,” but asked the INAH to report “under what conditions this permit was granted.”
    


            “And if the permit was violated, then (it must be determined) what sanctions apply,” the president added.
    


            Other points have also caused controversy, such as a drone shot that appears to be inside the temple at the top of El Castillo in Chichén Itzá. Regarding this, the INAH said that this did not occur and that the shot was in fact recorded outside the structure.
    


            There are also scenes where MrBeast appears to descend to the archaeological sites by helicopter or where he holds a pre-Hispanic mask in his hands.
    


            All of this, the INAH says, is either false or was edited after the recording: “Clearly, the video involves extensive audiovisual post-production work and alludes to events that did not occur, such as the fact that the producers never descended from a helicopter, spent the night inside the archaeological site, or possessed a pre-Hispanic mask, as the one presented is clearly a contemporary reproduction. All of these are false assertions that reflect the theatricality of the YouTuber in question.”
    


How easy is it to apply for permits? Is it true that not even archaeologists can enter, as MrBeast claims?



            Exploring, filming, and broadcasting in Mexican archaeological sites is a restricted activity that few are allowed to do.
    


            The INAH stated that, while institute personnel were supervising MrBeast's activities at all times, access was granted to an area that is not permanently accessible to the general public.
    


            “The tours were conducted in publicly accessible areas without affecting visitor access. In the case of Calakmul, the substructure of the Structure II was also visited. Although it is not permanently open to the public, it does provide access by arranging a scheduled visit in advance and with justification, as is the case with tours conducted with the communities surrounding the archaeological site,” it said in its Monday statement.
    


            Sheinbaum asked the INAH to provide information on the nature of the permit for the MrBeast video. Until it is announced, its scope and the points it covers are unknown.
    


            However, by law, exploration of Mexico's archaeological sites is permitted for a very small group of institutions.
    


            In September 2024, the INAH responded to a request for citizen information requesting the “requirements and steps” necessary to enter the Kukulkan pyramid at Chichén Itzá.
    


            In this request, the director of the Chichén Itzá Archaeological Zone, José Francisco Javier Osorio León, mentions that “in accordance” with the provisions of the Federal Law on Archaeological, Artistic, and Historical Monuments and Zones, “all types of material work to discover or explore archaeological monuments will only be carried out by the National Institute of Anthropology and History or by scientific institutions or those of recognized moral standing, with prior authorization.”
    


            Likewise, Article 31 of this law states that the authorizations granted by the INAH must specify “the terms and conditions to which the work must be subject, as well as the obligations of those who carry it out.”
    


            While the details of the permits for MrBeast's video are still unknown, the INAH stated that, although the YouTuber's video offers “distorted” information, its dissemination “may motivate interest among young audiences in Mexico and around the world to learn about our ancestral cultures and visit archaeological sites.”
    


            Meanwhile, Federal Culture Secretary Claudia Curiel de Icaza spoke out against the activities carried out by MrBeast and his team at the archaeological sites.
    


            “This isn't the first time this type of incident has happened, and it's been clarified. Of course we don't agree, and of course there will be appropriate sanctions because that's not what these spaces are for,” Curiel de Icaza said Tuesday at a decorative and utilitarian art event.
    


            CNN has reached out to MrBeast for comment.

Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said President Donald Trump's tariffs are “too high” and it will raise prices on some items as Trump's global trade war increases the company's costs.
    


            “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call.
    


            “The higher tariffs will result in higher prices,” he said.
    


            Tariffs on China are raising costs on electronics and toys, McMillon said, and some food costs are going up from tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia.
    


            The price hikes will begin later this month.
    


            “I'm concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You'll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June,” Walmart finance chief John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC Thursday.
    


            Many companies have been raising prices to mitigate cost increases from the 10% universal tariffs on every product entering the United States and higher levies on Chinese goods. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement to lower those tariffs this week, but the United States still charges a 30% levy on most goods coming from China.
    


            Walmart applauded the Trump administration for bringing down its 145% tariff levels on China, but said the current levels of tariffs are “too high.”
    


            “There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we're dependent upon to import from other countries,” Rainey said on the call with analysts. “Prices of those things are likely going to go up. And that's not good for consumers.”
    


            Tariffs have already made mattresses, toys, strollers and other products more expensive.
    


            The Federal Reserve said last week that tariffs have led to a 0.3% increase in prices this year. Some companies are increasing the prices of all of their products. Others are hiking targeted items in their catalogs. Many are just eliminating the products that will cause sticker shock rather than try to sell at prices either customers won't buy or competitors will undercut, companies and analysts say.
    


            Price hikes could put Walmart in an uncomfortable position with Trump. Companies typically communicate why they need to raise prices, but Trump has made doing so a political risk.
    


            The White House took aggressive aim at Amazon last month after the company considered displaying the added cost of tariffs on some items. Trump placed a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos about the site's plans, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Amazon's plans a “hostile and political act,” while holding up a picture of Bezos in front of news cameras. Trump also threatened Mattel last week after the toymaker said it planned to raise prices because of tariffs, saying in the Oval Office that he might levy a 100% tariff on the company's toys and suggested the company should remove its CEO.
    


            Walmart's business in the United States remains strong, despite tariffs and recession fears, and the company may benefit from the trade war.
    


            “We are equipped to manage this as well or better than other retailers,” finance chief Rainey said on a call with analysts.
    


            Sales at stores open for at least a year grew 4.5% last quarter, driven by its grocery business. Walmart said it gained with higher-income households last quarter.
    


            Walmart's (WMT) stock jumped 2% during pre-market trading.
    


            Walmart's investments have helped it gain more upper-income shoppers in recent years. Historically, Walmart's primary customers have been lower and middle-income Americans.
    


            Although Walmart is a legacy brick-and-mortar retailer, it has been one of the strongest retailers in America for several years. It successfully navigated the shift to online shopping and built a competitive online business to rival Amazon's.
    


            Analysts say the company can use its scale and wide supplier base to keep prices down for customers, even as tariffs raise its costs. This could help Walmart gain market share against competitors in the coming months.
    


            Walmart is “well positioned to manage tariffs” given its deep relationships with suppliers, low prices and other strengths, Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said in a note to clients this week. The company sells fewer products from China – around 15% of its overall items – than most retailers, so tariffs hurt it less than other businesses.
    


            Around 60% of Walmart's products are groceries, the vast majority of which are sourced domestically.
    


            Tariffs have presented an enormous challenge for the retail industry.
    


            Most toys, baby gear, sneakers and many other everyday products are made in China, and companies have been rushing to shift production. Companies are raising prices on consumers, cutting products and taking other steps to minimize the impact of tariffs.
    


            Last month, the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot met with Trump to discuss the impact of tariffs.
    


            Walmart CEO McMillon, who has developed a cordial relationship with Trump through meetings at Mar-a-Lago and several mutual friends, bluntly told Trump that the trade war with China had already started to disrupt the supply chain, officials said, and would only intensify by summer, CNN previously reported.
    


            Walmart said Thursday that trade uncertainty makes it difficult to plan for the future.
    


            “The lack of clarity that exists in today's dynamic operating environment makes the very near-term exceedingly difficult to forecast.”

            President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India has offered to eliminate tariffs on the United States as part of a potential trade deal. If that comes to pass, it could represent a significant breakthrough with an increasingly important US trading partner.
    


            “India is the highest — one of the highest tariff nations in the world. It's very hard to sell into India, and they've offered us a deal where, basically, they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha, Qatar.
    


            The president said the tariff India places on US goods is “so high” that it prevents much business from taking place between the two nations. The White House has long criticized India's high tariffs, including 70% on autos, 20% on some networking equipment, 80% on rice imports. It also has chastised India for its non-tariff trade barriers, including burdensome regulatory requirements for importers.
    


            So a zero tariff — if that's in fact what India is offering — would be a welcome change for US companies looking to export their goods to the world's most populous country.
    


            “(India) have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent)… that there will be no tariff, right? Would you say that's a difference? They're the highest, and now they're saying no tariff,” Trump said.
    


            India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The US is India's largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the US importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024, according to data from the US Census Bureau.
    


            India is one of several countries or trading blocks attempting to strike deals with the US after Trump's sweeping set of tariffs has upended global trade.
    


            Trump has imposed a baseline 10% levy on all goods imported into the US, and threatened to slap so-called “reciprocal tariffs” at still higher rates on nations in early July. India faces a 26% “reciprocal tariff” on its goods arriving into the US.
    


            Last week, Trump scored the first big win in his trade war — a framework for future trade negotiations with Britain that lowers some tariffs on London and potentially opens up the UK market to more American goods.
    


            And, on Monday, the US and China to drastically roll back tariffs on each other's goods for an initial 90-day period in a surprise breakthrough between the world's two richest nations.
    


            When Trump initially announced plans in February to unveil a package of reciprocal tariffs, he singled out India several times. In particular, the administration has taken issue with India's value-added and digital services taxes as well as the growing goods trade deficit.
    


            “They charge more tariffs than any other country,” Trump said on February 13. The comments came hours before he met with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
    


            Trump also spoke about India during his Rose Garden “Liberation Day” event on April 2. “India, very, very tough,” Trump said. He also mentioned he told Modi when he met with him, “You're not treating us right.”
    


            The White House last month estimated that US exports to India would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually if India dropped its trade barriers — but it's unclear how the White House arrived at those figures.
    


            The goods trade deficit the US runs with India has nearly doubled since Trump's first term, though this occurred as both countries roughly doubled the amount of imported goods from one another.
    


            The top goods the US received from India last year included pharmaceuticals; communications equipment, such as smartphones; and apparel. The top American exports to India were various oils and gases, chemicals and aerospace products and parts.

Qatar has dismissed criticism over its proposed gift of a luxury Boeing jet to the US, insisting the move is a straightforward government transaction. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani suggested the offer was part of normal diplomatic relations and not a personal favor.

The $400 million Boeing 747-8 would be handed to the Department of Defense and replace Air Force One, while the US government awaits a delivery of new presidential jets from Boeing; the order has been set back years by the troubled plane maker.

Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have accused US President Donald Trump of using the presidency for personal gain.

“This is a very clear exchange that's happening between two governments… It has nothing to do with personnel,” Al-Thani has told CNN. “I don't see any controversy.”

Al-Thani also refuted concerns voiced by some Republicans that Qatar may seek to influence the US administration.

”Qatar has always been there for the US when it's needed,” he said, pointing to counterterrorism collaboration between the two states. Qatari help with evacuation during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, and mediated hostage releases involving US citizens in Gaza.

Trump argued that the jet is a “gift from a Nation” to the US government, not to him personally. “Only a FOOL would not accept this,” he claimed.

The White House's current fleet of Boeing 747-200 jets, which have been in service since the early 1990s, has faced ongoing technical issues. A contract for two new Air Force One planes based on the 747-8 has been plagued by delays and rising costs, pushing delivery from the original 2024 target to as late as 2027 or 2028.

Al-Thani's comments came as Trump visited Qatar on Wednesday and Thursday as part of his tour of the Middle East. During the visit, the White House announced an economic exchange agreement between the two countries worth $1.2 trillion, which included a ‘historic' Boeing deal for up to 210 jets.

The gifting of the jet was expected to be confirmed during Trump's visit to Doha. However, the President has departed, and no official announcement has been made so far.

US President Donald Trump and his team have “made the impossible possible” by bringing Moscow and Kiev to the cusp of their first direct negotiations since 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has said.

Dmitriev complemented Washington's mediation efforts ahead of much anticipated talks in Istanbul on Thursday.

The meeting is set to happen “against all odds/fierce resistance,” he said on X, adding that if “not derailed last-minute, this could be a historic step to peace.”

Dmitriev specifically named US Vice President J.D. Vance, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as major contributors to the mediation effort.

Putin suggested Thursday as the day direct engagement between Russia and Ukraine could happen in a televised address last Sunday. Moscow has indicated that negotiations could continue from where they left off in 2022, when Kiev pulled out and tried to score a victory on the battlefield with Western military assistance. The U-turn came after then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Kiev to discard a draft peace treaty, which had been pre-agreed in Istanbul.

At the moment of writing, there was no certainty that a new round of negotiations would commence as expected. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, who is currently in the country to meet Turkish President Recep Erdogan, said the Ukrainian government had yet to make a final decision on how to proceed.

Zelensky announced his intention to go to Türkiye in response to Putin's proposal, claiming that the Russian leader must reciprocate to prove his seriousness.  Zelensky and leaders of European NATO nations supporting him have threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia unless Moscow agrees to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire – an idea that Russian officials have called a ruse to give Kiev time to regroup. The initial deadline on Monday has been postponed until the end of the week, pending the outcome of talks.

While Moscow has stated that it will seek a path towards lasting peace in Istanbul, which it says will require addressing the root causes of the conflict, Kiev has been vague about its goals. Some media reports have suggested that the Ukrainian delegation will focus on the proposed ceasefire first. Previously, Kiev insisted that no direct talks could happen without a truce.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Germany could reintroduce military draft","https://www.rt.com/news/617557-germany-to-revive-draft/","Thu, 15 May 2025 02:40:00 GMT","

Germany may be forced to revive conscription if not enough people join the army voluntarily, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said.

Berlin abolished conscription in 2011 but has recently considered bringing it back, citing “threats” from Russia. According to the broadcaster N-tv, the Social Democrats and Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats agreed in their coalition deal to introduce the so-called “Swedish model,” which combines selective mandatory and voluntary service.

“We have agreed that we will initially rely on voluntarism – a service that is initially voluntary and intended to encourage young people to serve their country,” Pistorius said in an address to the Bundestag on Wednesday.

“And I say this quite deliberately and honestly: the emphasis is also on ‘initially,' in case we cannot recruit enough volunteers,” he added.

“In the medium and long term, we will strengthen personnel levels to ensure that the Bundeswehr is sustainably positioned for both homeland security and alliance defense,” the minister said.

According to Pistorius, applications for military service increased by more than 20% in the first quarter of 2025. Germany plans to raise the number of active soldiers from 180,000 to over 200,000 by 2031.

Enlistment had previously dropped by 7% in 2023, as the Bundeswehr struggled to attract younger recruits, prompting some politicians to describe the recruitment goals as unrealistic.

Although Germany has supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, including Leopard 2 tanks, Berlin denies that the country is directly involved in the conflict with Russia. Carsten Breuer, Germany's top general, told Deutsche Welle in March that the country was living in a “grey zone” between full-scale war and complete peace.

During a visit to Lithuania in January, Pistorius claimed that Russia could prepare its army for a “theoretical attack” on NATO in 2029 or 2030.

Moscow has denied any plans to attack NATO member states and accused Berlin of dangerous escalation after Merz voiced support for supplying Kiev with Taurus long-range cruise missiles. Russia argued that the shipment of such sophisticated weapons would make Germany a de facto direct participant in the conflict.

MOSCOW, May 15. /TASS/. Russia's stance at negotiations on the situation in Ukraine has been modified if compared to 2022 and adjustments are due to the situation on the ground, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told journalists on Thursday.

""Yes, there are adjustments in Russia's stance. These changes are due to developments on the ground,"" she said.

Zakharova noted that the Ukrainian territory diminishes every time the Kiev regime disrupts the negotiating process.

""If you want to grasp the connection between the negotiating process and territories, I should remind you of a statement made by the Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey Lavrov] on September 28, 2024,"" Zakharova said.

According to her, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated at that time that Ukraine would have preserved a part of Donbass if the agreements reached at the April 2022 negotiations in Istanbul were observed.

""However, Sergey Lavrov added that each time when any agreement backed by Russia is breached, Ukraine becomes smaller,"" Zakharova said. ""I think it would be wise to keep this quote in mind for everyone trying to find a connection between the negotiating process and the size of the [Ukrainian] territory.""

Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin in the early hours of May 11, Putin urged Kiev to resume direct talks suspended in 2022, without preconditions. The plan is to start dialogue in Istanbul on May 15. Putin also recalled that Russia had declared multiple ceasefires that Kiev consistently broke, including a recent truce during the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War.

Vladimir Zelensky, in turn, announced plans to travel to Istanbul on Thursday, following US President Donald Trump's call on Ukraine to immediately accept Putin's offer for talks. Prior to that, Zelensky had insisted that a 30-day ceasefire should precede any negotiations with Moscow.

The Russian delegation at the negotiations in Istanbul is led by Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky. The Russian team of negotiators also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

A Magna Carta wrongly listed as an unofficial copy for nearly 80 years has been confirmed as an original from 1300.

The discovery means the document is just one of seven issued in 1300 by Edward I that still survive.

David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at King's College London, stumbled on a document labelled as an unofficial copy of Magna Carta from 1327 in Harvard law school library's online collection.

He said: “I was trawling through all these online statute books trying to find unofficial copies of the Magna Carta … and I immediately thought: my god this looks for all the world like an original of Edward I's confirmation of Magna Carta in 1300, though of course appearances are deceptive.”

Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia, used a battery of tests to establish the authenticity of the document, known as HLS MS 172.

“Using spectral imaging and ultraviolet light, because in places the condition isn't very good, I worked through it word by word and it matched perfectly to the other six,” Carpenter said. “One extraordinary little detail about the handwriting is the initial E at the start of Edwardus. The next letter – the D – of Edwardus is also a capital, which is quite unusual. And yet you find that capital D in one of the other six originals.”

Magna Carta, originally granted by King John in 1215, was the first document to put into writing the principle that the king and his government were not above the law.

Carpenter described HLS MS 172 as “one of the world's most valuable documents”.

He added: “It asserts a fundamental principle that the ruler is subject to the law. He can't just say: ‘Into prison, off with your head, I'm seizing your property.' If he wants to act against you, he has to do so by legal process. It's the foundation stone of the western tradition of law and democracy.”

According to the library's accession register, it had bought what it believed to be a copy for $27.50 in 1946. A month earlier, an RAF veteran had sold it to the London book dealers Sweet & Maxwell for £42.

Vincent said: “It's easy to understand why it was mis-catalogued when it was sold … it's a long time ago. Everyone in 1945 was a bit tired. It's worth many, many, many, many times that.”

Carpenter described the discovery as fantastic news for Harvard. “I felt amazed. First that it existed at all and secondly, that Harvard didn't realise what they had. I felt slightly awestruck in a way because the 1300 confirmation by Edward I is the most authoritative of all confirmations,” he added.

Carpenter and Vincent believe the document was issued to the former parliamentary borough of Appleby in Cumbria in 1300.

Vincent said: “It was then passed down through an evil aristocratic family of the 18th century, the Lowthers, who then gave it to Thomas Clarkson, who was the leading slavery abolitionist. And then, through Clarkson's estate, it went to this fellow, Forster Maynard, who was a first world war flying ace, who ended up as the commander of the airbase on Malta at the start of the second world war. The provenance of this document is extraordinary.”

Amanda Watson, Harvard Law School's assistant dean for library and information services, said: “Congratulations to Professors Carpenter and Vincent on their fantastic discovery. This work exemplifies what happens when magnificent collections, like Harvard Law Library's, are opened to brilliant scholars.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US president's reported comments in Qatar come as scores killed in a second consecutive night of heavy bombing. This live blog is closed

President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted the United States to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”, as the Israel-Hamas war rages on in the Palestinian territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good, make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone,” the US leader said in Qatar, adding:

I'd be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.

Here is a summary of the day's main developments so far:

US president Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of a plan he put forward in February for the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub. “I'd be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone,” Trump said in Qatar.

Gaza's civil defence agency said that the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103. Most of the victims, including women and children, were killed in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in airstrikes that hit homes and tents, Palestinian medics said. Gaza's civil defence agency spokeperson Mahmud Bassal said at least 13 people were “recovered from rubble” after a dawn strike in Khan Younis.

The dead included a journalist working for Qatari television network Al Araby TV, the network announced on social media, saying Hasan Samour had been killed along with 11 members of his family in one of the strikes in Khan Younis.

Trump has arrived in Abu Dhabi, where he was greeted by president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan as he stepped off Air Force One. After addressing US troops at Qatar's al-Udeid airbase, Trump made his way to the presidental plane where the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was waiting to see him off.

Trump has said that the US's air campaign against the Houthi rebels was “very successful, but maybe tomorrow, an attack will be made, in which case we go back on the offensive”. He made the comments on a visit to al-Udeid airbase in Doha, Qatar. Prior to that visit, the president attended a business forum in Qatar where he hailed what he said was a record $200bn deal for Boeing aircraft.

Trump said on Thursday that the USwas getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms. “We're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Roads have been blocked in the occupied West Bank and a manhunt is under way after Israel's military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman. Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called for nearby Palestinian villages to be flattened, while WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the West Bank were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack, according to AFP.

Palestinians have been commemorating the 77th anniversary of the Nakba, to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Madrid attended a march on Thursday to commemorate Nakba Day.

In the West Bank village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks. “The occupation forces killed five young men after besieging a house in the centre of the village,” Tammun mayor Samir Qteishat told AFP. The Israeli military said “soldiers identified armed terrorists who barricaded themselves in a building”.

Hamas on Thursday accused Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining mediation efforts for a hostage release and ceasefire deal by carrying out military operations in Gaza. “War criminal Netanyahu undermines mediation efforts through deliberate military escalation, showing indifference to his captives, endangering their lives,” Hamas said in a statement referring to hostages held in the Palestinian territory.

Israel's foreign ministry said it had summoned the Spanish ambassador for a formal reprimand after the country's prime minister described Israel as a “genocidal state”. Pedro Sánchez made the remarks on Wednesday during an exchange in Spanish parliament in which his government was accused of continuing to trade with Israel. “I want to clarify one thing,” Sánchez said. “We don't trade with a genocidal state. We don't.”

“Israel's blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”, Human Rights Watch (HRW) interim executive director Federico Borello said in a statement on Thursday. HRW said: “The Israeli government's plan to demolish what remains of Gaza's civilian infrastructure and concentrate the Palestinian population into a tiny area would amount to an abhorrent escalation of its ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide.”

Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream, has been charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while protesting against the Gaza blockade during a US Senate hearing. Video film recorded at the hearing and posted by Cohen on social media shows him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away.

Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said on Thursday he will discuss the US decision to lift sanctions on Syria and the roadmap ahead in a meeting with his US and Syrian counterparts later in the day. Fidan was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Antalya, Turkey, where he later planned to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani.

Germany's Lufthansa airline group said on Thursday its suspension of flights to and from Tel Aviv would last until at least 25 May amid ongoing regional conflict. Lufthansa said in a statement the decision to extend the suspension was made “due to the current situation”, without giving further details.

Israel will not fund a new US-led humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip, but it will facilitate and enable it, Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon told reporters on Thursday.

The US treasury has said that it has begun to execute Donald Trump's announcement in Saudi Arabia that Washington was lifting sanctions on Syria.

In a post on social media, the US said: “We look forward to implementing the necessary authorisations that would be critical to bringing new investment into Syria.”

It added that the action would help Syria begin rebuilding its infrastructure, economy and financial sector, to put the country “on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future.”

The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, told US president Donald Trump on Thursday that the Iranian nation considered him the “murderer” of Quds Force commander Qassem Suleimani.

Suleimani was the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards.

He was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on 3 January 2020, ordered by Trump during his first term in office.

Trump had said earlier that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Tehran.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Thursday met Syria's foreign minister to discuss normalising relations after president Donald Trump moved to ease sanctions on the country.

The top US diplomat, in the Turkish resort of Antalya for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, opened talks with Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani, a state department official said, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The closed-door meeting also involved top Turkish officials including foreign minister Hakan Fidan, the official added.

Trump, on a visit to Riyadh on Tuesday, announced that he would lift sanctions, saying that he wanted to give Syrians “a chance at greatness”.

Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice-cream, has been charged with “crowding and obstructing” others after he was arrested while protesting against the Gaza blockade during a US Senate hearing.

Cohen – the Ben in Ben & Jerry's – made his stand on Wednesday while Robert F Kennedy Jr was addressing a hearing of the health, education, labor and pensions committee. A group of activists heckled the health secretary over his anti-vaccine posture, yelling: “When Bobby lies, children die,” and “Anti-vax, anti-science, anti-America”.

Then Cohen stood up and made his Gaza protest. Video film recorded at the hearing and posted by Cohen on social media shows him being hauled out of the committee room, handcuffed and escorted away.

As he is being removed, a woman asked him why he was being arrested.

He replied:

Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the US.

He added:

Congress and the senators need to ease the siege, they need to let food into Gaza. They need to let food to starving kids.

Gaza is now in the 11th week of a total blockade by Israel which prevents essential items including food, fuel and medicines reaching the area's 2.3 million Palestinians. Many people are surviving on limited supplies of canned peas or dried beans.

A report this week from food security experts warned that Gaza was at “critical risk of famine”.

Here are some images from Gaza, where Palestinians have been commemorating Nakba Day, to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It is the 77th anniversary of the Nakba:

Users of Palestinian Telegram channels sharing information on West Bank checkpoints reported many road closures in the north of the territory on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the West Bank were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman (see 11.56am BST). “To make sure this never happens again … we need real revenge! Erase every terror village,” one user said, according to AFP.

In the northern West Bank, the Israeli military said a manhunt was under way. Lt Gen Eyal Zamir said:

We will use all the tools at our disposal and reach the murderers in order to hold them accountable.

In the northern village of Tammun, Israeli troops killed five Palestinians in a raid the military described as targeting buildings suspected of being used to plan attacks.

“The occupation forces killed five young men after besieging a house in the centre of the village,” Tammun mayor Samir Qteishat told AFP.

The Israeli military said “soldiers identified armed terrorists who barricaded themselves in a building”. “Following an exchange of fire, five terrorists were eliminated, and an additional terrorist was apprehended,” it said.

“Israel's blockade has transcended military tactics to become a tool of extermination”, Human Rights Watch (HRW) interim executive director Federico Borello said in a statement on Thursday.

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), HRW said:

The Israeli government's plan to demolish what remains of Gaza's civilian infrastructure and concentrate the Palestinian population into a tiny area would amount to an abhorrent escalation of its ongoing crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide.

Gaza's civil defence agency said that the death toll from Israeli bombardment since dawn on Thursday had risen to 103. Updates have been coming in throughout the day, with previous total, given by Palestinian rescuers, being 94 (see 12.20pm BST).

Palestinians and pro-Palestinian protesters have been marking Nakba Day, which is generally commemorated on 15 May to honour the more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.

Here are some more images, coming in via the newswires, of Trump's latest stop on his Middle East visit:

US president Donald Trump has arrived in Abu Dhabi, where he was greeted by president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan as he stepped off Air Force One.

After addressing US troops at Qatar's al-Udeid airbase, Trump made his way to Air Force One, where the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was waiting to see him off.

According to a White House spokesperson, the two leaders spoke for a moment, before Trump walked to the stairs of the presidential plane on a red carpet, with a Qatari honour guard standing at attention.

President Donald Trump's comment Thursday about not wanting to make “nuclear dust” in a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities mirrors the concerns of the Gulf Arab countries he's visiting in the Middle East this week.

The possibility of a US or Israeli strike on Iranian enrichment sites has renewed longstanding fears that Gulf Arab states have about Iran's programme, AP reported.

In the past, they have worried that an accident or a strike at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant could send radioactive material into the air and spread across the Persian Gulf into their countries.

Speaking to a business forum on Thursday, Trump similarly brought up the idea.

“Iran has sort of agreed to the terms: They're not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust,” Trump said. “We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.”

Iran has criticised the US threats to strike.

Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said on Thursday he will discuss the US decision to lift sanctions on Syria and the roadmap ahead in a meeting with his US and Syrian counterparts later in the day.

Fidan was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Antalya, Turkey, where he later planned to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Syrian foreign minister Asaad al-Shibani.

US president Donald Trump made the surprise announcement on Syrian sanctions this week.

Just two days after the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria last December, Israel launched a sweeping offensive, seizing the Golan Heights and carrying out hundreds of airstrikes across the country.

Israel has remained militarily involved in Syria, declaring regions near their shared border a demilitarised zone and carrying out frequent attacks, patrols and raids. These measures have frustrated the new leadership in Damascus, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, which has accused Israel of destabilising the country.

Gift packages from the Taipei City Government to World Masters Games competitors included souvenirs made in China, city councilors said.

Competitors received packages that included smartwatches that were difficult to use and required users to use apps from its retailer, Taipei City Councilor Lin Yen-feng  (林延鳳) said, adding that the watches were made in China, in contravention of government regulations.

The watches' retailer is listed as JSmax Co in Tainan, but it is the same as a China-made smartwatch available on Shopee, Lin said.

Taipei City Councilor Yen Juo-fang (顏若芳) of the Democratic Progressive Party also said coffee cups in the gift packages were falsely labeled, with its country of origin shown as “supervised in Taiwan, made in China.”

Elected representatives passed bylaws stating that “World Masters Games products, souvenirs and official items must not use China-made goods,” Yen said.

Other items in the package are missing labels or have incomplete information, which contravenes the Commodity Labeling Act (商品標示法), she said.

There are no instructions for the souvenir plastic water bottles either, in contravention of the Act Governing Food Safety and Sanitation (食品安全衛生管理法), which requires that containers provide information on the item's materials and heat-resistant temperature range, she added.

The councilors accused Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) of negligence and raised questions about firms selling Games-related souvenirs and items online.

Taipei City Councilor Lin Chen-yu (林珍羽) of the Taiwan People's Party at a city hall meeting yesterday questioned Chiang about the city government spending NT$3 million (US$99,374) to develop an app for the Games' participants and audience.

“We received numerous complaints about the app not working, being very difficult to use and lacking updated information,” Lin Chen-yu said. “It is a big waste of taxpayers' money.”

Chiang said he has heard about the unauthorized selling of Games-related items and that he has tasked officials to look into it.

He also agreed that contractors are not allowed to use China-made products, adding that he would pursue legal action against firms that contravened the signed agreement and government regulations.

Chiang apologized for errors in billboards, which misspelled the city as “Taiipei,” other English-language mistakes in the Games' promotion and apps, and poorly translated names on the tags of athletes and volunteers.

The World Masters Games' opening ceremony is set for tomorrow evening. 

People are invited to join a street parade at 5:30pm around Taipei City Hall. Traffic control is to begin in the morning before the start of events at the Taipei Dome.

The government would provide full scholarships for international students to further their studies for two years in Taiwan, so those who want to pursue a master's degree can consider applying for the program, he said.
The fields included are science, technology, engineering, mathematics, semiconductors and finance, Yeh added.
The program, called “Intense 2+2,” would also assist international students who completed the two years of further studies in

Tsai arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Friday night, but did not speak to reporters before departing.
Tsai wrote on social media later that the purpose of the trip was to reaffirm the commitment of Taiwanese to working with democratic allies to promote regional security and stability, upholding freedom and democracy, and defending their homeland.
She also expressed hope that through joint efforts, Taiwan and Europe would continue to be partners building up economic resilience on the global stage.

The National Stabilization Fund (NSF) will continue to support local shares in spite of the TAIEX's recent rebound, as global trade headwinds could attenuate Taiwan's GDP growth, despite a strong first-quarter performance, two government ministers said yesterday.

“The fund will remain active in the stock market at least through July, as the government aims to boost investor confidence in the face of global economic uncertainty,” Minister of Finance Chuang Tsui-yun (莊翠雲) told a meeting of the legislature's Finance Committee in Taipei.

The minister attributed the TAIEX's recent rally to the agreement over the weekend between the US and China to slash their respective tariffs for 90 days, allowing the world to breathe a sigh of relief.

The agreement suggests that global economic and geopolitical uncertainties persist, Chuang said.

The TAIEX gained 5 percent over the past five sessions to close above the 21,000-point mark, Taiwan Stock Exchange data showed. The benchmark index slid 0.24 percent to close at 21,730.25 yesterday. 

“The fund will not exit before its next quarterly meeting in July... Rather, it will continue to carry out its duty of stabilizing market confidence,” Chuang said.

The government on April 8 activated the NT$500 billion (US$16.56 billion) fund in a bid to shore up the local bourse, which tumbled to 17,391 amid panic sell-offs triggered by US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 to slap a 32 percent “reciprocal” tariff on Taiwanese goods.

Chuang declined to remark on the fund's operations, saying that a committee is in charge of the fund's trading decisions and she is not involved. 

The committee's executive secretary — Deputy Minister of Finance Frank Juan (阮清華) — is tasked with managing the fund to support the local market and shore up investor confidence.

The fund has intervened during major crises, including the political power transition in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022.

The fund's next scheduled meeting is in July, when the committee is to evaluate whether it would stay in the market, Chuang said.

Minister of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) Chen Shu-tzu (陳淑姿) shared the cautious tone, saying Taiwan would have difficulty achieving GDP growth of more than 3 percent this year, despite a 5.37 percent expansion in the first quarter.

Taiwan delivered a stronger-than-expected performance in the first quarter on the back of front-loading demand, but concerns over US tariffs are clouding the outlook for the rest of the year, she said.

The momentum is unlikely to be sustained in the second half of this year — the high season for technology products — although front-loading demand has continued this quarter, Chen said.

With risks of tariffs from the US hanging over Taiwan's export-reliant economy, achieving 3 percent growth is difficult this year, she said.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on semiconductors. The DGBAS is to release its GDP growth update on May 28.

The first city entirely built by a private company to be operational in east Africa, with about 25,000 people living and working there, it accounts for about two-thirds of all foreign investment in Kenya. 
Its low-tax status has attracted more than 100 businesses including Heineken, coffee brand Dormans, and the biggest call-center and cold-chain transport firms in the region. 
However, to some local politicians, Tatu City has looked more like a target for extortion.

The CIO Fund Series has received widespread acclaim since its launch. The first two issues — the “CIO Income Fund” and the “CIO Growth Fund” — have both been well-received by clients due to the CIO team's excellent strategy execution. 

Building on this success, the third product in the series — the “CIO Balanced Fund” — continues the core mission of providing diversified asset solutions that balance stability and growth potential.

The CIO Balanced Fund combines equities and bonds — Seizing opportunities to navigate both bull and bear markets

Against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, including rising global tensions and potential trade policy shifts, the importance of diversified and balanced asset allocation has never been more apparent. Historical trends show that equities and bonds can seldom move in tandem, limiting the benefits of traditional diversification. The inclusion of gold and alternative assets in a portfolio has therefore become a critical element for risk mitigation.

The CIO Balanced Fund strategically diverse assets include stocks, bonds and gold. Based on a balanced allocation of stocks and bonds, this fund enhances risk control and resilience through the inclusion of gold and commodities. It enables a flexible balance between risk management and growth potential, while offering investors with the flexibility and potential to participate in market rebounds.

Five strategic advantages for all-round performance

The CIO Balanced Fund is built upon five core investment strategies, offering investors a comprehensive and flexible solution to pursue opportunities across market cycles:

All covered — A robust mix of equities, bonds and gold delivers broad diversification and effective risk control

All weather — A dynamic, all-weather strategy designed to adapt to interest rate shifts, inflation and geopolitical risks

All expert — Backed by insights from Standard Chartered's Chief Investment Office and actively managed by Amundi's experienced team for full-cycle professional oversight

All ETF — Leverages active strategy with low-cost ETF implementation, balancing flexibility with cost efficiency

All in one — Combines Standard Chartered's Chief Investment Office strategic views, multiasset exposure, and execution efficiency in a single fund structure

Never miss out an investment opportunity — SCB Fund2Fund, the ideal solution

Standard Chartered Bank had embarked on several ambitious innovations and solutions; besides the CIO Funds, “Fund2Fund” is an innovated Master-Feeder Fund, which combines the advantages of lump-sum and RSP subscription, serving as a solution for solving the pain point of disciplined investment for investors.

Fund2Fund offers three investment modes: “Fixed Date,” “Fixed Price” and “Cycle Plan.” Through an automated process, it enables active investors to seize market opportunities.

Moreover, SCB Fund2Fund provides nearly a thousand funds to select, including Signature CIO fund series, giving investors a convenient and efficient way to diversify and construct a comprehensive portfolio. 

Standard Chartered Bank serves as the custodian bank for this “Signature CIO Balanced Fund,” and investors can subscribe through Standard Chartered online / mobile banking or at any branch from May 5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","Exclusive: Ukraine eyes new sanctions on China, but Kyiv wary of peace talks fallout","https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-eyes-new-sanctions-on-china-but-wary-of-peace-talks-fallout/","Thu, 15 May 2025 01:24:44 GMT","

Ukraine faces a difficult balancing act — sanction more Chinese firms for aiding Russia's war machine without alienating Beijing, which could be key to ending Russia's invasion.

Kyiv is currently considering imposing new sanctions against Chinese firms providing raw materials to Russia's defense sector, a source close to the matter told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity.

But doing so could risk pushing Beijing — an important economic partner for Kyiv — further from Ukraine and closer to Russia, the source said.

As momentum builds around peace talks, with President Volodymyr Zelensky heading to Istanbul on May 15, Kyiv is hoping China can nudge its Russian ally toward negotiating a ceasefire and bringing end to the invasion, Ukrainian officials said.

China could be a key country in ending Russia's war and ushering in a “sustainable” peace, the press service of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine has largely abstained from publicly bad-mouthing China, but the relationship has taken a hit in recent weeks as Kyiv grows more vocal against Beijing's support for Russia.

Days after Chinese troops were captured in Donetsk Oblast fighting alongside Russians, President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 18 slapped sanctions on three Chinese companies. In an speech, he accused Beijing of supplying Moscow with gunpowder and weapons.

While claiming to be neutral in the full-scale invasion, China provided 76% of Russia's battlefield goods in 2023, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE).Top Ukrainian sanctions official Vladyslav Vlasiuk told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine is “concerned about some apparently Chinese-made components found in weapons used to attack civilians and count on our partners to take some serious action to stop it.”Ukraine sanctioned two Chinese firms — ​​Beijing Aviation and Aerospace Xianghui Technology Co. Ltd — as well as Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining Co. Ltd, for supplying carbon fiber to Russia used in Iskander ballistic missiles that frequently target cities across Ukraine, according to an official document seen by the Kyiv Independent.Days later, Zelensky said Chinese citizens were working in Russian drone production factories, even claiming Russia could have “stolen” drone technology from China, during a news conference in Kyiv. 

On May 9, as Xi Jinping watched Russian soldiers march through Moscow during the WWII Victory Day parade, Ukraine followed up with sanctions on the Hong Kong-based firm Smart Kit Technology. The company was already subject to U.S. sanctions for shipping raw materials and technology like chip-making machines to Russian enterprises.Meanwhile, Ukrainian media reported in February that Chinese companies were also investing in occupied territories and working with the occupying authorities. Kyiv notifies Beijing when Russia attempts to lure a Chinese company to the occupied territories, Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry press service said. “The government bodies of China respond to such appeals of the Ukrainian side and, after confirming the relevant information, take measures to prevent interaction of Chinese business circles with representatives of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,” the ministry said. The recent sanctions are Ukraine's first proper slap on China's wrist. Zelensky previously accused Beijing of “disrupting” the peace process and supplying “elements of Russia's weaponry” during a conference in Singapore in June 2024, but took no tangible action. 

Prior to the crackdown on the Chinese companies, Zelensky's administration turned a blind eye to Beijing's “no limits” partnership with Moscow, despite China helping Russia, including by skirting Western sanctions and supplying dual-use goods for military purposes. There is little anti-China rhetoric from the Ukrainian government, and unlike other countries that support Russia, Kyiv hasn't cut ties with Beijing. In July 2024, Ukraine's Foreign Minister at the time, Dmytro Kuleba, even visited Guangdong Province to convince local businesses and authorities to invest in Ukrainian regions, specifically in Mykolaiv Oblast. “At this moment, we cannot see a strong will from the side of the government to move away from China,” Arthur Khartyonov, President of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine, an NGO, and founder of the Free Hong Kong Center, a pro-democracy initiative , told the Kyiv Independent.


Ukraine is unlikely to divest from China, as Beijing remains the top producer for goods that it needs, including radio equipment for military use, drones, generators, and equipment that props up the energy grid after attacks.
    

Chinese exports to Ukraine reached a record high last year. The value of Chinese goods increased to $14.5 billion from $10.44 billion in 2023, outgunning Polish, German, and Turkish imports for the top spot, according to the Center for Economic Strategy (CES) in Kyiv. While Ukrainian exports to China dipped from $8 billion in 2021 to $2.4 billion last year, this is largely due to blocked trade routes and war-time complications rather than any political decision, Dmytro Goriunov, an expert at the KSE Institute and Head of the “Russia Will Pay” project, told the Kyiv Independent. 

Ukraine is unlikely to divest from China, as Beijing remains the top producer for goods that it needs, including radio equipment for military use, drones, generators, and equipment that props up the energy grid after attacks, he added. Kyiv's budgetary constraints mean it is stuck with China, for now. 

Issues began piling up when Kyiv failed to woo Beijing with its 10-point peace plan presented in 2022. Instead, Xi presented his own peace formula in February 2023 that received a lukewarm response in Ukraine. Zelensky said he agreed with only some of China's points. In the West, the plan was largely criticized for being too much in Moscow's favor, while Russia celebrated it. The points were general and included conditions like a cease-fire, the lifting of sanctions on Russia, and respect for territorial sovereignty. Beijing hasn't recognized Russia's 2-14 annexation of Crimea nor the occupied Ukrainian territories Moscow claims to have annexed in 2022.A year later, China snubbed Kyiv's invitation to the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland that gathered nations supportive of Ukraine's peace formula. To add insult to injury, Beijing then announced that over two dozen countries backed the Chinese peace plan. By June, Zelensky's frustrations reached a tipping point, and he accused China of “working hard… to prevent countries from coming to the peace summit.” Beijing maintained its neutrality and refuted “fanning fire or fueling the flames.”

On China's end, it wants to make sure the status quo within Russia remains steadfast, Dr. Marina Rudyak, an international development consultant and a lecturer at Heidelberg University's Center for Asian and Transcultural Studies, told the Kyiv Independent.“It's in China's interest to keep its border (with Russia) stable and secure and keep Russia stable. Anything that is not (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is more unpredictable than Putin,” she said.

After several attempts to engage with Chinese officials in Ukraine failed, Kyiv realized it needed a different approach. When Ukraine captured several Chinese soldiers on April 8 and Beijing denied any involvement, Kyiv saw its opportunity to put its foot down. While Ukraine can't simply cut trade with China, it knew it had scope to go after Chinese companies involved in Russian weapons production, as well as two Chinese captains sailing sanctioned Shadow Fleet vessels.  It's not clear how informed the CCP is about the involvement of Chinese citizens and companies in the war. The central leadership is unlikely to have full knowledge or responsibility for all the Chinese support for Russia, said Rudyak. The testimonies of the captured Chinese troops suggest there is a “significant number” of Chinese citizens fighting with Russia, the Foreign Ministry's press service said. “This may indicate a systemic problem and insufficient effectiveness of the Chinese authorities' measures to prevent this phenomenon,” the ministry added. For now, China has not publicly responded to the sanctions aside from calling the accusations “groundless.” Tensions then escalated when Kyiv presented evidence of Chinese citizens and companies to the Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Ma Shengkun.


“China is first pro-China, not exactly pro-Russia, so there are hopes that China may persuade Russia to stop the war.” 
    

“We have clarified China's position on the relevant issues. China strongly opposes groundless accusations and political manipulations,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a press briefing on April 22. Ukraine wants to open up dialogue with China so that tensions don't boil over. The country is powerful and, like Turkey, a possible mediator between Ukraine and Russia if Kyiv can win it over. “China is first pro-China, not exactly pro-Russia, so there are hopes that China may persuade Russia to stop the war,” Goriunov said.  Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis cautiously assured Ambassador Shengkun on April 22 that Ukraine “values its strategic partnership with China” while urging Beijing to “stop supporting Russia.”

President Xi didn't seem to get the message as he sat next to President Putin during Moscow's Victory Day Parade. The day before, the two “friends of steel” reiterated their partnership in a joint statement and announced deeper cooperation, including in military ties to counter the U.S. Conceringly for Ukraine, the statement included a line about China helping establish peace in Ukraine with Russia and addressing the “root causes” of the war– a thinly veiled reference to Russia's narrative about NATO expansion. While Ukraine is eager for a diplomatic meeting to iron out the tensions, the Chinese side is taking a long time to consider Kyiv's proposals, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said. This does not bode well for their bilateral relations.“Further delaying or avoiding such contacts could lead to a crisis of confidence, which is highly undesirable,” the ministry added.

Editor's note: The article was updated with statements from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and from a source close to the Ukrainian Presidential Office.

A plane with the Russian delegation arrived in Istanbul ahead of planned peace talks with Ukraine, pro-state news agency Interfax reported on May 15, citing sources in aviation services.

Russia proposed to launch direct negotiations with Ukraine this week in lieu of an unconditional ceasefire proposed by Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky immediately agreed to attend and invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to an in-person meeting in Istanbul on May 15. 

The Russian leader seemingly declined to join himself and appointed his aide, Vladimir Medinsky, to lead the talks. When asked by the Kyiv Independent, a source close to the Presidential Office did not confirm whether Ukraine would still hold the talks if Putin does not join.

Ukraine's Presidential Office has previously said that Zelensky would not meet lower-level Russian officials if Putin refuses to come, making the format of the expected talks uncertain. 

The Ukrainian president is first set to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara and will then decide on the next step regarding possible talks with Russia, the source noted.

The Russian delegation will also consist of Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Military Intelligence Director Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.

The delegation's list is notably void of Putin himself and other Kremlin top politicians, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, was also absent from the list.

Putin held a preparatory meeting on the evening of May 14 with the Russian delegates, Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belusov, Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, and chiefs of military and security forces, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian state-owned news agency TASS.

""I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take. So far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing,"" Zelensky said on the evening of May 14.

Initially, TASS reported that the meeting would start at around 10 a.m., a claim refuted by Ukraine. The Russian state media later reported that the talks are likely to begin in the second half of the day.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially voiced optimism about the prospects of a Zelensky-Putin meeting and suggested he might attend as well. However, a White House official on May 14 said that Trump will not attend the peace talks.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Turkey on May 14 and met with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in Antalya. Sybiha also met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan. 

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Istanbul with Rubio on May 16 to participate in discussions on Ukraine.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) on May 14 for the first time presented its latest versatile Magura naval drones to the public.

The Magura drones, as well as the Sea Baby drones of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), have been pivotal in turning the tide of the war in the Black Sea, destroying or damaging multiple Russian ships and other assets.

HUR's Group 13 has deployed Magura drones to successfully hit 17 naval and aerial Russian targets. Fifteen of them, including two Mi-8 helicopters, two Su-30 fighter jets, and the Sergey Kotov, Ivanovets, and Ceasar Kunikov warships of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, have been destroyed, the agency said.

Several variants of the Magura drones exist, including the ""ship-killer"" V5, the V7 capable of carrying machine guns or anti-air missiles, and the multi-platform V6P.

As of 2024, Ukraine was reportedly able to destroy or disable one-third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in a drone and missile campaign, despite Moscow's significant advantage in sheer naval power.

Black Sea hostilities have since then quieted down as Russia moved most of its naval assets from occupied Crimea further east and Ukraine managed to resume its maritime shipping.

Good morning. The Trump administration's retreat from science has created an international bidding war for talent – more on that below, along with Vladimir Putin's no-show in Istanbul and Loblaw's dwindling pre-tariff stock. But first:

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a U.S. Senate committee yesterday.John McDonnell/The Associated Press

Yesterday, in his first appearance before U.S. Congress since becoming health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had a lot of explaining to do. Democratic lawmakers wanted to know why he slashed billions in funding that they'd appropriated for medical research. They wanted to know where 20,000 federal employees had gone. They wanted him to stop criticizing vaccines. Pressed repeatedly by House Representatives, Kennedy wavered on whether he'd vaccinate his own child. “My opinions on vaccines are irrelevant,” said the man who spent Mother's Day lounging in a creek full of sewer runoff. “I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.”

That hasn't typically been the position of the Health and Human Services Department. For decades, the U.S. served as the world's science superpower, spending more than any other nation on research and development – nearly US$1-trillion in 2024 – and luring top talent from around the globe. But now, as the Trump administration shutters whole health divisions, curbs what can be studied, and cracks down hard on immigration, scientists are eyeing the exits. In a recent Nature poll of more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, 75 per cent said they were considering leaving for work elsewhere. Most cited Canada and Europe as their top relocation picks.

And those countries are ready to poach. They're not being especially subtle about it, either. In a statement last month, the Canadian Medical Association insisted that “Canada must act quickly to turn a U.S. brain drain into Canadian brain gain.”

Race to the finish

Some provinces have already hopped on the opportunity, fast-tracking licensing for U.S. health workers to practise in Ontario, B.C., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This week, B.C. announced that it had shaved the accreditation process for nurses from four months to just a few days. Even without promoting the new process, B.C. Premier David Eby said applications had increased by 127 per cent since early April; more than 100 American nurses are now eligible to work. “It is very clear to us that U.S. professionals are looking for something better,” Health Minister Josie Osborne said at the press conference, “and here in British Columbia, we are offering just that.”

If that sounds suspiciously like the tagline of a recruitment campaign, you're onto something – the province plans to run ads targeting nurses and doctors in U.S. states. It'll face stiff competition from the Prairies. Advocacy group Doctors Manitoba launched a splashy website weeks after the U.S. election, inviting health workers to come practise “where you are valued and trusted as a physician and the government stays out of the exam room.” Manitoba Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara said in March that more than 15 health care workers now plan to relocate. And last month, the Saskatchewan government kicked off its own recruitment campaign with a suite of digital ads. “More security and less drama,” one ad promised doctors. “Join us in Saskatchewan!” 

The exchange rate

Across the Atlantic, countries have been more transactional in their sales pitch to Americans: You've got the talent, and we've got the cash. Last week in Paris, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a €500-million investment over the next two years to “make Europe a magnet for researchers.” French President Emmanuel Macron said his government would pony up an additional €100-million to attract U.S. scientists. Norway countered with 100 million kroner, or more than $13-million, in funding. Spain promised €45-million to researchers who are “despised by the Donald Trump administration.”

We'll see if Prime Minister Mark Carney's new government puts a similar price on U.S. scientists. In its campaign platform, the Liberal Party said it would focus on attracting top global talent, including from the U.S., to drive economic growth, even as it restricts immigration for everyone else. But Toronto's University Health Network isn't waiting around for Ottawa to make a move. UHN announced recently that the hospital network – the largest in the country – will invest $15-million to bring in 50 scientists immediately, particularly from south of the border. “We have to move pretty quickly, because the rest of the world is looking at the same opportunity to recruit top talent,” UHN president and chief executive officer Kevin Smith told The Globe. “It's an opportunistic moment that we would hate to miss.”

When Mark Carney named François-Philippe Champagne – a Trudeau-era veteran – as Finance Minister, the choice didn't quite seem to align with the Prime Minister's promise for change. Insiders tell The Globe they see it differently. Read more about Carney's pick here. 

At home: Canada Post paused negotiations with its workers on a new collective agreement as a potential strike looms next week.

Abroad: The Kremlin confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't be in Istanbul today for a face-to-face meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Costs: Loblaw warned that it's running out of pre-tariff inventory – and that prices could go up when the grocery store restocks its shelves.

Savings: The toughest job market in decades is threatening the financial futures of young Canadians.

Pay outs: After last year's controversy, the CBC said it would no longer offer individual bonuses to employees.

The quantum world is having a big month. From next-gen cybersecurity to international alliances, the headlines show how fast the tech is evolving and how many industries it's starting to touch. Here's a quick and easy rundown of what you need to know.





Oracle (ORCL) has teamed up with seQure, an Entanglement company, to launch Ground-Truth on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Previously only available on-premises, this advanced cybersecurity and observability platform is now accessible across Oracle's public, government, and sovereign cloud environments.

What makes Ground-Truth special is that it processes up to 20TB of data per day and uses AI and quantum-inspired algorithms to detect threats in under a second, with up to 90% fewer false alarms. It's designed for zero-trust environments and works across corporate networks, IoT, and operational tech (OT), making it a powerful fit for modern cyber defense.

Quantinuum just hit a new performance high: a Quantum Volume (QV) of 8,388,608 on its H2 system. QV is a metric, developed by IBM (IBM), that measures not just qubit count but also system coherence, error rates, and connectivity. Think of it as quantum computing's equivalent of horsepower.

Quantinuum pledged in 2020 to increase QV tenfold every year, and it's now delivered on that promise early. The company is now looking ahead to its next-gen Helios system, which is expected to push performance even further. No other company has made (or kept) such a public promise on QV growth.

Australian quantum computing startup Diraq has signed on to join the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP), home to the $140 million Quantum Proving Ground and anchor tenant PsiQuantum. Diraq uses silicon spin qubits and CMOS-compatible tech to scale quantum systems efficiently as part of DARPA's Quantum Benchmarking Initiative.

Illinois continues to position itself as a global quantum hub, and Diraq's move signals growing international investment. The On-Ramp program will give Diraq early access to local facilities while the larger park is still under development.

Neutral-atom quantum company Pasqal has partnered with Google Cloud (GOOGL)(GOOG) to offer access to its 100-qubit QPU through the Google Cloud Marketplace. With a pay-as-you-go model and open-source tools, Pasqal is making it easier for both experts and newcomers to run quantum workloads in the cloud.

Users can monitor job progress, optimize workflows, and even run advanced simulations. More toolkits—especially in optimization and quantum simulation—are expected later this year, making Pasqal's platform a strong contender for real-world use cases.

The EU and Japan signed a Letter of Intent to strengthen quantum tech collaboration as part of the EU-Japan Digital Partnership. The agreement establishes joint funding (via Horizon Europe and Japan's SIP) and includes projects like Q-NEKO, which is focused on quantum AI for climate modeling and healthcare.

This partnership is about more than research; it also covers cybersecurity, semiconductors, and quantum communication, with a progress review set for 2026. It's another sign of global momentum in quantum R&D, especially on strategic issues like resilience and digital sovereignty.

QuEra Computing is now at the heart of two of six final projects in the prestigious Quantum for Bio Challenge. One is led by the University of Nottingham and Phasecraft, focused on targeting myotonic dystrophy. The other, from Harvard and MIT, aims to enhance ligand-protein binding predictions—both using QuEra's quantum simulation capabilities.

These projects are now entering Phase 3, where real quantum hardware will be used to validate earlier simulation results. With up to $2 million in funding available, this is a key step in proving that quantum computing can actually help solve real-world healthcare problems.

India has blocked X accounts belonging to state media from China and Turkey. The move comes as disinformation has been rife in both India and Pakistan amid last week's tit-for-tat military strikes. 

The X accounts of Chinese state news agency Xinhua, English-language Communist Party media Global Times, and Turkey's TRTWorld were blocked in India as of Wednesday afternoon local time.

The blocked accounts come as India claims misinformation is being spread by foreign media outlets about last week's military clashes with arch-rival Pakistan. 

India and Pakistan reached the brink of war last week with the nuclear-armed nations exchanging missile, drone and shell fire.

Tensions began on April 22 when Islamist extremists killed 26 civilians, mostly tourists, in a brutal attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. India has accused Pakistan of harboring and supporting militants, a charge that Islamabad denies. 

After several strikes from both sides, a  ceasefire was reached on May 10 that is still holding.

India and Pakistan have presented starkly different official versions of last week's military clashes, with social media accounts and news organisations in both countries pushing unverified reporting. 

On May 7, The Indian embassy in China on X warned China's Global Times about an article that claimed Pakistan's air force had ""shot down another Indian fighter jet in response to overnight airstrikes."" The information had been attributed to Chinese news agency Xinhua.

 ""We would recommend you verify your facts and cross-examine your sources before pushing out this kind of disinformation,"" the post said. 

Pakistan claims it shot down five Indian fighter jets. India's military said all its pilots involved in the strikes had returned home safely. 

The embassy further quoted India's Press Information Bureau, which has labelled circulating videos of fallen Indian fighter jets as fake. 

Since the Kashmir crisis erupted, India's government has directed X to block some 8,000 accounts and remove Pakistan-linked content from the digital platform.

Many of these accounts were those of credible Indian news publications like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat ,The Wire and journalists like Anuradha Bhasin, which has drawn criticism from press freedom activists. It is unclear at the moment if the Chinese and Turkish news accounts are part of the 8,000 accounts mentioned above. 

Both China and Turkey are allies of Pakistan. 

During last week's exchanges of fire, Turkey criticized India for its ""provocative steps"" and ""attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure."" 

Beijing has offered to mediate the tensions, but has also called Pakistan its ""all-weather partner"" and said bilateral ties were ""ironclad.""  

China, which also administers a small part of Kashmir is an economic and territorial rival of India.

As of Wednesday, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcast and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has yet to comment on the withheld accounts.

Pope Leo XIV was gifted a tennis racket by world number one player Jannik Sinner on Wednesday. Sinner offered to volley with the pontiff, who declined saying, ""we might break something."" 

Beyond the buzz around newly-elected Pope Leo XIV's possible course for the Catholic Church moving forward and the novelty of his being an American (native to both north and south), the pontiff is getting a lot of attention for being a sports fan.

On Monday, Leo asked a pilgrim requesting he sign a baseball, ""White Sox or Cubs?"" before signing his autograph — the pope, a native of Chicago's south side, is a life-long Sox fan.

On Wednesday, Pope Leo received a visit and presents from Jannik Sinner, the world's number-one ranked tennis player, who had a day off from play at the current Italian Open.

Pope Leo XIV is known to be an avid tennis player who follows the sport closely. During his Vatican visit, Sinner gifted the religious leader a racket as well as extended an invitation to hit a few balls together.

Leo declined Sinner's invitation to volley, saying with a laugh, ""We'll break something. Best not to.""

Referring to the All England Club's all-white dress code, the pontiff pointed to his own cassock while holding the racket, quipping, ""They would let me into Wimbledon like this.""

Earlier this week, the pope said he would be open to playing a charity match ""as long as they don't bring Sinner,"" making light of the English-language meaning of the name.

Sinner was said to have responded ""Are you trying to get me into trouble?"" to news of the possibility of playing the pope.

The top-ranked player was accompanied Wednesday by his family and Italian Tennis Federation President Angelo Binaghi. He posed for photos with the new pontiff in front of the Davis Cup, which Sinner and Binaghi brought along.

Sinner, who has just returned from a three-month doping ban for what was judged an accidental infraction, will face Casper Ruud in a Thursday Italian Open quarterfinal match in Rome on Thursday.

In a wide-ranging speech in the Bundestag, the German Chancellor outlined his new government's priorities, including a plan to revive Germany's struggling economy and transform it once again into a ""growth locomotive.""

Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, outlined his government's agenda to lawmakers in Germany's parliament, the Bundestag.

Elected in a historic second-round vote, he aims for swift action on growth, migration, and defense. 

He has also described his cabinet's lack of federal experience as a ""great opportunity"" for real change.

On foreign policy, Merz said that Germany wants the 'greatest possible' US-European unity on Ukraine.

The chancellor added that Germany aims to have the 'strongest conventional army' in Europe. 

This blog is now closed, thank you for reading. Below is a roundup of stories from Germany on Wednesday, May 14:

Four Berlin residents facing deportation from Germany for taking part in a pro-Palestinian protest have won a reprieve — for now.

Berlin's administrative court ruled in favor of all four plaintiffs, preventing their removal from the country until their appeals have been heard. 

The four demonstrators — two from Ireland, one from Poland and one from the United States — were served orders last month, instructing them to leave Germany by April 21 or be deported.

The Immigration Office said the deportation orders were related to a pro-Palestinian protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. It claimed the four posed a threat to Germany's public safety.

They are accused of criminal acts such as resisting arrest, property damage and disturbing the peace. None of them have been convicted.

In a written statement, the court said that after reviewing the case there were ""serious doubts about the substantive legality of the measures"" taken by the immigration authorities. 

The activists have accused Germany of ""weaponizing migration law.""

Criminal and immigration lawyer Alexander Gorski said it is a big victory for his clients

""The court has ruled that the migration authorities acted unlawfully. It's a big win given the erosion of rights in this country. This verdict shows how weak the reasoning of the migration office was,"" he told DW. 

Police investigations are still ongoing. 

German newspaper Tagesspiegel reported that Benjamin Jendro, a spokesperson for the Berlin police union, called the court's decision on Monday ""annoying, but acceptable in a constitutional state.""

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to enter negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.

""Ukraine has shown every willingness to conduct ceasefire and peace negotiations without preconditions,"" he said while speaking in the German parliament, known as the Bundestag.

""We now expect Mr Putin to come to the negotiating table,"" he said.

""Everyone who wants peace in Europe must negotiate now, and the ball is in Mr Putin's court,"" Wadephul stressed.

The comments come a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he would attend talks on the war in Ukrainein Turkey if Putin was also present.

Moscow has not yet specified who will be part of a Russian delegation to be sent to the talks.

The negotiations are scheduled to be held on Thursday in Turkey's most populous city, Istanbul.

Meanwhile, Germany's foreign ministry said Wadephul, will participate in an informal NATO meeting with his counterparts in Turkey on Thursday and will meet his US counterpart Marco Rubio for bilateral talks.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier reiterated Berlin's call for the release of hostages taken into Gaza during the Hamas militant group's October 7, 2023, attack.

""Their fate is an open wound,"" Steinmeier said of hostages still being held in the Gaza Strip.

""Germany will not forget them, I will not forget them. Our voice will not be silent as long as they have not returned.""

Steinmeier also noted the suffering of the civilian population of Gaza. The Palestinian enclave has been blockaded by Israel for over two months.

Israel announced it would widen its military offensive in Gaza earlier this month.

Since the 2023 terror attack on Israel more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza.

Germany's president made the comments while speaking alongside Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog during a visit to Kibbutz Be'eri, which lies some 4 kilometers (nearly 2.5 miles) from the Gaza Strip.

Over 50 people were abducted from the kibbutz on October 7 and 130 were killed.

In total, over 1,200 people, including around 800 civilians, were killed in the attack, and around 240 were taken hostage.

Some 58 hostages remain held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

Six people from Kibbutz Be'eri are thought to be among the dead.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including Germany, the United States and Israel.

Germany's socialist Left Party criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz over what it described as ""cold"" social welfare policies.

The Left's leader in parliament, Sören Pellman, accused Merz of ""remaining silent on the social crisis in this country.""

Pellman said that people in Germany want ""a government that deals with people's real problems.""

He called for Germany to raise monthly pension payouts from 48% to 53% of the average monthly salary and for the establishment of a minimum pension of €1,400 (around $1,570).

He welcomed a plan presented by Labor Minister Bärbel Bas to include the self-employed and civil servants in the state pension system.

Bas is a member of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are the junior member in Merz's governing coalition.

Pellman also called for a new social housing program as well as for a fund to improve living conditions in states in former East Germany.

Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Dröge wished the new government success while accusing the new chancellor, conservative Friedrich Merz, of multiple failures.

Dröge said she wanted to be optimistic: ""Because this country deserves it.""

However, she accused Merz and his conservatives of making false election campaign claims after it abandoned a commitment to not tap into extra borrowing.

Dröge also recalled the joint vote between the conservative CDU-CSU parliamentary group and the far-right AfD on the issue of migration after Merz said he would not work with the party.

""You have broken your word here in the German Bundestag,"" Dröge said.  Merz has often polarized Germans, Dröge added, saying he had stirred up sentiment against minorities.

""I expect you to be the chancellor of all people in this country. A chancellor, in particular, must be there for all people, especially for the weakest in this country. And that is how we will measure you.""

Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel has derided Chancellor Friedrich Merz's as a ""second choice chancellor"" in the Bundestag, referring to when he suffered a historicdefeat in a first round of voting in parliament his failed first round of elections last Tuesday. 

Addressing Merz, she said: ""You will never get rid of this stigma,"" she added, criticizing the debt package for defense and infrastructure, which was passed with majorities in the old Bundestag.

Weidel also criticized the new federal government's migration policy as inadequate and ineffective. The tightened border controls ordered in recent weeks must be continued ""completely and permanently,"" Weidel said after Merz's government statement. 

""Illegal immigration to Germany and into the German social systems must be reduced to zero,"" Weidel continued.

Rejections announced by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt should be ""only a first step"" toward this, Weidel emphasized.

Furthermore, ""migration magnets"" must be eliminated, the AfD leader demanded, citing the promise of benefits and family reunification.

Weidel accused Merz of being unable to implement his election promises of more repatriations because he was in coalition with the center-left Social Democrats and had submitted to dogma prohibiting mainstream parties from working with the AfD.

The AfD leader said a recently completed report by German domestic intelligence that classified her party as ""right-wing extremist"" was ""arbitrarily and abusively cements this dogma.""

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged a tough new migration policy, citing years of uncontrolled immigration and weak labor market integration.

Germany, he said, would remain a country of immigration but with more control, rejections, and returns.

""We have allowed too much uncontrolled immigration, and have enabled too little qualified migration into our labor market — and especially into our social security systems.""

Plans include stricter border enforcement, ending certain admissions, and launching a return initiative to countries like Syria and Afghanistan.

At the same time, integration would be supported — especially for well-integrated individuals.

Merz said his government would ""make it a priority to ensure that people who remain in Germany can enter the labor market as quickly as possible.""

""For well-integrated individuals with tolerated status, who support themselves and speak German, we will create a right to remain.""

""Our new migration policy is a sign of responsibility — clear, fair, and oriented toward the welfare of our country.""

Merz said his new government would stand by Germany's and Europe's climate goals, but that it would adopt new pragmatic approaches.

The central instrument, he said, would be carbon pricing — a market-based monetary cost is applied to greenhouse gas emissions.

However, he said, the revenues from this would not disappear into the federal budget, but be returned directly to businesses and citizens.

""Moreover, we will align our energy policy systematically with affordability, cost-efficiency, and security of supply —  pragmatically, free of ideology, and open to all technologies.""

""As a first step, we are cutting electricity taxes. That will bring noticeable relief to everyone—in the short term.""

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has unveiled a sweeping economic recovery package, declaring that Germany must overcome an ""unprecedented"" recession by removing barriers to growth.

""We will do everything we can to put Germany's economy back on a growth path — by investing and reforming. The two go hand in hand.""

""We can once again become a locomotive of growth — one that the world looks upon with admiration.""

Merz outlined several core measures:

He also pledged to repeal the controversial supply chain due diligence law and simplify regulations across sectors. ""Let's give businesses and workers more trust, more freedom, and less bureaucracy,"" Merz said.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz outlined a whirlwind of diplomatic activity in his first week in office aimed at reasserting Germany's leadership role on the global stage.

He began with a reset in Franco-German relations through talks with President Macron, followed by a symbolic first-day visit to Warsaw.

In Brussels, he pledged to end Germany's habit of abstaining on key EU decisions. 

Merz also made a high-profile joint visit to Kyiv alongside leaders from France, the UK, and Poland, signaling unwavering support for Ukraine.

On transatlantic ties, he emphasized close coordination with the US and revealed talks with US President Donald Trump about halting hostilities in Ukraine.

Reaffirming Germany's commitment to NATO, Merz stated: ""We must be able to defend ourselves so that we don't have to. Strength deters aggressors. Weakness invites them.""

Merz has been emphatic in framing Russia's war in Ukraine as a direct threat to European peace.

""This terrible war and its outcome will not only determine the fate of Ukraine. Its outcome will determine whether law and justice continue to apply in Europe and the world — or whether tyranny, military violence, and the naked law of the strongest will prevail.""

""What is at stake in Ukraine is nothing less than the peace order of our entire continent.""

Germany, he said, would reassert its leadership role in Europe, rebuild trust with partners, and back Ukraine unambiguously.

""We are not a party to the war, and we do not intend to become one. But we are also not disinterested third parties or neutral mediators between the fronts. There must be no doubt where we stand: unambiguously on the side of Ukrainians.""

Promising the Bundeswehr would become ""the strongest conventional army in Europe,"" Merz pledged sustained investment and a new voluntary national service.

""This is appropriate for the most populous and economically strongest country in Europe. That is what our friends and partners expect of us — indeed, they are explicitly demanding it.""

Merz has paid tribute to his predecessor Olaf Scholz for his response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Scholz has been praised for announcing a shift in Germany's approach to its military, boosting defense spending and ending reliance on Russian energy. He later became a key supporter of Ukraine through arms, aid, and EU unity.

Merz addressed Scholz personally: ""Your response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine was pioneering — and historic. For that, you have the thanks and recognition of this House and our entire country.""

Making his first official address to the Bundestag as Chancellor, Friedrich Merz is laying out an agenda calling for reform, national renewal, and assertive international leadership.

The coalition, he says, will govern under the banner of ""Responsibility for Germany.""

""We place ourselves jointly in the service of our country and all 84 million of its citizens,"" said Merz.

""We want to govern in order to move our country forward again under its own power.""

Merz's message is likely to echo the coalition blueprint. Here's what he's likely to touch on.

He is likely to place a strong focus on Germany's competitiveness, citing overregulation, high costs, and weak infrastructure as contributing factors to the country's current recession.

Merz is anticipated to unveil reforms and investment plans aimed at restoring growth, cutting bureaucracy, boosting digitalization, and encouraging innovation.

On Ukraine, the chancellor is expected to reaffirm Germany's support and its commitment to Europe's liberal order—rejecting neutrality while stressing deterrence, defense spending, and transatlantic cooperation.

Merz may also advocate for balanced global partnerships, including with the US and China, alongside greater strategic autonomy for Europe.

In line with the coalition agreement, he is likely to outline a pragmatic climate approach that emphasizes affordability and favors incentives over penalties for emissions reductions.

He has signaled support for modernizing labor laws to provide greater flexibility for both employers and workers, as well as updating the welfare state to better reward employment and savings.

On migration, Merz is expected to emphasize stronger border controls and steps to promote faster and more effective integration, in keeping with campaign pledges.

Germany's new chancellor has described the fact that he and his 17 federal ministers have little experience in federal government as a ""great opportunity to truly change something in this country.""

Merz was speaking at an economic conference of his conservative Christian Democrats on Tuesday evening.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius from the previous center-left government is the only cabinet member who previously served in Germany's federal government.

While Merz was elected Chancellor on May 6th, it took a second round of voting to get him across the line — something that hasn't been necessary in Germany's postwar political history. 

After the bumpy start, Merz is hoping for a speedy implementation of the government's plans for key areas like growth, migration, defense. 

He is likely to stay within the framework of the coalition agreement, but will also likely set some new priorities.

After Merz outlines his policy program in his first statement to Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, his ministers will present their plans to lawmakers one by one until Friday.

Connecticut activists are making big gains in their campaign against the airlines ICE is using to abduct people.

Connecticut activists are making big gains in their campaign against the airlines ICE is using to abduct people.

The Connecticut legislature has advanced two actions actively targeting Avelo Airlines, a previously little-known private airline that's taken the mantle of the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda by flying deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security.

In early May, the state's legislature advanced a bill that bans companies engaged in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights from business with state agencies, and dramatically and purposely did not extend a seemingly insignificant (but actually consequential) fuel tax exemption, all of which impact one company most significantly: Avelo Airlines. 

As of May 12, the company is the only known commercial airline contracting with ICE to carry out deportation flights — including those carrying U.S. citizens and green card holders. Avelo is already under financial pressure, even though it has already signed for this tainted contract and money, it's also still desperately trying to raise $100 million to stay afloat, meaning these additional local-level blowbacks will have real financial consequences. 

If the bill passes, it could jeopardize Avelo's contracts with institutions like the University of Connecticut, which includes a partnership for their athletics department: tickets for travel, partnerships for events and branding at UConn stadiums. Meanwhile, the loss of the fuel tax exemption will cost the company. But it doesn't stop there — Connecticut's attorney general has also threatened investigations.

These pointed actions follow weeks of organizing by students, workers, and other community members, joined by local politicians and even the president of the State Senate. The protests are rooted in a singular concern: Connecticut taxpayers shouldn't subsidize government-sanctioned kidnapping.

These voices don't stop in the Nutmeg State. Protesters are active in over a dozen cities across the country, and these protests are why local politicians and Avelo customers are responding. For instance, Avelo enjoys a fuel tax break in Delaware up for renewal this year, and even though Avelo is the only commercial airline in the state, the governor has said he's looking for alternatives specifically because of Avelo's contracting for deportation flights following local pressure. 

The company also enjoys local subsidies in places like Scranton, Pennsylvania; Lakeland, Florida; and even the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Avelo has also partnered with universities around the country, like Yale and Quinnipiac, with arrangements that vary but are similar to the UConn collaboration — all while receiving incentives and tourism funds from places like Salt Lake City, Utah, and Salem, Oregon. Community members and their representatives are now taking stock and asking: Are our tax dollars helping deport people — sometimes without court hearings — even in defiance of federal court orders?

The financial blows could keep coming, because Avelo already has tough competition. Tens of thousands have signed petitions and pledges committing to boycott Avelo. The airline flies out of over 50 destinations around the country, but many passengers are looking at other companies that fly similar routes but have chosen not to profit off of abduction and the morally and legally corrupt work of aiding ICE. 

The reasons for these boycotts and protests are obvious: the abuse of taxpayer dollars; avoidance of the law; and notably, the experience of these flights themselves. A ProPublica report revealed horrifying conditions on prior Avelo deportation flights. Detainees are shackled for hours. There's little to no training for staff. The operations are cloaked in secrecy.

The airline's flight attendants are speaking out because of concerns around passenger health and safety. These barely trackable routes operate in the shadows — removing people to send them to countries they aren't even from, sometimes without notifying families or lawyers.

When pressed, Avelo has said it took the ICE contract to save the company and protect jobs. But that justification rings hollow when the result is tearing families apart and potentially harming legal residents, all while placing the company's own workers in traumatizing conditions. 

Now, concerned people across the country are making it clear: Choosing to enable ICE and profiting off of abductions doesn't save your business — it might sink it. Protests are growing, and this is no fringe movement. It includes students, retirees, faith communities, politicians and aviation workers. Groups like the national network Defend and Recruit, the Coalition to Stop Avelo, and many local immigrant rights and broader social justice groups around the country are organizing local and national actions to expand the movement, too.

These are unprecedented times. But the reason we're seeing responses from state legislatures is due to bottom-up pressure. This mirrors what I've seen work in my decades in community and worker organizing fighting exploitative companies. I've seen contracts dropped and policy changes from massive multinational corporations and small local companies that abuse workers and exploit immigrants because local people organized, and it's especially possible when the company is already so vulnerable. 

We know these actions can work, but if we want to stop Avelo, we need more of them, in more places, and at more of the points that help the company stay solvent. It's not just about ticket sales — it's also about schools, jobs, taxes and tourism. Strategic actions, like these protests in key locations impact a company's ability to make money and raise funds. We've stopped immoral corporations before, thanks to combinations of local outrage and protests, as well as efforts to pressure local governments and key institutions like universities to cut off ties, end subsidies and demand more from these companies. And that means we can do it again.  

We already know Avelo isn't the only airline option. And its complicity in the Trump administration's deportation agenda means public dollars are propping up likely illegal ICE actions. To respond to this increasingly horrific and immoral immigration system, we need to identify every choke point. That includes setting up ICE watch groups, educating our communities on their rights, ensuring workplaces and institutions are prepared to protect the Fourth Amendment — and targeting corporations profiting from this cruelty.

Avelo recently issued a statement saying, “When our country calls and requests assistance our practice is to say yes.” But we are the country. And we say no. Let's show them what we refuse to accept.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Che Johnson-Long: Hi.

KH: How are you doing today, friend?

CJL: I feel surprisingly hopeful. I feel really grateful for spring in Atlanta, and I feel like I could use a 27-hour nap.

KH: A 27-hour nap sounds amazing. I think I want one of those, too. These are busy times, and I think many of us could use a nap. 

I know this is an especially hectic time for you, as someone that people look to for advice around safety and security — which are really widespread concerns right now. But before we get into a deep dive about what's unfolding right now, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your work?

CJL: Yeah, my name is Che Johnson-Long. My pronouns are she/her. I am an abolitionist organizer. I am a somatics practitioner, and I'm a community safety and security practitioner and trainer. I run the programmatic offerings of Vision Change Win's community safety work, which means that I support left movement groups through navigating safety threats, threats that can include threats from the state, police, law enforcement, the right, and sometimes even safety threats from within our communities. I train groups, I offer rapid response support. I also run a Security School that's a 10-month training program for community organizing groups.

Yeah, what else to say? I am a sci-fi nerd. I believe strongly that sugar does not belong on grits and I'm willing to debate that. Yeah, I think that's me.

KH: Well, we love sci-fi nerds around here, and I don't have a strong position around grits.

CJL: The podcast is done.

KH: Yeah, I think that about covers it. 

[Laughter]

But just to briefly address safety, since I have you here… in your role as someone who helps groups and organizations operate as safely as they can, what kind of threats and concerns are you seeing and hearing about right now? What are folks who are concerned for their safety grappling with?

CJL: Yeah, there's a ton of emerging threats to organizations, to individuals and to dissent in general. I say emerging because some of these threats are not new to this political moment, but they've either ramped up or they have been accompanied by so many new threats that they can feel new. Namely, I think there's just been a huge uptick in the right wing targeting left movement groups who support a free and liberated Palestine, Black-led groups and trans-led groups. There's been a number of right-wing think tanks who have put out reports quite literally naming these groups and putting a target on them.

We're seeing repression at the federal level with H.R. 9495, which is a bill that the second part of which would allow for the Treasury Secretary and the President to basically claim that a non-profit is “a terrorist supporting organization,” and that claim could then remove that group's 501(c)(3) tax status. I think threats like H.R. 9495 are important for us to track because I think they point to an emerging trend of creating new ways for the government to label an organization as a terrorist group or supporting terrorism. That's really scary because they could very, very immediately change a group's tax status, make it really difficult for them to receive grants [and] have staff.

I think there's also a lot of threats to groups who are doing any kind of mutual aid or collective care work. We've been seeing a lot of financial deplatforming happening. Namely this is happening with bail fund groups, but it's not exclusive to bail funds. We're seeing groups who receive donations through PayPal or other financial institutions get a notice from PayPal or other banks saying that they simply won't house their money. And in some cases, those groups are also then seeing their funds frozen, which then makes it really difficult for groups to continue doing their work.

And especially for bail funds, I think it's especially scary because these groups rely on many small donations to get people out of jail. And the existence of bail funds, I think is part of a political ecosystem that allows people to feel more confident about showing up to protests, knowing that if there are arrests and if they happen to be one of those people arrested, that there's an organized group of people whose role it is to get them out of jail. And so without those bail funds, I imagine that it would chill a lot of the protests and mass protests that we're seeing.

There are threats to individuals. I don't have to say that ICE has been incredibly terrifying. The ICE raids that we're seeing in Atlanta and Chicago, in New York City, in many places have been overwhelming to all sorts of left movement groups, but especially groups that focus on immigrant rights.

In addition to these ICE raids, in Atlanta and a lot of other places that are fighting against cop cities, we're seeing increased police targeting. I was just talking to someone the other day who had a story that I hear repeated in many other stories, which is essentially, I was driving, I got pulled over. The cop asked me a few questions, maybe saw a stack of flyers in my backseat or saw a bumper sticker or saw something that indicated involvement or support for the movement to Stop Cop City, and then asked for my phone and presumably went through my phone and then handed it back and let me go. And I think those kinds of stories are us starting to notice and pick up on police targeting.

And then I think the last thing is just a general threat to anyone who's dissenting. We see this all over the place, whether it's that recent Greenpeace lawsuit, they lost a suit against a big oil company called Energy Transfer, and the suit is what's known as a SLAPP suit. It stands for “strategic lawsuits against public participation.” And these suits are basically meant to discourage folks from protesting and groups from organizing protests. They're meant to drag on and on and on, they're meant to be very costly. And right now, Greenpeace, because of this loss, might owe over $600 million in damages.

These suits are frivolous, they're absurd. Many courts have already said that they are illegal. I think over 35 states have anti-SLAPP laws that are basically meant to prevent these kinds of frivolous suits, but unfortunately, those anti-SLAPP laws aren't everywhere. And so suits like this are meant to, of course, end organizations like Greenpeace. And I think it should be noted that even though Greenpeace is the organization targeted, Greenpeace is not the organization who mainly led a lot of the organizing against the pipeline, the DAPL pipeline. And so I imagine that these suits will continue and are meant to eventually create enough intimidation that organizations distance themselves from protests.

I think Greenpeace is a good example because they tried everything. Before the SLAPP suit, they tried a RICO federal suit and it failed. And so I just think that we're in a political moment right now where dissent is very quickly being criminalized and the state is trying every possible avenue to criminalize that it can. I think we'll see more of these kind of meritless RICO suits in the future. I think we'll see more of these SLAPP suits in the future that are just meant to tie up groups in the court system for a long time or be very costly for groups.

KH: I'm glad you brought up the situation with Greenpeace because I don't think this is on a lot of people's radar, or that folks necessarily understand how this outcome might affect grassroots work. The idea that telling the truth about a pipeline project, or using messaging that defends a marginalized community, or holding direct action workshops, can lead to a $660 million judgement has chilling implications for grassroots organizers because grassroots folks do all of the things Greenpeace was targeted for, in this case, but don't have the kind of money Greenpeace has had to wage a defense. That case is going to move through the appeals process, but given the right-wing capture of the Supreme Court, it's a very daunting situation.

Which kind of describes what we're up against in general — it's a very daunting situation. So, in your experience, how are people adapting as our political climate becomes more overtly fascistic?

CJL: It's a scary time. It is a scary time, and I think that people are responding like it's a scary time. And so the question for everyone right now is how do you “do fear?”

I had this somatic coach years ago, she was wonderful and she was kind of a hard ass. And so one thing that she said to me that really stuck with me was, we were talking about bravery and what actually creates bravery in someone. And she said to me, “Bravery is not when someone doesn't feel fear in the midst of a scary thing happening. Bravery is when someone feels fear, really actually embodied feeling of fear, and then continues to move through it and continues to take an action that leads to more liberation, more freedom.” And then she proceeded to give me a bunch of homework about practicing more embodied fear, because at the time, I was someone who really loved to disassociate from fear and just kind of check out from it.

And so I say all this to say that I think we're seeing a lot of folks adapt to this political moment by choosing to feel fear and to move through it together anyways. And I think that is incredibly brave and I feel really inspired by all of these examples of bravery.

I don't mean to shout y'all out too much, but I feel very much a fan girl of the organizers of Chicago right now. Y'all are holding down some incredible organizing work when it comes to dealing with the ICE raids in your city. I think that it's probably the result of a lot of beautiful coordination and years of coalition work, but it's inspired me.

I think about… there was a House hearing last year on antisemitism in schools, and the hearing was really meant to target schools who allowed for folks to publicly speak in support of a free and liberated Palestine. And it inspired me because it was all these public schools from New York City and Berkeley, California and Maryland I think, and these public school teachers, they were steadfast. They were clear about their allegiances to a free and liberated Palestine, to addressing actual antisemitism in their schools and to remaining anti-Zionists. And I just feel like that kind of bravery is what we need. And I think it has led to a lot of other public schools creating space for people to talk about their work and to talk about not just Palestine, but supporting trans folks, being in solidarity with the Black Liberation movement, with the movement for abolition.

And at the same time, I do think that some people are adapting to our political moment by avoiding fear, which I get it. I have a lot of empathy for the desire to not want to feel the immense, sometimes overwhelming fear, but I think that avoiding fear means avoiding the news. It means sometimes avoiding the movement. I think avoiding fear in this moment can often be the thing that leads to isolation, that leads to people saying things like, Oh, I'm going to sit this one out. And unfortunately, I think that this moment is very critical and we actually just need all of us inside of our left movement. We need stronger base building strategies so that there are more of us.

And so part of my work as a community safety and security practitioner is also about offering tools for people to feel and move through fear so that we can continue to keep more of us in this fight.

KH: Well, I appreciate the Chicago shout out. We are very proud of the work that's happening here, and I hope more people will join those efforts. 

I also want to say that I really relate to what you were saying about the distinction between not feeling something, and really feeling it, and allowing yourself to move through it. I am thinking about how, when I was younger, I did not have a healthy relationship with fear. In my early and mid-twenties especially, but for many years, I was not afraid in situations when I should have been. Trauma had really turned all of that off in me, which was helpful in some situations, and deeply unhelpful in others, because I took a lot of unnecessary risks in my life. In organizing, when I started to find myself in a position where other people took my actions and choices seriously, and might follow along, and do what I was doing, I had to reevaluate my actions. I had to think about what risks I was willing to create for other people. And in that way, I think my regard for other people helped me make better and more grounded decisions for myself, as well, because I started thinking about what would happen to us, instead of just disregarding what would happen to me.

As I have gotten a little older and a little more in touch with my mortality, and also done a lot of healing, I no longer have the problem of not being afraid when I ought to be. Now, I am thoroughly afraid of many things that I think it's really normal and healthy to be afraid of. And I am okay with that. I don't actually like that refrain from Dune that some people are fond of, about how “fear is the mindkiller,” because as someone who lacked fear when I should have had it, I know it has the power to keep me safe. I know fear can be like pain — sometimes it's just warning us that there's a problem, and we need to stop something, attend to something, or do something differently. But like pain, fear can become excessive, and it can take over our lives. At that point, it needs to be managed. I think we're at our weakest when we are ruled by our fears and resentments. So, for me, it's about not letting my fear govern me. 

Because I think our fears, as you said, have the potential to immobilize us, and also the potential to compromise our values, if we allow that. So, much like grief, I think it's important that we not hide from fear. We need to own it, discuss it, and talk about what's grounded in something immediate, that needs to be attended to, and what's probably not as pressing right now, even though it's coming from a real place — and what we can and can't do about these things.

I think one of the greatest dangers we face right now comes from fear and what it will bring out in us. I think the impulse to hunker down and to try to protect ourselves is a real one, and that it leads to people acting outside their values, abandoning people and breaking solidarity. And those actions are what really make the ugliest outcomes we're afraid of more likely to happen in the long run. 

CJL: Yes, I just want to say, now is the time to be bold and audacious. And I understand that move towards wanting to hide or be small, I have a lot of empathy for it. I think all of us have lots of practice of doing that in our lives, and this is not the time for small. This is the time for big, this is the time for actually more audacious campaign tactics and strategies and coalitions than what we've seen in the past.

KH: Thank you for that. I completely agree. And I think that to help people move through their fears, we need to give people tools, so they feel empowered to create as much safety as they can and reduce some of the harm and risks they and their communities might face. I know that's what you're doing in your work, and I have such a profound appreciation for that.

Can you talk a bit about what safety planning might look like for different groups and individuals right now? What kind of scenarios should people be looking at and how can we have these conversations without throwing ourselves into panic mode? 

CJL: What a great question. I think it's important for us to start with examining what is panic mode? How does panic mode happen? So I'm going to start by talking about what safety planning is not. We all have different ways that we respond to pressure or to safety threats. We all have ways that we have navigated or survived harm as individuals, and maybe that way has been to hide or to run away or to fight your way out. Maybe that way has been to negotiate or to appease. And I think that those ways are really smart. I think that those ways have saved us, and in some cases have been the reason that many of us are still alive.

And so while I have a lot of gratitude for these ways that we each individually have dealt with and moved through harm, trauma, abuse, violence, pressure, these ways, and sometimes people might refer to these as trauma responses, these trauma responses are not very adaptive. They're kind of one-trick ponies. And they do not know how to read a calendar or a clock. And so they're often responding in a present moment as if it were the past, as if it were that time where you got out or that time where you survived that thing. And so they'll look at a current pressure or a current safety threat in 2025 and they'll respond as if it's 2009 or 1988 or 2023. And because they don't read a clock or they don't understand time very well, they can sometimes misread what's needed in a moment. And so I think it's important for us to just start by saying that it's often from this place if we allow for our trauma responses to lead us and if we allow for them to be the only tools in our toolbox, that is what can create panic mode.

And so in order to understand this political moment and to not safety plan from our trauma responses or go immediately into panic mode, I think we also have to be able to look at what's happening in our political landscape and understand some of the intention behind what the right is doing. I think namely the news is just a shit-show right now. There's this term “flooding the zone” that I hear everywhere, and I think this term is meant to refer to the news media being flooded with all sorts of scary things. Some of them are legitimate scary things that are actually happening and being implemented and some of them are just empty threats, but it's hard to tell the difference. And I think that the right means to overwhelm us with this tactic. I think the right means to activate our trauma responses and send us into a frenzy by overwhelming us.

And so one of the ways that we can push back against that frenzy and create safety plans for a more grounded place is through what we call a risk assessment. And a risk assessment is just a fancy way of saying, how can we ground our safety planning in what's likely and what will likely make a big impact on us? So a risk assessment is looking to answer those two questions. What is likely to happen to me or to happen to my organization in our part of the world given our identities and our work? And then what might make a big impact on us being able to do what we do?

Risk assessments can happen in a lot of ways, but I like to start by just thinking about it as a research project. When we're looking at this question of what's likely, we can often start by looking at the national level, understanding what sorts of threats are we hearing about often in national news media, what threats are we hearing about repeatedly across regions? I think understanding what's trending at the national level can help us to sometimes predict safety threats that might be happening at a different region of this country, but eventually it might make its way to us. I think that the national level gives us a little bit of a predictive sense or even just a sense of what are people talking about?

But I don't think it's smart to stop there, because in Atlanta, the political conditions here are very different than they are in Milwaukee, than they are in Miami, than they are in Durham. And so then I want to go and talk to coalition partners. I want to talk to the people in Atlanta who are out in the streets often, who do a lot of base building often, and I want to ask them about threats that I'm concerned about.

So for example, a few summers ago we had a really beautiful summer of action in the movement to Stop Cop City and the summer was filled with a lot of barbecues and just protests in Southwest Atlanta and more activity in parts of Atlanta that don't often see protests and barbecues and Stop Cop City-related stuff. And so as we were planning all these events, we were hearing rumors about cops showing up to different events and disrupting, and so we wanted to get a sense of is this a likely threat for our events coming up?

And so using this kind of risk assessment tool, we started by looking at the national level. Of course, the movement to Stop Cop Cities started in Atlanta, but it's national now because unfortunately Cop Cities are starting to be built in many states, and so we talked to a lot of partners in other states to get a sense of how their week of actions had gone. And they said, yeah, actually it's interesting because the cops are showing up more to our fliered events that say things like family friendly that are hosted in parks than they are to our big protests. And we thought that was really strange, and so we said, okay, that's good information for us to have.

Then we went around and talked to people in Atlanta, people who are part of the movement to Stop Cop City and people who are not. We talked to people who just throw barbecues, people in neighborhoods, people part of neighborhood planning units, to get a sense of what police presence was like at their events. We talked to folks who are intentionally not a part of our movement who maybe have political disagreement with us. And we talked to them because they know our communities well. And so for us, it's important that we build coalition across different kinds of groups and especially groups who have a strong understanding of the neighborhood, knowing that we don't have to have perfect political alignment with some groups in order to build safety together.

So as we talked to some of these groups, they said, no, we haven't seen increased police presence, but we have heard about police presence increasing at these parks specifically, so you should check out those places. We followed that line of questioning, always being sure to be clear with people that we are looking into an unverified threat. We're worried about this thing, we don't know if it'll happen, and so we're curious about it, just to avoid that rumor mill or to avoid information getting away from us and then becoming misinformation.

And then lastly, I think a lot of groups who are older than five years old tend to do great organizing, but sometimes struggle with documenting state threats over time. And so what can happen in a lot of organizations is they experience sort of cycles or seasons of the same threats coming back around, but because they're not tracking those threats over time, it can feel like a brand new threat and so then safety planning starts all over again.

And so for us, the movement to Stop Cop City has been a part of and has sort of been fed by many different movements in Atlanta against police violence. And so we talked to police violence groups that predated our movement to get a sense of what it's looked like in the past in Atlanta when there's been a big campaign against police violence or against police spending. What happened? And talking to those kind of long-time organizers in Atlanta was really helpful, because then they were able to talk to us about seasonal trends that they saw. When a campaign in Atlanta picks up steam like the campaign to reclassify marijuana possession in (I think that was 2017), talking to them and getting a sense of what happened when your campaign became popular enough to get to the national level? How did cops respond to your events? Those organizers helped us to fill in some of the gaps and to answer that question, is this likely?

And the answer ended up being yes, it is likely. But in addition to answering that question, we also got a ton of advice we heard from people who said, when the cops showed up to our barbecue in 2012 or in 2017, here's what we did that did not work and you shouldn't do this again, and here's what we did that did work. And so we were able to pick up a number of tactics that we just didn't have to spend a lot of time planning or coming up with ourselves, and that was a really big gift.

The second part of a risk assessment is again, just asking yourself what's the impact that this safety threat might have on our work? For us, the impact was pretty big because we were looking to have these events in a part of Atlanta that hadn't seen a lot of Stop Cop City events in the past few years, and we didn't want to scare people off in neighborhoods that maybe had a lot of people showing up to these events for the first time. And so it really informed how we did safety for these events, the ways that we navigated the cops and the ways that we were able to create a buffer for folks who might've been newer to our events.

A risk assessment is important to do because again, it just helps you to ground what is likely. There are so many safety threats in the news, there are so many safety threats that we hear about constantly, they're not all likely. And they might be likely for Atlanta folks, but they're not likely for folks in Milwaukee. Or they might be likely for a certain kind of organizing group and not for another. And we just don't have time or resources to waste developing safety plans for things that aren't likely to happen. And so again, just grounding in that risk assessment allows for us to really focus our energy on what we think is most likely to happen.

KH: I really appreciate the process you described around determining what is likely, because my work requires me to consume so much bad news, and so many horror stories, that my imagination is all over the place — and I think that's something a lot of people can relate to, right now. It's so easy to be haunted, or to just feel overtaken by nightmare scenarios. Our fears can seize upon our psyches in ways that can distort our sense of what's imminent or likely, and requires immediate action, what's possible, and may require long-term action, and what's probably not going to happen. 

What are some baseline moves that individual activists can make to create more safety in their lives during this time?

CJL: Going back to that story about people in Atlanta being pulled over and then the cop asking for them to turn over their phone – many of those pullovers were for all sorts of different excuses and the state will find lots of excuses to target us. They will find the organizer with unpaid parking tickets, they will find the organizer who owes back taxes, they will find the folks with expired registration tags. And so one of the small ways that individuals can reduce their vulnerability to these sorts of safety threats is by figuring out where you can reduce your personal vulnerabilities.

This is going to be different for everybody. For some folks, it might mean actually paying those unpaid parking tickets because that might be the thing that gets somebody caught up. Or it might mean making sure that your tags are up to date. For some folks where that's possible, I think reducing those vulnerabilities actually protects our movement, but for other folks that might not be possible. And so I encourage folks to consider, is it paying my unpaid parking tickets or is it making sure that whenever I go to a protest, I text two friends to let them know when I'm leaving and when I'm coming back?

For some folks, it might mean not bringing your personal phone to the protest anymore, but instead bringing a low-data or a burner phone with fewer contacts and fewer sensitive information. For some folks it might be really upping their personal digital security. I can't tell you how many Signal threads I'm on, Signal groups I'm on and nobody has set their disappearing messages. And so all of our very sensitive information that we're communicating about on Signal is vulnerable because people are storing it for longer than it's needed. And so these are the kinds of personal practices that can not just protect individual people, but that can also prevent really sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.

I think it's also important that folks do their own work to recognize and understand how your fear response might take over. I think that the fear response that we all hold is probably in a normal time, is maybe on 3, but for a lot of us it's on 10. And so what that can mean in a coalition meeting or in a planning meeting is that sometimes we can come with safety concerns and we'll come with these valid concerns, but we'll share them in a way that can actually feel like more of a fight.

For example, I'm in this group, coalition group, and right now the group is concerned about how we document stuff and the group wants to move a lot of our documentation off of Google Drive. And there's one person in the group who is very, very adamant about this, for valid reasons. There was another organization that's a part of a coalition of ours who was just subpoenaed and Google just turned over all their information. And so they have valid reasons for wanting this safety practice, but the way that they bring it to meetings is like a strong embodied fight. It's like, if we don't do this, then we're just asking for them to come for us. It's like that kind of vibe. And there are other folks in the group who I think probably have a strong appease in them. And so instead of picking a practice, they'll say, I just think we need to just agree, we need to figure out how to agree, without addressing the root issues.

And all of these different ways I think are coming from a lot of people's fear responses. And so I think the more that we can each kind of understand our fear response ground in a risk assessment and have empathy and love and care for other people's fear responses, the easier some of these conversations are going to be about safety practices, because they're not easy conversations to begin with, and so we really need to show up with our best selves.

The last thing I'll say is to just not isolate. Everyone needs to be in a group right now. Everyone. I don't care if it's a local mutual aid group, if it's a base building organization, if it's national, if it's your neighbors on your block, but we all need to be in a group. And if you can't find the group that's right for you, then start a group, because that's what allows for us to coordinate with each other better and to be able to consolidate power.

KH: I agree so much that we all need to be in a group right now, and I know some people don't love hearing that, but it's really true. We all need to find our people and fortify our relationships right now. The creation of safety begins with our willingness to look out for each other and to make plans about how we're going to show up for each other. There is no safety in isolation. We are at our most vulnerable when we are on our own. 

So, for people who have found their people, what are some actions that groups and organizations can take right now to create more safety for their members?

CJL: Every left movement organization needs to have some basic safety protocols right now. These protocols should include some of the most common safety threats that we're seeing, like what happens if ICE shows up to your organization? What happens if someone in your group goes missing or you don't hear from them for a while? And what happens if your group is targeted in a public way, meaning there's a social media post about your group or the group is talked about in some way that might draw attention to your group? Those are just three likely threats that a lot of groups are starting to plan around, but I encourage groups to first start by just going back to that risk assessment tool and getting critical about what are the likely threats for my organization given what we do, given who our opponents are, given our identities and our location.

I think once groups have that list of likely threats and they go through that risk assessment, then it's important to start building an inventory of what existing resources and skills do you have to address the threat. An inventory is also just a great way to build morale in an organization. I like to do inventories in fun ways, so I discourage people from sending out a very boring survey and encourage folks to get creative with how you get a sense of what you already have.

There was an organization recently that I worked with that was doing an inventory. They were looking to decrease their reliance on the state, and so they wanted to increase their medical knowledge so that there were fewer moments where they needed to call 911, because in their city calling 911 brought both an ambulance and the cops. And so there were all of these different skills that they wanted to inventory to get a sense of who knows how to do this, who's trained in CPR, who's trained in Stop the Bleed, et cetera. And they developed this highly competitive bingo game where every meeting that they had, they would have different skills on a bingo card. Have you been CPR trained and certified within the past six months? Have you been to a Stop the Bleed training? Have you facilitated a training around respiratory health?

And it was great. I think when groups can create those sorts of fun games or engagement, it's a friendly way to get folks thinking about the safety skills that exist in their crew, and it helps you to understand what do you have on deck and then what do you need. From there, just starting to go through each of those safety threats and developing a plan. How do we want to intervene in this threat? How do we want to prevent it? What skills might be needed in order to intervene well and do we have those skills?

I think when people are thinking through those questions around intervention, it'll often bring up training needs. They'll say, we really want to decrease the police presence in our block, but one barrier to that is us being able to deal with respiratory emergencies, people who have asthma, in a timely fashion. And so it will then naturally create, well, we need a training. And so figuring out where the training gaps are that would actually increase your group's skill. A big one right now is how do I read a legal warrant? I think every group should be in that kind of conversation.

Vision Change Win is one of many groups that's available to support some of those training gaps, namely around safety and security, but I also encourage folks to kind of think outside the box. I've been really pleased recently with the number of street medics in Atlanta who've been doing different kinds of trainings related to heat stroke and heat exposure that have really helped us to navigate some of the medical emergencies that show up during protests much faster than we would otherwise. There's also just a huge retired nurse and RN community inside of our left ecosystem here, and so it's been really fun to learn from elders here about different skills that have been really useful to deal with these emergencies during protests.

The last thing to consider when you're building these safety protocols is that training should happen regularly. So if you're building up a protocol, for example, around the cops showing up to your space with a warrant, you want to make sure that you have skill, someone knows how to read a legal warrant, how to recognize when a warrant isn't legal. You might want to identify the people in your group that would answer the door, maybe the people who would let folks know that the cops are here but it's being handled. But you might realize that as you're building up this practice, that oh, three of the people who knew how to read a legal warrant are about to be on maternity leave. And so having regular training can help you to identify when you might have gaps inside a plan.

Training is also a great place to evaluate. So a risk assessment can change, we can have risks that are likely in one month that are not likely the next month. And so as we're offering these regular trainings, it's also important to make sure we go back to our risk assessment at least once a year, but I would recommend more often than that, to make sure that the risks that we're planning around are still likely. Because as we all know, the political landscape is changing constantly, and so we just want to make sure that we're responding to the right threats.

I do think that this is a political moment where I want to encourage groups to resist the urge to plan last minute. I think it's very easy for us to say, we have to plan this last minute protest, we have to plan this last minute event, we have to respond to the moment. And I think the reality is that we are going to be in a rapid response moment for a while. And so figuring out where we can slow down also means being able to braid safety into the fabric of our work a bit more seamlessly so that safety isn't this last minute burden. When we're able to do that braiding well, when we're thinking about safety from the beginning of the protest plan and not in the last few days, I think that's when we see the most successful interventions and that's when we're able to do safety in a way that's also sustainable.

I think the last thing to say is, just like I think it's important for individuals to be in a group, I also think it's important for groups to find the coalitions that are right for them. Whether it's an alliance, a network, or just a partnership with one other group, I think that groups are stronger when they can communicate with other groups about safety threats. This is what allows us to predict safety threats and to intervene ahead of time. And so whatever that means for your organization, whether it means formalizing a sort of informal partnership you might have with a local group, or showing up more regularly to a coalition, or talking to a network who you're politically aligned with about sharing safety threats with each other, I think upping the rigor around working together is what's going to help groups to maintain safety over time.

KH: This is all such good advice. I really love what you said about last minute planning, and this is a mistake I've made in the past myself. When I look back at all of my organizing over the years, there are a couple of moments that really jump out at me when things went sideways, and if I am honest with myself, I knew in my gut, before doing the thing, that we didn't have enough time to plan and prepare the way we should have. I got swept up in the urgency of the thing, or in other people's arguments about why it had to happen right away, or maybe moved from a place of ego, thinking that we could handle it. And, you know, I learned by being humbled by my mistakes that we need to be thorough as fuck in our planning and in our preparations, and I think that's even more true now, because the stakes are so high.

I also really appreciate what you were saying about skill inventories and making plans about how you want to intervene. It made me think about the Chicago Teachers Union's Sanctuary Toolkit, and how teachers here are forming sanctuary teams, and taking on safety roles for scenarios when ICE might be trying to get into the building. This involves preparation, training, and probably some rehearsal, and that work makes everyone stronger and safer. CTU has also shared that toolkit publicly, and it can be adapted by teachers in other cities and states, and I hope folks will look at that, because learning from each other is so key right now. 

And on that note, we have a lot to learn from Vision Change Win (VCW). VCW's resources have been so important to me as an organizer. I refer back to the Get In Formation toolkit all the time. It's a resource that I mention to just about every group that I work with, because I think it's both essential reading, and an essential resource to keep handy. I've also gotten a lot out of the VCW workshops I've attended over the years. Can you talk a bit about the resources you all offer and about any upcoming workshops that folks might want to plug into?

CJL: Yeah, the Get In Formation Training Series (G.I.F.T.S.) is the first resource that I would recommend folks check out. It's a three part training series that happens every month until we abolish prisons and police, and it's on the second, third and fourth Wednesday of the month. We cover verbal de-escalation, safety values. We talk about building a safety team for an event or direct action and organizational safety planning. And then quarterly, we have a session on digital security.

I think G.I.F.T.S. is a great entry point. I think it is a great way to start to learn about community safety. You can complete it in one month or you can take one training every month for four months, so it's really kind of a choose your own adventure training series. We offer Spanish interpretation quarterly, and we also offer late night sessions quarterly. And we're about to launch recorded trainings.

The second offering is we run a 10-month Safety and Security School. It's a cohort style, we'll be in our sixth year this year. And the Security School is for anyone who wants to take a deeper dive into community safety work within their organization. I really love Security School, it's a big, big commitment, but I think that it allows for groups to really, really develop strong safety practices or update existing practices. The application for Security School will drop in May. Folks should check out our website to find out more about other offerings.

There's a risk assessment mini toolkit that I have found really helpful, especially when describing a risk assessment to a group who might not be familiar with that language. That's available on our website. And I think more than anything, I want to keep plugging our rapid response system. Rapid response is kind of our warm line, so not quite a hotline, but it is our offering to be able to support organizations in urgent or emergent needs. We have about a 24- to 48-hour turnaround time, you can request support from going on our website. And groups reach out to us for all kinds of safety and security crises through that rapid response system, but often once they've developed a plan for that crisis, we'll then move into a training program. And so whether you're navigating a safety threat right now and you just need help now or you're concerned about preventing a threat from impacting you, I encourage you to reach out because there's a little bit for everybody.

KH: VCW's Rapid Response system is such a gift to our movements. I have been so grateful to be able to send some folks y'all's way in moments when they were facing some very scary, very credible threats. It meant everything to me, honestly, when folks reached out with those nightmarish experiences to be able to point them toward people who I knew would give them practical advice, based on years of experience and analysis around how we address these things. I won't get into those people's stories, because they are not mine to tell, but I will say that when we face threats in the movement, sometimes the scariest possibilities involve our loved ones being at risk, and that can make us feel so helpless and powerless. To offer people practical guidance on how we can move from that sense of helplessness and powerlessness to doing whatever we can to create safety for ourselves and our loved ones, that's just beautiful and essential work, and we're all so lucky that VCW exists. Because that's the kind of help that's going to allow us to be as brave and strategic as we can in these times.

So, as we wrap things up, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?

CJL: There's so many opportunities to collectivize practices that keep us healthy and well, or healthy and safe, and I am consistently blown away by the creativity of people in my community and all the ways that we continue to move away from individualism and into collectivism. And so I'm sure there are folks who are listening who might have a special skill. I've been talking to a lot of parents recently about how they're navigating this moment. There's a really incredible parenting collective in Atlanta that meets weekly to talk about community safety, namely for protests, but it's expanded beyond protests to talk about safety in their neighborhood, safety against ICE raids, safety against cops. And that group just formed because someone wanted to go to a protest and just didn't feel like they had capacity to be at the protest and care for three kids. So they reached out to a friend and the friend reached out to another friend, and before they knew it, they had a collective who was getting trained weekly.

I have friends who have been really interested in really getting clear about where there's clean drinking water in our neighborhood and in our community in case there's an emergency, in case our water gets shut off and we need to find access to clean drinking water. I have friends who are mechanics who are really skilled at fixing cars, and they've been reaching out to community members to offer a free tune up and oil change for folks so that they're able to drive around safely. And so I just feel like no matter who you are or what you're good at, there is a way to make that an offer to movement, and I just encourage folks to get really creative about what that offering is. 

KH: Thank you so much for that. I love those examples, and I think this is a really important time for us to think expansively and creatively about what it means to create as much safety as we can. This is how we are going to move through these times effectively — by moving through our fears together, building skills, making plans, and having each other's backs. I want to thank you, Che, for helping us learn how to do that, and thank you so much for joining me and thinking alongside me today. Your insights and your knowledge are so deeply appreciated, and it's always good to talk to you.

CJL: Thank you. This is such an exciting opportunity, I'm such a fan of the podcast, so I am grateful to be here talking with you.

[musical interlude]

KH: Well, I am so grateful for Che and for Vision Change Win. Please remember to check the show notes of this episode for links to some of the resources we've discussed today. 

I know many of us are grappling with our fears in these uncertain times. When I think about what's at stake right now, I have a lot of fears, and I need to allow myself to feel them. I also need to do what I can to reduce risk and anchor myself and others, as much as possible, because I am not powerless. For me, moving through fear is a process that involves acknowledging what's beyond my control, and examining what choices I can still make to protect myself and others, while also trying to live my values. That last part is important, because our fears can sometimes pull us away from our values, and prompt us to abandon other people, or hunker down, in the hopes that we can ride the storm out in safety, if we only look out for ourselves. That kind of mentality is what our enemies are counting on. Individualism shreds our solidarity and leaves us isolated.

I encourage everyone who is frightened right now to create or join a space to discuss those feelings with others. You might find that sharing your feelings not only helps you cope, but also opens the door to constructive conversations about what we can do to address our fears together. 

Risk assessments and safety planning can empower us to create as much safety as we can in our lives and movements. Rather than becoming immobilized by fear, let's learn together and build skills that can help us meet the moment. Let's make space for what we're feeling and figure out how we can be constructive together. Solidarity means making every effort to protect each other, so let's figure out what that looks like in practice, for all of us. 

I want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

Three U.S. House committees from May 11 have advanced their portion of President Donald Trump's “big beautiful” government funding bill to carry out his MAGA agenda.

Since then, the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Agriculture Committee have each taken votes their respective budget bills.

The bills, which were passed in party-line votes, touch on loaded issues related to topics like Medicaid, tax policy, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. Republicans have a top-line goal of cutting spending by at least $1 trillion—though that's easier said than done.

The standalone bills will be combined by the Republican leadership into one mega-reconciliation bill, which could allow the GOP to bypass the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate.

“With today's committee meeting, relief is finally on the way for working families, waitresses, mechanics, nurses, farmers, and Americans all across this country who have been hammered by four years of [former President Joe] Biden's 21 percent inflation tax,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-Mo.) said in a statement before the markup hearing.

“The bill delivers what Americans voted for—tax policies that put working families first—and kickstarts a new golden era of American prosperity and strength.”

A core component of the legislation, which proposes cutting taxes by more than $4 trillion and reducing spending by $1.5 trillion over a decade, is permanently extending the lower income tax rates of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The tax plan raises the state and local tax deduction limit to $30,000 from $10,000 for households earning less than $400,000.

Democrats say the bill will be skewed toward wealthy Americans and worsen the federal government's fiscal position.

Under the bill, “a taxpayer who's making more than [$1 million] a year ... gets 310 times the average tax cut [that] taxpayers making less than $50,000 a year [get],” Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) said.

The proposal will reduce federal spending by $712 billion over 10 years, accounting for a large portion of the $880 billion in cumulative spending reductions through to 2034.

Republicans and Democrats painted vastly differing pictures of how the proposed changes to Medicaid would affect beneficiaries.

Republicans said the reforms are commonsense and necessary measures to extend the solvency of the $914 billion program by ensuring that only people entitled to receive Medicaid benefits are enrolled and receiving payments through the program.

Democrats said the changes would create barriers to enrollment and health care for low-income, disabled, and elderly people and would rob millions of low-income Americans of health coverage.

Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said: “This is not a moderate bill, and it is not focused on cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse.' Instead, Republicans are intentionally taking health care away from millions of Americans so they can give giant tax breaks to the ultra-rich who don't need them.”

Under the bill, able-bodied adults who do not have dependents would have to complete “community engagement requirements” to remain eligible for Medicaid. That will mean spending 80 or more hours per month—or an average of 20 hours a week—at work, receiving education, or in volunteer service.

Enrollees in the low-income program would also have to show they are keeping up with the eligibility requirements twice a year instead of annually.

The bill would also add a requirement for some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100 percent of the federal poverty level to pay certain out-of-pocket expenses.

The panel passed the legislation in a strictly party-line 29–25 vote after a contentious hearing.

It would reduce reform expenditures on SNAP by reducing the federal government's portion to 95 percent, beginning in fiscal year 2028, requiring states to pick up 5 percent of the SNAP burden.

It would also impose new work requirements, limiting eligibility to 90 days for able-bodied adults without work.

The committee was also ordered to find at least $230 billion in savings as part of the $1 trillion in cuts ordered by House leadership.

Republicans said the proposal would shrink the national debt and return SNAP to its original, narrower congressional intent.

In his opening remarks in favor of the legislation, Chairman Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said the Agriculture Committee legislation would “restore integrity” to SNAP and “make sure that this essential program works for the most vulnerable and functions as Congress has intended.”

Democrats were deeply critical of the proposed budget, with many comparing the bill to “Robin Hood in reverse.”

Ranking Member Angie Craig (D-Minn.) said that the cuts would harm millions of Americans, citing Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposed paperwork requirements would result in 3 million people losing access to food assistance.

“You don't build a life on SNAP. You build a bridge to the next paycheck, the next opportunity, that next moment of stability,” she said.

They also expressed concerns that the legislation would negatively impact American agriculture more broadly.

SALT allows voters to write off state and local taxes for federal purposes, making it popular in blue states like New York or California—where taxes tend to be high.

The SALT deduction currently sits at $10,000, but Republicans from Democrat-controlled states like New York and California want it increased.

The bill passed by the House Ways and Means Committee increases it to $30,000 but a group of Republicans from New York—including Reps. Elise Stefanik, Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino—say it's not enough.

Lawler has told The Epoch Times previously that he was seeking as much as a $100,000 SALT cap.

Conservatives, meanwhile, have criticized SALT, alleging it requires GOP-led states to subsidize high-tax Democrat states.

With multiple Republicans unhappy over the issue, Johnson could have trouble passing the legislation in the full vote on the House floor.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Kseniia Petrova, 31, was charged with one count of smuggling goods into the country.

If found guilty, she faces up to 20 years in prison, five years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.

The charges were announced just hours after a federal judge in Vermont heard arguments in a lawsuit Petrova filed against the Trump administration alleging she has been unlawfully detained at an immigration detention center in Louisiana for months.

She was transferred out of the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to a nearby Louisiana parish jail shortly after being charged.

An initial hearing in her criminal case has been set for May 15.

Petrova, a Russian national, was first taken into immigration custody on Feb. 16 after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston following a trip to Paris.

According to prosecutors, she was stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents after her checked duffle bag was flagged for inspection, revealing biological items including a foam box containing clawed frog embryos in microcentrifuges, as well as embryonic samples in paraffin well stages and on mounted dyed slides.

Such biological products must be declared and require a permit to be brought into the country.

Prosecutors said that Petrova initially denied carrying such material in her baggage but acknowledged she had biological specimens when asked again.

She was then advised that she was ineligible for entry to the United States, at which point prosecutors say she agreed to willingly withdraw her application for admission, prosecutors said.

Her lawyer, Gregory Romanovsky, called the case against his client “meritless” and questioned the timing of the charges being announced, noting she was transferred into criminal custody after the judge in her lawsuit set a May 28 bail hearing to consider releasing her.

“The charge, filed three months after the alleged customs violation, is clearly intended to make Kseniia look like a criminal to justify their efforts to deport her,” he said.

During an interview under oath, Petrova allegedly claimed to be unsure that she was required to declare biological material when entering the country, prosecutors said.

However, prosecutors said text messages on her phone from an individual identified as one of her colleagues informed her that she was required to declare the biological material.

They alleged that in response to one text message asking how she planned to get through customs with the biological samples, Petrova said: “No plan yet. I won't be able to swallow them.”

Petrova's case has drawn criticism from Democrats, including Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, who filed an amicus brief on May 12 opposing the government's efforts to dismiss her petition for release.

The brief states that Petrova had been conducting critical research on degenerative diseases at Harvard under a valid J-1 visa prior to her detention 10 weeks ago.

“Ms. Petrova's case is not an isolated incident—this is just the latest example of the Trump Administration's reckless and cruel misuse of power to punish and terrorize non-citizen members of the academic community,” Campbell said. “I will continue to fight to defend the rights of our international students and faculty, who meaningfully contribute to the academic and economic success of our communities.”

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts said Petrova was recently employed by the Institute of Genetic Biology in Moscow from 2023 to 2024 and previously served as a bioinformatician of genetic disorders at the Moscow Center for Genetics from 2016 to 2023.

Harvard University said in a statement that it “continues to monitor the situation.”

The Epoch Times has contacted Petrova's attorney for further comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are growing. Even before Taiwan elected William Lai as its president, in January 2024, China voiced strong opposition to him, calling him a “separatist” and an “instigator of war.” In recent months, Beijing has ramped up its broadsides: in mid-March, the spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office labeled Lai a “destroyer of cross-Straits peace” and accused him of pushing Taiwan toward “the perilous brink of war.” Two weeks later, as Beijing launched a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) circulated cartoon images that portrayed Lai as an insect. One image depicted a pair of chopsticks picking the “parasite” Lai out of a burning Taiwan.

This effort to dehumanize Lai reflects Beijing's deep anxiety about the trajectory of cross-strait relations, particularly what China views as Lai's desire to push Taiwan toward independence. Compared with his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has taken a stronger and more defiant stance in the face of growing Chinese threats to the island, as evident in his rhetoric and new policy measures. This March, Lai characterized Beijing as a “hostile foreign force” and announced a plan to implement 17 wide-ranging strategies to defend the island from Chinese infiltration.China's vilification of Lai echoes Beijing's denunciations, roughly two decades ago, of Chen Shui-bian, then president of Taiwan. Beijing labeled Chen a “die-hard separatist” and “a troublemaker” who “is riding near the edge of the cliff, and there is no sign that he is going to rein in his horse.” Beijing escalated external pressure against Chen and worked with opposition parties within Taiwan to frustrate his political agenda. China did come dangerously close to using military force against the island in 2008 and might have gone through with it if Chen had been more successful in winning Taiwan's public support for his referendum.

Beijing's attitude now should very much concern Washington. China does not view Lai's rule as merely a continuation of that of Tsai. Instead, Beijing sees Lai as a disruptor like Chen and is treating him much in the same way. Since Lai became president, Beijing has demonstrated growing willingness to use military might to intimidate and punish the island. And it is far more prepared to use force against Taiwan today than it was 20 years ago.

Apparent divisions within U.S. President Donald Trump's administration about how to approach Taiwan compound these risks. If Beijing doubts U.S. commitments to the island, that could encourage China to engage in more coercive actions against Taiwan. All these factors dramatically increase the chances that Beijing will miscalculate—and that it could very well use force against the island around 2027, as China approaches critical military modernization milestones and Taiwan gears up for its next presidential election.

China's official narratives have long emphasized that its peaceful unification with Taiwan is inevitable. But in recent months, anxiety has mounted in Beijing that Lai intends to systematically decouple Taiwan from China. Chinese media outlets have accused Lai of militarizing Taiwanese society as Lai prioritized efforts to increase Taiwan's defensive resilience, reinstated the military court system to handle espionage and treason by Taiwan military officials, and accelerated training and preparations for the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Beijing is highly critical of Lai's efforts to thwart Chinese infiltration and to counter Chinese cognitive warfare, arguing that Lai is preventing the resumption of tourism, suppressing and prosecuting pro-Chinese groups and individuals, discouraging Taiwanese citizens from applying for Chinese identification documents, imposing barriers on academic collaboration between universities in China and Taiwan, and altering Taiwan's textbooks to undermine historical and cultural affinity.

In March, a Chinese government spokesperson claimed that Lai's 17 strategies were aimed at “obstructing exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.” China has also denounced Lai's efforts to encourage Taiwanese businesses to invest more in democratic countries, including in the United States. Beijing has cast these measures as doomed to fail and mocked Taipei when the United States threatened to impose high tariffs on the island in April.

Many Chinese analysts believe that Lai's political position is weak compared with that of his predecessor, Tsai. But they worry that this weakness may make Lai bolder, as he might want to ramp up confrontation with China to try to win public support.

Based on this analysis of Lai and domestic conditions in Taiwan, hawkish voices within China are urging an ever more aggressive approach toward Taiwan. Some are calling for the use of military force against the island or the resurrection of so-called civil war operations, nonpeaceful ways for Beijing to unify with the island, such as by imposing a maritime blockade of the island. Other hawks have publicly wondered whether Beijing can engineer a crisis in Taipei similar to the 1936 Xian incident, in which generals serving under Chiang Kai-shek—who was leading the government of the Republic of China and its Nationalist forces—seized Chiang and forced him to ally with the Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japanese forces that had invaded northern China.



A more resonant parallel may be to one of the most dangerous periods during Chen's tenure. To boost turnout in Taiwan's March 2008 presidential election, Chen paired that vote with a popular referendum on whether the island should join the United Nations under the name Taiwan instead of the Republic of China.

This proposal came perilously close to crossing a redline for Beijing: in 2005, Beijing had passed the Anti-Secession Law, which established China's right to use military force against Taiwan under several conditions, including if “major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur.” When the law was passed, a spokesperson for the Chinese government suggested that an island-wide referendum could be considered a major incident. And in 2007, after Chen proposed the referendum, Chinese President Hu Jintao warned U.S. President George W. Bush that Beijing interpreted the Taiwan referendum in this way.

Beijing accompanied these warnings with significant military signaling. China increased its deployment of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan sevenfold from the beginning of Chen's term in 2000 to early 2008. Before the referendum, the Bush administration detected that the PLA had put mobile short-range missile units near the Taiwan Strait on heightened alert. The U.S. military and intelligence community believed that China could fire missiles around Taiwan, as it had during the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis—or, worse, China could actually attack the island.

Fortunately, the 2008 crisis passed without bloodshed. Low voter turnout invalidated Chen's referendum, and the opposition Kuomintang candidate beat the candidate from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party in the presidential race. U.S. deployment of significant forces near Taiwan may also have given Beijing pause. Taking the risk of escalation seriously, Washington had publicly opposed Chen's referendum and positioned two aircraft carriers to the northeast and southeast of Taiwan, and a third near Singapore, ahead of the vote. Nevertheless, the episode suggested that Beijing was serious about using force if provoked by what it viewed as “pro-independence” activities.

Since the 2008 crisis, China's military capabilities have grown significantly. Its army, navy, and air force have rapidly modernized, and its conventional rocket forces now field a far more capable array of longer-range missiles, including advanced hypersonic and antiship ballistic missiles. China has also doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past five years. Beyond advances in hard capabilities, Chinese President Xi Jinping has launched sweeping organizational reforms to enable the PLA to conduct more joint high-tech operations, and he has waged unparalleled anticorruption campaigns to root out obstacles to military readiness.

Beijing's willingness to use its military is growing, too. China has long engaged in military exercises to hone its capabilities and intimidate Taiwan. During Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou's tenure from 2008 to 2016, Beijing limited these provocations as it sought to encourage greater cross-Strait engagement. But China resumed major exercises when Tsai, who emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty and security, succeeded Ma. In August 2022, toward the end of Tsai's term, China mounted larger and more provocative drills near Taiwan than it had ever held before.

Now the pace and scale of Chinese military activities are increasing. Not even a year into Lai's term, China has broken precedent by staging three large-scale exercises, which were given names to raise their profile and distinguish them from smaller drills.

In a significant shift, the PLA is now using such large-scale military exercises to punish Lai's administration for domestic political acts. All of China's past major exercises—in 1995–96, 2022, and 2023—were launched after Taiwan's leaders traveled to the United States or met with senior U.S. officials. Last December, China did engage in a major—but unnamed—drill after Lai made stops in Hawaii and Guam on a tour of the Pacific. But all three recent large-scale exercises responded to domestic speeches or statements by Lai.

These military activities have become markedly more provocative, unpredictable, and complex. In April's exercise, named Strait Thunder-2025A, PLA naval vessels reportedly ventured within 24 nautical miles of the island's shores. China is engaging in large-scale operations around Taiwan year round and increasing activities to the east of Taiwan. In a break with the past, the PLA now provides little or no advance warning of its drills. This has raised concerns in Washington and Taipei about how much lead time the United States and Taiwan might have should China decide to use force to seize the island.



In another shift from earlier years, recent rounds of exercises have witnessed China's coast guard joining with the navy to practice blockading Taiwan. China's maritime militia, a state-backed network of civilian vessels often deployed to assert Chinese territorial claims, has also become increasingly involved. The participation of these new actors suggests that China is preparing to conduct a broad variety of operations, such as an invasion, a PLA navy–led blockade, and a Chinese coast guard–led quarantine of Taiwan.

Finally, China is also operating across a bigger geographic range: its exercise in December involved one of the largest-ever deployments of maritime forces from all three of the PLA's coastal commands. China conducted operations around Taiwan and in the East China and South China Seas, demonstrating its ability to dominate areas within the first island chain—an arc of islands and countries in the Western Pacific stretching from Japan to parts of Indonesia—and block external forces from entering to assist Taiwan.

Apart from such major operations, China now conducts near-daily military incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, a self-declared area that extends beyond the island's official airspace. In 2024, the Chinese military flew a record-shattering 3,075 sorties into this zone, an increase of over 80 percent from 2023. These operations aim to delegitimize Taiwan's claims to its surrounding air and seas and complicate Taiwan's ability to monitor and track activities around the island.

Some of these air incursions occur as part of “joint combat readiness patrols,” involving not just air assets but also coordinated maritime operations. These patrols are now occurring on a near-weekly basis and offer China opportunities to quickly step up coercion against Taiwan short of much larger-scale exercises. Days after Lai unveiled his 17 strategies in March, for instance, China launched two joint combat readiness patrols and then followed up two weeks later by holding its Strait Thunder-2025A exercise.

U.S. officials are issuing warnings about these remarkable Chinese military activities. In February, Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command, asserted that China's “aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises. . . .They are rehearsals.”

Yet as China increases its military activities against Taiwan, many in Beijing don't know where Washington stands. Beijing is relatively confident that the Trump administration wants to intensify competition with China, with a particular focus on the economic relationship. Chinese analysts also generally believe that Trump will try to use Taiwan as a card in this competition, but there is no consensus on how he will do so.

Chinese experts assess that Trump and his team are divided on Taiwan. Many believe that Trump wants to negotiate deals with China and that he and many of his supporters want to avoid foreign military entanglements. But national security hawks in the administration, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, are still focused on checking Chinese aggression and influence. Chinese interlocutors note that Trump's national security team is not receptive to Chinese concerns about Lai, and they worry that when it comes to day-to-day Taiwan policy, this administration will likely strengthen relations with Taipei through deepened cooperation and increased arms sales.

These conflicting assessments leave Beijing less certain that the United States will defend Taiwan from large-scale attacks or lower-intensity scenarios. But Chinese officials believe that, if left unchecked, the United States is likely to move even closer to Taiwan. That creates a dynamic ripe for miscalculation. China could determine that it needs to treat Taiwan more aggressively to make it clear to Trump's national security team that it will tolerate neither growing U.S.-Taiwan ties nor moves by Taiwan that it sees as provocative. Meanwhile, China's perception that Trump is not altogether willing to defend Taiwan may lead Beijing to consider still more escalatory actions against the island.

U.S. and allied policymakers must not overlook these shifts in China's perceptions of Taiwan and its actions regarding the island. As Lai's term continues, Beijing and Taipei are likely to enter an even more dangerous situation. Chinese experts believe that Lai may take more radical measures to promote Taiwan's independence in 2027 ahead of the next presidential elections. If Lai is not faring well in the polls, Chinese analysts worry that he could ratchet up his anti-Beijing stance to win electoral support, much as Chen did in 2008. Xi himself has set a deadline of 2027 for the PLA to have the capability to forcefully take Taiwan. Given Xi's push to accelerate the PLA's modernization, it is unlikely that his military leaders will tell him in 2027 that China is not capable of successfully executing large-scale military operations against Taiwan, meaning that Xi may feel more confident then—and willing to provoke a crisis or conflict.

Beijing's diminished patience and hardened intent make it even more important for the Trump administration to ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the United States and its willingness to counter Chinese aggression. There is extraordinary work that the United States must do to deter a conflict or, failing that, to deny and defeat Chinese military adventurism. In addition to building up its own military capabilities—as well as those of Taiwan and its allies—and significantly increasing allied and partner defense spending, Washington must better integrate different elements of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan to enhance deterrence and reduce the risks of misperception by potential adversaries. This is important because Beijing is not just assessing American resolve by looking at what the United States is doing on defense. For example, as Chinese experts watch the U.S.-Chinese tariff and trade negotiations, some are noting how rapidly Washington has both scaled up and temporarily backed down on tariffs, suggesting that Trump was bluffing initially and that the administration now recognizes that it needs to cooperate with China despite its focus on competition.

As the United States is moving fast on multiple fronts, it will be important to pay attention to how Beijing may be connecting the dots of different U.S. policies in cobbling together a larger understanding of American strategy and intentions. To the extent that China is misunderstanding the United States, it will be crucial for the Trump administration to correct and push back against Chinese narratives, both in public and in private.

If the Trump administration does not want a crisis on its hands, it should not leave such a door open for Beijing. The Taiwan Strait will be volatile enough over the next few years without adding to the mix muddled Chinese perceptions of what the United States is willing—or not willing—not do.

 Mustafa Kutlay

At a time of growing uncertainty about the future of the international order, middle powers seem to be having a moment. Along with countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey is trying to capitalize on a geopolitical landscape that is less shaped by the postwar U.S. alliance system and rules-based diplomacy and more by multiple centers of power and transactional relations. Especially since the global financial crisis in 2008, Turkey has pursued closer relationships beyond its traditional Western allies, including with Russia and China. It has also sought to extend its international reach, especially outside the West—Turkey now has the third-highest number of diplomatic missions in the world, trailing only China and the United States. And in conflicts in the South Caucasus, the Black Sea region, and the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey has played an increasingly assertive role.

Turkey's recent policies in Syria are emblematic of the way a middle power can exert influence in its region, sometimes outmaneuvering seemingly stronger players. Throughout Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, the Turkish government openly opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and provided material support to groups fighting against his rule. It did so even when Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, appeared to have a stranglehold on power, and the conflict itself caused millions of Syrian refugees to flee to Turkey, creating security risks along Turkey's long southern border with Syria. Yet 13 years later, in December 2024, the Assad regime collapsed. Against all odds, Turkey's policy had belatedly paid off. Ankara's adversary is gone, and the victory of Turkish-supported opposition groups has given it a direct line to Damascus. Regional geopolitics remain fragile, and state-building in Syria will be a long and delicate process, but Turkey has established itself as one of the main outside powers with the leverage to shape the country's future.

Turkey's Syria policy seems to be yielding results, at least for now. Middle powers such as Turkey do have to pursue their own interests and hedge their bets to survive in a world where upheaval is the norm, great powers cannot be counted on, and global relations are increasingly transactional. Two decades ago, the path to foreign policy success for these countries lay in becoming a good citizen of the liberal international order. Today, “strategic autonomy” is the name of the game. Yet if Turkey and countries in similar positions do not appreciate the tradeoffs of this approach, they risk straining their partnerships, overstretching their diplomatic resources, and diluting their economic priorities. The idea that transactionalism is inherently good for middle powers is a delusion.

Turkish policymakers believe that the move toward multipolarity is generating a new world—one in which Turkey should be an active player. Historically, Turkey's diplomacy focused on the country's immediate neighborhood and Western allies. Turkey conducted a large part of its trade with Europe since the early Cold War years and linked its security to NATO when it joined the alliance in 1952.

Today, Ankara's ties to the non-Western world are growing, and gaining influence across the global South has become a core pillar of Turkey's strategy. In 2002, the country's volume of trade with Asian countries, including China and Russia, was only half its volume of trade with the European Union. Two decades later, Turkey's trade with Asia had surpassed its trade with Europe. Turkey's trade with African countries jumped more than 50 percent between 2014 and 2024, from $21.2 billion to $33.3 billion. The number of Turkish embassies on the 54-country continent increased from 12 in 2002 to 44 in 2022. As part of a long-term plan to become a power broker in Africa, last year, the Turkish government brought Ethiopian and Somali leaders together for negotiations to end the two countries' dispute over Ethiopia's plans to build a port in Somaliland, a breakaway region with its own government in the north of Somalia. Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier, now flies to 130 countries, branding itself as the company that “flies to the most countries in the world.”

Regional instability and the deterioration of security ties with Western partners have also compelled Turkey to develop domestic defense and aerospace technologies. Large-scale government and private investments have fueled the growth of Turkey's drone industry. The Bayraktar TB2 drone has been used in various conflicts, including in Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, and Ukraine, and is now exported to more than 30 countries. By 2024, Turkey's total defense and aerospace exports soared to $7.2 billion—a nearly 30 percent increase over the previous year. As of 2023, three Turkish defense contractors are among the world's top 100 arms revenue earners.

Ankara has expanded its pool of international partners in other areas, too, partly in an effort to position itself as a connector country that supports the flow of investment, transport, and energy between Asia and Europe. In 2012, Turkey became a dialogue partner of the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization—an alignment that Turkish policymakers, more for political posturing than out of conviction, occasionally highlight as an alternative to Turkey's stagnated EU membership bid. Turkey also joined China's Belt and Road Initiative in 2015, hoping to unite its own Middle Corridor project—which envisions transport infrastructure connecting East Asia to Europe via Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Turkey—with the Belt and Road Initiative in one big transcontinental network. Since 2011, Turkish public-private partnerships have poured around $115 billion into motorways, bridges, ports, and airports to improve Turkey's segment of that infrastructure. Last year, in its most significant step yet toward alignment with non-Western economies, Turkey applied to join BRICS, the increasingly influential bloc led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

As it pursues multiple foreign alignments, however, Turkey has not always accounted for the vulnerabilities of its conflicted position. Multipolarity may offer economic opportunity, but it also brings heightened risk. Strengthening partnerships in one region could also come at the expense of ties in another. For Turkey to successfully walk this tightrope, like other middle powers, it will need to operate with self-restraint and a realistic understanding of its limits.

An essential concern for Turkey is economic security. In an increasingly transactional world, middle powers want to work with multiple major powers on an issue-by-issue basis. Yet as the global economy fragments, accelerated by the United States' escalation of trade and technology wars under President Donald Trump, many countries will also be pressured to pick sides. What makes this balancing act more challenging for Turkey is that it has multiple dependencies on rival blocs. It cannot afford to lose access to Russian gas, Chinese goods, European markets, or the American dollar. On the Russian-Chinese side, Turkey's economic interest is deepening. In 2024, total trade with these two countries reached $101 billion, accounting for almost 17 percent of Turkey's overall external trade. Yet these trade ties are highly asymmetric—Turkey's total exports to Russia and China were only $12 billion last year—which significantly contributes to Turkey's external trade deficits. Meanwhile, the Turkish economy still needs Western markets and capital to sustain its growth; Turkey exports roughly as much to the EU as it imports and almost 70 percent of foreign direct investment comes from the EU and the United States. Being dragged into a trade, technology, and sanctions war between Western actors and the Russian-Chinese axis could lead to significant economic turbulence for Turkey.



Diversifying trade and investment ties may seem to be a good insurance policy for a middle power. But Turkey, in part because of domestic political tumult that generates uncertainty for investors, has so far struggled to convert its hedging strategy into substantial economic gains. From 2019 to 2023, for example, the country attracted about $53 billion in foreign direct investment—much less than the $84 billion that Vietnam, another “hedging middle” country whose economy is less than half the size of Turkey's, brought in over the same period. Turkey's economic exposure to rival blocs, moreover, could constrain its room for maneuver. If Turkey chooses to deepen its economic ties with Russia and China, for example, it risks losing much-needed high-quality foreign capital from Western countries.

An effective hedging policy must start at home. To reduce its economic exposure and increase its resilience, Turkey needs a comprehensive industrial policy and strong institutions. The country already has some important advantages: its open economy, lacking in natural resources, has achieved significant market and product diversification, and its entrepreneurs are astute and adaptable. Yet the structure of the Turkish economy reinforces external dependencies. The main problem is that Turkey relies on imports for many high-end products; advanced technologies account for only four percent of Turkey's manufacturing exports, significantly below the world average of 19 percent. At least until Turkey can become more self-sufficient in this area and alleviate its current economic hardship, the country will need to take extra care not to antagonize the wrong economic partner as it chases other foreign policy objectives.

Turkey's and other middle powers' commitment to strategic autonomy is understandable in a world where great powers are becoming increasingly unreliable. But overzealous pursuit of such autonomy is dangerous, too. Turkey suffered the consequences of pushing an independent foreign policy too far in the wake of the Arab uprisings, when it overstretched itself by clashing with both neighboring countries and global partners. It opened diplomatic rifts—or exacerbated existing ones—with Syria after Assad cracked down violently on protesters in 2011, Saudi Arabia after Ankara supported the government of Mohamed Morsi in Egypt in 2012, Egypt after Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, and the EU and the United States over migration, Syria policy, and other issues throughout the decade. As these stalemates dragged on, foreign investment in Turkey declined significantly. The government also had to direct additional resources to security, restricting its fiscal capacity in other areas, and foreign policy decisions became increasingly contentious, feeding political polarization. To ease those pressures, Turkey has dedicated significant diplomatic energy to damage control over the past few years.

Today, Ankara will need to juggle long-term relations with its traditional Western allies with a strategy to engage with the non-Western world. Turkey's relations with Western countries are in particular need of repair, having become increasingly transactional over the last decade. Rather than working together toward shared goals, the two sides often settle for crude deals. In exchange for Turkey keeping Syrian refugees out of Europe, for instance, the EU provides funds to help offset costs—and, in an unspoken term of the agreement, the EU tolerates the regression of democratic norms in Turkey.



Complicating Ankara's transactionalism is the fact that Turkey is not a typical nonaligned country. Even though it is courting institutions such as BRICS or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, it remains a member of NATO, part of the EU Customs Union, a founding member of the Council of Europe, and an EU candidate country. These affiliations place expectations on Turkey, and charting a different course has consequences. After Turkey signed a deal to purchase S-400 missiles from Russia in 2017, for example, it was expelled from NATO's F-35 fighter jet program. And after years of poor relations with its neighbors and Europe, Turkey was excluded from the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum, a regional bloc that was formally established in 2020.

Transactional diplomacy, moreover, has not advanced any of Turkey's most urgent national interests. Turkey and the EU, for instance, have been discussing plans to modernize their Customs Union deal for the last decade. The agreement needs an upgrade to better contribute to Turkey's economic development, green transition, and integration into Europe's restructured supply chains. But no progress has been made so far. Nor has Turkey managed to negotiate a better process for Schengen visa applications, which have become an extremely unpleasant experience for Turkish citizens who wish to travel and do business in Europe, or to establish a working model for sustained cooperation with its Western partners in Ukraine, the eastern Mediterranean, and Syria.

Progress on these issues may require resetting Turkey's relationship with the EU, and Turkey could use the transition to a post-Assad Syria to do so. Syrian stability is hanging by a thread, and although Turkey has strong ties with the new government in Damascus, it cannot single-handedly finance the massive reconstruction the country needs. Together, however, Turkey and the EU could do much to support Syria, preventing another exodus of refugees and helping to stabilize the entire Middle East—if both sides change the way they approach their relationship. For Brussels, that would mean treating Turkey as a true security partner, not just as a buffer state that prevents large numbers of refugees from entering Europe. The Trump administration's hesitance to backstop Ukrainian and European security may be the jolt the EU needs to commit to working with Turkey. Ankara, for its part, will need to recognize that deepening its ties with the non-Western world in ways that antagonize European allies is not sustainable.

The transition to a multipolar world is often perceived as a middle-power renaissance, granting opportunities to countries beyond a few great powers to shape regional and global politics. The way for a middle power to navigate international politics today, the argument has been, is to avoid making restrictive obligations or picking sides. As Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the press last month, “I do not want to choose . . . I want to have relationships with the United States, I want to have relations with China. I do not want to have a preference for one or the other.” The return of Trump to the White House would seem to reinforce this way of thinking, as U.S. foreign policy becomes more explicitly transactional, prioritizing deals that serve specific national interests over explicit commitments to alliances and norms.

Yet by embracing flexible partnerships, as Turkey has done with its own balancing act, middle powers may be ignoring significant risks. Particularly for economies as exposed as Turkey's, careful economic statecraft is vital to limit the fallout of trade and technology wars, supply chain disruptions, and other manifestations of geopolitical uncertainty. An activist foreign policy is not sustainable without strong domestic institutions and a healthy economy to back it up. Autonomy, moreover, can only be pushed so far. Playing all sides can lead to isolation, and pursuing every opportunity for engagement can overstretch countries that simply do not have a superpower's resources. Turkey and other middle powers may see a transactional approach as an appealing way to get ahead in today's world. But unless they temper it with realistic expectations, the policy will likely cost more than it yields.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","From free planes to crypto meme coins, Democrats seize on Trump's deals to raise corruption concerns","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/politics/democrats-raise-trump-corruption-concerns","Thu, 15 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Follow:


            Democrats are leaning into a corruption argument against President Donald Trump, pointing to his crypto meme coin and plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar as evidence that the president is potentially violating ethical norms and the US Constitution.
    


            In floor speeches and interviews, on social media and in the skies above Trump's Florida resort, Democrats have warned that Trump is seeking to enrich himself – even as Republicans advance legislation that could cut programs such as Medicaid and the Department of Government Efficiency scales back the size of the US government.
    


            “The first 114 days of this administration have been one bad deal after another for American families,” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said during a floor speech Wednesday highlighting Trump's alleged conflicts of interest. “But if your last name is Trump, these 114 days have been just about the greatest deal of all time.”
    


            It's a familiar strategy for Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who criticized Trump during his first term as foreign officials sought to curry favor with the president by staying at his hotels. This time, however, Democrats and ethics groups argue that the potential corruption of the second Trump administration has far surpassed the first term.
    


            Tiffany Muller, president of the Democratic-aligned group End Citizens United, said that how Democrats message their anti-corruption arguments will be critical.
    


            “Voters don't know who to trust on this issue, and whoever wins that trust battle will win the election,” Muller said in an interview with CNN. “We have to connect the corruption that we're seeing day to day back to their everyday lives and then also talk about how Trump and the Republicans are using it to line their own pockets.”
    


            Muller and Molly Murphy, president of Impact Research, which conducted focus groups with swing voters last month, recently briefed congressional Democrats and staff on their findings relating to corruption. Voters in those groups expressed concern about corruption but also were cynical about lawmakers in Washington fixing the issue, Muller noted, adding that Democrats should talk about tangible actions they can take to fight corruption, including a congressional stock trading ban.
    


            Trump's past call to “drain the swamp” and vows to reform the federal government have “helped inoculate him against some of the corruption messaging” among some voters, Muller said. But she argued voters would have “buyer's remorse” as additional ethically questionable episodes arise.
    


            Faiz Shakir, an adviser to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, argued Democrats should combine pushback on corruption with a “proactive positive agenda,” similar to tactics used by Democrats in the 2006 midterms when they took control of both chambers of Congress.
    


            “In addition to opposing Donald Trump and telling you he's corrupt, we need an agenda that speaks to the things we'll do,” Shakir said. “In order for the Democratic brand to be more powerful, it has to be something other than just opposing Trump.”
    


            While some Republicans have expressed concerns about Trump's potential conflicts of interest, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the president's actions.
    


            “I can just tell you that President Trump has had nothing to hide,” Johnson said Wednesday. “He's very upfront about it. There are people who watch all the ethics of that.”
    


            Republican strategist Matt Gorman said the talk of corruption is another “shiny object” for Democrats and highlights the party's lack of consistent messaging.
    


            “It doesn't affect anyone, any actual, real people,” said Gorman. “It's the same thing when you talk about Democrats talking about esoteric terms like democracy and fascism while Trump is talking about paychecks and illegal immigration.”
    


CNN reported Sunday that the Department of Defense plans to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family that would be used temporarily as Air Force One, then later donated to Trump's presidential library. Critics argue that accepting the plane would violate the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.
    


            “I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person, say, ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.' But it was, I thought it was a great gesture,” Trump said as he defended the move this week.
    


            The administration has claimed the deal is above board. “Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.
    


            The plane controversy comes as Trump has been accused of selling access to himself through his cryptocurrency. Last month, the website for Trump's meme coin announced that the top holders of the coin would be invited to a dinner and “exclusive reception” with the president.
    


            Daniel Weiner, the director of the Brennan Center's Elections and Government Program, said that when it comes to ethical concerns about Trump's conduct, the Qatari plane and the president's cryptocurrency represent an “escalation” from Trump's first term.
    


            “You didn't have anything like, for instance, the cryptocurrency that his family has launched that basically anyone who wants to ingratiate themselves with the president, or thinks that might work, can just pay directly into this platform,” Weiner said. “These are significantly bigger potential sources of conflict of interest.”
    


            This isn't the first time Democrats have sought to message on corruption. In the 2006 midterms when Democrats consolidated power on Capitol Hill, the party focused on a “culture of corruption” in its messaging along with the “Six for ‘06” agenda, featuring specific deliverables the party aimed to pursue. Exit polls that year showed corruption and ethics were among the most important issues for voters.
    


            After Democrats won back the House in 2018, the first bill they introduced was a sweeping voting rights and ethics reform package that would have strengthened conflict-of-interest laws for the White House. The bill passed the House but stalled in the Senate in 2019 and 2021.
    


            Democrats have faced questions about corruption in recent years as well. Former Sen. Bob Menendez resigned his seat last year after he was found guilty of 16 counts — including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent — for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme. Congressional Republicans seized on Hunter Biden's position with a Ukrainian natural gas company to fuel corruption allegations against his father former President Joe Biden, though there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the elder Biden's part.
    


            While Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, it's not clear how much Democrats' corruption argument played into that election. What is clear is that Democrats are attempting to tie the corruption argument into a broader argument about the economy.
    


            The Democratic National Committee flew a “Qatar-a-Lago” banner in Palm Beach, Florida Wednesday afternoon to highlight the plane gift and conflict of interest concerns related to the Trump Organization's new deal to build a golf course in the Middle Eastern country.
    


            “Donald Trump is using the presidency to personally enrich himself while he bankrupts working families,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “His corruption is a slap in the face to the millions of Americans who are struggling to get by and put food on the table.”
    


            Congressional Democrats are also making a push this week to highlight the administration's potential conflicts of interest.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer placed a blanket hold on confirming Justice Department political appointees in response to the Qatari plane gift, calling it “naked corruption” and a “grave national security threat.” Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, filed a resolution Wednesday blasting Trump for attempting to accept the plane without congressional approval.
    


            Democrats have also introduced legislation to block presidents and members of Congress from issuing meme coins. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who introduced the MEME Act, called Trump's meme coin “the most unethical, the most corrupt thing a president of the United States has ever done,” in a social media video promoting the legislation.
    


            Murphy argued during a Tuesday appearance on CNN's “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins that the president was using his trip this week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates “to profit off of US foreign policy.”
    


            “The real story here is that Trump is cementing the fundamental corruption of American foreign policy,” he said.

Ahead of his trip, Trump said he plans to accept a plane from Qatar to be used as Air Force One — raising legal, ethical and security concerns.

            “Let me have one month of fixing up the Oval Office, in other words, getting things ready. And I look forward to having you in the White House we'll celebrate together,” the president said on Thursday.
    


            Trump appeared to be referring to the UAE's announcement in March that they would invest $1.4 trillion over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing, and energy.
    


            The UAE's existing US investments already total $1 trillion, according to its embassy in Washington.
    


            President Donald Trump has spent the day on Thursday in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as he visited the largest US military installation in the Middle East and participated in a business roundtable with Qatari leaders before traveling to Abu Dhabi and touring the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque.
    


Catch up below on key moments from Trump's Thursday in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates:



Roundtable with business leaders: Trump participated in a business roundtable with Qatari leaders, where he praised Syria's interim leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa, floated the idea of a Gaza “freedom zone” and appeared to indicate that the US has reached a trade deal with India.
    


                    “India is the highest – one of the highest tariff nations in the world. It's very hard to sell into India, and they've offered us a deal where, basically, they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said during the roundtable in Doha.
                





Visit to US military installation in Qatar: Trump thanked US troops for political support and said his priority is to end wars, but won't hesitate to “wield American power if it's required,” during a campaign rally-style visit to the largest US military installation in the Middle East, the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.
    


                    “My priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners, and this is one of our great partners right here,” he said.
                





Trip to Abu Dhabi: Trump traveled aboard Air Force One from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop on his tour of the Middle East.
    


            He was feted with drums, chanting, and a military honor guard lining a hallway as he arrived at the presidential flight terminal in Abu Dhabi.
    


Grand Mosque: Trump toured the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque moments after arriving in Abu Dhabi, calling the rare closure of the Emirati cultural and religious landmark for his presidential visit a “great tribute.”
    


Trump's evening: The president is set to participate in bilateral meetings at the UAE presidential palace.
    


What's expected on Friday: Trump plans to wrap up his trip to the Middle East by participating in a US & UAE business family photo and roundtable before touring the Abrahamic Family House.

            While President Donald Trump is in the United Arab Emirates, back in the US House Speaker Mike Johnson is meeting today with competing House GOP factions — House Freedom Caucus members and New York Republicans — as he attempts to strike a deal on the state and local tax deduction cap in Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts bill.
    


            New York Republicans who arrived for the meeting, including Reps. Elise Stefanik, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota, have been advocating for the SALT cap to be raised higher than $30,000.
    


            LaLota reiterated that the $30,000 cap is “not a fix for us” and “I don't think it's a fix for the president.”
    


                    “Members of Congress who represent these districts throughout the country are through a deliberative process right now, haggling over in maybe an Apprentice-like style over what will be in the beautiful bill,” Lalota told reporters.
                





            Ahead of the meeting with Johnson, conservative hardliner Rep. Chip Roy argued that the House reconciliation bill “must change.”
    


                    “It 1) increases debt by $20T (to over $56T in a decade), 2) backloads savings (typical swamp), 3) locks in place Obamacare's failing Medicaid expansion subsidizing able-bodied over vulnerable & likely pressuring no-expansion states to expand, 4) delays work requirements til AFTER Trump & includes massive waiver, 5) delays IRA subsidy repeal until after Trump, 6) many other issues,” he posted on X.
                





            President Donald Trump toured the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque moments after arriving in Abu Dhabi, calling the rare closure of the Emirati cultural and religious landmark for his presidential visit a “great tribute.”
    


                    “Is this beautiful? It is so beautiful. Very proud of my friends, this is an incredible culture, that I can say,” Trump said in brief remarks inside the Al Noor Foyer.
                





            Trump continued: “This is the first time they've closed the mosque for the day. First time they've closed it. It's an honor of the United States, I think. Better than an honor that's given to the country, but it's a great tribute, thank you.”
    


            He asked the press if they were “having a good time.”
    


            Joined by the mosque's director, the acting director of the Culture and Knowledge Department and other officials, Trump arrived at the Al Noor entrance and observed the mosque's exterior through the Sahan Courtyard. He then strode along the mosque's long, outdoor marble walkway with intricate floral columns.
    


            Inside, Trump admired the Al Noor Foyer, the main prayer room, decorated with geometric patterns, impressive stonework, gilded columns, colorful chandeliers and a patterned traditional rug – the largest handmade carpet in the world, according to pool reporters traveling with the president.
    


            He observed a carved, gilded wall with his guides, and later stood atop the center of the rug and posed for a photo.
    


            President Donald Trump's remarks ahead of his visit to the United Arab Emirates show that the relationship between Washington and Gulf Arab states is “beyond transactional,” UAE Minister of Education Sarah Al Amiri said.
    


                    “This is a beneficial relationship to both nations, and this is a relationship that will create deep-rooted ties,” Al Amiri told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday, adding that “this is what we're looking for here in the UAE.”
                





            The UAE is looking to diversify its economy, Al Amiri said, especially in fields of artificial intelligence and technology.
    


            “We are in the perfect stage today to take on this paradigm shift that artificial intelligence is going to take on, and that's why we've invested in it so early,” she said.
    


            Perhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns – and it has money to back it up.
    


            Abu Dhabi seeks to become a global leader in AI by 2031, a goal it is unlikely to achieve without American microchips. Under the Biden administration, the US had tightened curbs on AI exports to keep advanced technology out of the hands of foreign adversaries like China.
    


            President Donald Trump was feted with drums, chanting, and a military honor guard lining a hallway as he arrived at the presidential flight terminal in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on Thursday.
    


            Trump processed through the arrival ceremony, warmly greeting UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other Emirati officials as children waved American and Emirati flags. Men in traditional green robes held swords and others in white robes stood with orange guns raised to the ceiling. A line of women in white robes danced and tossed their long, dark hair back and forth as part of the ceremony, a traditional Gulf dance.
    


            The hallway appeared to be part of a large jet bridge that was attached directly to Air Force One.
    


            Trump, who is keenly aware of the stagecraft of a presidential visit, has been received with grand displays of fanfare at each of his three Middle Eastern stops as all of his hosts seek to bolster ties with the US. In Doha, the presidential motorcade was escorted by a cavalry of red Tesla Cybertrucks and passed mounted camels and Arabian horses. And in Riyadh, Trump was welcomed with a royal purple carpet arrival ceremony and a 21-gun salute.
    


            After a private greeting with the Emirati president, Trump is on the move to Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, a major landmark in Abu Dhabi.

            President Donald Trump told reporters that when it comes to peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, “nothing is going to happen until” he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “Nothing's gonna happen until Putin and I get together, ok? And obviously — he wasn't going to go. He was going to go, but he thought I was going. He wasn't going if I wasn't there and I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together. But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he landed in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
    


            Trump added that he was not disappointed that the Russian delegation sent to Turkey Thursday for high-level talks with Ukraine did not include Putin: “I'm not disappointed in anything.”
    


            He continued, “I'm not disappointed. Why would I be? We just took in $4 trillion, and you're disappointed about a delegation? I know nothing about a delegation, I haven't even checked.”
    


More on the talks: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he won't meet with any Russian representatives in Turkey besides Putin. He called the delegation who showed up Thursday “phony.”
    


            Trump indicated earlier Thursday that a trip to Turkey could still be on the table, keeping the option open even after top officials said there were no plans to do so.
    


            “If something happened, I'd go on Friday if it was appropriate,” he said during a business roundtable in Doha.
    


            Trump had vowed to end Russia's war in Ukraine on his first day in office, a resolution that has proven elusive. Since then, he has said he was exaggerating.
    


            President Donald Trump is traveling aboard Air Force One from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop on his tour of the Middle East.
    


            In Qatar, the president highlighted key investments in Boeing, but also made news on Iran nuclear negotiations, Russia-Ukraine talks, a potential India tariff deal, and the possibility of a Gaza “freedom zone.”
    


            He addressed thousands of US troops at Al Udeid Air Base, marking his largest crowd of the trip and an effort to highlight US-Qatari security ties.
    


            Trump was also greeted with much fanfare by the country's emir and treated to a state dinner.
    


            The president is expected to tour Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and attend a state dinner in Abu Dhabi upon his arrival.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday thanked US troops for political support during a campaign rally-style visit to a US installation in Qatar, telling troops stationed at Al Udeid Air Base that “nobody's been stronger than the military in terms of backing us.”
    


            “There's – nobody been stronger than the military in terms of backing us, nobody. So, I just want to thank you all very much. Great honor. Thank you very much,” Trump said at the largest US military installation in the Middle East, a base highlighting the deep security ties between the US and Qatar.
    


            Trump, who is on the second of three stops in the Middle East, also repeated baseless claims of 2020 election fraud while on foreign soil, noting calls to seek a fourth term.
    


                    “We won three elections, okay? And some people want us to do a fourth. I don't know. Have to think about that,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump said his priority is to end wars, but he won't hesitate to “wield American power if it's required,” while addressing US troops in Qatar on Thursday.
    


            Trump visited the Al Udeid Air Base, which houses 10,000 American troops and plays a critical role in US foreign policy, on his first major international presidential visit of his second term.
    


                    “My priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners, and this is one of our great partners right here,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump is speaking at the largest US military installation in the Middle East, the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.
    


            The base houses more than 10,000 troops and has played a pivotal role in US foreign policy over the last two decades.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday morning appeared to indicate that the US has reached a trade deal with India, in which, India is “willing to literally charge us no tariff.”
    


            “India is the highest – one of the highest tariff nations in the world. It's very hard to sell into India, and they've offered us a deal where, basically, they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha.
    


                    He continued, “So we go from the highest tariff – you couldn't do business in India. We're not even a top 30 (importer) in India because the tariff is so high, to a point where they have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent), you were working on that also, that there will be no tariff, right? Would you say that's a difference? They're the highest, and now they're saying no tariff.”
                





            On his so-called “liberation day,” Trump imposed 26% tariffs on India. The US has a $45.6 billion trading deficit with India.
    


            As President Donald Trump makes his way to the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military installation in the Middle East, the warm-up acts have already begun for a few thousand troops waiting to see their commander-in-chief.
    


                    “What's up Al Udeid? Thank you guys for having me,” said Theo Von, an American comedian-turned-podcaster, who took the stage to booming applause. “They said ‘do you want to go to the Middle East?' I said ‘the Middle East of what, Kentucky?'”
                





            Von was among the right-leaning podcasters whose support of Trump in the presidential campaign was credited with helping to win the support of many young men. Today, he offered a few jokes at the president's expense.
    


                    “One of the most famous suntans in the world is here today, Donald Trump!” Von said. “That dude has the best one. He's got a tone of his own. He sunbathes at a Sherwin-Williams, dude.”
                





            Lee Greenwood, the country music star whose “God Bless the USA” has become the anthem of Trump campaign rallies over the past decade, is also on hand here on the base outside of Doha.
    


Some background: Trump is making his first visit to Al Udeid Air base, which houses more than 10,000 troops and has played a pivotal role in US foreign policy over the last two decades. It served as a critical launching pad for airstrikes and intelligence missions over Afghanistan and was the main CENTCOM base following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
    


            It's the largest audience the president will face on his trip across the Middle East this week. He is expected to take a tour of base facilities before giving a rally-style speech to troops.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday again proposed the idea of the US taking over Gaza, offering the idea of a “freedom zone” as he continued to muse about redeveloping the war-torn enclave.
    


                    “If it's necessary, I think I'd be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone. Let some good things happen, put people in homes where they can be safe and Hamas is going to have to be dealt with,” Trump said at a business roundtable in Doha with top Qatari officials.
                





            Trump's efforts to end the Israel-Hamas conflict have so far proven elusive, and the former real estate developer has previously floated the idea of the US taking control and developing Gaza.
    


                    “We're working very hard on Gaza, and Gaza's been a territory of death and destruction for many years. And you know, I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good: make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone, have a real freedom zone,” Trump said.
                





            He continued, “They've never solved the Gaza problem and if you look at it, I have aerial shots, I mean there's practically no building standing, there's no building. People are living under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, which is not acceptable, it's tremendous death. And I want to see that be a freedom zone.”
    


On the ground: Almost 70 people were killed overnight in Gaza as a week of intense Israeli strikes continues.
    


            Israeli strikes killed 57 people in Khan Younis, according to a list from the Nasser Hospital mortuary. Videos supplied by local journalists show young children among those killed and bodies filling the mortuary at the hospital, with staff saying it was “packed with bodies.”

            Donald Trump's perceived domestic political enemies appeared to remain top of mind during his Middle Eastern sojourn. The president took aim at Democrats and the media in Doha on Thursday even as he appeared at an event ostensibly aimed at heralding business deals with Qatar.
    


            Former Transportation Secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg reemerged on the national stage this week for a town hall in Iowa amid speculation about a 2028 presidential bid – and Trump took time to mock him in Doha.
    


            As he praised his Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for “working right now on the airports and getting a system,” Trump slammed the Biden administration and Buttigieg's bicycling commute.
    


                    “Biden didn't do a thing for four years, and Pete Buttigieg was the head. And he goes bicycling into work. He takes a bicycle to work. Can you believe? He's running the biggest air system in the world, and he takes a bicycle to work,” Trump said, surrounded by Qatari leaders.
                





            “And they say he's going to run for president. I don't see it. Who knows, right? But I don't see it.”
    


            Trump has largely ignored the long-held presidential norms of avoiding criticism domestic political opponents while traveling abroad, personally attacking his predecessor for the second day in a row.
    


                    “Biden was so bad, worst president we've ever had by far. There was never a president like this. This man was grossly incompetent, and now that's been proven, but people were able to see how bad it is, and it gave me a mandate.”
                





            As he visits a region where a free press is not guaranteed, Trump called the media “enemies.”
    


                    “This has been a very historic trip. I watched some of the people talking about it, and even what I would perceive as enemies of ours, people that are not fair from the press, are saying it's been amazing,” he said, later referencing an outlet he described as an “enemy paper.”
                





            President Donald Trump on Thursday continued to express hope for a nuclear agreement with Iran, suggesting progress even as he warned of a “violent step” if a deal is not reached.
    


                    “Iran has sort of agreed to the terms: they're not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust. We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.”
                





            He reiterated that Iran “can't have a nuclear weapon” and suggested that negotiators are “getting very close to maybe doing a deal.”
    


            His top foreign envoy Steve Witkoff held a fourth round of talks with Iranian counterparts on Sunday, with discussions expected to continue in the coming days.
    


                    Trump offered two options: “There's a very, very nice step, and there's a violent step, the violence like people haven't seen before, and I don't – I hope we're not going to have to do this. I don't want to do the second step. Some people do. Many people do. I don't want to do that step. So we'll see what happens.”
                





            Global oil prices fell after Trump's comments that the talks had made progress. A potential US-Iran nuclear deal raises the prospect of more of Tehran's oil becoming available on the global market, boosting overall supply.
    


            The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell over 3% Thursday morning to $64 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, was trading down 3.5% to almost $61 a barrel around the same time.
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered less optimistic language on Wednesday, lambasting remarks made by Trump earlier in his Middle East tour.
    


            Seated at a business roundtable with Qatari leaders, Trump vowed that the US would “protect” Iran's neighbor.
    


                    “For this country in particular, because you're right next door, you're a stone's throw away, not even, right? You're a foot away. You can walk right into Iran. Other countries are much further away, so probably it's not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country, this very special place with a special royal family.”
                





CNN's Anna Cooban contributed to this report.



            President Donald Trump said Thursday he was not disappointed by news that Vladimir Putin will not attend Ukraine war talks in Turkey, saying he didn't expect Putin to attend the talks that the Russian leader himself suggested.
    


            Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would not attend the direct talks, which were first proposed by the president in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraine's European allies on Saturday.
    


            In a subsequent post to social media, Trump called on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”
    


            On Thursday, Trump told reporters in Qatar he “didn't anticipate” Putin's participation when asked if he was disappointed by the Russian president's absence at the talks.
    


                    “No, I didn't anticipate (Putin would go). I actually said, ‘Why would he go if I'm not going?' Because I wasn't going to go. I wasn't planning to. I would go, but I wasn't planning to go. And I said, ‘I don't think he's going to go if I don't go.' And that turned out to be right,” Trump said.
                





            He continued, “I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there.”
    


            Trump repeatedly floated the possibility of traveling to Turkey to join the talks, which would have upended his Middle East trip.
    


            “I was thinking about going,” Trump said Thursday in what could be an attempt to save face, but once more kept the option open:
    


                    “If something happened, I'd go on Friday if it was appropriate.”
                





CNN's Ivana Kottasova and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.



            Donald Trump again praised Syria's interim leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa on Thursday, characterizing the former jihadist-turned-president as someone with a “strong past.”
    


                    “I met the new leader of the country, and he's got a, you know, strong past… I think he'll be a great representative, and we'll see,” Trump said at a roundtable with business leaders in Qatar ostensibly aimed at highlighting new investment in Boeing.
                





            Trump's comments underscore his frequent efforts to publicly praise and admire strongmen leaders.
    


                    “You're gonna have to have a strong past to put that one around. You can't – you cannot be a weak person. If you're a weak person, we would just be wasting time. So he's a strong guy, and I thought he was good, and let's see what happens. But we're going to give him a fighting chance by taking off the sanctions.”
                





            Trump announced Tuesday that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria following last year's fall of the Assad regime.
    


            Trump and Al-Sharaa held a key meeting Wednesday in Riyadh as the US explores the possibility of normalizing diplomatic relations with Syria.
    


Some background: Until recently, al-Sharaa had a $10 million US bounty on his head. Once known by his militant nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, he was placed on the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist list in 2013 for heading al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. But in 2016, he broke away from the group, according to the US Center for Naval Analyses.

            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected remarks made by Donald Trump during his Middle East tour, saying the US president is “naive” for thinking Iran will give in.
    


                    Trump “is naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands. We will never negotiate our dignity. This is in the blood of every Iranian,” Pezeshkian told academics on Wednesday, according to Iranian media.






            “You have tried to bring Iran to its knees for the past 47 years. We have existed for thousands of years and will continue as one for the years to come.”
    


Some context: At the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh on Tuesday, Trump called Iran the “biggest and most destructive” of forces in the Middle East, saying “enemies get you motivated.”
    


            Trump's comments come amid nuclear talks between the US and Iran. Trump said he wants to sign a nuclear deal with Iran, but that there will be a price to pay if Tehran rejects a deal.
    


                    “If Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure,” Trump said.
                





            Trump repeated his threats on Wednesday, saying he doesn't want nuclear talks in Iran to take a “violent course.”
    


                    “I mean, two courses, there's only two courses. There aren't three or four or five, there's two. There's a friendly and a non-friendly, and non-friendly is a violent course, and I don't want that. I'll say it up front. I don't want that, but they have to get moving.”
                





            Pezeshkian said “Iran will continue its progress with or without a deal.”
    


            President Donald Trump is “open to virtually any mechanism to get us to a just, enduring and lasting peace” in Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Antalya, Turkey.
    


            Rubio also repeated the Trump administration's position that there is “no military solution” to the war started by Russia's invasion of its neighbor in 2022.
    


            Trump is not going to Turkey to mediate today's expected meeting between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul. He had repeatedly hinted that he might upend his Middle East trip to join negotiations after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be “grateful” for his presence and Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin would “like me to be there.”
    


Putin is also skipping the talks.
    


            The US and Saudi Arabia inked a $142 billion defense partnership on Tuesday.
    


            Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf countries such as Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are among the top 15 largest importers of weapons globally. A large proportion of their imports comes from the US.
    


            American companies, led by Lockheed Martin, are the largest producers of arms worldwide.
    


            Kathy Warden, CEO of Northrop Grumman, and Kelly Ortberg, CEO of Boeing, joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, alongside other American business leaders, at a lunch in Riyadh's Saudi Royal Court on Tuesday— according to a list provided by the White House.
    


            President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday after the US leader said that he planned to lift sanctions on Syria.
    


            CNN's Becky Anderson explains why the meeting was so significant:

An opulent welcome: Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani greeted US President Donald Trump atop a red carpet.
    


            Then Trump's motorcade was escorted through the streets of Doha by a cavalry of red Tesla Cybertrucks, a nod to the president's senior adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
    


            The motorcade was greeted at Amiri Diwan, the administrative offices of the emir, by dozens of mounted camels and Arabian horses.
    


            Seated in plush, gilded chairs at a tea ceremony, the emir lavished praise on his guest, saying Trump was “the first American president to officially to visit Qatar.”
    


A Boeing deal: Economic deals totalling more than $243 billion between the US and Qatar were announced, including an agreement for Doha to purchase jets from US manufacturer Boeing for Qatar Airways.
    


            A White House fact sheet said it was a $96 billion agreement to acquire up to 210 American-made Boeing planes, contradicting Trump, who said the deal was worth $200 billion and included 160 jets.
    


            Boeing could use the help; it has faced a string of safety incidents and financial troubles in recent years.
    


            The deal was inked days after Trump said he planned to accept a Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to be used initially as Air Force One — raising legal, ethical and security concerns and drawing widespread criticism.
    


            The Qatari prime minister and minister of foreign affairs told CNN's Becky Anderson the offer was simply a “government-to-government transaction,” not a personal gift to Trump, adding that the matter was “still under legal review.”
    


Other agreements signed in Qatar: Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth signed defense agreements, including a statement of intent on cooperation between the countries. Hegseth also signed offer and acceptance letters for MQ 9B aircrafts and FS-LIDS. And Trump signed a joint declaration of cooperation between the two countries.

Follow:


            Days of speculation that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky could meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Turkey have ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on the idea, confirming that the Russian leader had decided not to show up for talks he himself suggested.
    


            The possibility of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was not entirely off the table as of Thursday morning, however, with lower-level delegations from both countries known to be in Turkey.
    


            A direct meeting would be a major development – the two sides are not known to have met directly since soon after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
    


            And while the talks are unlikely to yield immediate results, and almost certainly won't bring the elusive “deal” US President Donald Trump has been promising since his return to the White House, they could still have a major impact on the future of the war – if Trump decides that Putin's no-show is a sign of his unwillingness to end the war.
    


            Adding to the general uncertainty over how a day of high-stakes diplomacy might unfold, Zelensky is sitting down with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in southern Turkey for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers.
    


            Here is what we know.
    


            The talks were first proposed by Putin in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraine's European allies on Saturday, when the leaders of Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom demanded that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face a new round of “massive” sanctions.
    


            Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead “direct talks” between Russia and Ukraine.
    


            This was likely a delaying tactic by Putin  – something he has successfully deployed several times in the past.  But it appears to have backfired.
    


            The Europeans and Ukraine initially said there could be no talks before a ceasefire is agreed, but that quickly changed when Trump got involved. In a post on social media, he publicly urged Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”

            Putin wasn't suggesting a one-on-one with his loathed Ukrainian counterpart. He said he wanted a restart of the talks that took place in the spring of 2022 and were attended by top-level diplomats, but not the leaders themselves.
    


            But Zelensky raised the stakes by announcing he would travel to Turkey himself and calling on Putin to do the same. The Ukrainian leader made it clear that he would not meet with any other Russian official, arguing that “everything in Russia depends on Putin.”
    


            Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, added to the pressure by suggesting he might go as well, “if it's helpful.” That idea was endorsed by Zelensky, who said Ukraine would be “grateful” for Trump's presence. Trump also told CNN on Wednesday that Putin would “like me to be there.”
    


            But two White House officials told CNN that Trump was not planning to travel to Turkey. “I was thinking about going,” Trump said Thursday in Qatar, but stressed it wasn't a firm plan. He kept the option open, though, adding: “If something happened, I'd go on Friday if it was appropriate.”
    


            By putting the ball in Putin's court, Zelensky placed the Russian leader under pressure.
    


            If Putin had decided to show up, he would have undermined his own narrative that Zelensky and his government are illegitimate.
    


            But by staying at home, Putin gave Zelensky an opportunity to point out, once again, that Russia is not serious about peace.
    


            This message is aimed squarely at Trump. Kyiv and its European allies have long said they don't believe Putin is seriously interested in negotiating peace.
    


            Trump has previously repeatedly expressed his belief in the opposite, although he began expressing his doubts in recent weeks, questioning whether Putin wants peace after speaking to Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral in the Vatican last month.
    


            Highlighting this is likely the key reason why Zelensky suggested a personal meeting with Putin, who, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence services, had previously ordered his assassination.
    


            The two sides are so far apart that it is unclear what the talks – if they indeed happen – would be about.
    


            Zelensky said on Tuesday that anything other than an agreement on an unconditional ceasefire would be a failure.
    


            Putin, meanwhile, said that while Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict.
    


            The “root causes” he cites include long-held Russian grievances that include the existence of Ukraine – formerly part of the Soviet Union – as a sovereign state, and NATO's eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.
    


            Neither is negotiable for Ukraine or its allies.
    


            The last known direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Turkey and Belarus in the spring of 2022 – when it became clear that Putin's initial plan to take over the whole of Ukraine and install a new puppet government in Kyiv within a few days had gone catastrophically wrong.

Ukraine ceasefire call is aimed at forcing Putin to reveal his war goals to Trump



            This left Russia scrambling, trying to achieve its goals through negotiations.
    


            The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said the agreement that was proposed by Moscow called for Ukraine to surrender its sovereignty and would have made Ukraine completely powerless in the face of any future attacks.
    


            Once Ukrainian forces began liberating parts of northern Ukraine, finding clear evidence of massacres and other atrocities as they advanced, the talks started to collapse.
    


            The Russian abuses uncovered in one town in particular – Bucha, just north of Kyiv – horrified the world and hardened the resolve of the Ukrainian people.
    


            Shortly after Zelensky challenged the Russian leader to travel to Turkey, the Kremlin started to lay the groundwork for the possibility that Putin might not attend.
    


            The Kremlin late Wednesday said Vladimir Medinsky, Putin's senior aide and member of the country's Supreme Council bureau, would lead a delegation of Kremlin insiders. The aide previously headed Russia's delegation in 2022 when Kyiv and Moscow had their last known direct talks.
    


            This is in line with Putin's call for the talks to pick up where the meeting in 2022 stopped – an option that would be unpalatable to the Ukrainians since the demands Russia was making back then would amount to a capitulation by Kyiv.
    


            The stakes are higher this time though, as both Trump and Ukraine's European allies have said they will impose more sanctions on Moscow if it doesn't agree to the ceasefire.
    


            It's not yet clear whether Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul to meet with the Russian negotiators and who might be part of it.
    


            Not much. The Turkish government said earlier this week that it was prepared to provide “all kinds of support, including mediation and hosting negotiations, to achieve peace” in Ukraine.
    


            Turkey has played the role of the bridge between Moscow and Kyiv in the past, most notably when it brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative which guarantees the safe passage of Ukrainian ships carrying food exports – a rare diplomatic success in the brutal conflict. Russia withdrew from the pact in 2023.
    


            As a NATO member, Turkey is invested in the conflict, but it is also seen as more amenable to Russia, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously hailing his “special relationship” with Putin.
    


            Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and his foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul this week, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, a statement confirmed by another source familiar with the plans.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also in Turkey, attending the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya.
    


            Rubio, Kellogg and Witkoff all took part in some of the previous rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia, in which they acted as intermediaries, meeting separately with the Russian delegation and then, a few days later, with the Ukrainians.
    


            This time, the possibility that the two delegations might meet face to face is significant – even if their goal is more about satisfying Trump than reaching an actual deal.

NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart, which became the nation's largest retailer by making low prices a priority, has found itself in a place it's rarely been: Warning customers that prices will rise for goods ranging from bananas to car seats.

Executives at the $750 billion company told industry analysts Thursday that they are doing everything in their power to absorb the higher costs from tariffs ordered by President Donald Trump. 

Given the magnitude of the duties, however, the highest since the 1930s, higher prices are unavoidable and they will hurt Walmart customers already buffeted by inflation over the past three years.

Trump's threatened 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days. 

Those higher prices began to appear on Walmart shelves in late April and accelerated this month, Walmart executives said Thursday. However, a larger sting will be felt in June and July when the back-to-school shopping season goes into high gear. 

“We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first quarter sales.

Rainey emphasized that prices are rising not just for discretionary items such as patio furniture and trendy fashions, but for basic necessities as well. The price of bananas, imported from Costa Rica, rose from 50 cents per pound, to 54 cents. He thinks car seats made in China that currently sell for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100. Baby strollers are also sourced from China, Rainey said.




Higher prices arrive as many Americans pull back on spending as they grow increasingly uneasy about the economy. 

Government data Thursday revealed slowing sales growth for retailers. Walmart says that its consumers have become cautious and selective. 

Tariffs on China and other countries are threatening the low-price model at the core of Walmart's success.

Retailers and importers had largely halted shipments of shoes, clothes, toys, and other items due to new tariffs, but many are resuming imports from China in the narrow window that opened during the temporary “truce” this week, hoping to avoid sparse shelves this fall. Yet retailers, already operating on thin margins, say they have no choice but to raise prices to offset higher costs from tariffs. And they are also bracing for higher shipping costs fueled by a surge of companies scrambling to get their goods on ships to the U.S.

Rainey told The Associated Press that the retailer did not pause shipments from China as a result of the tariffs like others because it didn't want to hurt its suppliers and wanted to keep merchandise flowing. It has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart's merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries now accounting for roughly 60% of Walmart's U.S. business.

Still, Walmart isn't immune.

CEO Doug McMillon told analysts Thursday that Walmart imports general merchandise from dozens of countries. But China, in particular, represents a big chunk of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys.

Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia are raising costs on groceries like avocados, coffee and roses, in addition to bananas, company executives said. Walmart is absorbing costs on general merchandise within departments and has yet to pass along rising costs in some cases. 

Walmart is also asking suppliers to swap input materials for components if possible, for example, using fiberglass instead of aluminum, which Trump hit with tariffs in early March. 

“We're very dependent upon imports for these types of products,” Rainey told The Associated Press.

He said there are some goods for which Walmart simply can't shift production or produce easily in the United States. 

Walmart earned $4.45 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year.

Adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, exceeding the 58 cent projections from industry analysts, according to FactSet. 

Revenue rose 2.5% to $165.61 billion, just short of analyst estimates. 

Walmart's U.S. comparable sales — those from established physical stores and online channels — rose 4.5% in the second quarter, though that's slowed from a 4.6% bump in the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase in the third quarter of 2024. . 

Business was fueled by health and wellness items as well as groceries. Sales were weaker in home and sporting good, which was offset by robust sales of toys, automotive goods and kid's clothing, the company said.

Global e-commerce sales rose 22%, up from 16% in the previous quarter. 

Walmart said it expects sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% in the second quarter.

Like many other U.S. companies, however, it did not issue a profit outlook for the quarter because of the chaotic environment, with stated U.S. tariff policies changing constantly. The company maintained its full-year guidance issued in February.

▶ Follow live updates of Thursday's oral arguments before the Supreme Court over Trump's birthright citizenship order

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Thursday weighed whether to allow President Donald Trump's restrictions on birthright citizenship to temporarily take effect in most of the country, even if they might ultimately be found to violate the Constitution.

The justices heard arguments in the Trump administration's emergency appeals over lower court orders that have kept the citizenship restrictions on hold across the country. Nationwide, or universal, injunctions have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts to remake the government and a mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.

Judges have issued 40 nationwide injunctions since Trump began his second term in January, Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court at the start of more than two hours of arguments.

Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis, after lower courts acted to slow the president's agenda. 

The justices are also considering the Trump administration's pleas to end humanitarian parole for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and to strip other temporary legal protections from another 350,000 Venezuelans. The administration remains locked in legal battles over its efforts to swiftly deport people accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term that would deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are in the country illegally or temporarily.




The order conflicts with a Supreme Court decision from 1898 that held that the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment made citizens of all children born on U.S. with narrow exceptions that are not at issue in this case.

States, immigrants and rights group sued almost immediately, and lower courts quickly barred enforcement of the order while the lawsuits proceed.

The current fight is over the rules that apply while the lawsuits go forward.

The court's liberal justices seemed firmly in support of the lower court rulings that found the changes to citizenship that Trump wants to make would upset the settled understanding of birthright citizenship that has existed for more than 125 years. 

Birthright citizenship is an odd case to use to scale back nationwide injunctions, Justice Elena Kagan said. “Every court has ruled against you,” she told Sauer.

But if the government wins on today's arguments, it could still enforce the order against people who haven't sued, Kagan said. “All of those individuals are going to win. And the ones who can't afford to go to court, they're the ones who are going to lose,” she said

Several conservative justices who might be open to limiting nationwide injunctions also wanted to know the practical effects of such a decision as well as how quickly the court could reach a final decision on the Trump executive order.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Sauer with a series of questions about how the federal government might enforce Trump's order.

“What do hospitals do with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn?” he said.

Sauer said they wouldn't necessarily do anything different, but the government might figure out ways to reject documentation with “the wrong designation of citizenship.”

Kavanaugh continued to press for clearer answers, pointing out that the executive order only gave the government about 30 days to develop a policy. “You think they can get it together in time?” he said.

The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has complained that judges are overreaching by issuing orders that apply to everyone instead of just the parties before the court.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor was among several justices who raised the confusing patchwork of rules that would result if the court orders were narrowed and new restrictions on citizenship could temporarily take effect in 27 states.

Some children might be “stateless,” Sotomayor said, because they'd be denied citizenship in the U.S. as well as the countries their parents fled to avoid persecution.

New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing 22 states that sued, said citizenship could “turn on and off” for children crossing the Delaware River between Camden, New Jersey, where affected children would be citizens, and Philadelphia, where they wouldn't be. Pennsylvania is not part of the lawsuit.

One possible solution for the court might be to find a way to replace nationwide injunctions with certification of a class action, a lawsuit in which individuals serve as representatives of a much larger group of similarly situated people.

Such a case could be filed and acted upon quickly and might even apply nationwide.

But under questioning from Justice Amy Coney Barrett and others, Sauer said the Trump administration could well oppose such a lawsuit or potentially try to slow down class actions.

Supreme Court arguments over emergency appeals are rare. The justices almost always deal with the underlying substance of a dispute.

But the administration didn't ask the court to take on the larger issue now and, if the court sides with the administration over nationwide injunctions, it's unclear how long inconsistent rules on citizenship would apply to children born in the United States.

A decision is expected by the end of June.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's delegation was made up of the most senior officials “to take any decisions that might lead to the expected and just peace”, and accused Russia of sending a ‘decorative level' delegation, with Russian President Vladimir Putin not attending. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it's delegation was “ready for serious work”.

The Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin met with top Russian officials late Wednesday to “prepare for the upcoming negotiations with the Ukrainian side.” Video shared by Kremlin showed Putin entering the room with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other Russian top officials seated at the table.

Donald Trump says he and Vladimir Putin need to get together to solve the Ukraine war. Trump says he doesn't “believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together.”

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he didn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin would go to talks in Turkey with Ukraine if he wasn't there. Trump made the remarks at a business roundtable in Qatar on his trip to the Middle East.





























ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Russia and Ukraine are set to hold their first direct peace talks in three years, both countries said Thursday, but hopes for a breakthrough remained dim after Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned an offer by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face in Turkey.

Zelenskyy said he is sending a team headed by his defense minister from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul to meet a Russian delegation, even though Moscow's side doesn't include “anyone who actually makes decisions.” 

Few had expected Putin to show up in Turkey, and his absence punctured any hope of significant progress in efforts to end the 3-year-old war that was given a push in recent months by the Trump administration and Western European leaders. It also raised the prospect of intensified international sanctions on Russia that have been threatened by the West.

Zelenskyy, speaking to reporters in Ankara where he flew Thursday after challenging Putin to sit down with him, accused Moscow of not taking efforts to end the war seriously by sending a low-level negotiating team that he described as “a theater prop.”

AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey.



His proposal to Putin came after a flurry of maneuvering last weekend as each side sought a diplomatic advantage.

The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said in Istanbul the representatives were ready to meet Ukrainian officials.




“The task of these direct negotiations with Ukraine is to establish long-term peace sooner or later by eliminating the root causes of this conflict,” he said in a brief statement.

It was not clear when they might meet. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the talks will go ahead on Friday, citing an unidentified source.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was due in Istanbul in Friday.

Zelenskyy, who heads Friday to Albania for a gathering of European officials, said he had decided to send the delegation to Istanbul to demonstrate to U.S. President Donald Trump that Ukraine wants to end the fighting.

The Ukrainian side would be headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and its aim is “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war — namely, a ceasefire,” he said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier welcomed Zelenskyy to the presidential palace in Ankara before holding their own talks. 

The war has killed tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides and more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the U.N., and continues along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts say.

At least five civilians were killed and 29 injured in the past day, according to authorities in five eastern regions of Ukraine where Russia is trying to advance.

The diplomatic maneuvering began Saturday when European leaders met Zelenskyy in Kyiv and urged the Kremlin to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire as a first step toward peace. Putin responded early Sunday by proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul. Then came Zelenskyy's challenge to Putin for face-to-face talks.

After days of silence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov finally said Thursday that Putin had no plans to travel to Istanbul in the next few days.

Trump said he was not surprised that Putin was a no-show. He had pressed for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet but brushed off the Kremlin leader's decision not to attend.

“I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there,” Trump told reporters at a meeting with business executives in Doha, Qatar, on the third day of his visit to the Middle East.

Trump said a meeting between him and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock.

“I don't believe anything's going to happen whether you like it or not, until (Putin) and I get together,” he said on Air Force One while traveling from Doha to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. “But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.”

Peskov said Putin has no plans to meet with Trump in the coming days.

Medinsky, Putin's aide, is leading the Russian team that also includes three other senior officials, the Kremlin said. Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as “experts” for the talks in Istanbul.

Also absent from the talks were Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, both of whom represented Russia at talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia in March.

The top-level Ukrainian delegation included Umerov, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, and the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official said. Zelenskyy will sit at the negotiating table only with Putin, said presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

Putin met Wednesday with senior government officials and members of the delegation in preparation for the talks, Peskov said. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, General Staff chief Valery Gerasimov, and National Security Council secretary Sergei Shoigu attended. 



The Kremlin billed Thursday's talks as a “restart” of peace negotiations that wer held in Istanbul in 2022 but quickly collapsed. Moscow accused Ukraine and the West of wanting to continue fighting, while Kyiv said Russia's demands amounted to an ultimatum, not something both sides could agree on. That delegation also was also headed by Medinsky.

Putin's proposal came after more than three months of diplomacy kickstarted by Trump, who promised during his campaign to end the war swiftly — although it's been hard to pull off. The Trump administration in recent weeks indicated it might walk away from the effort if there was no tangible progress soon. 

Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, met with Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday night in the Turkish city of Antalya, which is hosting NATO foreign ministers to discuss new defense investment goals as the U.S. shifts its focus to security challenges away from Europe.

Sybiha reaffirmed Ukraine's support for Trump's mediation efforts and thanked the U.S. for its continued involvement, urging Moscow to “reciprocate Ukraine's constructive steps” toward peace. “So far, it has not,” Sybiha said. 

On Thursday morning, Sybiha also met with other European foreign ministers, including his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot, who in a post on X reiterated the call for a ceasefire and the threat of “massive sanctions” if Russia doesn't comply. 

“We're in a very difficult spot right now, and we hope that we can find the steps forward that provide for the end of this war in a negotiated way and the prevention of any war in the future,” Rubio said Thursday. 

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Putin of “standing in the way of peace.”

“There was only one country that started this conflict -- that was Russia. That was Putin. There's only one country now standing in the way of peace -- that is Russia, that is Putin,” he said in a visit to Tirana, Albania.

Barrot echoed that sentiment: “In front of Ukrainians there is an empty chair, one that should have been occupied by Vladimir Putin,” he said. “Vladimir Putin is dragging his feet and in all evidence does not want to enter into these peace discussions.”

UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan greeted Trump, and the pair had a short meeting.

President Donald Trump arrived in the United Arab Emirates Thursday for the last leg of his first major foreign trip. Air Force One was given a fighter jet escort into the country's airspace, just as Saudi Arabia and Qatar offered on the first stops of his Mideast trip.

Trump was greeted by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and later headed to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque — among the largest mosques in the world. He is to attend a state dinner at the presidential palace in Abu Dhabi.

What to know:



That's after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to attend the talks, hosted by Turkey, and sent only a low-level Russian delegation instead. That helped scuttle hopes that the talks in Turkey could see Putin get together with President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to potentially jumpstart efforts for a ceasefire.

“I think it's abundantly clear that the only way we're going to have a breakthrough” is for Trump and Putin to talk directly, Rubio said.

Rubio spoke Thursday in Antalya, Turkey, where he said he would confer with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakam Fidan and the Ukrainian delagation on Friday in Istanbul. 

Rubio said the low-level Russian delegation would be meeting Friday with other members of the U.S. team and that he hoped all sides could meet together.

Ukraine has sent more senior officials to the talks in Turkey, as Ukraine stresses its cooperation with U.S. efforts to broker an agreement.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke as he prepares to travel to the Vatican this weekend to celebrate new Pope Leo XIV inaugural Mass.

Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, who are the highest-ranking Catholics in the administration, will both attend the Mass on Sunday. Speaking to reporters in Antalya, Turkey after a NATO foreign ministers meeting, Rubio maintained that there was no daylight between the administration's migration polices and the new pontiff, the first American pope, who has spoken out about the mistreatment of migrants.

“I think there is nothing incompatible,” he said. “We, too, are compassionate towards migrants. I would argue there's nothing compassionate about mass migration. There's nothing compassionate about open borders that allows people to be trafficked.”

Rubio rejected concerns that deportations to a notorious terrorism facility in El Salvador put migrants at risk for torture and other abuse, saying such charges were incorrect and that groups that have complained are “wrong.” 

He also said the people sent to El Salvador were not migrants, but rather “criminals” who their home countries would not accept.

At the end of the public portion of the meeting, Trump was awarded a medal known as the Order of Zayed, named for the U.A.E.'s first president.

It was presented for Trump's “exceptional efforts” to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.The bulky necklace was delivered in a display case, which he held with Sheikh Mohammed.

The meeting between the two leaders began with flattery.

Trump said “we've been good friends” and described the sheikh, known by his initials MBZ, as “a truly great warrior.”

He also boasted about his leadership of the United States.

“We've become a very hot country,” Trump said. “We were not such a hot country six months ago.”

Vice President JD Vance paid tribute to fallen police officers at a memorial service Thursday at the U.S. Capitol and used his speech to criticize local officials and “far left prosecutors” who were not tough enough on crime and the “defund the police” movement.

“I know that none of us here like crime, but last year, in November, I think the American people killed the ‘defund the police' movement and they used Donald J. Trump as the murder weapon,” Vance said at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday.

Vance said the administration would do everything to help the families of fallen officers and “never disparage or degrade our police officers, and particularly not the memory of those who died defending our society.”

Vance delivered his remarks at the Capitol where four years ago on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol, leaving more than 100 police officers injured.

Trump has repeatedly downplayed the violence, lauded the rioters as patriots and on his first day back in office, pardoned more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in the attack, including people convicted of assaulting police officers.

The president arrived at the Qasr Al Watan, a palace in Abu Dhabi.

He was greeted by children waving U.S. and U.A.E. flags, plus an honor guard that included camels.

Trump is participating in a tour led by the Arab country's first astronaut. He's also going to sit down with Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and receive a medal of honor from his hosts.

After the meetings, he'll attend a banquet dinner, his third of the trip. He was previously hosted in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

The Thursday dinner will be at Qasr Al Watan, the sprawling and ornate presidential palace in Abu Dhabi.

The white-domed palace, parts of which were opened to the public in 2019, includes a vast library and a room housing gifts from world leaders.

Rubio, Syrian Foreign Minister Assad al-Shaibani, and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fiden and their delegations, including Sen. Lindsey Graham on the U.S. side, were to discuss plans for Syria's reintegration into the Middle East and global communities, the State Department said.

The meeting in in Antalya, Turkey — which follows Trump's meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa earlier this week in Saudi Arabia and Trump's pledge to lift all sanctions against Syria —was closed to journalists and no details were immediately available.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he'll send the team headed by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov to the Turkish city of Istanbul for peace talks with a Russian delegation.

Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Turkish capital Ankara that the Russian delegation doesn't include “anyone who actually makes decisions.”

But he said that to demonstrate to President Trump that Ukraine is seeking an end to the 3-year-old war, he decided to send officials from Ankara to Istanbul for the meeting.

Their aim is “to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation, the first steps toward ending the war — namely, a ceasefire.”

A bipartisan group of House representatives introduced the bill aimed at keeping the country's most advanced chips from China by requiring them be tracked.

The bill comes as the U.S. is competing with China to lead the race of artificial intelligence, in which advanced chips are crucial for computing powers. It also comes as the Trump administration has moved to rescind export controls on advanced chips. Lawmakers have expressed concerns that chips were smuggled to China despite export controls.

“This bipartisan bill closes those gaps with real safeguards to keep our most advanced chips out of the wrong hands,” said Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China.

Leading the effort is Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, who said technical tools are available to keep U.S. AI technology from wrong parties.

The bill would require chip exporters to track their chips subject to export controls and report to the federal government if their products should be diverted from their intended location or get tampered with.

Rubio met with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Antalya, Turkey to discuss U.S. “efforts to halt the senseless bloodshed in Ukraine,” the State Department said. Rubio also “emphasized that European leadership is critical for getting Russia and Ukraine to negotiate in good faith for a swift and durable peace settlement,” it said.

The meeting comes as confusion has mounted over the status of the peace plan even as direct talks between Ukraine and Russia are supposed to be held this week in Turkey.

The mass is Sunday. Vance, who's formally leading the U.S. delegation, will be accompanied by second lady Usha Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and his wife, Jeanette Rubio.

Both Vance and Rubio are Catholic, and Vance's office says he's the first Catholic convert to be vice president.

Vance met Pope Francis, the current pope's predecessor, shortly before the pontiff's death April 21.

“It's beautiful,” Trump said. He also thanked his tour guides. “Very proud of my friends.”

The president sidestepped a reporter's question on whether Israel has been an obstacle to peace talks in Gaza.

Instead, Trump said “we're working very hard on Gaza,” which he described as “a territory of death and destruction for many years.”

He repeated his proposal to “make it a freedom zone,” and “let the United States get involved”

“I'd be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone, let some good things happen,” Trump said.

Trump had his shoes off, which is customary, as he stepped into the iconic house of worship, the country's largest mosque. Trump and Abu Dhabi's crown prince paused for a photo.

Air Force One was escorted by Emirati F-16 fighter jets as it entered the country's airspace, flying over the man-made Palm Jebel Ali archipelago in southern Dubai.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar both also offered the same escort on Trump's trip.

The house of worship is a vast monument to the United Arab Emirates' official religion and has hosted other heads of state before, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

It's also an important symbol of national identity. The UAE's founder, Sheikh Zayed, is buried in the mosque's main courtyard.

U.S. wholesale prices dropped unexpectedly in April for the first time in more than a year despite President Trump's sweeping taxes on imports.

The producer price index — which tracks inflation before it hits consumers — fell 0.5% last month from March and rose 2.4% from April 2024, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale prices dipped 0.4% from March and rose 3.1% from a year earlier.

Economists had expected that producer prices rose modestly in April. A 0.7% drop in services prices brought the index down.

On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 2.3% last month from April 2024 — smallest year-over-year gain in more than four years.

Economists have predicted that Trump's tariffs would drive up prices, and many expect the effect to show up in June or July.

Democratic Sen. Andy Kim is expected Thursday to introduce a bill he co-sponsored with Sen. Jeff Merkley that would resurrect the Presidential Management Fellows Program, which was wiped out earlier this year by one of Trump's executive orders.

“I believe that public service and serving our nation is an honorable pursuit that should inspire and attract the very best talent in our country,” Kim said in a statement.

A former fellow himself, he added: “The PMF program has for years operated under both Republican and Democratic Presidents to lift up merit and align skills with opportunity. Even in these divided times, I hope we can show strong bipartisan support for the importance of talent in government and the need to codify this important program in legislation.”

The program was created by a 1977 executive order issued by then-President Jimmy Carter to entice highly qualified workers with advanced degrees to join the federal government. The bill being introduced lines up with the requirements that were in place at the time the program was dissolved, including graduate level degrees as well as the expectations for future government employment.

As he made his way from Doha Qatar to Abu Dhabi, United Emirates, on Thursday, the president reminded reporters about Joe Biden's 2022 fist bump with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

During that encounter, Biden awkwardly greeted the crown prince with a fist bump, a moment roundly criticized by human rights activists, who were already upset at Biden's decision to meet with the Saudi leader.

Trump noted that while in Saudi Arabia and Qatar this week, he's shaken many hands.

“They were starving for love because our country didn't give them love,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “They gave him a fist bump. Remember the fist bump in Saudi Arabia? He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia … and he gives him a fist bump. That's not what they want. They don't want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”

Trump's trip to the United Arab Emirates come as Senate Democrats push that wealthy Gulf country to stop what the U.S., U.N. and international rights groups say are arms shipments to one of the sides in Sudan's devastating war.

The U.S. has sanctions on UAE companies over weapons deliveries to Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, whose fight with a rival has uprooted millions of Sudanese and spurred atrocities and starvation. Aid groups call it one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

UAE's arms deliveries also are raising the risk of a “broader conflict that could destabilize the whole region,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said this week.

Ahead of Trump's trip, “my message to the UAE is to stop extending the aid” and work to stop the fighting, Shaheen said.

The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it has strenuously denied despite evidence to the contrary.

The president insists he's not disappointed with Russian President Vladimir Putin for not showing up for peace talks in Istanbul with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“I don't believe anything's going to happen whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled from Doha, Qatar, to Abu Dhabi, United Emirates, on Thursday. “But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.”

President Donald Trump's comment Thursday about not wanting to make “nuclear dust” in a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities mirrors the concerns of the Gulf Arab countries he's visiting in the Mideast this week.

The possibility of a U.S. or Israeli strike on Iranian enrichment sites has renewed the long-standing fears that Gulf Arab states have about Iran's program. In the past, they've worried that an accident or a strike at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant could send radioactive material into the air and spread across the Persian Gulf into their countries.

Speaking to a business forum on Thursday, Trump similarly brought up the idea.

“Iran has sort of agreed to the terms: They're not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust,” Trump said. “We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.”

Iran has criticized the U.S. threats to strike.

A Qatari newspaper editor said President Donald Trump's visit to an air base in the country showed it is “very important” in the Middle East.

Faisal Almudahkha, the editor-in-chief of the Gulf Times, told Al Jazeera English immediately after Trump's visit to Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar that it helps the U.S. project power as well as protecting the energy shipments coming out of the Persian Gulf region, and Qatar itself.

“The base plays a very big part of the stabilization of this region,” Almudahkha said. “Let's face the truth: We are a small nation with a lot of ambition.”

He added Qatar also provides intelligence and diplomatic advice to the U.S.

President Donald Trump has boarded Air Force One to leave Qatar.

Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar's ruling emir, met him at the steps of Air Force One to say goodbye.

Trump climbed the stairs, turned around and then pointed at the emir and waved.

Trump now heads to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

President Donald Trump has ended his speech to U.S. troops at the Al-Udeid Air Base, dancing for a moment to the Village People's “YMCA.” 

Trump pointed to several people in the crowd and waved. He then raised his fist in the air going off stage, as service members filmed his exit with their phones.

Standing in front of U.S. troops at the Qatari airbase, President Donald Trump said “we let a lot of four stars go,” touting his administration's effort to thin the military's top ranks.

There's long been friction between Trump and some top generals, and he's been more emboldened to remake the command structure in his second term.

He described some military leaders as “frickin' losers” as he addressed the rank-and-file.

President Donald Trump is speaking to troops at the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

He started his speech thanking troops and discussing his Mideast trip so far, then spoke about America's military power.

“As president, my priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power if it's necessary to defend the United States of America or our partners,” Trump said. “And this is one of our great partners right here” in Qatar.

He added: “When we're threatened, America's military will answer our enemies without even thinking about it. We have overwhelming strength and devastating force.”

Trump swayed, his fists up, during the song's chorus, drawing cheers.

The assembled troops at the airbase stood up, most holding up cellphones to take pictures and videos of Trump.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asserted that “wokeness and weakness” allowed the wars in the world.

“We're restoring the warrior ethos. No more political correctness,” he told troops at Al-Udeid Air Base, before President Donald Trump takes the stage.

“Sadly, over the last four years, we saw a collapse in Afghanistan. And what happened on October 7th, the war in Ukraine, violence unleashed by wokeness and weakness.”

President Donald Trump has arrived at the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where he is expected to address U.S. troops and view a demonstration of American air capability in the region.

The base was a major staging ground during the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It houses some 8,000 U.S. troops, down from about 10,000 at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

This post has been edited to paraphrase offensive and racist jokes.

American comedian Theo Von did a set Thursday before President Donald Trump's visit to a military base in Qatar that included a joke about a mixed-race baby and drugs as well as one that compared the base's Qatari hosts' attire to Klansman robes.

The jokes drew laughter and some groans from the service members at Al-Udeid Air Base, home to the forward headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command.

Von did an extended one-on-one podcast interview with Trump during last year's presidential campaign in which they discussed addiction and the opioid crisis

President Donald Trump kept up pressure Thursday on Iran, warning Tehran that a deal over its nuclear program or potentially airstrikes are the only two solutions to the diplomatic impasse.

Speaking in Qatar before business leaders, Trump said: “We'd like to see if we could solve the Iran problem in an intelligent way, as opposed to a brutal way. There's only two: intelligent and brutal. Those are the two alternatives.”

President Donald Trump has suggested that India has offered to drop tariffs on U.S. goods to zero, something not immediately acknowledged by New Delhi.

Trump made the comments during a business roundtable in Doha, Qatar, on his Mideast tour, first discussing Apple's plans to build manufacturing plants for its iPhone there.

“It's very hard to sell into India and and they've offered us a deal with what basically they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said. India is a close partner of the U.S. and is part of the Quad, which is made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia, and is seen as a counterbalance to China's expansion in the region.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he didn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin would go to talks in Turkey with Ukraine if he wasn't there. Trump made the remarks at a business roundtable in Qatar on his trip to the Middle East.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he didn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin would go to talks in Turkey with Ukraine if he wasn't there.

Trump made the remarks at a business roundtable in Qatar on his Mideast trip.“I didn't think it was possible for Putin to go if I'm not there,” Trump said.

Trump had suggested he could travel there for the talks if Putin was going. On Thursday, however, Trump said: “I actually said, why would he go if I'm not going? Because I wasn't going to go. I wasn't planning to go. I would go, but I wasn't planning to go. And I said, I don't think he's going to go if I don't go.”

It has been a particularly good week for Boeing. The American aerospace manufacturer confirmed a $96 billion order from Qatar, one day after announcing an order from a company in Saudi Arabia for 20 737-8 jets and options for 10 additional aircraft.

The Qatar deal, which includes Boeing's 787 and 777X jets, is the biggest order for 787s and wide body jets in Boeing's history, the company confirmed. Shares of Boeing, which has been mired in legal and regulatory problems since the crashes six years ago, bounced to their highest level in more than a year Wednesday. It was the fifth straight day of gains for the company.

Boeing had already been in the news for its planes in the Middle East, but for different reasons. Donald Trump said he would accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar, setting off intense criticism from Democrats, ethicists, and even some unease among Republicans.

President Donald Trump has attended a business forum in Qatar.Trump sat with GE Aerospace's Larry Culp and Boeing Co.'s Kelly Ortberg on either side of him on Thursday. Both praised Trump for his support for the Qatar Airways order for Boeing aircraft. Ortberg called it one of the largest orders Boeing has ever had.

A hospital in southern Gaza says 54 people have been killed in overnight airstrikes on the city of Khan Younis.

Qatar's satellite news channel Al Jazeera has long been a powerful force in the Middle East, often taking editorial positions at odds with America's interests in the region during the wars that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al-Qaida.

But during President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf Arab nation this week, state-funded Al Jazeera muted its typical critiques of American foreign policy.

The channel, which broadcasts in Arabic and English, broadly covered Trump's visit in a straightforward manner, highlighting it was the first-ever trip to Qatar by a sitting American leader. Mentions of the Israel-Hamas war, which Al Jazeera often has criticized America over for its military support to Israel, did not include any critiques of U.S. policy. Instead, journalists highlighted Qatar's role as a mediator in the war and aired comments by Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, calling for a ceasefire.

The president then travels to the United Arab Emirates, the final leg of his first major foreign trip. He will head first to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and then to a state visit hosted at Abu Dhabi's Qasr al-Watan palace.

After a morning meeting with top U.S. and Qatari officials and American defense and aerospace business leaders, Trump heads to Al-Udeid Air Base, a U.S. installation at the center of American involvement in the Middle East. There, he will address troops and is expected to view a demonstration of American air capability.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Cristeta Comerford, a longtime White House executive chef who recently retired after nearly three decades of preparing meals for five presidents and their guests, says first families are “just regular people” when they're at home in the private living areas of the executive mansion. 

“It's not what you see on the news,” she told The Associated Press in an interview. 

Preparing the first families' meals was among Comerford's many culinary responsibilities. Meals mostly would be prepared in the main kitchen, then finished off in the residence kitchen on the second floor.

“At the end of the day, when you do the family meals upstairs, they're just regular people at home. They just want a good meal. They want to sit down with their family,” she said. “If they have children, they eat together. And just to see that on a daily basis, it's not what you see on the news. 

“It's the other side of them that we get to see,” she said. 




Comerford, who hung up her apron and chef's toque in July 2024 after nearly 20 years as top chef and nearly three decades on the kitchen staff, is the longest-serving chef in White House history. Her tenure spanned the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

Each of the five families she served approached food differently, Comerford said at a recent White House Historical Association symposium on food and wine. She was asked whether she'd describe any of the presidents as “real foodies.”

The Clintons liked healthier meals, Comerford said. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton hired the first American executive chef, Walter Scheib, and had the kitchen avoid serving heavy sauces and creams. 

She said, “I learned so much” about Southwestern cuisine from Bush, the former Texas governor who liked Tex-Mex food. “We made thousands of tamales for Christmas,” she said of the popular Mexican meal of stuffed corn dough wrapped in a corn husk and steamed until cooked. 

Comerford got ideas from the vegetable garden Michelle Obama started when she was promoting healthy eating, primarily for children. “We used the garden as kind of like our backbone for our menu development,” she said.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump are “very, very classic eaters,” she said. Mrs. Trump “loved Italian food, so we tend to do the pastas, but light ones.” Comerford didn't comment on President Trump's food choices, but he is known to like a well-done steak served with ketchup and fast food.

Jill Biden was the first Italian American first lady, and the kitchen did “a lot of Italian food, as well, because she loved Italian food.”

Overall, “it's different for each family,” said Comerford, “but my job as the chef is to execute their style, their likes and their preferences.” 

A black-tie state dinner is the highest diplomatic honor the U.S. reserves for its close allies. 

Comerford presided over 54 of these opulent affairs, including for France and Australia during Trump's first term. Sometimes, guest chefs were brought in to help. 

State dinners give presidents the opportunity to bring together hundreds of guests from the worlds of government, politics and other industries for an evening in which the three-course meal, decor and entertainment are designed to help foster relations by dazzling the visiting foreign leader.

The first lady's staff and the social secretary typically have about two months to pull one together. 

Comerford said her team started by researching the visiting leader's likes and dislikes, then she used the information to create a menu using the best of American food while incorporating nuances from the country being recognized. 

She'd develop at least three different menus. Then came tastings for the first lady to make a final decision. 

Comerford, 62, started her career tending a salad bar at a Chicago airport hotel before working as a chef at restaurants in Austria and Washington. Scheib, then the White House executive chef, hired her in 1994 for a temporary gig preparing a state dinner for Nelson Mandela, South Africa's newly elected president.

Scheib then hired her as an assistant chef in 1995, and she succeeded him a decade later, becoming the first woman and first person of color to permanently hold the executive chef's position. Comerford is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in the Philippines.

Her husband, John Comerford, is a chef, too, and she credits him with sacrificing his career to be present for their daughter so she could thrive in hers. Their daughter is a pastry chef. 

When Comerford retired, assistant chef Tommy Kurpradit, whose parents are from Thailand, was named interim executive chef. Melania Trump, who worked with Comerford in the first Trump administration, has not named a successor.

Comerford said she managed everything with “a lot of prayers,” often said during her hourlong, early morning drive into the White House, but also by being versatile, humble, able to handle chaos and having faith in herself and her team. 

“One thing with cooking at the White House, you don't just do fine dining meals,” she said. “You have to know how to cook eggs and breakfast. You have to know to cook a smashburger.” 

It also helps to remember that the job is about the family.

“There's no ego in it,” Comerford said.

White House culinary history includes chefs from China, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand, as far back as the 19th century, according to Adrian Miller and Deborah Chang, co-authors of a new book, “Cooking to the President's Taste: Asian Heritage Chefs in White House History.” 

Most sharpened their skills through service in the U.S. military.

Before Comerford, Pedro Udo, a Filipino trained in the U.S. military, was the first Asian heritage chef to run the White House kitchen after he was promoted from meat chef to head chef in June 1957, according to the book. He prepared meals for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip later that year, and for Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in September 1959 during the Cold War. 

But his stint ended after less than four years when the new first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, hired acclaimed French chef René Verdon in early 1961.

Miller said the book offers a “unique window” on the presidency.

“We get a look at the presidents, but also the presidents got a look at Asian American life in maybe ways that they hadn't before,” he told the AP in an interview. “And I think, you know, for the presidents that decided to open that window and find out more about the people who were providing, comforting them through amazing food, I think our nation is better for them.”

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor has lost access to his email, and his bank accounts have been frozen. 

The Hague-based court's American staffers have been told that if they travel to the U.S. they risk arrest.

Some nongovernmental organizations have stopped working with the ICC and the leaders of one won't even reply to emails from court officials. 

Those are just some of the hurdles facing court staff since U.S. President Donald Trump in February slapped sanctions on its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, according to interviews with current and former ICC officials, international lawyers and human rights advocates.

The sanctions will “prevent victims from getting access to justice,” said Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.

Trump sanctioned the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant.

Judges found there was reason to believe that the pair may have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny.



Staffers and allies of the ICC said the sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for the tribunal to conduct basic tasks, let alone seek justice for victims of war crimes or genocide. 

A spokesperson for the ICC and for Khan declined to comment. In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions “constitute serious attacks against the Court's States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.”

The February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC's 900 staff members from entering the U.S., which is not a member of the court. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with “financial, material, or technological support.” 

The sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel's leaders.

The ICC had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing ICC prosecutor Eric Iverson, who is fighting the sanctions in U.S. courts. Iverson filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking protection from the sanctions. 

Iverson “cannot do, what I would describe as, basic lawyer functions,” said Allison Miller, who is representing Iverson in the suit. 

American staffers at the organization, like Iverson, have been warned by its attorneys that they risk arrest if they return home to visit family, according to ICC officials. Six senior officials have left the court over concerns about sanctions. 

One reason the the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organizations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by U.S. authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers.

Microsoft, for example, cancelled Khan's email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country of the U.K. have been blocked. 

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. 

Staffers at an NGO that plays an integral role in the court's efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of U.S. bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration. 

Senior leadership at two other U.S.-based human rights organizations told the AP that their groups have stopped working with the ICC. A senior staffer at one told the AP that employees have stopped replying to emails from court officials out of fear of triggering a response from the Trump administration.

The cumulative effect of such actions has led ICC staffers to openly wonder whether the organization can survive the Trump administration, according to ICC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

One questioned whether the court would make it through the next four years.

Trump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, issued his sanctions order shortly after re-taking office, accusing the ICC of “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.” Washington says the court has no jurisdiction over Israel.

Trump's order said the ICC's “actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces.” He said the court's “malign conduct” threatens “the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. 

Netanyahu has dismissed the ICC's allegations as “absurd,” and Israel's Knesset is considering legislation that would make providing evidence to the court a crime. 

Israel launched its offensive after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting scores of others. Hamas is believed to be holding about two dozen hostages.

Inside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the U.S. radar.

This is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump's ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court's investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the U.S. military was operating in the country. 

President Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later. 

Three lawsuits are now pending from U.S. court staff and consultants against the Trump administration arguing that the sanctions infringe on their freedom of expression. Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution. But if other U.S. citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint. 

Meanwhile, the court is facing a lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters. 

The ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries – including two in the European Union – have refused to execute warrants issued by the court. 

Also in recent months, judges have banned Khan from publicizing his requests for warrants in several investigations. The first such ban, imposed in February and obtained by AP, targeted warrants in the court's investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan. Subsequent orders, also seen by AP, include a ban on the publication of warrant requests in the investigation into crimes in the Palestinian territories.

The court was already facing internal challenges. Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the AP. 

Khan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him.

Justice Kagan blasted U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on the birthright citizenship executive order— which she noted has yet to succeed in any federal court, including cases heard by Trump-appointed judges.

Justice Elena Kagan grilled U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer on the practicalities of ending universal injunctions on Thursday, a major sticking point in a highly watched case centered on birthright citizenship and the power of lower courts to rule against the executive branch. 

Kagan pressed Sauer Thursday on the practicalities of ending universal injunctions and how the higher court should then be tasked with managing the flow of lower court challenges. 

She also noted that the Trump administration has been ""losing uniformly"" in lower court cases on the ""substantive question"" in dealing with birthright citizenship.

""If I were in your shoes, there's no way I'd approach the Court with this case!"" Kagan quipped.

After he attempted to answer, she responded that ""This is not a hypothetical – this is happening out there.""

The order reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their mother is unlawfully present or temporarily in the country, and if their father is neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. Trump's action remains on hold nationwide pending Supreme Court intervention. 

A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025, according to a Fox News data analysis.

'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Matt Towery and Ari Fleischer discuss President Donald Trump's latest poll numbers.

A new national poll released this week is one of the first to indicate a bump up in President Donald Trump's approval ratings after a steady edging down in the president's numbers since he returned to office in January.

Trump stands at 44% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday (May 12-13). The president's approval rating edged up two points – which is within the survey's sampling error – from the previous Reuters/Ipsos national survey, which was in the field late last month.

US-CHINA TRADE TRUCE IGNITES STOCK MARKETS

Likely fueling the modest increase in the president's overall approval rating is his performance on the economy. The new poll indicates 39% of adults nationwide give Trump a thumbs up on how he is handling the economy, up three points from last month.

The new poll was conducted amid this week's surge in the stock markets following a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff, and in the wake of last week's signing of an initial trade deal with the United Kingdom – which is the first since Trump implemented massive tariffs on friends and foes across the globe six weeks ago.

WHAT'S IN THE TRADE TRUCE WITH CHINA

Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

(Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP)

However, as Trump has partially reversed course in recent weeks by easing back on his sharpest trade moves, public concerns about recession have also slightly eased, while still remaining at heightened levels.

Sixty-nine percent questioned in the new poll said they were worried about a recession, down from 76% a month ago. Additionally, concerns about the stock market dropped seven points, to 60%.

Veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News that the president has ""been very clear-eyed about the fact that you are going to have to break some eggs to make an omelet and his voters will give him the latitude to do so.

""We're still less than 150 days in, he's got some time to make the hard calls that have to be made and still give the economic plane runway to take off ahead of the midterms, which is when all of these early decisions will be graded,"" Reed added.

WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL

Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president's poll position when he started his second tour of duty in the White House nearly four months ago. 

Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recent Fox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.

 (Fox News )

An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around four points, but that is a slight improvement from late last month.

The economy, and inflation in particular, were pressing issues that kept former President Joe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency, and which greatly contributed to Trump's White House victory last November.

They were behind Trump's slide in the polls so far this year.

""Trump's return to office did not begin as he and his supporters had hoped. Campaign promises about inflation and interest rates appeared deferred while the daily news coverage focused on the many distractions plaguing the White House,"" longtime political scientist and analyst Wayne Lesperance noted.

However, Lesperance, president of New England College, said that ""signs of progress may be emerging. Possible trade deals with Britain, China, and India are providing hope that some good may come from his tariff strategy. Add to that a rebounding stock market and lower gas prices at the start of summer vacation season and the president may see some calming of public nervousness.""

Fox News' David Spunt reports the latest on the case. Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley also weighs in during 'The Faulkner Focus,' and discusses the latest on backlash over a Wisconsin judge's arrest.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday in a challenge to President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, a case that could more broadly call into question the powers of lower courts to block executive branch actions.  

It's unclear when the justices will rule, but their decision to fast-track the case means an opinion or order could come within weeks – or even days.

Justices across the ideological spectrum appeared to agree Thursday that the use of universal injunctions has surged in recent years – blocking actions by both Democratic and Republican presidents.

""In the first Trump administration, it was all done in San Francisco,"" Justice Elena Kagan said. During the Biden years, ""it was all done in Texas,"" she added, underscoring how both sides have used the tactic to challenge sitting presidents.

Kelsi Corkran, representing private plaintiffs and advocacy groups, proposed a middle-ground approach: allowing universal injunctions when government actions violate fundamental constitutional rights. If lower courts do get ""ahead of their skis,"" she said, appeals courts can still rein them in, just as they do now.

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer used the bulk of his opening arguments Thursday to reiterate the government's view that universal injunctions exceeded lower courts' Article III powers under the Constitution, noting that the injunctions ""transgress the traditional bounds of equitable authority,"" and ""create a host of practical problems.""

Universal injunctions ""require judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions,"" he said. ""They operate asymmetrically, forcing the government to win everywhere,"" and ""invert,"" in the administration's view, the ordinary hierarchical hierarchy of appellate review. ""They create the ongoing risk of conflicting judgments.""

During a five-minute rebuttal period, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Sauer on what authorities the courts, under their argument, would have in this scenario. 

""Your theory here is arguing that Article III and principles of equity [clause] both prohibit federal courts from issuing universal injunctions to have your argument,"" she said, adding: ""If that's true, that means even the Supreme Court doesn't have that power.""

Justice Elena Kagan, meanwhile, pointed out the practical challenge of expecting the Supreme Court to weigh in on every issue now handled by lower courts, which have already faced hundreds of federal lawsuits during Trump's second term.

Kagan also noted to Sauer that the Trump administration has lost every federal lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship executive order, including under judges Trump appointed during his first term. ""This is not a hypothetical; this is happening out there,"" she said. ""Every court is ruling against you.""

""If I were in your shoes there's no way I'd approach the Supreme Court in this case,"" said Kagan, who in fact had previously served in Sauer's exact role as U.S. solicitor general.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also appeared skeptical, telling the Trump administration lawyer that their argument seems to ""turn our justice system, in my view at least, into a kind of ‘catch me if you can regime' … where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's rights.""

As expected, several conservative justices on the court expressed skepticism about the use of universal injunctions.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who in 2018 described their use as ""legally and historically dubious,"" noted Thursday that it was not until 1963 that the first universal injunctions were used, appearing to agree with the government's assertion that they could survive without them.

But Justice Samuel Alito, for his part, expressed a somewhat surprising degree of skepticism. 

He asked Sauer about the possibilities of plaintiffs seeking emergency class certification, and de facto nationwide relief via other avenues, to highlight the point that blocking universal injunctions would not resolve the practical problems raised by the government.

And if that's the case, he said, ""then what is the point of this argument about universal injunctions?""

New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing the states, acknowledged that there could be alternative remedies for federal courts other than nationwide injunctions – though he suggested that in certain cases, the class action alternative presented by the Trump administration may not move fast enough to grant relief in certain cases.

""We are sympathetic to some of the concerns the United States has about percolation, about running the table in particular cases,"" he said. ""We just don't think that that supports a bright line rule that says they're never available.""

He suggested they should be available in certain cases, including the one currently before the court on birthright citizenship – a case where the ""alternative ways of remedying the harm for the parties are not practically or legally workable.""

Roberts and Sotomayor questioned Feigenbaum more in depth on how to determine in what cases universal injunction should not be the preferred remedy and how to ensure district courts are following that.

Justices on the high court agreed in April to hear the case, which centers on three lower courts that issued national injunctions earlier this year blocking Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The order reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny automatic U.S. citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their mother is unlawfully present or temporarily in the country, and if their father is neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at time of birth. Trump's action remains on hold nationwide pending Supreme Court intervention. 

The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court in March to review the case, arguing that the three lower courts in question had exceeded their authority in issuing the universal injunctions.

President Donald Trump also weighed in on the case directly in a post Thursday on Truth Social. ""Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America,"" he said, arguing that the law is about the ""babies of slaves"" and has nothing to do with illegal immigration.

As it turned out, the oral arguments had very little to do with the merits of the birthright citizenship challenge and focused instead on nationwide injunctions.

""These injunctions exceed the district courts' authority under Article III [of the Constitution] and gravely encroach on the President's executive power under Article II,"" U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer told justices on the high court in a filing before arguments began.  ""Until this Court decides whether nationwide injunctions are permissible, a carefully selected subset of district courts will persist in granting them as a matter of course, relying on malleable eye-of-the-beholder criteria."" 

Plaintiffs told the high court that there is no reason for them to intervene here, objecting both to the executive order in question, which one lawyer described in a brief as ""citizenship stripping,"" as well as any effort to block the nationwide injunctions. The lower court orders ""preserve the status quo that has existed for more than a century, and the federal government suffers no harm, much less irreparable harm, by continuing to follow long-settled laws while the appeals proceed,"" Nicholas Brown, the Attorney General of Washington state, said in its filing. 

Oral arguments are expected to focus not only on the lower courts that blocked Trump's birthright citizenship order – but also on whether federal judges can issue universal injunctions halting executive actions nationwide. The Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the practice, though several conservative justices, including Justice Thomas, have raised concerns.

A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025, according to a Fox News data analysis.

The consolidated cases before the court are Trump v. CASA, Trump v. the State of Washington, and Trump v. New Jersey.

Two travelers from Arizona speak to Fox News Digital about the four letters ""SSSS"" that may be printed on your airline boarding pass.

Many Americans are planning to take to the skies to get to their destinations this summer.

Ahead of the season, American Airlines announced that for the period between May 16 and Sept. 2, over 715,000 flights have been booked — with July 6 predicted to be the most-traveled day.

American Airlines is looking to take some of the anxiety away from some of those flights by introducing new technology for customers with connections.

""If the airline determines it can delay the flight without any impact on the airline's schedule, we will propose a short hold to get those connecting customers onboard,"" the airline announced in a press release.

The technology will first be rolled out at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport hub in Texas to ""identif[y] departing flights with connecting customers who might miss their flight.""

The technology ""helps automate and enhance existing processes to hold certain connecting flights so the airline can help even more customers make their connections and get to their final destinations,"" the press release also notes.

Following the first rollout, American Airlines plans to expand the test to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, followed by other hubs over the summer.

Heather Garboden, chief customer officer at American Airlines, said in the press release, ""Expectations are high when customers are traveling for their hard-earned summer vacations.""

A 31-year-old Russian national was charged with smuggling biological material after TSA at Boston's Logan Airport allegedly found clawed frog embryos and embryonic samples in her luggage.

Kseniia Petrova, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of smuggling goods into the U.S., according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. Petrova was originally detained on Feb. 16, 2025 after a law enforcement canine alerted its handler to her luggage. 

The U.S. Attorney's Office said on Wednesday that Petrova allegedly denied having the biological material at first but later admitted to carrying it.

Prosecutors also claim that Petrova's text messages show that she was aware that she needed a permit to bring in the clawed frog embryos and embryonic samples that were allegedly found in her luggage. In one text message exchange cited by the office, Petrova was asked whether she had a plan to get the biological material into the U.S., and she allegedly responded by saying, ""No plan yet. I won't be able to swallow them.""

RUSSIAN HARVARD SCIENTIST KSENIIA PETROVA 'KNOWINGLY' SMUGGLED ILLICIT ITEMS TO US: FEDS

However, Gregory Romanovsky, the attorney representing Petrova, said on Thursday that customs experts confirmed that his client ""did not need a permit to bring her non-living scientific samples that are not considered biological material under U.S. Customs law.""

""Yesterday's hearing in federal district court in Vermont confirmed that Customs and Border Patrol officials had no legal basis for canceling Kseniia's visa and detaining her on Feb. 16.  Less than two hours after the Vermont judge set a hearing on Kseniia's release, she was suddenly transferred from ICE to criminal custody. This is not a coincidence,"" Romanovsky said.

""It is an attempt by the government to justify its outrageous and legally indefensible position that this scientist working for the U.S. on cures for cancer and aging research has somehow become a danger to the community. The government confirmed in court yesterday its intent to deport Kseniia to Russia, where it knows she will face grave danger for opposing the Putin regime."" 

Petrova said in a recent New York Times op-ed that she was returning to the U.S. after vacationing in Paris when she was detained by ICE in February. She also expressed her fear of being arrested in Russia if deported, as she has been a critic of the war in Ukraine.

Kseniia Petrova, a bioinformatician at the Kirschner Lab, was bringing back frog embryos at the request of a professor at a French lab Harvard is collaborating with, her attorney Gregory Romanovsky confirmed to Fox News. (Kseniia Petrova's attorney Gregory Romanovsky)

While she admitted in the op-ed to not filling out a customs form regarding the frog embryos in her luggage, she believed it would result in a fine or warning, not an arrest.

""At Logan International Airport, I did not complete a customs declaration for frog embryos (for use in our lab's research) in my luggage. I'm told this would normally result in a warning or a fine. Instead, my visa was revoked, and I was sent to a detention center in Louisiana,"" Petrova wrote.

In her op-ed, Petrova claimed that colleagues said the lab—home to the world's only NoRI (short for Normalized Raman Imaging) microscope—""ground to a halt"" after her detention. 

""Without me there to help, the lab has been unable to analyze the image data that the microscope generates,"" Petrova wrote.

She also claimed that several of her colleagues are afraid of having their visa status revoked and being detained, as ""many"" are ""foreign scientists.""

On Wednesday, a federal judge grilled government attorneys on their grounds for canceling Petrova's visa and detaining her, the Times reported. The judge reportedly set a bail hearing for Petrova later this month.

Romanovsky told the NYT that he believes the government filed the criminal charge against his client ""to make Kseniia look like a criminal to justify their efforts to deport her."" He also said that he and his client were ""blindsided by the unsealing of a meritless criminal complaint,"" which came after the bail hearing was set.

Retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Rob Spalding joins ‘Fox & Friends' with insight on the president's show of ‘strength' on the world stage as he prepares to rally U.S. troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

President Donald Trump blasted President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan and cited his wish to give troops a pay raise in an address to U.S. service members on Thursday.

Trump made the comments during an address to troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar during his extended trip to the Middle East.

""My 2026 budget includes across the board – maybe you don't want to look for the good of the country, you don't have to take it – pay raises for each and every one of you. Substantial pay raises,"" Trump said.

""You are without a doubt the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. That's the way it is. I said it last night. I said it's strong. We have the strongest military in the world. It's not even a contest. We have the best equipment, nobody has equipment like us, nobody has the planes or the missiles or anything else,"" he continued.

""And as your commander-in-chief, I'm here to say that America's military will soon be bigger, better, stronger and more powerful than ever,"" he added.

Trump went on to criticize Biden, noting the deaths of 13 U.S. troops during the evacuation from Kabul, Afghanistan.

The agreements involved a purchasing agreement by Qatar for Boeing aircraft, as well as letters of intent and ""joint cooperation"" between Qatar and the U.S. The emir also signed an intent agreement to purchase MQ-9 drone aircraft.

U.S. relations with Doha have come a long way since 2017, when Trump accused Qatar of harboring terrorism: ""The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level,"" Trump said at the time.

From there, Qatar became a major non-NATO ally to the U.S. in 2022 under Biden and is home to Al Udeid Air Base, one of the U.S.'s largest Middle Eastern bases and a key hub for U.S. Central Command operations.

President Donald Trump‘s cordial approach to his Middle East counterparts has lent itself to criticism that he is failing to hold them to account for human rights abuses, as well as direct ties to terrorism.

President Donald Trump is showcasing his cordial relationship with counterparts in the Middle East during the first major foreign trip of his second administration, but critics contend he is also capitulating to them, some of whom have weak human rights records and others who have direct ties to terrorism.

Trump has always adopted an untraditional approach to foreign policy, and on this trip he has showcased his willingness to do away with conservative foreign policy orthodoxy and mix business with diplomacy.

Trump's approach represents “an uncritical embrace” of Arab leaders, but Americans have beliefs and principles, according to Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“We don't like to see people tortured or jailed for a tweet the ruler doesn't like,” Abrams, deputy national security adviser to former President George W. Bush, told the Washington Examiner. “We don't like to see women abused and denied equal rights. We don't like to see Gulf money supporting radical Islam and indeed hatred of everything we stand for. It isn't interference in their internal affairs when we stand up for American principles. Why should we take a vow of silence just because they have money to throw around?”

Democrat Tom Cochran, an alumnus of former President Barack Obama‘s State Department, agreed, particularly amid criticism of the lack of separation between Trump's business interests and those of the United States in the Middle East.

“In some circles, it might be called diplomacy,” Cochran told the Washington Examiner. “In others, it looks like diplomacy for sale.”

Trump's Middle East policy was captured by his address to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh on Tuesday, during which he repeated his desire to “end past conflicts and forge new partnerships,” “even if our differences may be profound.”

“Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use U.S. policy to dispense justice for their sins,” he told the crowd, which included the likes of Trump ally Elon Musk and Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman.

Republican strategist John Feehery was “delighted” by Trump's foreign policy after the president campaigned on being a deal-maker and “the American people don't like war.”

“There's a lot of neocon conservatives who love war, but they are not the majority of the country, and they're not the people who voted for Donald Trump for president,” Feehery told the Washington Examiner. “I would like to find ways to get peace in the Middle East so we can get our focus on China. I don't want to go to a war with China, either. I just want us to be able to focus on our competition with China.”

To that end, Trump signed a multitude of deals with Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on Tuesday after the kingdom rolled out the lavender carpet for the president, including F-15 fighter jet and Arabian horse escorts. At one point, he quipped that he sought to increase a Saudi promise to invest $600 billion in the U.S. during his administration to $1 trillion.

“Are we doing a good job so far for America? They're only putting in a trillion dollars,” Trump joked with reporters on Tuesday.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who allegedly directed the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, made the $600 billion pledge to Trump shortly after the president's inauguration in January. The White House underscored that the first tranche of deals that were announced on Tuesday, amounting to $283 billion, would strengthen “energy security, defense industry, technology leadership, and access to global infrastructure and critical minerals.”

Those deals include Saudi database management company DataVolt spending $20 billion on artificial intelligence data centers and energy infrastructure in the U.S. and the Saudi government spending $142 billion on defense equipment and services from more than a dozen U.S. companies. That spending includes air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, maritime and coastal security, border security and land forces modernization, and information and communication systems upgrades. 

But, regardless of those deals, Trump told reporters traveling on Air Force One en route to his second stop of Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday that the prospect of extraditing Saudi intelligence officer Omar al Bayoumi over his alleged connections to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks “didn't come up” with the crown prince.

Those comments come after Trump announced at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum that he was removing sanctions on Syria at the request of the Saudi crown prince and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He then met with Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council on Wednesday before departing for Doha.

Trump's meeting with Sharaa is a seismic shift in foreign policy, the first sit-down between a U.S. president and a Syrian leader in 25 years and one with a former member of the U.S.'s terrorist watch list after Sharaa was detained by the U.S. from 2006 to 2011 for his involvement with al Qaeda in Iraq. In the years since, Sharaa has tried to distance himself from the terrorist organization before leading the insurgency against former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad last year.

“Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter,” Trump said on Air Force One on Wednesday.

A White House readout of the meeting added that Trump urged Sharaa to sign on to the Abraham Accords to normalize Syrian relations with Israel, deport all foreign terrorists from Syria, including Palestinians, and help the U.S. counter the Islamic State.

“President Al-Sharaa concluded with his hope that Syria would serve as a critical link in facilitating trade between east and west, and invited American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas,” the White House said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has raised concerns about Trump's Syria policy, imploring the president to proceed with caution and advocating congressional oversight.

“Waiving congressionally passed sanctions is a complicated process,” Graham told Jewish Insider. “While I would like to empower the new players in Syria, it has to be done in a coordinated fashion with our allies — especially our friends in Israel — so that numerous security concerns can be addressed.”

Concerns have also been raised regarding reports Sharaa proposed that Trump build a Trump Tower in Damascus, Syria, which the president downplayed en route to Doha.

“No, that I haven't heard,” he told reporters. “We'll have to wait a little while until things calm down, a little while with the country.”

That report comes after this week's criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike that Trump is considering accepting a luxury $400 million Boeing 747 from Qatar as a temporary Air Force One because of delays with Boeing for two replacement planes. Trump remains adamant that it is for the U.S. government, through the Defense Department, though he will eventually receive it through his presidential library. 

“I thought it was a beautiful gesture. Now, there are those that say we shouldn't be accepting gifts to the Defense Department, and I would say only a stupid person would say that. Why wouldn't we do that?” Trump told Fox News en route to Riyadh on Monday. “It helps us out because we'll have a relatively new plane instead of having 40-year-old planes. These planes are 40 years old, and that's not representative of our country.”

Trump signed a joint declaration and defense agreement with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani in Doha on Wednesday that included a $1.2 trillion economic exchange, $243.5 billion of which was announced during the trip. The president was also present for Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg signing a deal with Qatar Airways and GE Aerospace for up to 210 jets worth $96 billion.

“Get those planes out there. Get them out there,” Trump said.

The defense agreement included a $1 billion deal with Raytheon for counter-drone capabilities and a $2 billion one with General Atomics for the MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft system, in addition to a statement of intent identifying $38 billion in possible investments for burden-sharing at Al-Udeid Air Base, the U.S.'s largest military installation in the Middle East, which is near Doha.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is in for a rude awakening if it passes the House, as Senate Republicans are already threatening to tear apart the progress made during difficult negotiations.

The legislation, which sweeps together Trump's tax, border, and defense priorities, has torn apart the Republican conference ahead of a House vote planned for next week. Republicans cannot agree on a slate of issues, from Medicaid reform to the state and local tax deduction demanded by blue-state lawmakers.

The infighting could jeopardize the strict time frame Republicans have set to send the legislation, which includes a hike in the federal debt ceiling, to Trump's desk. The administration wants to see it passed by mid-July to avert the prospect of default.

But Senate Republicans are also making clear they won't be content with the House bill as it stands, complicating the delicate balance leadership must strike with narrow majorities in both chambers. Fiscal hawks are unhappy with the relatively modest changes to Medicaid, including the delayed enactment of work requirements, while centrists are reluctant to meet the $1.5 trillion in spending offsets Republicans are targeting.

“That's why I've always thought I'd like to decouple the ‘big beautiful bill' into three separates, and I'm still recommending that,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), one of the fiscal hawks demanding further spending reductions. “I'm pushing it right now.”

For now, House Republicans are focused on getting the legislation through the House. Portions of the package were debated and advanced this week through key House committees, but negotiations continue outside of that process with holdouts who can almost singularly tank the bill.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who controls the House by three votes, could need to amend the bill on the House floor before it can pass. Any changes made in the Senate would then have to be reconciled between the two chambers before a final series of votes.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) described the House's version as a “good first step” but previewed more spending cuts in the Senate, a feat that will undoubtedly prove difficult to achieve given their three-vote GOP majority. Centrists in the upper chamber are equally, if not more, resistant to Medicaid changes that pare back the program.

“I think we should cut as much unnecessary spending as humanly possible, and I am hopeful that we will see the Senate prove to be even more fiscally conservative than the House,” Cruz said. “There is a whole lot of negotiation between today and the final finished product.”

In a bid to stay on the same page, Senate leadership and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) have been in regular contact with their House counterparts to avoid last-minute conflicts.

But Crapo, the Senate's top tax writer, acknowledged that there will be some daylight between the priorities of each chamber.

“We've been working very closely together to get our work product as close together as we can,” Crapo said. “I think you'll see a significant amount of overlap, but there will be differences.”

On the tax side, there is concern about the level of green energy clawbacks included in the House bill for the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. The spending reductions are meant to pay for the tax cuts, as are reforms to Medicaid that include more frequent eligibility checks and new fees for patients.

The bill is projected to reduce Medicaid spending by $715 billion over 10 years and lead 8.6 million people to lose health coverage from a mix of policy changes and work eligibility requirements.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the Senate's loudest Republican defender of Medicaid, has made benefit cuts to the government-run health program a red line.

“The bottom line is, we need to get our savings from somewhere other than Medicaid,” Hawley told the Washington Examiner before pivoting to the climate change-related tax credits. “We ought to be looking at the Green New Deal subsidies, for instance. A lot of those are still on the House's bill. That's absurd. That's gobs of money. That's gobs of money. Why are we not cutting that? Why would we cut Medicaid but not the Green New Deal?”

Even wonky, less contentious pay-fors are facing heightened scrutiny from senators. That includes a push to auction off $88 billion in radio spectrum owned by the government to companies like Verizon.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PASS $4 TRILLION TAX CUT OUT OF COMMITTEE AS MEMBERS DEBATE SALT CAP

The House included legislation from Cruz to sell off some 600 megahertz to the private sector, but defense hawks like Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) expressed concern that the Pentagon could not afford to lose control of the airwaves.

“There are certain parts of the spectrum that are simply off limits for national security purposes,” Rounds said. “Those have to be respected. I don't think the language that they've got in the bill right now does that.”

Republicans in New York have expressed anger over a state budget proposal that could give state employees funds to cover themselves if President Donald Trump‘s Department of Justice pursues litigation against them.

The budget plan does not mention New York Attorney General Letitia James by name, but the budget sets aside $10 million to cover private defense costs for state employees who may be subject to federal investigation. The budget states that the funds are only made available so long as the investigation is “reasonably likely to have been commenced” because of that employee's work.

Republicans in the state are asking New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli not to sign off on the $10 million.

“This proposed use of public money is a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. It undermines public trust in government and sends a troubling message that elected officials and state employees are entitled to a publicly-funded legal defense, even for matters entirely disconnected from their public responsibilities,” state Senate Republicans wrote to DiNapoli in a letter obtained by the New York Post.

The letter was signed by state Senate Minority Leader Republican Robert Ortt and 21 other Republican state senators.

LETITIA JAMES SUBJECT OF ETHICS COMPLAINT TO NEW YORK STATE COURTS AFTER CRIMINAL REFERRAL

The notion in New York's budget comes after Trump's DOJ launched a “working group” designed to investigate James and other legal officials who have investigated Trump over the years. The Justice Department recently launched a criminal investigation into allegations that James engaged in mortgage fraud when purchasing homes in New York and Virginia.

James's lawyer told CBS News that the investigation “appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When then-President Joe Biden invited comparisons to Franklin D. Roosevelt during a meeting with historians, the possibility he might end up in a wheelchair while in office was surely not what he had in mind.

But FDR went down in history as a Democratic icon who changed the presidency. He was also successful in a cover-up of his physical condition over not just one but more than three terms in the White House. (Roosevelt died in office early in his fourth term.)

Despite a recent outpouring of new books about Biden's condition as he aged in the White House, including Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, which includes the wheelchair report, this cover-up was much less successful. 

Millions of voters saw Biden's age-related decline in real time and were quicker to say so than many journalists who covered him daily, including some now reporting on or even authoring books chock-full of the gory details.

There was a partisan slant to how many of these voters viewed a possible rematch between two presidents born in the 1940s. A Pew Research Center poll of adults conducted in April 2024 found that 48% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters thought Biden's age got too much media attention, while 12% believed it received too little. 

By contrast, 48% of Republicans and Republican-leaners thought Biden's age was getting too little attention and 14% said it was getting too much. Those numbers are almost exactly reversed when respondents were asked about President Donald Trump, then nearing the end of his four-year hiatus from the Oval Office. 

But the same pollster found a steady drop in voters who viewed Biden as “mentally sharp” long before his disastrous June 27, 2024, debate with Trump. Just 33% thought Biden was mentally sharp in April 2023, according to Pew. That was long before the debate or special counsel Robert Hur's report that said a jury would view the then-president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”

Pew respondents' perception of Biden's mental sharpness peaked at 53% early in his term. But from 2020 to 2024, it was usually below 50%. It declined all the way to 24% after the debate. For Trump, 50% in 2020 was the low point in the poll's findings about his mental sharpness, with that number rising to 58% after the 2024 debate with Biden.

An ABC News-Ipsos poll released in February 2024, some four months before the debate, found 86% of Americans thought Biden was too old to serve another term as president. This included most Democrats. A majority, 59%, said both Biden and Trump were too old.

A New York Times-Siena College poll in March 2024 found that a majority of Biden 2020 voters thought he was too old to be effective. As far back as the summer of 2022, that pollster had results showing 94% of Democrats under 30 wanted their party to nominate someone other than Biden for president in the next election. 

FiveThirtyEight's Kaleigh Rogers wrote nine days before Biden dropped out that the debate “didn't suddenly thrust Biden's age into the spotlight for most Americans the way it seemingly did for Democratic Party elites.”

“Though polls of the presidential election have moved toward former President Donald Trump,” she added, “answers to specific questions about Biden's age haven't changed much.”

One pollster argued at a presentation in Washington, D.C., weeks before the debate that concerns about Biden's age erased his competence advantage over Trump in the data.

Anecdotally, there was a spectrum of opinion about Biden's age. Some thought he was already too old to be president before he decided to run for reelection. Others questioned whether he would still be fit to serve at 86, which is how old he would have been if he completed a second term. People might think he was slowing down without concluding he had dementia or a serious medical problem.

TO MANY IN MEDIA, BIDEN AGE STORIES SOUNDED TOO CONSERVATIVE TO BE TRUE 

Some of the press skepticism about Biden's age worries, which reporters often treated as right-wing mis- or disinformation in conjunction with his team's “cheap fakes” narrative about video footage of the president, was likely in response to maximalist claims about his health and mental acuity. (Though it should be noted that some of the books coming out now contain reporting moving closer to those claims.)

But the desire to maintain access to Biden and not do Trump any “but her emails”-style favors aided a cover-up that only fooled the people who were paid to see through it and Democrats who wanted to be fooled.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

UnitedHealth Group said a recent media report that the Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into the embattled company is false. 

The Wall Street Journal report, citing unnamed sources, alleged that the DOJ is investigating UnitedHealth Group, the country's largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, for possible criminal Medicare fraud. After the outlet published the claims, UnitedHealth Group's stock fell by 17% early Thursday, to its lowest level in five years. 

The group slammed the outlet's report on Wednesday, saying in a statement that it is unaware of any DOJ investigation at the company.

“The WSJ's reporting is deeply irresponsible, as even it admits that the ‘exact nature of the potential criminal allegations is unclear,'” UnitedHealth Group said.

“We have not been notified by the Department of Justice of the supposed criminal investigation reported, without official attribution, in the Wall Street Journal today,” the statement continued. “We stand by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program.”

The company's latest downturn came after it had a tough year. In December, UnitedHealth Group was plunged into turmoil after the CEO of its insurance division was shot and killed in New York City by a suspect who accused the group of “parasitic” corporate greed. Since then, the group has experienced fallout over cascading claims that it wields corporate power to rip off clients.

MAN ARRESTED NEAR UNITEDHEALTHCARE HEADQUARTERS MONTHS AFTER CEO ASSASSINATED

Earlier this week, UnitedHealth Group unexpectedly announced that a new CEO would be taking the reins at the company after former CEO Andrew Witty surprisingly stepped down for “personal reasons.”

He's the American president Gulf leaders have been waiting for.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

Three years ago, Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia and was pointedly not greeted at the airport by any of the kingdom's major leaders (a mere governor of a province was the highest-ranking official who showed up). This week when President Trump landed in Riyadh, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met him at the end of the jetway, shook his hand warmly, and walked him down the purple carpet. In Qatar, his entourage was greeted by red Cybertrucks, camels, and dancers. The affection appears mutual and genuine. That is in part because Trump speaks the transactional language of the Gulf leaders he met with this week, and they appreciate him for it. As a gift, he gets a luxury jet from Qatar while U.S. citizens get … ? That remains to be seen.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk with Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, about this new era of chumminess among the American president and Gulf leaders. What does it mean that Trump has not brought up any of Saudi Arabia's human-rights violations? Is that luxury jet just norm breaking or illegal? And how might this friendship influence Trump in his dealings with Israel as its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, threatens to escalate attacks on Gaza?

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Have you been seeing the pictures of Trump on the tarmac being greeted by various royals?

Hussein Ibish: Yeah.

Rosin: I wonder if you read it this way: He seems very relaxed.

Ibish: He is very relaxed. He's home. He's come home. This is, like—outside the U.S., this is his favorite place.

[Music]

Rosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic, and that is Hussein Ibish.

Ibish: I'm Hussein Ibish, and I'm a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, and I write for many publications, especially The Atlantic.

Rosin: This week, we're watching the president's visit to the Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

The pictures we're referring to show Trump at the airport tarmac in Saudi Arabia being greeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a royal welcome. Lavender carpets. Golden swords. Arabian horses. And Trump smiling through all of it. This is a stark contrast to a few years ago, when MBS, as bin Salman is known, was a pariah in the West for his human-rights violations.

So what does Donald Trump's new approach to the Gulf states mean for our Middle East policy? And why is Trump so at home there?

Ibish: He lives in a world of patrons and clients. He lives in a world where authority is not questionable. And that's very familiar. It's a very familiar space to—especially the Saudi royals, but—all of them. And he understands them, and they understand him. And he loves them, and they love him. He can be himself, the unedited version. He doesn't have to check his instincts. He just go[es] with it. And that's kind of unusual for Trump.

Rosin: The word that seems to summarize Trump's approach is transactional. That's the word that a lot of people use. So what are Middle East leaders getting from America, and what is Trump getting from them?

Ibish: Yeah, it's pretty straightforward, right? The Middle Eastern—not leaders, but—countries, what they're getting, ultimately, is protection. They're getting military protection, which is often unsatisfactory from their point of view. But they don't really have a good alternative to the United States, so they have to try to work to make it as good as possible. And that's what they're doing. They're buying goodwill from the U.S. They're also buying weapons, which they want and need. It's not, you know, purely just gifting.

However, what Trump is getting in return is lots of money, and more for himself than for the country. There is money coming for the country. There are these large weapons sales of missiles and other things to Saudi Arabia, the biggest weapons sale in U.S. history. And the U.A.E. is looking at buying over a million semiconductor chips from Nvidia. And so on. All three countries are buying lots of American stuff, which is a big boon to Trump's bid to revitalize American manufacturing.

But there's also a grifting angle here, right? Trump is getting a lot of money for his own company. We've never seen this before. We've never seen, even in the first Trump term: The level to which this state visit is also a private-business visit is amazing, because the projects include a Trump Tower in both Riyadh and Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia; another Trump Tower in Dubai, in the U.A.E.; and a Trump International Golf [Club] and resort in Qatar. There's also a cryptocurrency scheme connected to his sons, in which a U.A.E.-linked company has just agreed to invest $2 billion, with a B—$2 billion. The company is not going to look the same after this trip. It's going to go from being a very-successful-for-its-size mom-and-pop shop built on the vast inheritance that Trump's had from his father, Fred—but now he's taking it into the stratosphere.

I mean, the amount of financial clout that's coming to his family-owned, privately held business is just amazing. And what the Arabs are doing here is buying goodwill. It's an investment. It's an investment in Trump as a friend and, you know, ultimately also with the U.S. But right now Trump has, you know, instituted l'état c'est moi: “He is the country, and the country is him.”

And until somebody stops him or until he leaves the White House, that's the way it's going to be. And this is very understandable to a group of people who deal in patron-client relations as a matter of course.

Rosin: Okay, so just to summarize, the transaction is: They get protection, and what Trump gets is money for the country and money for himself.

Ibish: Exactly. They get protection and he gets money. We get money.

Rosin: Yeah, it's very clear when you describe it: The symbol, the concrete thing that is going to symbolize this trip for a long time, is this luxury jet from Qatar. How should we understand what this transaction is?

Ibish: Well, it's the absolute—I was waiting for you to bring it up, because it is exactly the kind of icon, the avatar of this trip. It says it all.

Qatar, which is an unbelievably rich country, has 300,000—maybe 400,000—citizens. Most of the country, between 2 and 3 million people, are ex-pat laborers, foreign workers, Arab and Western technocrats. But collectively, those 350,000 or so Qataris are the largest single exporter in the world of liquid natural gas. And obviously, all of the wealth goes to the citizens. I mean, it's just amazing. You've never seen a country with this level of per-capita wealth.

And it uses that money for national interests. In this case, what they've done is: One of the former prime ministers who is a royal has a jet, a luxury Boeing 747 that's kitted out not for a president but for a wealthy man who enjoys luxury travel on his own private plane. So what the Qataris have done is they've said: You can have the plane for use as president while you're in office, and after that it will be transferred to your presidential library, meaning he could still use it after that. So it's sort of been—they've very cleverly muddied the waters or blurred the line between private and public here, in order to give this plane to Donald Trump as an individual. They can say that they haven't, that they've given it to his presidency, right?

Rosin: This is so interesting. Basically, what you're saying is this is the president that the Gulf leaders have been waiting for. Trump is the man that they can finally deal with in the way that they want to.

Ibish: Yeah. Well, in a lot of ways I think that's true. I remember a certain high-ranking—or formerly very high-ranking—Gulf individual who said just as much in 2016, after he was elected. They said, He does the same things—and he listed a bunch of verbs that were unlawful actions—and said, We do that. And he does that.

It's not, obviously, unlawful in their countries. It's normative, but traditionally not allowed in the United States and in Western countries in general. And I think this man was absolutely correct when he said, We do this and he does that, and we do this and he does that, and that they would feel very comfortable with him.

They certainly would disagree about how much pressure he should put on Israel regarding Gaza, things like that. But I was thinking yesterday that there's really no daylight between Trump's positions on all the really most-important issues and those of Saudi Arabia. You can't find a major irritant there, which is really amazing.

Rosin: Such as what? What issues?

Ibish: Well, I mean, anything you think of—the war in Ukraine, the nature of U.S.-Saudi relations, you know, how business should be conducted, the Yemen war, talks with Iran (they both want a deal). They convinced him that lifting the sanctions on Syria was a good idea. They just agree, more or less, on just about any issue. That can change overnight, because if there was a spike in oil prices, they would disagree right away.

But I was contrasting that in my mind with the problems that the U.S. and Trump have with Israel right now, where there's disagreement about Gaza, about the cease-fire with the Houthis, about the talks with Iran, about the negotiations with Hamas. There are many irritants. Now, that's not to say the U.S. is closer to Saudi Arabia than it is Israel. I don't think that's true. The Israeli relationship with the U.S. is very deeply ingrained and protected by political influence in the U.S., especially from evangelical Christians on the right.

But yeah, I think Trump is sort of ideal in many ways from, say, a Saudi point of view.

[Music]

Rosin: So now that we've established the nature of this relationship and where we are now, I want to understand what it means—to the rest of us, not to Trump and his family. So when you hear about U.S. relations with Gulf states in the past, especially Saudi Arabia, human rights enters as a factor. Not always forcefully, but it's always—

Ibish: Well, it's definitely a rhetorical factor with most administrations. Whether they're Republican or Democrat, they do bring it up. Trump doesn't—ever, at all.

Rosin: Right. So how important is that departure or shift?

Ibish: Well, I mean, MBS has learned—and one of the big questions about him when he was a young, rash leader, you know, beginning in 2015, when he came in as defense minister, and a quick rise to where he is now, which is head of government. That is to say he is the prime minister of Saudi Arabia, so he runs the government.

And human-rights issues became very serious in his early years with the arrest of the dissidents, the sort of adventure in Yemen that was ill-advised and badly done, to put it mildly, and also the jailing of important people who are not perhaps on board fully with the changes—the reforms, the social liberalization, or other concerns that MBS had about them—who were jailed at the Ritz Carlton.

Rosin: Yeah, and of course, the 2018 murder of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded MBS ordered, although he denied it.

Ibish: I was coming to that. That's the big enchilada—right?—for many people, including me, because he was a friend of mine for 15 years. And I, you know, I was just—I'm still scarred by it, and I think I always will be.

[Music]

Ibish: MBS, what we've learned about him is that, you know, he's not a sociopath, in the sense that he's educable. The question about him was always, Is he young and, you know, rash and doing these things because he doesn't know better, or is he kind of nuts? And the answer is, No, he's educable. He's evolving. He's maturing.

Saudi Arabia remains a real human-rights violator from the point of view of human-rights norms. It executes a lot of people. Rule of law does not apply in the way we would expect. Dissidents—when they're found, when they exist—suffer, you know, arrest and imprisonment and long sentences. And even if they go as far as saying, Parts of the country should secede or leave Saudi Arabia, they can be executed. And they are sometimes. So it's not, you know, a happy story on human rights at all. But it's just way better than it was. And, you know, there are certainly more-alarming cases around the world.

Rosin: Okay, so we need to take a quick break, but when we come back, I want to talk about what this trip means for the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and U.S.'s role in them. That's when we're back.

[Break]

Rosin: Okay, we're back. So I want to put this Gulf visit in the broader Middle East context. As Trump was heading to this trip, he made a number of deals that seemed like they were trying to clear away American entanglements in the region—so the U.S. cease-fire agreement with the Houthis and Yemen, the agreement with Hamas to release the last living U.S. citizen held hostage in Gaza, and then the announcement that the U.S. was going to lift sanctions on Syria. Do you see a pattern in this series of deals? Do you see a common goal? What is it?

Ibish: Yes. I think he's trying to reduce American exposure and involvement in conflict in the region—not only in the region, but in regional conflicts.

So for example, the lifting of sanctions on Syria is a response to Gulf countries saying to him, in effect, You say you want us to handle our problems. Fine. We want to, you know, invest in Syria and build. We can't have any influence in Syria if we don't spend money there, because we don't have a militia or an army in Syria. The only way to get their attention is by investing in reconstruction and in other services where we can build constituencies of friends who will represent our interests and, by extension, yours. And we can't do that if every time we write a check, we have to worry about the Treasury Department slamming us. So if you want us to handle our business, you gotta take these sanctions off.

The deal with the Houthis in Yemen is undoubtedly directly connected to another conflict-ending or conflict-containing policy of Trump, which is the negotiations with Iran. Trump definitely wants a deal with the Iranians, another version of the Obama peace deal—which he railed against but is trying to resurrect—but he wants it to be longer and stronger and tougher on Iran. And he can get all of that because of what happened to the Iranians under Biden.

I mean, he'll never give Biden the credit for having put Iran in this situation, but it was under his presidency that Iran was crippled in its regional status, and the biggest blow by miles was the Turkish-engineered downfall of Assad in Syria. You know, that's why the—letting the Saudis and the Emiratis and others, you know, do what they can in Syria without sanctions is part of that.

You know, he needs to take advantage of this moment of Iranian weakness and the fact that they need 20, 25 years to rebuild their power and to rethink their national-security strategy, because it was all based on the idea that Arab militia groups led by Hezbollah in Lebanon would provide a powerful forward defense against Israel and, ultimately, the United States. And that was tested and proved untrue. Hezbollah was decimated by Israel.

So Iran is in very bad shape. It needs to rethink everything, and it needs time. And Trump understands this, and Trump wants a deal because he doesn't want to be put in a situation of having to confront the Iranians militarily. And Iran wants a deal, and the only country left that doesn't want such a deal is Israel. With Obama, the Arabs were totally against it, but now they're all for it because they want calm and regional stability.

Rosin: So that is the one big, obvious point of disagreement, which you mentioned, is Israel.

Ibish: Yeah.

Rosin: This is coming at a moment when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning that he's going to escalate in Gaza. As you've been seeing this Gulf trip unfold, what do you think it means for Israel, Gaza, and America's role in all of that?

Ibish: I mean, it certainly incentivizes Trump to think very carefully about doing what he can to restrain Israel's worst impulses in Gaza.

The situation in Gaza is so dire after more than 70 days of complete blockade—no food, no medicine, no water, no electricity, no shelter, nothing, no supplies into Gaza. People have been reduced to the point of starvation. That's where we're headed here. And it's a crime—it's certainly a war crime, and it's probably a crime against humanity. What the Israelis are proposing to do is to go back into Gaza with full force, force all the population—2.2 million who are not Hamas fighters and cadres and officials—into a tiny enclave in the south, where they will be kept supposedly protected but actually kind of herded, where they'll be kept with what the UN says is very, totally inadequate plans for their food and water and medicine and shelter. Meanwhile, Israel proclaims it will scour the entire rest of the country for anything and everything connected with Hamas and destroy it. Gaza delenda est.

You know, the bottom line is: This is kind of the war that the most-extreme factions in Hamas have been waiting for. It provides them with an open-ended, long-term insurgency. Now, obviously, the Israelis can rely on brute force to crush Hamas. But I think they've started to get the hint that as long as there are Palestinians in Gaza, there will be some form of Hamas, because Hamas is not a list of people and equipment. It's a name. And if you take a bunch of Palestinians and some of them say they're Hamas, then there will be Hamas, and that's likely to persist no matter what Israel does.

And we're getting closer and closer to the end goal of where I think the logic of this for Israel goes, which is depopulation. Gaza has to be, you know, depopulated of Palestinians in order to be free of Hamas. And because the two go together in Gaza, under the circumstances.

Rosin: So given that that's the current situation, and given that Trump is now engaging in the Middle East, how does this change the calculus for how he and the U.S. engage?

Ibish: Everything that has happened in the region incentivizes him to stop the Israelis from going ahead with this plan, at least as it has been structured now. It's too extreme. It's too brutal. It's too genocidal. It's too over the top. And I really think the fact that he made such close friends again and reinforced his relationship with these countries that don't want that, both at the emotional and the strategic registers, that need it not to happen in every possible way, is really important.

It gives him every reason to hold the Israelis back and say, Guys, come on. Don't do this. Don't do this this way. Don't do it. And he's the only person in the world at the moment who has real leverage over Netanyahu, because of the nature of the Israeli-U.S. relationship.

Rosin: Yeah. Well, Hussein, this has been so clarifying. I really appreciate you helping us navigate and understand what this trip to the Gulf states might mean.

Ibish: Such a pleasure to be here. Thank you.

Some of the president's biggest allies are panning his plan to accept the luxury aircraft.

As Air Force One glided into Doha today, it was easy to imagine President Donald Trump having a case of jet envy.

Hamad International Airport, in Qatar's capital, is sometimes home to the $400 million “palace in the sky,” a luxury liner that Trump is eyeing. Qatar's royal family plans to give the plane to Trump as a temporary replacement for the aging Air Force One and then to his future presidential library after he leaves office. The Qatari aircraft was in Texas, not Doha, during the tarmac welcome ceremony that Trump received on the second stop of his Middle East trip. But questions about the gift's security and ethics have shadowed the entire week.

Trump has privately defended accepting the Qatari plane as a replacement for the current Air Force One, which dates to 1990. He has told aides and advisers that it is “humiliating” for the president of the United States to fly in an outdated plane and that foreign leaders will laugh at him if he shows up at summits in the older aircraft, a White House official and an outside adviser told us, granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The outside adviser said that Trump has also mused about continuing to use the Qatari plane after he departs the White House.

But in a rare moment of defiance, some of the loudest cries of protest about the possible gift are coming from some of Trump's staunchest allies. “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, we'd all be freaking out on the right,” Ben Shapiro, a Daily Wire co-founder, said on his podcast. “President Trump promised to drain the swamp. This is not, in fact, draining the swamp.”

Even in Washington, a capital now numbed to scandals that were once unthinkable, the idea of accepting the jet is jaw-dropping. Trump's second administration is yet again displaying a disregard for norms and for traditional legal and political guardrails around elected office—this time at a truly gargantuan scale. Trump's team has said it believes that the gift would be legal because it would be donated to the Department of Defense (and then to the presidential library). But federal law prohibits government workers from accepting a gift larger than $20 at any one time from any person. Retired General Stanley McChrystal, who once commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told us that he couldn't “accept a lunch at the Capital Grille.” Former federal employees shared similar reactions on social media.

“Those of us who served in the military couldn't accept a cup of coffee and a doughnut at a contractor site because of the appearance of impropriety,” retired Air Force Colonel Moe Davis, who also worked as a military prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay, wrote on X. “Now Trump is taking a 747 airplane from the government of Qatar for his personal use … grift and corruption run amuck.”

Read: There's no such thing as a free plane

Air Force One is the most famous aircraft in the world, an instantly recognizable symbol of American power. More than that, it's a White House in the sky, one outfitted with enough top-of-the-line security and communications equipment to run the government if needed. Famously, it harbored President George W. Bush for hours after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, keeping him protected until he could safely return to Washington. Technically, any plane a president boards gets the Air Force One call sign. But when most people think of the plane, they picture the highly modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft, with its Kennedy-era light-blue, gold, and white color scheme. (There are actually two identical versions of the plane, one of which is usually used for additional staff on long foreign trips. A smaller version is also used domestically for airports with short runways.)

Permitting a foreign government to supply the signature American aircraft strikes many people as not just unpatriotic, but also an outrageous security risk. Although U.S. relations with Qatar have improved, especially as Doha has emerged as a crucial mediator in the Israel-Hamas war, the Gulf country has previously supported terror groups. In order to be swept for listening devices and brought up to American-military standards, the Qatari aircraft would likely have to be disassembled, inspected, and then rebuilt, a painstaking process that would take years and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Boeing was supposed to deliver a replacement for Air Force One last year, but significant delays have cost the plane maker billions on the project. The White House estimated last month that a new plane might not be ready until 2029; Boeing recently said that its goal is 2027.

For some in MAGA world, Trump's decision to accept a plane from a Gulf state is the antithesis of his “America First” foreign policy. It also clashes with his economic agenda to return manufacturing jobs and projects to the United States. Laura Loomer, whose influence with Trump helped lead to a recent purge at the National Security Council, has blasted the idea, posting on X, “This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true. And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump. I'm so disappointed.” Mark Levin, another influential conservative voice, replied, “Ditto.”

Trump's eagerness to accept such a lavish gift from a Middle Eastern power has put congressional Republicans in the awkward-but-familiar position of defending a move that they would denounce were it made by a Democratic president. Some have criticized the idea—gently. “I certainly have concerns,” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told CNBC. Saying he was “not a fan of Qatar,” Cruz warned that the plane would pose “significant espionage and surveillance problems.” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also panned the offer, telling Politico that “it would be like the United States moving into the Qatari embassy.”

Others have shown more willingness than usual to break with Trump. Borrowing the president's description of his economic policy, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri told reporters that “it would be better if Air Force One were a big, beautiful jet made in the United States of America.” Senator Rick Scott of Florida was more blunt, telling The Hill: “I'm not flying on a Qatari plane. They support Hamas.” And Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming burst into laughter when asked by reporters in a Capitol corridor if accepting the jet would be a good idea.

Yet GOP leaders have shown no indication that they plan to launch anything resembling the aggressive, lengthy investigations they conducted into the foreign entanglements of Hunter Biden or, in an earlier era, Hillary Clinton. Speaker Mike Johnson tried to draw a distinction between what he characterized as the secretive dealings of “the Biden crime family” and Trump's seemingly more transparent dealmaking. “Whatever President Trump is doing is out in the open,” Johnson told reporters this morning. “They're not trying to conceal anything.”

The speaker made little pretense of disguising the fact that a Republican-controlled Congress is unlikely to probe a Republican president, no matter how questionable their actions. Whereas GOP leaders framed their investigations into the Bidens and the Clintons as the solemn responsibility of the legislative branch, Johnson's remarks today treated Congress's oversight role as almost an afterthought. “I've got to be concerned with running the House of Representatives, and that's what I do,” he said. “Congress has oversight responsibility, but I think, so far as I know, the ethics are all being followed.”

The Senate's top Democrat, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, declared that he would place a hold on all of the president's Department of Justice nominees until the possible transaction is scrutinized.

Trump seems to see no problems with accepting the gift. He called a reporter a “stupid person” for questioning its appropriateness, adding, “I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.” And in a Truth Social post sent at 2:50 a.m. local time in Saudi Arabia today, before his arrival in Doha, he wrote, “Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE.” He added, “Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country.”

When I asked the White House for further comment, a spokesperson pointed me to the president's post. Trump has been frustrated with the current Air Force One for years and had thought that the new version—which was commissioned during his first term in office—would be ready for his second.

Jonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump

For years, the large majority of Republicans have chosen to ignore Trump's efforts to capitalize on the presidency to enrich himself and his family. Despite his promises, the president never did release his tax returns or totally divest himself from his business in his first term (his two eldest sons simply took over the day-to-day operations). Trump ignored the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from accepting gifts from foreign states, sparking multiple lawsuits. Perhaps his most egregious example of pay-to-play was the Trump International Hotel, in the towering old post-office building just a few blocks from the White House. When a foreign delegation came to visit Washington, a fine way to curry favor with the chief executive was to rent a block of rooms at the hotel. And taxpayer dollars flowed into the Trump family's coffers every time he spent a weekend at one of his own resorts, and required staff and Secret Service agents to stay there.

The Trump International Hotel was sold during Trump's four years out of office, but the president's efforts to profit have become only more blatant. His business has made a move into cryptocurrency with a pair of “meme coins” and an exchange called World Liberty Financial, which issues its own token, just as Trump is in a position to back crypto-friendly legislation. An auction involving one of the meme coins, $TRUMP, concluded this week, with the top holders of the coin winning a dinner with Trump and a private tour of the White House. And American Bitcoin, a crypto-mining firm backed by the Trump sons, will soon go public, meaning that investors at home and abroad will be able to pour money into the company.

Trump's aides have focused on striking business deals while the president is in the Middle East this week—the White House announced $1.2 trillion in agreements with Qatar today, including a deal for the Arab state to buy $96 billion in Boeing jets—while also quietly trying to make headway on an Iran nuclear deal and a cease-fire in Gaza. But the trip has again cast a spotlight on the Trump family's business ties to lands not covered by his “America First” rhetoric. Trump arrived in Qatar two weeks after his son Eric Trump inked a deal to develop a $5.5 billion golf club just north of Doha. The Trump Organization has also secured new deals in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the other stops on the president's trip.

“If he can get himself a plane, he'll be laughing his way to the bank,” Anthony Scaramucci, the former Trump official turned Trump critic, told us. “But I think it's just out there as a red herring to distract from the even bigger things that he's doing for himself.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿Are phones making teens more conflict-averse?

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

A few days ago, a group of teenagers taught me the term “dry texting.”

It's anything that indicates “a change in the vibe of the conversation,” Tanisha, 18, told me. Someone who usually texts in all caps could revert to lowercase. They could text back only short replies, or comments that don't invite a response — a “conversation ender,” as Joanne, 18, put it. Dry texting is the most common way kids at her school find out someone is mad at them, Akshaya, also 18, told me. 

I was talking with the three teens — co-hosts of the podcast Behind the Screens — about something that came up on a recent episode that intrigued me. They argued that phones, texting, and social media could make it easier for teenagers to avoid conflict with each other, by providing them with numerous passive-aggressive methods of showing disapproval.

The teens' comments stuck out to me because adults typically think of phones as igniting confrontation between young people, not the other way around. One Ohio school district, for example, banned phones in schools over concerns that students were using social media to orchestrate fights.

But as much as texting and social media can amplify disputes among teens, they can also transform these disputes into something quieter, more confusing, and sometimes harder to deal with. “Tech creates these subtle fault lines in communication,” Emily Weinstein, executive director of Harvard's Center for Digital Thriving, told me. 

Behaviors like leaving someone on read, half-swiping on Snapchat, or turning off location sharing are “ambiguous signals,” Weinstein said. They could be innocent, or they could mean the sender is actually mad, an uncertainty that has teens “worrying, wondering, second- or even third-guessing what is meant.”

These ambiguities aren't unique to teens — who among us has not sent or received the dreaded “ok” text? But today's tweens and teens have also grown up enmeshed with devices in a way their elders didn't. Their formative years have been marked by lockdowns and school closures, periods when, as podcast co-host Joanne put it, “the only type of interactions we could have had were behind a screen.” What happens when a machine for sending ambiguous signals becomes an integral part of your social life?

For answers, I turned to Scholastic's Kid Reporters, a group of 10–14-year-olds who cover “news for kids, by kids.” The young journalists went to work in their respective schools, and came back with much the same observation the Behind the Screens co-hosts shared with me: phones definitely make it easier to ignore someone you don't want to talk to.

“Sometimes it's just easier to leave someone on read or not respond right away instead of talking face to face,” one 13-year-old told Scholastic reporter Aiden. “I've definitely avoided talking to someone in person and just showed I was mad by muting them for a bit. It's kinda petty but it's also how a lot of people deal with stuff now.”

“In real life you can't ghost somebody,” Scholastic reporter Xander Dorsey told me in an email. “In texting you could say ‘oh, I'll be right back.' It's much more awkward to walk off in real life.”

Teens can also express their displeasure with someone by taking them off their close friends list on Instagram, or — a more extreme step — unfollowing them entirely, Akshaya said. Online communication “makes it a lot easier to be passive-aggressive,” she explained. 

But being on the receiving end of such passive aggression, whether it's a “dry” text or message hanging there on the screen without a response, kids and experts agree: “It will trigger this anxious thinking spiral where they see that they've been left on read, and you start to wonder, are they mad at me?” Weinstein told me. “Do they hate me? Do they think I'm an idiot? Did I say the wrong thing?”

When the meaning does become clear, ambiguous signals can be even more painful than a more direct confrontation, teens say. “​​I got removed from a group chat and found out they were talking about me behind my back,” the same 13-year-old told Aiden. “I felt confused and like I wasn't even worth a real explanation.”

“It hurt even more that they didn't just come talk to me,” she added.

Passive-aggressive phone behavior is far from unique to kids. But because they're at a developmental stage in which they're extremely sensitive to what their peers are thinking and feeling about them, “they're more likely to be scrutinizing these ambiguous signals,” Weinstein said.

Adolescence is also a time when conflict resolution skills are still developing, Weinstein said. We all need those skills because “life is full of conflict,” said Darja Djordjevic, a psychiatrist who works with Stanford Brainstorm, a lab focused on mental health and digital well-being. Dealing with people who disagree with us is a crucial part of growing up.

Some fear that phones could disrupt that process. “We learn how to argue and fight productively in person,” Djordjevic said. Sending ambiguous signals over text or social media could represent “a lost opportunity for confronting things” in real life.

There's a lot of concern among adults about how phones affect social skills more generally, and while I don't always share that concern, I think it's reasonable to ask whether new forms of communication will change how teens handle (or don't handle) confrontation as they mature.

The older teens I spoke with allayed these concerns somewhat. Akshaya told me that when she and her friends were younger, “we would start removing each other from our followings if there was a big falling-out, or getting dry and stuff to avoid talking to each other.” Now that they're about to graduate from high school, though, “I don't see it as much.”

Kids also pointed out that phones can sometimes actually help them resolve a conflict. Texting “gives me time to think before responding and helps me express my thoughts more clearly,” one 12-year-old told Aiden. “Sometimes it's less intimidating to start a difficult conversation through messages, and that can help us work out the problem later.”

Teens will also often show a draft text to multiple friends before hitting send, Tanisha told me. That way, “you're more confident that that text isn't going to be something bad or anything like that, because you have other people's approval.” (With workshopping texts, however, there is a risk that “your voice kind of gets lost,” she noted.)

And avoiding confrontation isn't always the worst thing. If, for example, a kid lives in a community or goes to a school where physical fights are common, “the stakes of certain kinds of online conflict are very different than a teen who's in a context where all that might happen is someone's gonna be mad at them,” Weinstein said. For some teens, ambiguous signals could actually be a way to stay safe.

Still, just as teenagers might need tools for responding to big, loud problems like bullying, they need help dealing with the subtle fault lines their phones create as well. It starts with listening to young people about the role tech plays in their lives, Weinstein said. 

Some app features that may seem benign to adults (Instagram close friends or location sharing come to mind) can feel very different for teens, Weinstein explained. “So often, adults miss or misunderstand aspects of what teens are experiencing behind their screens.”

The kids I talked to also had advice for their peers dealing with dry texting and other ambiguous phone behaviors, much of it strikingly low-tech. Scholastic reporter Evy, 12, recommends hashing things out in person whenever possible. “Having a real conversation with them and laughing with them — that makes it so much better,” she said.

PowerSchool, a company that makes software parents and teachers use to track students' grades, was hacked last year. Now several schools have received extortion notes threatening to release private student data. 

The FDA is moving to pull prescription fluoride drops and tablets off the market. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has repeatedly criticized the mineral, but experts say many of his claims are misleading, and dentists are worried that getting rid of fluoride will increase kids' risk of tooth decay.

Amid the culture wars surrounding America's schools, politicians are no longer talking about children's actual learning, writes Dana Goldstein at the New York Times.

Both my children have been demanding repeat readings of Chloe and Maude, a picture book about what to do when a) your drawings don't look realistic, b) your friend tries to reinvent herself and you're not sure you like it, or c) you're trying to fall asleep but that one crack on the ceiling looks like a mouth.

A reader recently reached out to tell me she received an email from Google notifying her that the company's Gemini AI apps would soon be available for kids, allowing them to “create stories, songs, and poetry,” and “get homework help.” The reader found the Google email “off-putting and disturbing,” she said, “as if they are saying it's inevitable that kids will be relying heavily on AI in the future, so here's a guide on how to get them started young.”

Next week, I'll be talking with Vox senior tech correspondent — and User Friendly newsletter author — Adam Clark Estes about the role of AI in kids' lives. If you, like the reader above, have thoughts about how the kids you know use (or don't use) AI — or questions for me and Adam as we chat — let me know at anna.north@vox.com.

The administration's attack on nature, explained by a dancing chicken.

by  Benji Jones

The bird above is not your typical charismatic species. It's no bald eagle, no peregrine falcon. 

It's a groundbird known as the lesser prairie-chicken that lives in the southern Great Plains. It's not even the greater prairie-chicken, another, related avian species, that's a bit larger. 

Today, however, this bird is very much worth paying attention to. 

In 2023, lesser prairie-chickens — which are actually fascinating birds, not least for their ridiculous mating rituals — were granted protection under the Endangered Species Act, the country's strongest wildlife law. Scientists say this protection is justified: The population of lesser prairie-chickens has crashed since the last century from hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of birds to roughly 30,000 today. 

Now the Trump administration is trying to axe those extinction-thwarting protections. In a motion filed earlier this month in a Texas court, the administration argued that federal officials made an error when listing prairie-chickens under the Endangered Species Act. The listing — which makes it illegal to kill or harm the birds, with a number of exceptions — should be tossed out, the administration said. 

The move isn't totally unexpected. Prairie-chickens overlap in some areas with oil and gas drilling. And President Donald Trump has signaled that he will prioritize drilling over environmental safeguards. 

Yet it reveals that his administration will take extreme steps to undo wildlife protections if they stand in the way of his agenda. If his administration is successful in delisting the bird, it will signal that no endangered species is safe — especially those, like these chickens, that happen to live where fossil fuels are buried.

Male lesser prairie-chickens are extremely extra.

Each spring, they come together in breeding grounds called leks to dance for females, hoping to attract them as mates. They inflate large sacs on their neck, flare yellow combs above their eyes, and raise wing-like feathers behind their heads. Then they stomp their feet and start booming, producing a noise that sounds like sped-up yodeling. (These are not to be confused with the greater sage-grouse, a bird in the same family that has a similarly spectacular display.)

The Great Plains were once filled with these unusual dancing birds, which play important roles in grassland ecosystems: They provide food for raptors, spread seeds, and control insects. But in the last few centuries, prairie-chickens lost most of their habitat — largely to the expansion of oil and gas, commercial farming, housing developments, and, more recently, wind energy. Scientists estimate that the range of lesser prairie-chickens has shrunk by 83 percent to 90 percent since European settlement.

“Grasslands are the most threatened ecosystem on the continent and in the world, and nowhere more so than in the southwestern Great Plains,” said Ted Koch, executive director of the North American Grouse Partnership, a bird conservation group. 

Facing extinction as a result of powerful industries, the prairie-chicken has been caught up in a game of political ping pong. 

The government first granted them federal protection in 2014. Then, in response to a lawsuit filed by an oil-industry trade group and several counties in New Mexico, the Texas court tossed out the listing in 2015. They were officially delisted in 2016. The suit argued that in granting federal protections the government didn't adequately consider existing voluntary efforts, such as habitat conservation, to conserve the birds.

Shortly after, the Interior Department — the government agency that oversees endangered species listings — reevaluated the bird and once again determined, under the Biden administration, that it is at risk of extinction, even with those voluntary efforts in place. In 2023, Interior added the chickens back on the endangered species list. 

That brings us to the present day, when these forsaken birds could once again lose protection. 

The Trump administration is arguing that the Interior Department made a mistake when it recently listed the birds again. 

It comes down to a somewhat wonky technicality. Briefly, the Endangered Species Act allows the government to grant formal protection to a species or to a population of a species — if those populations are important on their own, and at risk. That's what the Biden administration did: It determined that there were two distinct populations of lesser-prairie chickens and it granted each of them slightly different protections. One of the populations is in the northern end of the birds' range, including Oklahoma and Kansas, and the other is in the southern reaches of its range, in Texas and New Mexico. 

Under the Trump administration, Interior claims that it didn't provide enough information to show that the two bird populations are distinct. That's reason enough to delist the birds, the administration argues, while it reviews their status over the next year. If the species is delisted — even temporarily — the government would be able to permit activities, such as energy projects, even if they might harm the bird and the endangered grasslands it's found in. 

Avian experts, meanwhile, say the reasoning behind the original listing — which was the result of months of work and more than 30,000 public comments — is sound, and these birds are very clearly in trouble. “The North American Grouse Partnership agrees completely that listing of chickens is warranted,” said Koch, a former biologist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the division within Interior that implements the Endangered Species Act.

The move to delist prairie-chickens appears to be an effort by the Trump administration to skirt wildlife regulations that some perceive to stand in the way of the oil industry, said Jonathan Hayes, executive director of Audubon Southwest, a regional office of the National Audubon Society, a large environmental nonprofit. 

“Whether it's true or not, this chicken symbolizes a challenge, or an impediment, to oil and gas development for industry,” Hayes told Vox. “We would expect this administration to push back on regulations that may or may not impact oil and gas. That's what it feels like is happening here.” 

In a statement to Vox, the Interior Department said it has an “unwavering commitment to conserving and managing the nation's natural and cultural resources…and overseeing public lands and waters for the benefit of all Americans, while prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people.”

The new administration can quibble with the technical points of the listing, Koch said, but that will do nothing to change the reality: The bird is at risk of extinction and needs to be protected. 

“Whether somebody wants to engage in debate on technicalities is up to them, but simply and fundamentally lesser prairie-chickens are threatened with extinction,” Koch said. “Delisting lesser prairie chickens on a technicality is going to do nothing to address the underlying threat to these ecosystems.”

There's no guarantee that prairie-chickens will lose protection. 

The Trump administration's motion to delist the birds came in response to a pair of lawsuits filed by both the state of Texas and groups representing the oil and livestock industries. The suits allege that the Interior Department made a mistake in splitting the birds into two distinct populations and failed to follow the best available information. (Interior's spokesperson told Vox they will not comment on ongoing litigation.)

Before Trump took office, the government was planning to defend its decision to protect the birds — and to split them up — in court, in response to those lawsuits. Now it's reversing course and agreeing with Texas and the oil industry to toss out the listing.

It's possible that the judge overseeing this case could agree to remove protections, said Jason Rylander, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. In that case, groups like his would try to appeal to block the delisting. 

The court could also tell the government to review the bird's status while keeping existing protections in place, Rylander says. 

What's key here is that the decision to list lesser prairie-chickens involved a formal rulemaking process with public input. It's not clear that the government can simply reverse its decision and yank federal protections without going through that process again.

“The government can't act in a capricious way,” Hayes of Audubon said. “It can't just blow with the wind, and that's exactly what it did here. They just changed their minds when the administration changed. I'm not sure how they will legally defend their complete 180.”

But no matter how this plays out, this effort to delist lesser prairie-chickens puts other threatened species in an even more precarious spot, especially those that live in regions with oil and gas.

One example is the endangered dunes sagebrush lizard. It's a small, scaly reptile that lives in the Permian Basin of Texas, the largest oil-producing region in the country, and nowhere else on Earth.

The state of Texas similarly sued the government after it listed the dunes sagebrush lizard as endangered last year. The suit — which asks the court to vacate the endangered listing — alleges, among other things, that the government didn't rely on the best available data to evaluate the lizard's extinction risk. That case is still pending, though environmental advocates fear that the Trump administration could side with Texas and claim it made a mistake when listing the lizard. 

Then there's the beloved monarch butterfly. 

Following decades of population decline, the government proposed federal protections for the iconic insect late last year. Monarch habitat similarly overlaps with the oil and gas industry, as well as commercial farmland. Fossil-fuel groups have already asked the Trump administration to reconsider the listing. 

“As the Trump administration is in power, we can expect that endangered species protections are going to be under attack,” Rylander said. “I think there's a chance we can stop this in court,” he said of efforts to delist the prairie-chicken, “but I think if we don't, we will see more efforts to remand and vacate listings that they [the Trump administration] don't want to have in place anymore.” 

It's important to remember that wildlife protections benefit people, Koch said. And prairie-chickens are a good example. Most of the remaining birds live on sustainably managed, private ranchlands in the Great Plains, he said. Those lands — those working grassland ecosystems — are under threat from energy development and other industries that are more profitable. 

Saving prairie chickens means saving those lands. And saving those lands benefits the ranchers that live on them, he said.

“The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to conserve the ecosystems upon which we and all other species depend,” Koch said. “People depend on grassland ecosystems, and so do lesser prairie-chickens. We need to save grasslands for both of us.”

﻿The president casts himself as Israel's greatest defender, while cutting deals with its greatest enemies.

by  Joshua Keating

What's the opposite of a “bear hug”?

That was the phrase often used to describe President Joe Biden's approach to Israel since the October 7, 2023, attacks: publicly and enthusiastically backing Israel, particularly when it comes to its wider regional conflict with Iran and its proxies, while quietly trying to restrain Israel's actions in Gaza. 

Now President Donald Trump is traveling through the Middle East this week for a multi-country tour and dealmaking bonanza that pointedly does not include a stop in Israel. (Trump has denied the snub, saying his trip is “very good for Israel.”)

The trip is the latest example of how Trump's approach to the country often seems like a mirror image of his predecessor's: He has little interest in restraining or pressuring Israel on its war in Gaza, but perhaps even less interest in supporting Israel on wider regional issues or aligning the two countries' approach to the region. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

This is still an administration that is fiercely “pro-Israel” in rhetoric and in its willingness to punish Israel's critics in America. But in practice, as he conducts his foreign policy, Trump seems remarkably unconcerned about what Israel has to say about it. 

“The one message that's consistent [from Trump] is, ‘I have plans for the region. You're welcome to be a partner, but if you prefer to be ignored, go ahead,'” said Nimrod Novik, former foreign policy adviser to the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. 

When Trump was reelected last November, the response from the Israeli government was near rapturous. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had an often fraught relationship with Biden's administration, praised Trump for “history's greatest comeback” and predicted a “powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.”

It's not hard to figure out why Netanyahu was so optimistic. During his first term, Trump, who often describes himself as the most pro-Israel president in history, took a number of precedent-smashing steps to demonstrate that support, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which is not considered the country's capital by most of the international community, and recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights.

His first term included the Abraham Accords — a series of deals, mediated by the United States, normalizing relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries — as well as the scrapping of President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal, loathed by Netanyahu's government. Even by the standards of the US-Israel relationship, Trump's approach stood out for its unconditional support. 

There were early indications that the second term would bring more of the same. For his ambassador to Israel, Trump picked Mike Huckabee, a Christian Zionist whose views on Israeli-Palestinian issues would put him on the far right even in Israeli politics. One of Trump's most notable domestic initiatives so far has been a widespread crackdown on universities and activists over last year's anti-Israel protests. Nor has his White House engaged in much Biden-style soul-searching about Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza: Trump quickly lifted the limited restrictions on arms exports to Israel and sanctions on violent West Bank settlers that Biden had put in place. His suggestion that Gaza be “cleaned out” of its Palestinian inhabitants to make room for a resort was received ecstatically by the Israeli far right. 

But when it comes to the Middle East, writ large, it's been a different story. 

Trump seems remarkably unconcerned about appearing to be on the same page as the Israelis in his approach to the region, and has repeatedly negotiated directly with Israel's main adversaries while cutting Israel out entirely.

In early March, Axios reported that Trump's envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, had been negotiating with Hamas over the release of American hostages — without coordinating with Israel, and breaking a longstanding precedent of the US refraining from direct talks with the terrorist group. 

The news created a firestorm of controversy and Boehler was removed from the talks, but just this week, Hamas agreed to release the last surviving American hostage, Edan Alexander. The negotiations that led to the release, led by Trump's all-purpose foreign envoy Steve Witkoff, reportedly came after Hamas reached out via an “Arab Americans for Trump” group. Israel learned about the talks not from the White House, but from its own intelligence services. 

It was not the only surprise Netanyahu has gotten recently. During an Oval Office meeting with the prime minister last month, Trump dropped the surprise announcement that he was dispatching Witkoff and other negotiators to begin direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program. 

Netanyahu, who learned of the talks only after arriving in Washington, DC, has pushed the US to insist on a complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program. But officials including the secretary of state and vice president have suggested they might be open to Iran maintaining some type of civilian nuclear program — effectively returning to a similar framework to the one Trump tore up in 2018. 

And while Israel welcomed Trump's decision in March to step up the US air campaign against the Houthis, the Yemeni militant group that has been firing missiles and drones at Israel as well as ships traveling through the Red Sea since the start of the Gaza war, Trump abruptly announced an end to the bombing earlier this month. He said he had received assurances from the Houthis that they would refrain from attacking US ships. (The rate at which the campaign was burning through American money and munitions also probably played a role.) Trump's announcement made no mention of Israel, even though the Houthis had attacked Tel Aviv's airport days earlier. The message was unmistakable: Israel could deal with the Houthis on their own. 

All in all, the Trump administration has been in direct talks with three of Israel's main adversaries — Hamas, Iran, and the Houthis — to cut deals without Israel's input, a nearly unprecedented situation according to longtime observers of relations between the two countries.

“I don't think there's an administration, Democrat or Republican, that has even come close to undertaking the sort independent outreach that the Trump administration has now contrived over the course of the last three months,” said Aaron David Miller, a veteran Mideast peace negotiator who served in several US administrations. 

What explains the new frostiness in the US-Israel relationship? One answer may be that Trump is simply growing frustrated with Netanyahu. If there's one consistent theme in Trump's worldview, it's skepticism about allies that, as he sees it, take more from America than they give. During his Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu, Trump brushed aside a suggestion that he should lift tariffs on Israel, saying, “We give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot. Congratulations, by the way.” 

Some Trump critics in the US have been crediting him for his approach to the relationship. The New York Times's Thomas Friedman praised the president for realizing that “Netanyahu is not our friend,” while former Bernie Sanders foreign policy adviser Matt Duss credited him with handling “Netanyahu more effectively than alleged foreign policy expert Joe Biden did.” 

Netanyahu himself is probably not the only factor here. The second Trump term has also seen the rise in influence of the so-called restrainer wing of Republican foreign policy, who want to reduce America's military footprint abroad, especially in the Middle East, at the expense of traditional hawks. 

While not uniformly anti-Israel (though some outside Trump allies like Tucker Carlson would probably qualify), the restrainers are much less inclined to think that US and Israeli interests are aligned. Vice President JD Vance, for instance, has stated that while Israel has a right to defend itself, he doesn't believe the US should be drawn into a war with Iran. 

Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, which included pointed shots at “neocons” and “nation builders,” may have been an indication of which faction is winning the battle for influence. And according to reporting by the Washington Post, former national security adviser Mike Waltz, one of Trump's most traditionally hawkish advisers, was fired in early May in part because of Trump's anger that Waltz had been in communication with the Israeli government about using military force against Iran. 

This is also not the same Middle East that Trump dealt with last time around. Israel isn't the only longstanding US ally getting snubbed on Trump's trip; previous presidents might have been expected to make a stop in Egypt or Jordan. But Trump is making a beeline for the Gulf, home of lucrative arms and computer chip deals, not to mention golf resorts and free 747s.

During Trump's first term, the Saudis and Emiratis were more or less aligned with the US and Israel on wider regional security matters — namely, the perceived danger posed by Iran. This was the context that made the Emiratis' recognition of Israel in the Abraham Accords possible. 

This time, when Trump sits down with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, he's likely to hear a different story. The Saudis and Iranians have reached a detente, and both Gulf countries have tried to extricate themselves from the long and brutal conflict with the Houthis in Yemen. Both now support a deal with Iran that would avoid war, and both supported an end to the US campaign against the Houthis. 

They're also increasingly frustrated with Israel's war in Gaza and the anger it has provoked throughout the region, including in their own populations. The scenes coming out of Gaza have raised the costs of appearing to be aligned with Israel.

“Both MBS and MBZ have his respect. He listens to them,” said Novik, now a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, of the Saudi and Emirati leaders. “They believe that what happens in Gaza doesn't stay in Gaza. It's destabilizing the region, and that's bad for business.” 

All indications are that Trump is these days more interested in what he calls the “gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi” than the winding streets of Jerusalem. 

A case in point: Both the first Trump administration and the Biden team sought a major regional deal that would tie US nuclear or security cooperation with Saudi Arabia to Saudi recognition of Israel. 

Though Trump is still calling for the Saudis — who have never recognized the Jewish state — to normalize relations, his team has reportedly dropped it as a demand for US-Saudi nuclear cooperation. If this comes to pass, it would effectively be giving up on what would be the crown jewel of the Abraham Accords process. 

All this is a dramatic shift, but it's certainly not the change that critics of Biden's support for Israel were hoping for. 

Trump has iced out the Israelis on regional diplomacy just as Israel is considering a plan for an “intensive escalation” of its military operations in Gaza. This could include the destruction of most of the enclave's remaining buildings and and would give civilians a choice between moving to a tiny “humanitarian area” or leaving — though it's not clear what countries would be willing to accept them if they did. 

Trump and his senior officials have not spoken out publicly about the plan and, according to Axios' reporting, have “effectively given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to do as he sees fit.” 

Israeli officials say the operation will begin if there is no ceasefire and hostage deal by the end of Trump's visit to the region this week, though there are few indications that Trump is actively involved in pushing for one. It seems unlikely that Trump would employ pressure tactics that Biden was unwilling to use, such as conditioning military aid or addressing the Israeli public directly about the war. 

Trump has shifted radically on policy in the past, but for the moment, his cold shoulder doesn't seem any more likely to put an end to the ongoing catastrophe in Gaza than Biden's bear hug.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Why Citadel Securities is training its developers on a coding language that hasn't even been released yet","https://www.businessinsider.com/citadel-securities-training-coders-unreleased-coding-langugage-2025-5","Thu, 15 May 2025 09:12:00 GMT","

You may think that coding languages are static, just a string of letters and numbers for humans to communicate with machines and software. But Herb Sutter, a tech leader at Citadel Securities, says otherwise.

""All the major languages that are in heavy use are living languages,"" Sutter told Business Insider. ""That's why we see C++, Rust, C, and Python continuing to evolve. Our landscape is always changing, and it's important to stay abreast of those developments.""

As a market maker, Citadel Securities needs to be ready to match buyers and sellers and provide liquidity to institutional and retail investors worldwide. The company is focused on mastering C++, because speed and execution are everything. It's considered a more specialized coding language that is often used at high-frequency trading firms and exchanges. Better use and understanding of C++ can translate to faster systems and fewer coding mistakes.

Sutter joined in 2024 from Microsoft to spearhead its training initiatives on C++, which is used extensively throughout Citadel Securities' technology. As one of the more senior technologists at the firm, it's Sutter's day job to keep up with the evolution of coding languages to make sure Ken Griffin's market maker is reaping the benefits of the latest and greatest. But even less experienced coders have something to gain by familiarizing themselves with the fresh features that come with new versions of C++; one edge is standing out in the interview process to nab a job at Citadel Securities, which can fetch up to $350,000 for jobs requiring C++ experience.

In this Q&A, Sutter discusses how the firm is embracing a new version of C++ that isn't even set to be fully released until next year, and two pieces of advice that can help engineers stand out from the crowd. It has been edited for length and clarity.

How've you been and what's keeping you busy these days?

I've been at Citadel Securities for about six months. Can you believe it? And it has been great. I've been drinking from a firehose because there's lots of exciting work to do and new things I'm being exposed to.

I've particularly enjoyed seeing how the firm is adopting the important and immediately useful elements of the new standards, even without waiting for the ink to officially dry.

One of the things I'm especially excited about is C++'s async framework that's coming in the next standard that will ship about a year from now. Async use of C++ is a big deal because we are all increasingly needing to do things concurrently and in parallel.

[Editor's note: ""async"" is shorthand for asynchronous — code that can run in the background without freezing your app. It's a new framework that helps developers write faster, smoother programs by handling tasks like downloading files or crunching numbers without making users wait.]

I didn't realize until I joined Citadel Securities just how much that framework is already used at the firm, including for our US equities trading. Working at Citadel Securities is almost like living in the future in that we're already diving deep into technologies that will eventually be widely used. That's been a lot of fun.

What exactly is an async framework, and why is it becoming increasingly important to have things work concurrently and in parallel?

Concurrency is the idea of doing more than one thing at a time, which we're always trying to do in a network-cloud world, whether that's waiting for cloud capacity or AI tokens. Parallelism is when you have one huge computation to do, but would like to spread elements out over multiple machines to get the answer more quickly.

What impresses me most about C++26's async framework is that it can handle both of those elements — the one that involves hiding and waiting, and the other that's doing many different things. Those are such different things. Doing them both well in one framework is pretty amazing.

Just think of what a trading system has to do. Requests for trades are flying across the wire all the time. You never know when the client is going to want to buy or sell, so as a market maker, you have to be ready at all times. And that means being very responsive, very efficient, and super fast. Execution is extremely important, and that's why we're investing in the async framework. 

What are some of the advantages that you're seeing being an early adopter or a first mover in this new C++ standard?

At Citadel Securities, using the things today that everyone else is going to be using months or years from now builds muscle and familiarity — especially for something as core as an async framework. Beyond that, we have been providing feedback and suggesting tweaks to the standard that are being adopted. Because we're using the new standard in production and at scale, we're able to play a role in evolving the language, which has been great.

How would a prospective hire show off their C++ skills? 

One way you can show off your C++ skills is simply by talking about what you're looking forward to most in C++26, describing the features that have helped you, or sharing something you've learned recently. I want to know that you're that curious and that you're focused on continuous learning, and that's true more generally, regardless of language. It's important to be able to demonstrate curiosity and knowledge about software advancements — and to show that you understand that there's more than one tool out there and that you know how to use them together. 

What's your advice to young engineers interested in joining Citadel Securities?

I would encourage young engineers to get as much work experience as possible as early as possible. I went to the University of Waterloo in Canada, which has a well-known co-op program that served me incredibly well, but there are many others out there.

The key is to get some work experience so that by the time you graduate, you have spent a significant amount of time using your skills in a real-world environment. The biggest differentiator we see among candidates is their ability to use technology to solve commercial problems. Ultimately, knowing data structures, languages, and the like are important tools in the toolkit, but what will really set you apart is your ability to solve business problems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Advertisers hit back at Elon Musk's ad boycott lawsuit, saying X disrupted its own business and 'alienated' customers","https://www.businessinsider.com/advertisers-elon-musk-x-ad-boycott-lawsuit-dismiss-2025-5","Thu, 15 May 2025 11:54:00 GMT","

The advertisers and trade group targeted by an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk's X have hit back against its claims that they colluded to form an illegal boycott of the platform.

X is suing several major brands, including Mars, Lego, Nestlé, and Shell, alleging their participation in an ad industry initiative called the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, GARM, was tantamount to a conspiracy to ""collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising"" from X after Musk's takeover of the company, then known as Twitter.

X had claimed the alleged boycott resulted in it becoming ""a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform.""

In a joint motion filed on Wednesday seeking to dismiss the case, the defendants said the lawsuit was instead ""an attempt to use the courthouse to win back the business X lost in the free market when it disrupted its own business and alienated many of its customers.""

Founded in 2019, GARM was an initiative of the advertiser trade body The World Federation of Advertisers that aimed to provide the industry with a common language and frameworks to help categorize the kind of content that advertisers tend to want to avoid.

The categories ranged from obviously harmful content like child sex-abuse imagery, to content like violence, which different sorts of advertisers have varying risk appetites toward. The uptake of these frameworks was voluntary. X was previously itself a GARM member.

""None of the membership materials refers to boycotts, the exclusion of competitors, or the disclosure of competitively sensitive information,"" the WFA and advertiser defendants said in Wednesday's filing.

GARM discontinued operations after X filed its initial lawsuit last summer, saying the two-person operation lacked the resources to fight it. GARM's parent, the WFA, is still operating and remains a defendant in the case.

In Wednesday's filing, the WFA and the group of brands rejected the accusations of a conspiracy and said that advertisers — including non-GARM members —made their own individual decisions about pulling ad spend from X. It noted that X's own lawsuit said just 18 of GARM's more than 100 members stopped advertising on the platform.

X's advertising revenue had plummeted after Musk took control of Twitter in 2022. Under his leadership, the company fired reams of staff who had been responsible for areas like brand and platform safety, loosened content moderation rules, and brought back controversial banned accounts.

Some of X's original legal argument was built on a prior probe from the House Judiciary Committee, led by its Republican chairman Jim Jordan. The committee published an investigation last summer that alleged GARM and its members colluded to boycott platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other conservative-leaning media content they disfavored.

The WFA and the advertiser defendants said in the latest filing that even if marketers had chosen to stay away from X for political reasons, this would be protected by the First Amendment as an act of free speech and wouldn't be within the scope of antitrust law.

The WFA and some of the advertiser defendants — many of which are headquartered outside of the US — are also seeking to dismiss the case, which was filed in a Texas court, for lack of proper jurisdiction.

The WFA, CVS Health, and Nestlé declined to comment. X and the advertiser defendants — Mars, Ørsted, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmoliver, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell — didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

This month, X dropped its claims against the video platform Twitch, which was also previously a defendant in the case. X's court filing didn't state a reason, but the dismissal was brought ""without prejudice,"" which means X could potentially sue Twitch again over the ad-boycott dispute. Last month, X had told the judge presiding over the case that the two companies had reached an agreement for the claims to be dropped if Twitch met conditions, which it didn't detail, this year.

Unilever was also initially named as a defendant in the original lawsuit, but reached an unspecified agreement with X and was dropped from the case in October.

President Donald Trump's flurry of artificial intelligence deals during his tour of the Middle East is opening a rift within his own administration as China hawks grow increasingly concerned the projects are putting US national security and economic interests at risk.

The Trump team has worked out agreements for parties in Saudi Arabia to acquire tens of thousands of semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., while shipments to the United Arab Emirates could top a million accelerators — mostly for projects involving or owned by US companies. Such chips are used to develop and train models that can mimic human intelligence, and they're the most coveted technology of the AI age.

The cost of Republican lawmakers' draft plan for sweeping tax cuts weighed in at $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years in one official estimate, a lowball projection that independent analysts say masks the true fiscal hit.

Budget experts typically calculate the cost of legislation, or “score,” over a 10-year period. But President Donald Trump's headline-grabbing pledges to remove taxes on tips and overtime are supposed to expire after just four years in the latest bill. That has effect of downplaying the potential revenue loss if the measures are extended — which Congress has a tendency to do.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Shares of UnitedHealth Group plunged more than 18% on Thursday following a report that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud.

The DOJ is focusing on the company's Medicare Advantage business practices, but the exact nature of the potential criminal allegations is unclear, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

In a statement, UnitedHealth Group said the Justice Department has not notified it about the reported probe and called the newspaper's reporting ""deeply irresponsible.""

The company also said ""we stand by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program.""

It marks the second time this year that the insurer's Medicare Advantage business has come under federal scrutiny. The Journal reported in February that the DOJ is conducting a civil investigation into whether the company inflated diagnoses to trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans. 

The reported investigation also follows the surprise exit of UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty, who will be replaced by the company's former longtime chief executive, Stephen Hemsley. 

Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down roughly 49% this year following a string of setbacks for the company.

UnitedHealth Group has lost over $300 billion of its $600 billion market cap in just one month, Jared Holz, Mizuho health-care equity strategist, said in an email Thursday. He said there is some risk that the company will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average ""at some point unless there is greater evidence of greater consistency.""

UnitedHealth Group also had a tumultuous 2024, grappling with a historic cyberattack, higher-than-expected medical costs and the torrent of public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson.

The Grok chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI startup said Wednesday that it ""appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa,"" according to responses viewed by CNBC.

CNBC was able to duplicate the artificial intelligence chatbot's responses via multiple user accounts on X, including by asking in one prompt, ""Did someone program Grok to discuss 'white genocide' specifically?"" Users noticed the chatbot was generating bizarre answers about the controversial topic on Wednesday afternoon in response to unrelated queries.

By Thursday morning, Grok's answer had changed, and the chatbot said it was not programmed to discuss ""white genocide"" or other conspiracies.

""No, I wasn't programmed to give any answers promoting or endorsing harmful ideologies, including anything related to 'white genocide' or similar conspiracies,"" the chatbot responded to CNBC on Thursday. ""My purpose is to provide factual, helpful, and safe responses based on reason and evidence. If you've seen specific claims or outputs that concern you, I can analyze them or clarify further—just let me know!""

Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Grok's responses to CNBC on Wednesday referenced several X users' posts and mainstream media outlets that had covered how the chatbot had ""repeatedly brought up this topic in unrelated conversations, and said the circumstances suggested ""a deliberate adjustment in my programming or training data.""

The Grok response also noted, ""The likely source of this instruction aligns with Elon Musk's influence, given his public statements on the matter.""

Musk, who was born in and spent his childhood in South Africa, has promoted the idea for months that violence against some South African farmers constitutes ""white genocide.""

President Donald Trump has expressed similar views. Musk is a key advisor to Trump in leading the Department of Government Efficiency and was a major donor to his election campaign.

On Monday, the U.S. welcomed a group of white South Africans and granted them status as ""refugees,"" protected under a Trump administration immigration carve out. The people who attained refugee status are part of the ethnic minority of Afrikaners, a group of white people of Dutch descent who ruled South Africa during the period of racial segregation known as apartheid.

Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, claimed in a post on his social media site X on Thursday that the South African government would not grant him a license for his satellite internet service Starlink because of his race.

""Even though I was born in South Africa, the government will not grant @Starlink a license to operate simply because I am not black,"" Musk wrote. ""This is a shameful disgrace to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela who sought to have all races treated equally in South Africa.""

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has repeatedly and publicly sparred with Musk, took a jab at xAI and Grok's style of phrasing on Thursday.

""There are many ways this could have happened. I'm sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,"" Altman wrote in a post on X. ""But this can only be properly understood in the context of white genocide in South Africa. As an AI programmed to be maximally truth seeking and follow my instr…""

In this article

Birkenstock, the German maker of sandals and clogs, plans to raise prices globally to fully offset the impact of a 10% tariff that President Donald Trump has imposed on imports to the U.S.

Birkenstock sandals are made in the company's own factories in Germany, which is subject to the United States' universal 10% tariff on imports.

A higher 20% rate on the European Union still looms, despite a 90-day tariff reprieve granted by Trump last month.

""We will be fully offsetting the effects from current existing tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Ivica Krolo told Reuters in an interview. ""We're not raising in one region only, we see it as a global exercise.""

The tariff rate after July 9, when the reprieve ends, is ""extremely hard to predict"", said Krolo, in the role since February 1, echoing comments from executives around the world trying to navigate the uncertainty.

After steep U.S. tariffs on China and Southeast Asia caused shipments of clothes, shoes, and homeware from the countries to be cancelled, creating a risk of empty shelves at U.S. stores, Krolo said the fact Birkenstock does not source from Asia was an advantage.

""We do see this as an opportunity to take additional shelf space and gain (market) share, and this is also the reason why we are continuing to invest,"" he said.

Krolo called on the European Union to agree a deal with the U.S., however, the sooner the better.

Birkenstock raised its annual forecasts after sales for its second quarter ended March 31 grew more than expected as more people bought its sandals and more expensive clogs.

The company's shares gained about 7% in early trading.

Birkenstock said second-quarter capital expenditure of about 21 million euros ($23.5 million) aimed to expand production capacity to meet growing demand in regions such as the Americas.

Revenue in the Americas, its biggest market, was up 23% in the quarter, and Krolo said demand from U.S. retailers and consumers for Birkenstocks remains strong.

""In a world where most brands are hoping to be able to raise prices to offset any tariff pressure, Birkenstock has a proven track record of already having permission to do so,"" said Simeon Siegel, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, referring to consumers' willingness to pay more if needed.

Birkenstock's Arizona sandal in suede leather starts at $135 now on the U.S. website, up from $130 a year ago.

Birkenstock now expects 2025 revenue growth to hit the high end of its forecast range of 15% to 17%, and an annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin between 31.3% and 31.8%, up from 30.8%-31.3%.

Second-quarter revenue of 574.3 million euros, up 19% from a year ago, was stronger than analysts' consensus estimate of 567.7 million according to LSEG. Revenue was helped by double-digit growth in units sold and a mid-single-digit increase in average selling price as Birkenstock sold more clogs.

The low-single-digit planned price hikes on Birkenstocks will start to be seen in its fourth quarter from July to September, as some products still need to be shipped into the U.S. from factories in Germany, while most shoes sold now were shipped in before tariffs.

Birkenstock is not considering manufacturing in the U.S., Krolo said, despite the tariff on imports which Washington has said would help bring manufacturing back to the country.

A trio of liberal Supreme Court justices on Thursday strongly questioned a top Justice Department lawyer as he argued that federal district court judges should be prohibited from blocking an executive order by President Donald Trump sharply limiting birthright citizenship in the United States.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, that Trump's order ""violates four Supreme Court precedents.""

Both Sotomayor and her fellow liberal on the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan, pressed Sauer on his argument, which both justices suggested would bar courts up to and including the Supreme Court from ruling that the executive order on birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.

""Assume you're dead wrong"" on the legality of Trump's order, Kagan told Sauer.

""How do we get to that result?"" Kagan asked. ""Does every single person affected by his EO [executive order] have to bring their own suit?""

Sauer suggested there were other means for the Supreme Court to decide the question without that happening, but Kagan said she was not heartened by his reply, telling him she suspected he would argue that whatever means were used were also invalid.

The third liberal on the court, Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson, took up that point.

""The real concern, I think, is that your argument seems to turn our justice system, in my view at least, into a 'catch-me-if-you- can' kind of regime,"" Jackson said, noting that would mean ""everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's rights.""

""i don't understand how that is remotely consistent with the rule of law,"" she said.

Trump has signed executive orders related to a range of issues that have been halted by federal district court judges.

""Big case today in the United States Supreme Court,"" Trump wrote in a social media post earlier Thursday.

""Birthright Citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent Citizens of the United States of America, and bringing their families with them, all the time laughing at the 'SUCKERS' that we are!"" he wrote.

Trump, on his first day back in the White House in January, signed an executive order that claimed the 14th Amendment of the Constitution did not, despite longstanding practice, automatically extend American citizenship to anyone born in the United States.

In his Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump argued that the amendment was meant only to grant citizenship to the children of people who were enslaved before the end of the Civil War.

It has ""nothing to do with Illegal Immigration for people wanting to SCAM our Country, from all parts of the World, which they have done for many years,"" he wrote.

""Please explain this to the Supreme Court of the United States,"" the president added.

For Thursday's arguments, the Supreme Court is not expected to rule on the question of whether Trump's order is constitutional in limiting the scope of the 14th Amendment as it has long been interpreted.

Instead, the high court will consider issues stemming from three federal district court lawsuits that challenged Trump's order.

The question at hand is whether district court judges can block a presidential order nationwide, or just in individual states or as it applies to the people suing.

Two of the cases were filed by more than 20 states and two cities, while the third was filed by five pregnant noncitizens and two immigrant advocacy groups.

The judges in all three cases issued orders blocking Trump's executive order. Three federal circuit courts of appeals largely upheld the effects of those orders.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux.

In remarks that focused on the central bank's policy framework review, last done in the summer of 2020, Powell noted that conditions have changed significantly over the past five years.

During the period, the Fed witnessed a period of surging inflation, pushing it to historically aggressive interest rate hikes. Powell said that even with longer-term inflation expectations largely in line with the Fed's 2% target, the era of near-zero rates is not likely to return anytime soon.

""Higher real rates may also reflect the possibility that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s,"" Powell said in prepared remarks for the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C. ""We may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks — a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks.""

The Fed held its benchmark borrowing rate near zero for seven years following the financial crisis in 2008. Since December 2024, the overnight lending rate has been in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, most recently trading at 4.33%.

The ""supply shocks"" remarks are similar to those Powell has delivered over the past several weeks cautioning that policy changes could put the Fed in a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation.

Though he did not mention President Donald Trump's tariffs in his Thursday remarks, the central bank chief in recent days has noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation. However, the extent of either impact is difficult to gauge, particularly as Trump recently has backed off the more aggressive duties pending a 90-day negotiating window.

Nevertheless, the Fed has been reluctant to ease policy after cutting its benchmark rate by a full percentage point last year.

As for the ongoing framework review, the Fed will seek to develop a five-year plan for how it will guide decisions and the way the moves will be relayed to the public.

Powell said the process this time will look at a number of factors.

They include the way the Fed communicates its expectations for the future, while also entailing a look back at ways it can adjust the last review.

During the tumult of the summer of 2020, the Fed announced a ""flexible average inflation target"" approach that would allow inflation to run a little hotter than normal in the interest of providing full and inclusive employment. However, inflation targeting soon became a dead issue as prices soared in the wake of the Covid pandemic, forcing the Fed into a series of historically aggressive rate hikes.

The current review will look at how the Fed considers ""shortfalls"" in its inflation and employment goals.

Powell and his colleagues initially dismissed the 2021 inflation surge as ""transitory"" because of pandemic-specific factors. However, several Fed officials have said the 2020 framework adoption did not factor into their decision to hold rates near zero even as inflation was rising.

""In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls,"" he said. ""And at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting. We will ensure that our new consensus statement is robust to a wide range of economic environments and developments.""

Further addressing the idea of potential supply shocks and their policy impact, Powell said the review will focus on communication.

""While academics and market participants generally have viewed the [Fed's] communications as effective, there is always room for improvement,"" he said. ""In periods with larger, more frequent, or more disparate shocks, effective communication requires that we convey the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of the economy and the outlook. We will examine ways to improve along that dimension as we move forward.""

Powell did not give a specific date on when the review will be completed, only saying that he expects it in ""coming months."" For the last review, Powell used his annual remarks at the Fed's Jackson Hole, Wyoming, retreat to outline the policy.

In this article

Dick's Sporting Goods said Thursday it plans to acquire rival Foot Locker as it looks to expand its international presence, win over a new set of consumers and corner the Nike sneaker market. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Dick's will use a combination of cash on hand and new debt to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion. Foot Locker shareholders can receive either $24 in cash – a roughly 66% premium of Foot Locker's average share price over the last 60 days – or 0.1168 shares of Dick's stock.

Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon has been undertaking an ambitious turnaround at the footwear retailer, and while there have been signs of improvement, larger market conditions like tariffs and consumer softness have weighed on the company's stock, making Foot Locker a potential takeover target. As of Wednesday's close, Foot Locker shares were down 41% this year. 

In a joint press release, Dillon said the acquisition is a ""testament"" to all of the work her and her team have done to improve the business.

""By joining forces with DICK'S, Foot Locker will be even better positioned to expand sneaker culture, elevate the omnichannel experience for our customers and brand partners, and enhance our position in the industry,"" said Dillon.

The CEO added she was ""confident this transaction represents the best path for our shareholders and other stakeholders.""

While the companies are longtime rivals — both competing to sell the same brands in their stores — Dick's is almost double the size of Foot Locker in terms of revenue. In their most recent fiscal years, Dick's reported $13.44 billion in revenue, while Foot Locker saw $7.99 billion.

Dick's said it expects to operate Foot Locker as a stand-alone business unit within its portfolio and maintain the company's brands – Foot Locker Kids, WSS, Champs and atmos. 

Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said on a conference call Thursday that the two businesses will be run as separate entities and the consumer ""may or may not know that Dick's and Foot Locker are one.""

""The combination of them for the consumer is not the most important thing, it's making sure that there's two powerful brands that are meeting all consumer needs, wherever, whenever, however they want to shop,"" Hobart said.

The merger brings together two iconic names in sports retailing and will give Dick's a massive competitive edge in the wholesale sneaker market, most importantly for Nike products.

Currently, Nike's primary wholesale partners are Dick's, Foot Locker and JD Sports. If the merger is approved, the combined company would be able to corner the Nike market at a time when the sneaker giant is more reliant on wholesalers than in years past. 

""Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker are two of the most storied and respected brands in our industry and have been our valued partners for decades,"" said Nike CEO Elliott Hill in a statement. ""Each has their own loyal consumer following and deep understanding of the needs of athletes. I am confident that together, they will help elevate sport and continue to accelerate the growth of our industry.""

The acquisition will also allow Dick's to enter the international markets for the first time, as Foot Locker operates 2,400 retail stores in 20 countries, and gives it access to the type of consumer who doesn't usually shop at its stores. The Dick's customer tends to be affluent, suburban and older, while the Foot Locker customer is urban, younger and more likely to be lower and middle income. That latter customer has long underpinned sneaker culture and is critical for Dick's to reach long-term growth and competitive advantage. 

While Hobart said the company is not looking toward international expansion at this time, the total addressable market that Dick's is operating in will grow from $140 billion to $300 billion due to Foot Locker's global reach.

The proposed combination raises considerable anti-competition concerns, but Wall Street expects President Donald Trump's Federal Trade Commission to be more favorable to mergers.

Hobart said during the call that the companies are ""not expecting any regulatory concerns"" with the FTC.

Foot Locker shares soared more than 80% after the deal was announced Thursday. Shares of Dick's fell roughly 15% as investors worried about the impact the merger could have on financial results.

While Dick's expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings in the first full fiscal year post-close, and to deliver between $100 million and $125 million in cost synergies, Foot Locker has been struggling for some time. It has a cumbersome store footprint, many of which are in malls, and it's more exposed to economic downturns because of the lower-income level of its customer.  

Foot Locker has assessed all of its stores and determined that some locations could close, Hobart said, but she does not expect a ""significant"" number of stores to shutter.

In a note on Thursday, TD Cowen called the deal a ""strategic mistake"" as it downgraded shares of Dick's to hold from buy. Analyst John Kernan said the transaction is ""likely to produce low returns"" and presents clear risks to synergies, integration and the structural foundation of Foot Locker's business. Kernan expects the return on capital to be low and said it raises balance sheet risks.

""There is little to no precedence of M&A at scale creating value for shareholders within Softlines Retail. In our view, there are countless examples of M&A destroying billions of dollars in value since we have covered the sector,"" said Kernan.

Dick's Executive Chairman Ed Stack said the company knew there would be some initial skepticism in response to the merger, but stressed that the two companies are ""highly confident"" and ""up for the job.""

""We're pretty conservative. We don't have a lot of big egos here,"" he said. ""If we didn't see this clear line of sight to this, or we thought that this was going to impact what we're able to do with Dick's, we wouldn't be doing it.""

Both companies preannounced fiscal first-quarter results after announcing the merger. Foot Locker reported comparable sales down 2.6% from the prior-year period, led by a slowdown internationally, and expects to see a net loss of $363 million for the period, compared with net income of $8 million in the year-ago period. That loss includes $276 million in charges related primarily to trademark and goodwill impairments.  

Meanwhile, Dick's said it saw comparable sales growth of 4.5% and earnings per share of $3.24.

""We are very pleased with our strong start to the year and our demonstrated sustained growth,"" said Hobart. ""The strength of our business puts us in a great position for our proposed acquisition of Foot Locker — a transformative step to accelerate our global reach and drive significant value for our athletes, teammates, partners and shareholders.""

Coinbase on Thursday reported that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data to use in social engineering attacks. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated.

The crypto exchange operator received an email on May 11 from someone claiming they obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts as well as other internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer service and account management systems, Coinbase reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The company's shares were down more than 6% in morning trading.

The email demanded money in exchange for not publicly disclosing the information, but Coinbase says it has not paid the demand and is cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation of the incident.

Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, affected data included sensitive data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and emails; masked bank account numbers and identifiers as well as the last four digits of Social Security numbers; government ID images and account balances, the company said.

""Cyber criminals bribed and recruited a group of rogue overseas support agents to steal Coinbase customer data to facilitate social engineering attacks,"" the company said in a blog post. ""These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers. No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched. We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker.""

Coinbase had detected the breach independently in previous months, per the filing. It immediately terminated the employees involved, warned customers whose information may have been accessed and enhanced its fraud monitoring protections.

The threat actor paid overseas contractors and employees in support rolls to obtain the information, it said.

""We're cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received,"" the company said in the blog. ""Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.""

Coinbase operates the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. In the past week it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week. On the earnings call last week, CEO Brian Armstrong discussed his ambition to make Coinbase ""the No. 1 financial services app in the world"" in the next five to 10 years.

It's media Upfronts week, which these days serves primarily as a sports programming showcase. Readers of this newsletter shouldn't be surprised. As YouTube noted, NFL games were 90 of the top 100 most-watched telecasts during the 2024 NFL season. Disney, Amazon and NBCUniversal just spent billions of dollars – each – on an NBA TV rights deal that kicks in next season. 

Why have major media companies leaned so far into sports? One of the biggest reasons is ad revenue. That's what Upfronts week is all about.

I attended almost all of the major media company Upfronts and got a chance to speak with some executives and talent on the side. Here are some of my takeaways.

* Disney/ESPN: I'm going to start with Disney, because that was the company with the most consequential announcement this week – the long-awaited ESPN streaming service that I reported last week will be called … ESPN. This week, we learned the service will cost $29.99 per month, which isn't a surprise – I've reported for months it would either be $25 or $30 a month. 

Still, the extent of the bundling discounts with Disney+ and Hulu were massive and unexpected. For customers that sign up at launch this fall (exact date TBD), Disney will throw in both Disney+ and Hulu for free to ESPN subscribers for 12 months. After that, the bundle of ESPN, Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) will cost $35.99 per month – just $6 more than ESPN alone. 

Disney is pushing its bundle to cut down on churn – industry lingo for the rate of cancellation for streaming services. The idea is simple – if you make a bundle more cost effective than purchasing a solo service, more consumers will stick with the product. In other words, it's easier to cancel ESPN than ESPN, Disney+ and Hulu.

ESPN also wants to upsell its 24 million ESPN+ subscribers to the unlimited ESPN, Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said at a media event this week. ESPN+, which costs $11.99 per month for a smaller sampling of ESPN's live events, will essentially convert to an entry-level tier of ESPN. Part of the reason Disney is offering such a steep discount for the first-year bundle is to convert as many ESPN+ subscribers into ESPN customers as possible. 

""A lot of our marketing, our messaging will be focused on upselling those trio bundle subscribers to this new bundle at this very attractive pricing,"" Pitaro said.

Disney is fully embracing ESPN these days, a shift from when it contemplated spinning off its sports media arm a few years ago. The first five people that showed up during Disney's Upfront presentation? Current and former NFL stars Saquon Barkley, Pat Mahomes, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning … and CEO Bob Iger. 

Some other tidbits related to ESPN that I picked up during the week …

ESPN still wants UFC rights, but not for the mixed martial arts league's roughly $1 billion per year asking price. ESPN currently pays about $600 million for UFC, I'm told. That may lead to a situation where UFC splits its rights between multiple media partners.

It's a similar story for F1, though the dollars are lower. Despite some speculation ESPN was no longer interested in F1, I'm told that's not true. ESPN is specifically interested in the U.S. streaming rights for F1 given its younger audience and the lack of commercial breaks once a race begins. But I'm told the media company may only want a portion of a package – select races rather than the entire circuit. That could open the door for Amazon or even Netflix as a new partner. Netflix has a relationship with F1 through its documentary series ""Drive to Survive,"" now amazingly in its seventh season. Still, Netflix's sports strategy remains ""event"" driven, and it's doubtful that an F1 race can be turned into an event, given its limited audience. F1 has been asking for $150 million per year for its rights, sources said.

On the programming side, ESPN is thinking about adding two new dayside shows. One would replace ""Around The Horn,"" which concludes May 23. The other could sub in for the 2 p.m. SportsCenter. One idea being tossed around is a show that features newly-signed Peter Schrager, the NFL analyst who ESPN believes can be more of an all-sports figure, I was told by one plugged-in source. 

I'm told ESPN's decision to cancel ""Around The Horn"" was largely cost driven. ESPN had dozens of journalists on its payroll given the revolving guest nature of the show, and it paid a licensing fee to Erik Rydholm, the show's executive producer. While ESPN has no intention of canceling ""Pardon The Interruption,"" another Rydholm joint, it would prefer to create new programming in-house. 

*NBCUniversal: The biggest news from NBC Sports was the addition of Michael Jordan to the NBA on NBC broadcasts next season. NBC said Jordan would be a ""special contributor"" to the broadcast, and then did the public the great service of not explaining what that means.

There's a reason for that – the role is still nebulous. But, fair reader, I'm here to serve. I'm told the initial plan is for Jordan to appear in taped segments during the season to provide analysis that will air during pregame shows or halftime shows. How that evolves over time is still TBD. The deal with Jordan was orchestrated by longtime NBC Sports executive Jon Miller, who has a decades-long relationship with MJ. 

*Fox: Fox's biggest announcement was the launch of its streaming service, Fox One. Remember, the initial plan for Fox was to go into business with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery to create Venu Sports, a digital skinny bundle that would have given Fox a streaming outlet for its programming.

When the companies pulled the plug on Venu as it faced antitrust pushback, Fox pivoted to Plan B – launching its own streaming service consisting of live and on-demand programming from Fox broadcast, Fox News, Fox Business and Fox Sports, with the option to bundle with Fox Nation. The person in charge of the new streaming service? Pete Distad, who was going to be the CEO of Venu.

*Amazon: Amazon's biggest sports stars are probably Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce, who come to Amazon via Wondery, which owns ""New Heights,"" the brothers' popular podcast. Amazon has ""Thursday Night Football"" and will now add the NBA and WNBA on Thursdays and Fridays. 

But while Amazon threw a ton of star power at its Upfront (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael B. Jordan, John Cena, Jamie Lee Curtis, etc.), I thought it was notable that its NBA star power is noticeably light compared to Disney's licensing of ""Inside The NBA"" (Shaq, Charles Barkley, etc.) and NBC's Jordan announcement.

Amazon trotted out Blake Griffin, Udonis Haslem, Maria Taylor and Candace Parker to talk about its NBA and WNBA lineup. While Parker is an all-time great in the WNBA, that collective is not exactly The Avengers. And Parker isn't even exclusively on Amazon – she showed up at the Warner Bros. Discovery Upfront too because she's also broadcasting ""Unrivaled,"" the women's basketball three-on-three league that airs on Turner's cable networks. 

As if to underscore the point, NFL analyst (and former quarterback) Ryan Fitzpatrick beat Griffin handily in an on-stage pop-a-shot contest, causing Jamie Lee Curtis to wonder out loud why the professional basketball player didn't know how to shoot. 

I do think Amazon may have a bit of an NBA problem given its lack of on-air talent and weekday slate games. NBC made a huge deal of the return of the NBA during its Upfront, including flying in John Tesh to lead a large orchestra in ""Roundball Rock."" Jimmy Fallon even joked that the NBC Upfronts seemed like the NBA Upfronts. Earlier this month, NBC Sports president Rick Cordella told me NBC plans to incorporate stadium introduction music into its broadcasts – a throwback to the 1990s Chicago Bulls days. The idea is to make ""Sunday Night Basketball"" feel like the game of the week, he told me.

I fear Amazon's games may feel third-rate compared to ESPN and NBC. Amazon did pay less for its package of games than both companies, but ideally, Prime Video would find a way to make the games feel younger and fresher, given it's the first time an exclusive streamer has ever had NBA rights. And, to be fair, ""Thursday Night Football"" has improved in quality every year. 

*Warner Bros. Discovery: When everyone else zigs, you zag. WBD lost its NBA rights for next season, so the company conspicuously downplayed sports relative to entertainment programming. While NBCU, Amazon and Disney all emphasized sports early in their presentations, it took WBD an hour before TNT Sports Chairman and CEO Luis Silberwasser took the stage. 

This wasn't an accident. WBD is changing the name of its streaming service from Max back to HBO Max. The point is to re-emphasize prestige programming and HBO rather than a B-minus sports lineup.  

*Netflix: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell donned a Santa Claus suit to announce the platform's two new Christmas games — the Dallas Cowboys vs. the Washington Commanders and the Minnesota Vikings vs. the Detroit Lions. 

Then, the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders performed a routine to AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"" to tout a new Netflix series featuring Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, ""America's Team: The Gambler and his Cowboys,"" which hits the service this summer. 

Netflix is still new to sports, so the service leaned on the strength of ""Squid Game 3,"" ""Stranger Things"" season five, and ""Nobody Wants This."" Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said Netflix's event ""is all about our shows and movies."" 

Netflix noted that eight of the top 20 Nielsen rated TV shows were on its platform. The company's sports strategy is showcasing big live events. So while Netflix announced the Christmas games and promoted an Amanda Serrano-Katie Taylor women's boxing rematch, it's still figuring out how much of a player it wants to be as a media partner.

Still, there's a reason the NFL commissioner showed up at this Upfront. Netflix has a market valuation of nearly $500 billion. To use a Christmas analogy, Goodell wants to make sure Netflix isn't just the ghost of Christmas present, but also the ghost of Christmas future. 

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told me he frequently talks about adding more NFL games with Goodell, but the question always comes back to whether Netflix feels it can ""eventize"" the game beyond a random regular season occasion. 

With UConn women's basketball star freshman Sarah Strong and WNBA veteran Allison Feaster...

Cybersecurity firm Proofpoint is acquiring European rival Hornetsecurity for north of $1 billion to strengthen its European presence as it explores a return to public markets.

The deal marks the single largest acquisition in Proofpoint's history.

The cybersecurity industry has seen heightened consolidation in recent months, with companies snapping up smaller competitors to bolster their offerings in an era of AI-fueled cybercrime.

In March, Google announced a deal to acquire Israeli-founded cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion, while last month Palo Alto Networks said it was buying AI-focused cyber startup Protect AI.

Proofpoint, which is currently owned by private equity giant Thoma Bravo, told CNBC Thursday that the deal to buy Hornetsecurity would help deepen its expertise in the managed service provider (MSP) ecosystem.

Headquartered in Hannover, Germany, Hornetsecurity specializes in managed cloud-based email security services to help protect firms from cyberattacks, data loss, and compliance risks associated with Microsoft 365 and other IT infrastructure.

Proofpoint CEO Sumit Dhawan told CNBC the deal would help ""consolidate fragmented security tools into a unified platform that protects people and defends data across the global threat landscape.""

""Generative AI has fundamentally changed the threat landscape, enabling faster, more targeted, and more complex attacks,"" Dhawan said in an interview. Small and medium-sized firms ""are increasingly in the crosshairs"" of hackers and require ""integrated, high-efficacy"" solutions, he added.

Proofpoint's boss told CNBC in October last year that the company was exploring external funding as well as mergers and acquisitions of smaller cybersecurity firms with an aim to return to the public markets in 2026. The company went private in 2021 in a $12.3 billion acquisition by private equity firm Thoma Bravo.

""Hornetsecurity brings very strong business to Proofpoint targeting a new market segment of MSPs and diversifies our routes to market,"" Dhawan said.

""It contributes significantly to our earnings and cash flow going forward, which makes us an even stronger company and business as we explore a return to public markets,"" he added.

Dhawan said that while there is ""nothing new"" to share on Proofpoint's IPO plans for now, ""we remain interested in the IPO market and will explore public markets when we feel the time is right.""

Hornetsecurity serves more than 125,000 small to medium-sized businesses and has more than 700 employees, according to a press release. Proofpoint has over 4,500 employees and counts 85% of the Fortune 100 as customers.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

In this article

Alibaba shares fell on Thursday after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter on both the top and bottom line.

Shares were down nearly 8%.

Here's how Alibaba did in its fiscal fourth quarter ended March versus LSEG estimates:

While falling short of analyst expectations, revenue was nevertheless up 7% year-on-year.

Alibaba's net income was also still 279% higher year-on-year, off a low base. Alibaba said it saw some losses as a result of the disposal of some of its subsidiaries, which was offset by an increase in income from operations and changes to valuations of its equity investments.

However, analysts were hoping the company's investments in artificial intelligence and its core e-commerce business would help it hit or exceed high expectations.

But Alibaba is grappling with macroeconomic volatility that has affected consumer sentiment in China. Washington's trade war with Beijing has created uncertainty in the world's second-largest economy, which has seen huge tariffs slapped from both sides during the latest quarter in which Alibaba reported.

Beijing and Washington agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods this month.

Alibaba's core Taobao and Tmall group division — the company's China e-commerce business — saw revenue rise 9% to 101.4 billion yuan. That growth rate is faster than the level seen in the previous quarter. Customer management revenue, which Alibaba makes off of selling marketing and other services to merchants on its platform, jumped 12% year-on-year. This is a big revenue driver for the company.

Over the last few months, China has also introduced policies to spur consumption and consumer purchases.

In a move to boost purchases on its Tmall and Taobao platforms, Alibaba extended a partnership with Rednote, or Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like service in China. The deal allows Taobao links to be embedded in Rednote posts, so users can be taken directly to a product shopping page.

On the earnings call on Thursday, Alibaba management said that the company would be investing ""aggressively"" in its so-called ""instant commerce"" model. This is a feature introduced on Taobao this month that provides deliveries of certain products in China within an hour, underscoring Alibaba's bid to continue to differentiate itself from its rivals.

Alibaba executives said the hope is that will drive more engagement on the Taobao app.

Even with these changes, Alibaba is facing an intense price war in China with rivals including PDD and JD.com.

Alibaba said cloud revenue totaled 30.1 billion yuan in the March quarter, increasing at a year-on-year pace of 18% — faster than the growth seen in the previous quarter.

The company said this was driven by ""faster public cloud revenue growth"" and by ""increasing adoption of AI-related products.""

Investors are also focused on Alibaba's efforts in artificial intelligence, where it has become a leading player domestically and globally.

In April, the Hangzhou-headquartered company launched the latest version of its open source large language model, Qwen 3, which is being used to power Alibaba's AI assistant Quark.

AI competition in China is red hot and was exacerbated by DeepSeek's innovative model launched earlier this year. Chinese tech giant Tencent meanwhile on Tuesday announced a 91% year-on-year rise in capital expenditures in the first quarter, driven by investments in AI.

Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said in an earnings release that AI-related product revenue achieved ""triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter."" Wu did not specify a figure for AI-related revenue.

During the earnings call on Thursday, Wu said companies are shifting toward cloud-based AI services. He said the company sees a ""significant growth track for revenue"" for Alibaba's cloud business for the next few quarters.

""We have quite strong confidence and conviction in that,"" Wu said, according to a company provided live translation of his comments.

BEIJING — China's latest education policies for the year restrict the extent to which children can use generative artificial intelligence in the classroom, according to a local government report on Thursday.

The guidelines cited in the report, which weren't publicly available, covered AI education and generative AI use in primary and secondary schools during 2025.

China's Ministry of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Primary school students are prohibited from using unrestricted generative AI tools on their own, although an instructor may use the tech to assist with teaching, according to the local government report.

It added that middle schoolers can explore how generative AI reasons and analyzes information, while high schoolers are allowed to use the tech more broadly.

The report said the policies banned students from directly copying AI-generated content into homework and called on schools to establish a list of approved generative AI tools that can be used on school grounds.

The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, mentioned the new guidelines on the sixth page of its Thursday edition.

But the national state media report did not discuss specific limits on AI use, and instead focused on how the policies aimed to promote ""scientific"" and ""standardized"" promotion of AI education suited to various stages of education, according to a CNBC translation.

Use of generative AI in China has increased significantly after DeepSeek, a homegrown rival to OpenAI, in late January released a chatbot app. Tencent, ByteDance and other companies have released similar chatbots that have surged in popularity in China.

In this article

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he doesn't want the tech giant to build its products in India, taking shots at the company's moves to diversify production away from China and urging him to pivot stateside.

""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,"" Trump said. ""I said to him, 'my friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you're building all over India.' I don't want you building in India.""

Trump was referencing Apple's commitment of a $500 billion investment in the U.S. which was announced in February.

Apple has been ramping up production in India with the aim of making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the next few years, as it looks to reduce reliance on China, where around 90% of its flagship smartphone is currently assembled.

""I said to Tim, I said, 'Tim look, we treated you really good, we put up with all the plants that you build in China for years, now you got build us. We're not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here,'"" Trump said.

The U.S. president added that Apple is going to be ""upping"" its production in the United States, without disclosing further details.

CNBC has reached out to Apple.

Trump made the comments about the U.S. tech giant while discussing Washington's broader trade relations with India.

Trump said India is ""one of the highest tariff nations in the world,"" adding the country has offered a deal to the U.S. where ""they are willing to literally charge us no tariff.""

Under the White House's trade protectionist policies revealed in April, Trump has imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 26% on Indian goods, which has been temporarily lowered until July.

Apple's main assembly partner in India, Foxconn, received approval from the Indian government on Monday to build a semiconductor plant in the country in a joint venture with HCL Group.

Apple has spent decades building up its supply chain in China, but has looked to other countries like Vietnam and India to expand its production capacity.

But experts generally agree that moving production of the iPhone to the U.S. would be highly unlikely because of the final price of the end product. Varying estimates put the cost of an iPhone between $1,500 to $3,500, if it were made in the U.S.

Apple currently makes very few products in the U.S. Currently, the Cupertino, California, giant produces the Mac Pro in the U.S. In February, it announced it would launch a manufacturing facility in Texas to produce servers for Apple Intelligence, its artificial intelligence system.

Germany is backing U.S. President Donald Trump's call to increase the defense spending target of NATO members to 5% of their individual gross domestic product, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Thursday.

When asked about NATO chief Mark Rutte's reported proposal that members of the alliance should increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP while committing an additional 1.5% to wider security-related matters, Wadephul said he believed this suggestion had been coordinated — including with the U.S. — and that it would be discussed at the ongoing NATO foreign ministers meeting.

""But one should look at the result. And the result is indeed the 5% demanded by President Trump, that he believes are necessary, and we are following him in this respect,"" Wadephul said on the sidelines of the meeting in Turkey, according to a CNBC translation.

Trump has long demanded higher defense expenses from NATO members, some of which have so far even been failing to meet the existing 2% target. Some countries like Poland have already committed to boosting their defense spending as high as 5% in the coming years, while others have been more cautious and critical of the prospect of higher expenses.

In 2024, Germany spent around 2% of its GDP on defense, according to NATO estimates. In a press conference with NATO's Rutte last week, German chancellor Friedrich Merz noted that one percent of the country's GDP would represent around 45 billion euros ($50 billion).

The next NATO summit, where decisions regarding higher defense spending targets could be made, is set to take place in late June.

Wadephul also met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Thursday event. In a post on social media platform X, Wadephul said their conversation ""was a great start, especially at a time when so much is at stake in foreign affairs.""

Speaking to journalists, Wadephul suggested that there was a close alignment between Germany and the U.S. on foreign policy matters.

""The U.S. is very satisfied with what Germany is achieving,"" Wadephul said. ""I said that we are ready to take a leadership role in Europe, be an example and to invite others to follow us.""

Defense and military matters appear to be high on the agenda for Germany's new government, with the coalition partners earlier this year pushing changes to the country's long-standing debt rules through parliament. The shift is designed to enable higher defense spending.

In a parliamentary speech on Wednesday, Germany's Merz had also discussed defense and security policy, explaining that the goal was for Germany and Europe to be so strong that they would not need to use their weapons.

""We want to be able to defend ourselves so that we don't have to defend ourselves,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation. Merz also said the German military would be given the financial means it needs to become the ""conventionally strongest military in Europe.""

Merz further vowed to take on more responsibility in NATO and Europe.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

The Indian stock market has emerged from a volatile few weeks and soared past the level it was before the latest India-Pakistan flare-ups.

It shouldn't come as a surprise, though, because for a growing cohort of global investors focused on India, such border crises, while serious, are viewed as just one variable in a far more complex equation — for now.

While Indian stock markets initially dipped after it became apparent that India and Pakistan were headed toward armed conflict, Kieron Kader, an associate fund manager on Alquity's Indian Subcontinent fund, told CNBC that the episode was ""not going to change the overall return profile dramatically.""

Instead, the ensuing volatility was a ""gift to the long-term investor,"" Kader added. He bought shares of NYSE-listed MakeMyTrip, Lemon Tree Hotels and Samhi Hotels after they tumbled, only to see them rise strongly since.

He isn't the only one with that view.

Anand Gupta, lead portfolio manager for Allianz India Equity fund, pointed out that the Indian equity market displayed ""remarkable resilience"" during the crisis peak, with the MSCI India index seeing only a ""modest correction"" of around 1.5% despite a spike in the India VIX, or ""fear gauge.""

He attributed this to ""investor confidence supported by India's strong economic fundamentals"" and a ""historical pattern of limited market disruption during geopolitical flare-ups of this nature.""

Indeed, the risks from recent military flare-ups appear to have been offset by the fact that India is considered by many to be an attractive investment destination. Research from Barclays's credit team also noted that the ""macro impact is limited for both India and Pakistan"" from the recent conflict.

However, while the hostilities may not have spooked investors, over the longer term, rising geopolitical tensions could pose risks.

And there have been some surprises in the conflict this time around. Events from earlier this month have marked a significant escalation from previous skirmishes between the two nuclear-armed nations. For the first time, both claimed to have attacked territories deep into the opposing side.

In contrast, the Balakot strikes in 2019 saw India hitting locations very close to the border. The Indian Air Force mostly kept within India during the 1999 Kargil war. For decades, most conflicts between the two remained largely on land.

While investors may be somewhat desensitized to India-Pakistan tensions, the political willingness to escalate conflict has raised concerns for some, given the wider geopolitical situation around the world.

""Geopolitically India is not in a great situation,"" said Venugopal Garre, head of India research at Bernstein, in a note to clients on May 7. He pointed to the change of political stance toward India by neighbors Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and its traditional allies, Russia and Israel. These countries are now occupied with war closer to home. Garre added that China's support of Pakistan doesn't help either.

India has a precarious relationship with China — its largest neighbor — exhibiting certain qualities that are similar to its relationship with Pakistan.

China and India share a long border with many points of disagreement that have remained unsettled for decades. The two countries also went to war in 1962 over a border dispute. More recently, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese forces in a disputed Himalayan border area in 2020.

While an actual military conflict between the two Asian giants is deemed ""very, very unlikely"" by Alquity's Kader, he admits that such an eventuality would be a ""very scary situation"" potentially requiring ""global intervention"" and significantly elevating India's risk premium.

The scenario is seen as being near-impossible because, economically, the two countries have an interdependent relationship.

Bernstein noted: ""India needs China to help build its low-end assembly franchise while China may consider India as potential market (it runs a large trade surplus with India which it may not want to risk losing).""

Historically, however, India and Pakistan were also tied together economically as well as culturally. Yet, recent events show that when violence erupts, it can be difficult to predict how far each side will go. Investors might want to take note of the risks.

Trump doesn't want Apple building products in India. The U.S. President said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he doesn't want the tech giant to build its products in India, taking shots at the company's moves to diversify production away from China and urging him to pivot stateside.

India's consumer inflation rate in April cools. Headline inflation fell to 3.16% in April from 3.34% in March, and came in lower than the 3.27% expected by economists polled by Reuters. It was the sixth straight month that price increases moderated. Food inflation, which is a key inflation metric in the country, dipped to 1.78% in April, from March's figure of 2.69%.

Wholesale prices in India also fell. In April, wholesale inflation, which serves as a proxy for producer prices, rose 0.85% on an annual basis, much lower than the 2.05% increase the previous month and marking the slowest increase in more than a year. The reading was also lower than the forecast of 1.76% by a Reuters poll of economists. Encouraging consumer and wholesale inflation readings open the door to more rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India.

India raised the idea of retaliatory tariffs on America. Even as India is reportedly negotiating a trade deal with the U.S., the South Asian country on May 12 proposed to the World Trade Organisation that it retracts tariff concessions to the U.S., which would amount to $1.91 billion in duty collected from U.S. imports.

The ceasefire between India and Pakistan is brittle but intact. Both countries reached an agreement to stop military action on May 10, but have accused one another of violating it. That said, armed conflict has largely abated from the height of hostilities beginning May 6, which India said was a response to a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed. In a post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump offered help to find a ""solution"" regarding Kashmir.

The Nifty 50 index closed above 25,000 points for the first time since October, as it heads for a 4.4% gain this week. The index has risen 6% this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield declined to 6.23%, down by about 10 basis points from last week.

On CNBC TV this week, Shilpak Ambule, India's high commissioner to Singapore, said India will not distinguish between ""terrorists and government sponsors of terrorist,"" and further discussed India's perspective of its conflict with Pakistan that broke out earlier this month. Ambule stressed that India is still forging trade ties with countries such as the U.S., the European Union and New Zealand amid its hostilities with Pakistan.

Meanwhile, Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Investments, said India is the ""most exciting place"" now because it will replace China in many areas. For instance, Apple has already shifted some of its manufacturing and export operations to India. Mobius also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing a good job of cutting through the Indian bureaucracy, streamlining the country's infrastructure and economy.

India's balance of trade figures, out Friday, will receive more scrutiny than usual, given U.S. President Donald Trump's emphasis on trade imbalances between America and its partners. Meanwhile, Integrity Infrabuild, a construction company, lists Tuesday, followed by Accretion Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday.

Shares of Bitcoin Depot popped 20% to $2.04 on Thursday after the Bitcoin ATM operator reported a first-quarter profit of $12.2 million compared with a loss of $4.2 million a year earlier.

Revenue for the Atlanta-based firm, which manages over 8,400 kiosks in North America that let users convert cash to Bitcoin, rose 19% year-over-year to $164.2 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said the jump was driven by increased kiosk deployment over the three-month period and a higher median transaction size.

As part of its treasury strategy, Bitcoin Depot held $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin, up from $600,000 the previous quarter. The jump reflected a shift to fair value accounting. Last year, the company began purchasing Bitcoin with a portion of its cash reserves, while also carrying an “insignificant amount of Ethereum.”

Although Bitcoin Depot has kiosks in 48 U.S. states, the firm is trying to obtain a license to operate in the Empire State this year, CEO Brandon Mintz said on an earnings call. The state's population could support up to 3,000 kiosks over time, a shareholder presentation stated.

“New York state remains one of the largest untapped markets for Bitcoin ECMs,” he said. “We are in ongoing discussions with regulators and remain optimistic about obtaining a license to operate in the state in 2025.”

The company that promises users can “get Bitcoin in a minute” supplies software for its machines that are purchased from another company. Since its establishment in 2016, the company says it has facilitated around $3 billion worth of transaction volume, through machines located in gas stations, convenience stores, and other brick-and-mortar settings.

Since the company's shares were listed on the Nasdaq in July 2023, Bitcoin Depot's stock price has fallen 79%, according to Yahoo Finance. Based on current prices, the firm has a market capitalization of $44 million.

Bitcoin Depot's first-quarter performance represents a bounceback from the previous quarter, in which the firm posted a year-over-year drop in revenue. At the time, the company cited the negative impact of a law passed in California imposing daily transaction limits.

Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $103,000, a 0.4% decrease over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In the first quarter, the asset's price dipped as low as $78,800.

U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) is among lawmakers that have called for Bitcoin ATM operators to “curb fraud against elderly Americans,” citing recent FBI statistics. In February, he unveiled a bill that would impose $2,000 daily transaction limits on new customers and require full refunds for transactions reported as fraudulent within 30 days.

In 2024, Americans over 60 years old reported $107 million in Bitcoin ATM-related losses to authorities, according to a recently published annual report. Criminals often impersonate tech support workers or government employees, the FBI found.

Bitcoin Depot says that it has 19 compliance personnel, in addition to “robust transaction monitoring systems,” as well as know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering programs.

The ATMs have their supporters, though. Earlier this month, Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX), proposed putting them in federal buildings across the U.S. He wrote in a letter that “installations can serve as an educational resource for those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies.”

Ethereum is doubling down on security as tokenized real-world assets gain traction across global markets.

On May 14, the Ethereum (ETH) Foundation announced the launch of an initiative called “One Trillion Security”, which aims to make the network resilient enough to safely support trillions of dollars in assets. The network will benefit all kinds of users from individual savings to corporate treasuries and potentially government-issued instruments.

The Foundation stated that as more value flows on-chain, the system needs stronger protection at every level. from user wallets and smart contracts to validators and the base protocol. This push comes as tokenization continues to accelerate faster than many expected.

In a May 8 post on X, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted some recent major developments. Among them, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce backed blockchain-based equity issuance, while Superstate unveiled “Opening Bell,” a new platform for trading tokenized shares on Ethereum and Solana (SOL).

Stocks are going to move on-chain much faster than people think.  In the last 24 hours:  1) Robinhood announced plans for  a service that would let Europeans trade US stocks on Solana and/or Arbitrum ;2) SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce gave a speech about allowing stocks to be…

Ethereum already dominates the tokenized assets sector, holding over $6.9 billion in RWAs, according to RWA.xyz data. That figure jumps to nearly 89% when factoring in Ethereum layer-2 networks like zkSync. The Foundation believes long-term adoption depends on making the network more secure for high-value use cases.

A bigger wave is coming. A report by Boston Consulting Group estimates the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by 2030, roughly 10% of global GDP. To support that scale, Ethereum is now establishing itself as the infrastructure layer for tokenized finance. 

As demand from fintech platforms and enterprise issuers rises, Ethereum's security roadmap reflects a growing urgency to meet institutional standards. The 1TS program will focus on identifying security weak points, funding audits and bug bounties, and improving developer tools.

Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio shared Thursday that he thinks the blockchain wasn't necessarily meant to be a “competitor to Bitcoin,” but rather “it was meant to be an alternative.”



Speaking to a crowd at Consensus 2025, Di Iorio shared with the audience about his time during Ethereum's early days, noting back then that he understood that the project could become a really big movement. “We could sense and feel that it was picking up,” Di Iorio said.



Di Iorio was one of the eight co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain, but originally got into cryptocurrency through his advocacy with Bitcoin. He started Bitcoin meetups in Toronto in 2012, and through that met Vitalik Buterin, who came up with the Ethereum whitepaper and shared it with his fellow co-founders.



While Di Iorio is still a big Bitcoin proponent, he has said that “I do think eventually Ethereum has a possibility of overtaking it in terms of market capitalization.”



“With the amount of use cases, and the value that Ethereum is allowing to be created, I think it has that opportunity, in order to possibly overtake it,” Di Iorio added.



After stepping away from the Ethereum Foundation, Anthony Di Iorio founded Decentral in 2014, which is best known for creating the Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet. In 2022, he launched Andiami, a project blending hardware, tokenomics, and game theory to tackle centralization vectors within decentralized networks.

Altcoins slump over 5% as crypto market cools following last week's macro-driven rally.

Bitcoin whales accumulate 83K BTC amid profit-taking, while traders eye Coinbase's S&P 500 inclusion for the next catalyst.

After a strong week-long surge, the crypto market has entered a cooling phase. Major altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana have dropped over 5% in the past 24 hours as investors chose to lock in recent gains. The broader sentiment remains cautious as traders await fresh catalysts. 

The latest dip in prices comes after a macro-driven rally last week that pushed Bitcoin to nearly $104,000 and Ethereum to $2,700. But both hit resistance at key levels, prompting traders to step back. Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin saw notable declines, following the lead of large-cap assets as momentum slowed. 

According to FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, Bitcoin is struggling to break past its December-January highs, while Ethereum is showing signs of a possible correction toward $2,400 after gaining 55% in just a week.

Sentiment indicators are now flashing caution. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 71 from 74, a level that typically signals excessive bullishness and potential overbought conditions. Analysts suggest the market may need to cool down before making the next move, especially after last week's bullish run was largely driven by external events. 

The rally had been sparked by a combination of lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data, strong earnings from China's tech sector, and a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade relations. While those factors gave markets a boost, crypto prices have now begun to stabilize as traders reassess risk.

Despite the pullback, Bitcoin whales and sharks are still accumulating. According to Santiment, Bitcoin's largest holders, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have accumulated over 83,000 BTC in the past month, signaling strong confidence in further upside. In contrast, small retail investors holding less than 0.1 BTC have offloaded 387 BTC, likely locking in profits amid fears of a market top.

Looking ahead, all eyes are on Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 on May 19. Analysts at QCP Capital believe the move could act as a short-term catalyst for the crypto sector, potentially attracting over $9 billion in passive fund flows.

Bitcoin (BTC) is losing its crypto market share amid signs of easing global trade tensions and rising M2 supply. In other words, traders are beginning to take more risks in altcoins, which may lead to the so-called “altseason,” where most coins outperform Bitcoin.

Should such a sentiment return, altcoins that have underperformed the most so far in 2025, despite strong underlying fundamentals, may outperform the broader crypto market.

Let's examine three altcoins that may fare better than the rest if the altcoin season starts.

Ethereum has been 2025's most underwhelming top altcoin, with its native token, Ether (ETH), shedding over 50% at a time in the year despite major developments like the Pectra upgrade and persistent dominance in the DeFi sector.

But ETH's brutal underperformance could be its greatest strength heading into altseason.

Historically, Ethereum has led the altcoin market's recovery once Bitcoin dominance peaks and capital rotates out of BTC. ETH/BTC is currently showing early signs of bottoming, and if it breaks higher, it may signal the start of a broader altcoin rally.

Meanwhile, onchain data shows whales and institutional investors quietly accumulating ETH near multi-cycle support levels.

In altseason cycles, lagging majors like ETH often outperform due to oversold conditions and renewed investor attention. Once Ethereum catches a bid, it tends to ignite the entire layer-1 sector.

Ethereum's monthly chart is flashing a potential macro bullish reversal, marked by a rebound from the lower boundary of a long-term symmetrical triangle pattern—a historically bullish setup.

The price has reclaimed the key 50-month EMA (~$2,224) and is now trading just above the critical 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (~$2,562), suggesting growing bullish momentum.

If ETH holds this level and breaks above the triangle's upper trendline near $3,144–$3,600 (up 25-50%), it could trigger a strong rally toward $3,863 and possibly $5,000, aligning with prior cycle highs.

The monthly RSI is rising toward neutral territory (~50.4), signaling early signs of renewed strength without being overbought.

In short, ETH appears to be staging a major comeback—particularly compelling if altseason takes hold—positioning it as a prime rebound candidate after months of underperformance.

Polygon's transition from MATIC to POL as part of its Polygon 2.0 upgrade has left many investors confused, contributing to its massive drawdown. POL is one of the worst-performing assets among the top 20 coins in 2025, down over 50%.

Yet, this neglect may set up a classic “laggard catch-up” play. Polygon's zkEVM, combined with its legacy PoS chain, still supports one of the largest DApp ecosystems in crypto.

Once altseason rotates into L2s and Ethereum scaling narratives, POL could benefit from its broad infrastructure footprint and strong institutional connections (e.g., with Nike, Reddit, and Disney).

During previous altcycles, coins like MATIC surged over 100x from their lows. With POL trading at depressed levels, a similar risk/reward setup may be emerging, especially if ETH continues rallying further.

Polygon is trading within a descending parallel channel and recently bounced from its lower boundary near $0.20, suggesting a potential reversal. The chart implies a move toward the upper channel resistance around $0.55 could deliver a 120% gain if momentum continues.

With altseason heating up, reclaiming the 0.786 Fib level (~$0.55) could open the door to a larger rally toward ~$0.97 (0.618 Fib). As one of the most beaten-down top altcoins, POL is positioned for a strong catch-up move if broader market sentiment improves.

Unlike ETH and POL, which fall into the “oversold rebound” category, Toncoin (TON) represents a different breed of altseason candidate — momentum.

Backed by Telegram's 900 million+ user base, TON has gained attention for its integration into Telegram's interface and a fast-expanding ecosystem of Mini Apps, games, and DeFi protocols.

TON had been one of the few top-20 cryptocurrencies posting gains in 2024, repeatedly making higher highs as broader altcoins lagged.

That strength abruptly paused following the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France, which triggered a wave of uncertainty around TON's regulatory future and its close association with Telegram.

However, the drop appears to be sentiment-driven rather than fundamental.

TON's underlying value proposition remains intact: a functional layer-1 network with real-world adoption through Telegram's massive user base.

If Durov's legal situation stabilizes and altseason continues gaining steam, TON could regain its leadership position as both a technical and narrative-driven play.

Toncoin continues to trade within a long-term ascending channel, signaling a structurally bullish trend despite recent pullbacks.

The price recently bounced near the channel's lower boundary and is now consolidating just above the 0.5 Fibonacci level (~$3.10)—a key support area. If TON maintains this level and sentiment improves, it could resume its broader uptrend.

The chart's 2.618 Fib extension (~$13.10) marks the primary upside target, representing a potential 320% gain from current levels.

Given TON's strong fundamentals—Telegram integration, growing DeFi ecosystem, and retail momentum—this target is technically and narratively plausible if altseason fully materializes.

The US Core PPI decline signals easing inflation, sparking hopes for rate cuts that could boost Bitcoin and altcoin prices.

The financial market received fresh signs of cooling inflation in the United States on Thursday following the Producer Price Index (PPI) report. The preferred inflation gauge pointed to weaker-than-expected producer prices. The released data triggered immediate attention from traders as Bitcoin

	 and top altcoins reacted.

According to X user CyclesWithBach, the US PPI for April rose 2.4% year-on-year. However, it fell short of the 2.5% forecast and down from 2.7% the previous month.

Similarly, the monthly PPI figure showed an even sharper move, falling 0.5% compared to the expected 0.2% increase. This marks the most significant drop in producer prices in recent months and adds weight to signs that inflation is steadily easing.

Core PPI, which strips out food and energy costs, came in at 3.1% year-on-year, matching estimates but down from 3.3% in March. On a monthly basis, core PPI declined 0.4%, undercutting expectations of a 0.3% rise. These numbers follow Tuesday's release of April CPI data, which showed consumer inflation dropping to 2.3%, its lowest since early 2021.

That CPI news sparked a rally in Bitcoin, pushing it to new local highs as traders bet on the Federal Reserve easing interest rates later in the year. However, the climb was short-lived. Profit-taking quickly kicked in, dragging Bitcoin back below $102,000. The crypto market has since steadied, but the mood remains watchful.

It is worth noting that the broader macro picture also showed mixed signals. Jobless claims stood at 229,000, exactly as forecast.

Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index improved to -4, exceeding expectations of -11 and rebounding from -26.4 in April. Retail sales rose 0.1% month-on-month, slightly above the 0% estimate but far below March's 1.4% jump.

Market analysts are closely watching the January US CPI report, which aligns with the released easing inflation data. They noted that a lower-than-expected inflation figure could trigger a recovery in Bitcoin and altcoins.

It is important to note that the total crypto market cap had climbed back above $3.38 trillion before the release of the PPI numbers, fueled by optimism around easing inflation. Despite this, Bitcoin's price still declined.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin has dropped 1.86% over the past 24 hours and is now trading for $101,734. Altcoins like Ethereum [NC] and XRP

This price outlook shows the cautious market mood before the data was released. It is worth noting that Bitcoin faced selling pressure before the data release.

Crypto analyst Doctor Profit noted that Bitcoin price may be approaching a local bottom, with the MVRV indicator suggesting a potential range between $68,000 and $74,000.

However, with CPI and PPI showing consistent declines, crypto investors are watching for a potential digital asset market rebound. If the lower inflation continues, cryptocurrency may benefit from looser financial conditions in the months ahead.

 Pi Network has launched a $100 million fund, Pi Network Ventures, to invest in startups and businesses that drive the adoption and utility of its blockchain ecosystem. 

Mobile-first blockchain Pi Network has launched a $100 million fund to invest in initiatives built on its infrastructure.

According to a May 14 announcement, the Pi Foundation is launching Pi Network Ventures with an initial investment of $100 million in Pi (PI) tokens and US dollars. The fund will invest in startups and businesses building on Pi Network or contributing to its broader ecosystem.

“This strategic program intends to invest in high-quality startups and companies across sectors, driving innovation and ecosystem growth,” Pi Network said in an X post.

The Pi Foundation, the organization behind Pi Network, is described as an “ownerless” entity focused on supporting long-term ecosystem development. The foundation said the new venture fund will draw from the 10% of Pi tokens reserved for ecosystem initiatives.  

Pi Network had not responded to Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

Pi Network Ventures is tasked with increasing Pi's utility by investing in startups and businesses that integrate it into products and services. The new organization will attempt to bring more apps, transactions and companies into the network while developing new use cases:

Per the announcement, Pi Network Ventures plans to invest in startups from the early stages to Series B funding rounds and beyond. The hope is that such an approach allows access to high-potential innovators while also helping scale proven businesses.

Pi Network Ventures claims to differ from other crypto ecosystem programs in its focus and processes. The announcement said the company aims not to limit itself to crypto investments but to also fund general technology sectors, including generative AI and AI applications, fintech, embedded payments, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, social networks and real-world consumer and enterprise applications.

Another claimed difference is that the investment fund aims to act like traditional Silicon Valley venture capital firms. This will reportedly be primarily seen in the sourcing, selection and vetting process, which aims to “identify and support high-impact and disruptive startups and businesses.”

The announcement comes amid ongoing criticism of Pi Network, including accusations of operating a pyramid scheme and concerns over transparency. Skeptics have pointed to the project's sparse white paper and limited public disclosure regarding its funding sources.

The platform's user referral model, which rewards participants for inviting others, has drawn comparisons to multilevel marketing structures. 

Additionally, Pi Network's native token, PI, has faced volatility, falling more than 65% since its mainnet launch in late February and currently trading about 25% below its all-time high.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","NFT founder stole millions from Bitcoin project, investors allege","https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-bitcoin-project-ceo-stole-millions-partners-allege","Thu, 15 May 2025 06:23:12 GMT","

 The leader of an NFT project and Bitcoin mining venture has been sued by his former business partners for allegedly failing to pay them their promised equity returns. 

Several investors in a non-fungible token (NFT) project, Hashling NFT, have accused its founder of misappropriating millions of dollars in profits from the project and a closely tied Bitcoin mining operation.

According to the May 14 court filing in Illinois, the plaintiffs allege that their former business partner, Jonathan Mills, lied about transferring assets from Hashling NFT and at least $3 million from the Bitcoin mining project to a holding company — Satoshi Labs LLC (formerly known as Proof of Work Labs LLC), which Mills is the founder and CEO of.

The plaintiffs have sued Mills for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that they have not received any of the equity returns that he supposedly promised. 

They also claim to have raised a combined $1.46 million from two NFT drops on the Solana and Bitcoin blockchains, but didn't receive any returns from their investment. 

Mills allegedly began ghosting them shortly afterward, according to the plaintiffs, adding that he created a flawed shareholder agreement to falsely support his claim that the holding company controlled the project's assets.

This was “rife with errors” to support his lie, the plaintiffs said.

According to the supposedly flawed shareholder agreement, Mills was to receive a 67% equity share in Proof of Work Labs (before he later renamed it to Satoshi Labs) while several other investors contributed up to $20,000 into the company in exchange for just 2% equity.

He allegedly assured them that their equity stakes would remain unchanged despite the name change.

Mills also held a 67% voting stake on all matters related to Proof of Work Labs (at the time) while no other partner held more than 2%.

Cointelegraph reached out to Mills but didn't receive an immediate response.

The Hashling NFT project was born from a different idea that Mills had initially discussed with one of the plaintiffs, Dustin Steerman, who initially established rapport with Mills from earlier collaborations.

They followed through with the Hashling NFT project despite Mills initially telling Steerman that he had no money and no NFT-related experience to contribute to the project.

“[Mills] had a willingness to help push the project forward, and he did have an idea at the start,” the investor's attorney, Clinton Ind of Ind Legal Group LLC told Law360.

To ensure the Hashling NFT project's success, Mills and Steerman recruited other investors, now also plaintiffs, to assist with everything from the NFT art and social media marketing to even attending NFT conferences in New York.

Mills even got his girlfriend to invest in the Hashling NFTs project, the plaintiffs claimed.

In addition to the fraud and breach of fiduciary actions, the plaintiffs also requested a constructive trust over the project's assets and full legal restitution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Pranksy: Inside the anonymous life of an NFT legend — NFT Collector","https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/pranksy-inside-anonymous-life-nft-legend-nft-collector/","Thu, 15 May 2025 14:31:29 GMT","

OG collector Pranksy is one of the most prolific figures in the NFT space, yet remains one of crypto's greatest mysteries, with his true identity still unknown.Starting with just $600 worth of ETH in 2017 (incredibly he's never had to buy any more ETH with fiat) Pranksy cut his teeth with the explosion of CryptoKitties and quickly built up a stack of ETH which he relentlessly poured back into the ecosystem, being dubbed the “King of the Mint” by the time NFT mania truly hit in 2020-21.A key figure in popularizing Bored Ape Yacht Club, some of his trades have become legendary.On September 4, 2021, he purchased a Zombie CryptoPunk #6275 for 1,000 ETH ($3.89M) and sold it later that same day for 1,320 ETH ($5.12mil) — a casual $1.23 million profit in 24 hours.

Today, he still has more than 45,000 NFTs in his primary wallet, pranksy.eth, with Avastars and CyberBrokers two of his biggest current holdings.

But while few names in NFTs carry as much weight as his, ask him who Pranksy  really is and the answer might surprise you.

“Pranksy was an individual. In fact, the name ‘Pranksy' was only adopted a few years into the world of NFTs, when the market started gaining interest in digital art,” he tells NFT Collector. 

“Pranksy now represents a wonderfully diverse team of people; however, ‘Pranksy' is still an individual voice, who runs his own social media, he just has help running NFTBoxes and our new shiny thing, the House of Pranksy.”

Similar to the trajectory of other OG NFT collectors such as j1mmy.eth and Nate Alex, Pranksy first stumbled upon NFTs through CryptoKitties around the end of 2017. He had never even bought ETH at the time. 

“A friend told me via Slack that people were paying ridiculous amounts of money for pictures of cats on the internet, and you could breed those cats, the rest is history,” Pranksy says. 

“I bought around $600 of ETH to buy and mint those kittens, I never bought ETH again after this.” 

That moment led to years of collecting, experimenting and building up a huge stack of ETH in a space that most of the world hadn't yet heard of. Long before 2021-22 NFT mania, Pranksy was stacking NFTs and making a name for himself among a tight-knit group of collectors, artists and project founders through 2017-2020.

And the origin of the name “Pranksy”? “Before Pranksy, it was Pranked. I wanted to rebrand when minting my first piece of terrible artwork,” he says.

One of Pranksy's most notable moments in his career as a top NFT whale started like any other mint.

On 1 May 2021, he minted 1,250 Bored Apes in a few batches. His initial mint of 250 was followed with a tweet, “No horrible FOMO pricing strategy, each Ape is .08 ETH, + they look great.” Within a few more hours, Pranksy ran his total up to 1,250 total Apes. 

Pranky's multiple large mints and tweets, along with j1mmy.Eth's sweep of 420 Apes led to the sell-out of all 10,000. At the time, no one, including Pranksy, could predict the trajectory BAYC was about to take.

“It wasn't very different to many other mints, it was at a time when NFT projects didn't sell out in seconds with a huge waitlist for minting. Nobody expected BAYC to be one of the greatest returns on initial investment in the history of finance.”

He recalls interacting with his running mate, j1mmy.eth and BAYC, “Passed the profile picture test.”

What followed was a historic run. A single Ape could eventually net a holder close to $1mil from a mint cost of 0.08 ETH (~$220), if they held their original BAYC and sold their airdrops: BAKC (June '21), MAYC (Sep '21), ApeCoin (Mar '22), and Otherside Land (May '22). The top coincided with the Otherdeed for Otherside mint at the end of April 2022, almost exactly one year after the mint.

The eye-watering run-up of value for Bored Apes didn't happen immediately. For the first month, Apes were still sitting below a 1 ETH floor price, and Pranksy was still sending large quantities of his collection to friends.

By the back half of 2021, Apes were becoming a cultural phenomenon and they were everywhere: Steph Curry, Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon, Madonna, Justin Bieber and many more. Everyone wanted a piece of the action. 

Pranksy ended up doing deals with some of the world's most famous people and sports stars, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Tinie Tempah to NBA star Josh Hart, who's currently playing in the NBA playoffs.

The Becoming of Bitcoin: A Narrative Untainted by Illusions of Truth

“At the time, BAYC was just another NFT project. I was doing giveaways and trades for ridiculous things to raise awareness for NFTs as a whole, as well as my own following, not a particular project.”

“I traded with NBA stars, musicians and celebrities, usually for things like sports jerseys and sunglasses.”

Who were his favorites to interact with? 

“Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely to talk to and genuinely engaged. Imogen Heap was experimenting with the blockchain long before the ERC-721 standard was written. Tinie Tempah was also fun, we were looking at some creative collaboration options at one point, he is still repping his Ape today.”

And any regrets about parting with so many Apes?“No ‘ragrets',” he says. 

Pranksy is a huge sports fan too, and when NBA Top Shot launched, he became one of the top collectors.

While the magic of the early days of NBA Top Shot has fizzled out for many, Pranksy believes the platform and sports NFTs may still have their best days ahead of them yet.

“During its alpha launch, I repeatedly stated publicly that NBA Top Shot would define NFTs, and its failure or success would drive the future of tokenized collectibles. In 2021, Top Shot exploded in popularity, as did NFTs,” says Pranksy.

“Four years later, the ridiculous prices have disappeared, but the project still has fans who mint regularly. The use cases for NFTs are exponential, we lost that vision during the PFP bull market during COVID-19, but I still believe in the tech and its potential.”

Sorare, a fantasy football game that uses NFTs as digital trading cards, also captured his attention, and Pranksy is now a promotional partner for the project.

“I'm a huge fan of sports, analytics and stats within sports. Sorare couldn't be better placed to fit my interests. I genuinely believe it's the best fantasy sports product in the world. I've spent over 1,000 ETH on some football JPEGs. I don't believe another NFT project has found a better balance between utility and collectibles.” 

Pranksy is also no stranger to creating. In 2021, Pranksy launched NFTBoxes, a curated experience designed to spotlight artists and make art collecting fun. It was inspired by the success of his previous NFT Advent Calendar. 

“The idea simply was to put quality NFT pieces together in a single monthly box from talented artists within the space. Art can be so exciting, but the art world can be closed and talent often gets pushed out of the spotlight. We aimed to break that boundary and bring inspiring art pieces to NFT collectors and beyond.

Now he's teasing House of Pranksy, a new project with different ambitions.

“Unlike traditional NFT clubs that revolve around speculative value, House of Pranksy is being built around cultural permanence, knowledge, community and legacy.” Project updates will be on his personal X account.

What's your thesis as an NFT collector? How do you think about buying and selling?

You might as well ask me, “How do you breathe?” because the answer is, I don't know. It just happens. Instinct and luck play a part. Collect because you authentically believe in something, want to participate in something, or because you like it. Speculation isn't always the fun part.

Whose NFT portfolio do you think has an awesome collection outside of yours?

There are many individuals, I think anyone who has stuck around since 2017 deserves a mention.

What's been your biggest NFT sale?

I bought CryptoPunk #6275 for 1,000 ETH ($3.89 million) and sold it for 1,320 ETH ($5.12 million) on the same day.

Where's your head currently at with the NFT space? 

A large majority of the “NFT space” have moved to memecoins, AI, or whatever else is on trend. However, I see daily posts from “OGs” and the class of 2021 missing the vibe we had when NFTs were the only thing we were talking about. In 2020-22, we had the perfect storm of lockdown, the Beeple auction and the rise of Top Shot. I don't think we'll ever see that perfect storm again, but I wouldn't rule out an NFT renaissance.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are experiencing spectacular growth thanks to the new opportunities they offer for interaction and monetization to fans, clubs and athletes in the sports industry.

Platforms such as NBA Top Shot, which allows users to own key moments in basketball as NFTs, generated nearly $500 million in sales and had over 800,000 registered accounts a few years ago.

The initial enthusiasm for NFTs quickly faded after scandals over speculation and fraud shook user confidence. For this sector to reach full maturity, there must be stricter regulation and enhanced security practices.

Beyond the promises of these new markets, the challenges in terms of security and regulation are considerable. If the sector wants to have sustainable growth, it must answer a crucial question: how can the healthy and secure development of these rapidly expanding assets be ensured? The adoption of NFTs in the sports industry continues to grow, but the regulatory framework must evolve to support this expansion.

As professors at Polytechnique Montréal and HEC Montréal and researchers at CIRANO, our research focuses on social networks and new technologies.

NFT sales exploded in 2021 with record transactions such as the sale of a digital artwork by artist Beeple for US$69.3 million (C$96 million), and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's sale of his first tweet for US$2.9 million (C$4 million).

In the world of sports, a dunk by LeBron James during a game between the L.A. Lakers and the Sacramento Kings sold for US$208,000 (C$289,000) on the NBA Top Shot platform. The concept of owning a unique, authenticated, and verifiable moment on a blockchain has attracted a new wave of investors and fans willing to spend considerable sums of money.

In 2021, another dunk by Lebron James sold for US$210,000 (C$292,000).

The appeal of NFTs in the sports industry lies in their exclusivity and digital rarity.

A NFT establishes indisputable ownership of a digital asset, whether it's a player card, a video clip, or even a virtual souvenir of a sporting event. This blockchain-centric market enables absolute traceability and paves the way for additional revenue streams for clubs and leagues.

For example, NBA Top Shot completed more than three million transactions in 2021, the majority of which were microtransactions ranging from $10 to $50, while only 1% of transactions exceeded $1,500.

NFTs and fan tokens (fungibles) offer unprecedented opportunities to sports clubs to generate revenue and build fan loyalty.

A fan token is similar to a club ""share,"" and each fan can own a small part of it. The price of the token depends on factors such as the value, profit or popularity of a club, which change with the club's successes or failures over time. Football clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid and FC Barcelona have launched their own fan tokens, which allow fans to buy a symbolic ""share"" in the club.

These tokens also allow fans to participate in smaller decisions, such as choosing the team's uniform or selecting the songs played during match breaks. NBA Top Shot, meanwhile, has enabled NFTs representing sporting moments to be sold at astronomical prices, thereby capturing the interest of collectors and investors.

But the enthusiasm of fans shouldn't mask the realities of the market. Despite significant volumes, there is a notable concentration of value in a small number of accounts: 9% of accounts hold 80% of the market value of the $41 billion worth of NFTs traded on the Ethereum blockchain. These inequalities serve as a reminder that, despite their apparent accessibility, NFTs can exacerbate market dynamics that already exist in the world of art and physical collections.

The spectacular success of NFTs in sports nevertheless has a downside.

Cases of fraud, counterfeiting and market manipulation are on the rise. Among the most worrying techniques is the ""rug pull,"" where creators abruptly abandon a project after artificially inflating the value of NFTs.

A recent example is the Eternal Beings collection, promoted by American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. Shortly after encouraging his millions of followers to invest, he deleted his posts, causing the value of the tokens to plummet.

The phenomenon of wash trading, a practice that involves making artificial transactions to manipulate prices, is also a major problem.

In 2021, a report by Chainalysis revealed that 110 wash traders made nearly $8.9 million in profits by manipulating the prices of their own NFTs. Although they are documented, these fraudulent practices operate in a regulatory gray area.

To date, few regulations specific to NFTs have been put in place, although some countries, such as France, have begun to take action. In October 2023, the SREN law authorized the testing of games with monetizable digital items, including NFTs, for a period of three years.

The current regulatory framework for NFTs in the sports industry is still in its infancy.

In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed its first charges against non-compliant platforms. Impact Theory, a podcast studio, was fined for raising $30 million through unregistered NFT sales.

In the European Union, regulators are also beginning to explore how to integrate these new assets into their financial oversight frameworks. In May 2023, the European Union adopted regulations on markets in crypto-assets (MiCA), establishing a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset issuers and related service providers.

Although MiCA doesn't specifically target non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the regulation stipulates that issuing crypto-assets in large series or collections may be considered an indicator of fungibility, thereby making these assets subject to the provisions of MiCA. This approach aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure appropriate oversight of emerging NFT markets.

NFTs in the sports industry undeniably represent a new frontier for clubs, fans and investors. They create new experiences and transform the way we perceive and consume sports.

However, increased regulation and enhanced security practices are necessary for this sector to reach its full maturity. At a time when speculation and fraud threaten user confidence, regulators must ensure that the promises of NFTs are fulfilled without giving in to abuses.

With appropriate regulation and increased user awareness of the opportunities and risks of NFTs, this segment could become an essential pillar of the digital economy. By balancing innovation and stakeholder protection, NFTs in sports have the potential to generate substantial economic opportunities while transforming the sports ecosystem to make it more inclusive and interactive.

NFTs have rapidly expanded in the sports industry, offering new revenue streams and fan engagement opportunities. However, issues such as fraud, counterfeiting, and price manipulation, including wash trading and rug pulls, pose significant risks. The sector's sustainable growth depends on stricter regulation and improved security, as current frameworks remain limited and evolving.

An international study into why some countries are accelerating Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects, and why others are holding back, has found that the adoption of CBDCs is shaped less by technological readiness or economic development, and more by politics, levels of government transparency and, in some cases, corruption.

A CBDC is a digital form of government-issued money, backed and regulated by a nation's central bank.

The research, led by Nottingham Business School (NBS), part of Nottingham Trent University, analyzed 68 countries and revealed that more authoritarian governments are leading the charge on CBDCs due to centralized power structures which allow these governments to quickly implement tightly controlled systems—often leveraging digital currencies to enhance surveillance and control capital flows.

In contrast, countries with more democratic institutions and political systems are proceeding with more caution, taking time to address concerns around privacy, transparency, and trust before moving forward.

The study also explored the relationship between corruption and CBDC adoption and found that countries with higher levels of perceived corruption are more likely to explore digital currencies.

Dr. Milad Armani Dehghani, who led the research with Professor Alex Brauneis from Nottingham Business School, said, ""At first, that might seem backwards. But when you think about it, it starts to make sense. Digital currencies give governments powerful tools to fight things like money laundering, tax evasion, and illegal money flows, especially in places where traditional banking systems aren't exactly known for being transparent.

""Take China's e-CNY, for example. It's built on encrypted tech that lets the government track spending and stop things like counterfeit currency.

""Russia's digital Ruble takes a different approach—it outright bans private cryptocurrencies, citing fears about terrorism and illegal arms funding. In these cases, CBDCs aren't just about innovation. They're about control, stability, and bringing some order to messy financial systems, though whether that's a good thing or a little too much oversight really depends on how you look at it.""

The rise of stablecoins—privately issued digital currencies like USDT and USDC—has also played a role in shaping national strategies. Although these currencies are not the direct cause of CBDC development, their rapid growth has increased the urgency for governments to respond. Stablecoins are fast, efficient, and borderless, making them attractive but also threatening to traditional financial systems and national monetary sovereignty.

The research also found that a country's level of development, measured by factors such as income, education, and life expectancy, has little bearing on whether it pursues a CBDC. Both advanced and developing economies are actively exploring digital currencies, but for different reasons.

While wealthier nations focus on innovation and competing with Big Tech, developing countries are drawn to the potential of CBDCs to increase financial inclusion and reduce corruption.

Professor Alex Brauneis, co-author and Professor of Finance and Innovation at the Center for Finance, Technology and Society at NBS, said: ""This research helps policymakers and innovators alike understand the broader implications of digital currency. Whether you're building the technology or shaping the regulations, the question isn't just can they do this, but why are they doing it?

""For developers of digital wallets and crypto platforms, understanding the regulatory landscape in each country is crucial, particularly how political systems influence the pace and direction of innovation.

Governments are encouraged to critically evaluate whether their CBDC strategies support goals like economic freedom and transparency, or whether they risk concentrating power and oversight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Kyrgyzstan to launch gold-backed stablecoin in Q3","https://coingeek.com/kyrgyzstan-to-launch-gold-backed-stablecoin-in-q3/","Thu, 15 May 2025 05:02:33 GMT","

The central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan intends to launch its new stablecoin later this year, one of the officials involved in its development has revealed.

The Kyrgyz government has been developing the USDKG stablecoin for months now as a solution to its financial inclusion and remittance challenges. At a recent digital asset event in Dubai, one of the project's advisors revealed that the stablecoin is set to debut in Q3.

USDKG will be backed by $500 million worth of gold at launch, which the government intends to expand to $2 billion. To account for any swings in the price of gold— which has gained 25%, or $650 this year—Kyrgyzstan will overcollateralize the stablecoin. The government also intends to conduct regular independent audits to maintain trust in the currency.

The new stablecoin will primarily target remittances, which play a prominent role in the country's economy. In 2024, Kyrgyzstan received $3 billion in remittances, with Russia at $2.7 billion dominating the sector. Kyrgyz residents paid an average of 8% in fees to receive the remittances (banks charge as much as 12%), higher than the global average of 6.6% and nearly thrice the UN-recommended 3%.

The Kyrgyz government believes that a national stablecoin can reduce the costs, increase access and reduce the complexities involved in the process.

The USDKG has taken precedence over the digital som, the country's CBDC. Last year, the country's central bank revealed that it had developed a demo version of the digital som and a few months later, proposed legal amendments that would pave the way for the CBDC's launch. Since then, it has not revealed any new developments on that front.

ECB launches innovation hub to test digital euro use cases

Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB) has launched an innovation hub to test innovative use cases of its prospective digital euro.

The ECB first announced the initiative last October, inviting European financial industry stakeholders to submit applications by November 29. The regional bank has now selected 70 participants for the four-month hub, ranging from fintechs and banks to tech firms and academia.

Surprisingly, only four banks—CaixaBank (NASDAQ: CIXPF), Berenberg, Erste Group (NASDAQ: EBKOF) and Bank of Cyprus (NASDAQ: BKCYF)—joined the initiative. Other participants include German semiconductor giant Infineon and subsidiaries of software giant SAP, Tata Consultancy, KPMG and Accenture (NASDAQ: ACN).










“We welcome the huge amount of interest that market participants have shown in this exciting initiative,” commented Piero Cipollone, an ECB executive board member.

The platform will have two distinct workstreams: pioneers and visionaries. Under the pioneers' workstream, participants will limit their exploration to conditional payments and how the ECB can best develop technical standards to support them.

This workstream has 45 participants, including three of the four participating banks.

Companies in the visionaries workstream will focus on the bigger picture, including how the digital euro can solve societal challenges such as financial inclusion. They will organize workshops with the ECB to discuss how the central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be more accessible, easier to use and integrate into existing payment rails.

Visionaries will include the Italian university Politecnico di Milano, Erste Group Bank, German savings banks association DSGV and blockchain firm Exyond.

A few participants, like Tata Consultancy, German fintech firm PoMo Service and Spanish mobile payments service BIZUM, will be involved in both workstreams.

“The breadth and creativity of the proposals highlights the digital euro's potential as a catalyst for financial innovation in Europe, including the development of new solutions that further enhance the payment experience for Europeans and create market [opportunities],” Cipollone stated.

The ECB will publish a report with findings from both workstreams later this year.

The new initiative is the latest in the ECB's ongoing two-year CBDC preparations, which end later this year. While the regulator is committed to the project, the digital euro's fate lies in the hands of European legislators, who must pass new legislation that paves the way for the CBDC.

Speaking to one outlet recently, a spokesperson for the regional bank noted that CBDC legislation “is still under discussion and we won't take a decision on issuing the digital euro before that process is complete.”

The latest initiative comes as CBDC interest globally has cooled down after a scramble that was sparked by Western fear that China's digital yuan would take over. However, since then, countries like the U.S. have rejected CBDCs, while others like Canada have stated that they are focusing on other, more critical financial innovations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Jim Chanos takes opposing bets on Bitcoin and Strategy","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:7bfb84bf7094b:0-jim-chanos-takes-opposing-bets-on-bitcoin-and-strategy/","Thu, 15 May 2025 12:09:08 GMT","

Prominent short-seller Jim Chanos, once a vocal critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, revealed a new trading play that involves shorting shares of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and buying Bitcoin.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he's “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch.

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.

Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of retail speculation.”

Selling Strategy stock to buy Bitcoin

Chanos' recent move assumes investors overpay for Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers like Strategy and other firms that follow its Bitcoin accumulation blueprint. The investor's move reflects a stance that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing Strategy's stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. 

Chanos' move suggests that holding Bitcoin through companies reflects excessive speculation and risk mispricing. It assumes that retail investors' idea of having Bitcoin indirectly through corporate wrappers can inflate the company's stock valuations. 

While shorting Strategy may seem like a good idea, investors have already lost billions shorting Saylor's company. In 2024, investors who bet against the firm lost about $3.3 billion as the stock rose. 

As of May 2025, Strategy holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, valued at around $59 billion. Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, its stock price has surged by 1,500%, outperforming the S&P 500's gains during the same period. 

In a recently released documentary from the Financial Times, Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company's Bitcoin holdings would help it become the “number one publicly traded equity in the entire market” in the future.

Chanos previously called Bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy” 

Chanos has not always been favorable toward Bitcoin. In a 2018 interview, Chanos described Bitcoin as a “libertarian fantasy.” 

Chanos said that having digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario wouldn't work. The investor said that if fiat currency brings the world down, the last thing he'd want to own is Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. 

He also criticized Bitcoin for enabling illicit activity, calling the crypto sector “the dark side of finance” in a 2023 interview, and accusing the industry of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.

Chanos also expressed skepticism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in crypto to profit from the fees. 

Despite those critiques, Chanos now appears to see value in holding Bitcoin directly, particularly in contrast to investing in public companies with large BTC treasuries.

Chanos' history in short-selling

Chanos is best known for his short position against the energy company Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The move generated profits for Kynikos Associates, a firm that he founded. 

A short position involves borrowing assets from a broker, selling them at the current price, and then repurchasing the assets once the value falls to give back what is owed to the broker. Short sellers profit when the asset's value declines, but face losses when the asset appreciates. 

While the investor profited from short-selling Enron, Chanos' predictions weren't always correct. Chanos was bearish on Tesla and announced a short position in 2016. Tesla stock skyrocketed by 2,200% between 2015 and 2021. 

The event caused major losses to Chanos' fund. In 2020, the fund ended with $405 million in assets under management after having over $900 million the previous year. The fund was converted into a family office, and external assets were returned to investors.

US crypto investors contributed millions of dollars to Trump's election victory and did not conceal lingering contempt for Biden at Consensus

“Across the board, it's been a very encouraging three months,” said Lewis Cohen, a lawyer specialising in digital assets with the New York firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

Cohen was speaking at Consensus, the world's longest-running crypto conference, hosted this year in Canada's largest city, Toronto.

Trump's son Eric, who is promoting his own crypto business, is expected to address the conference on Thursday amid increasing questions about potential conflict of interest with his father in the White House.

Eric Trump is deeply involved in the crypto industry through direct business ventures, notably as a co-founder and executive at American Bitcoin, as well as through family-backed projects like World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP meme coin.

A rare bipartisan deal to regulate stablecoins is now on life support, underscoring how a proposal with widespread backing from lawmakers and industry players can get caught up in the political maelstrom over the Trump family's business conflicts.

A bloc of Democrats and Republicans in the US Senate stood ready to advance the “GENIUS Act” (S. 1582), supported by many digital asset and consumer advocates as way to place federal guardrails on the $205 billion stablecoin market. 

But the legislative push collapsed last week after Democrats demanded provisions ensuring that the president and vice president are covered by bill language to prohibit lawmakers and senior executive branch officials from issuing stablecoins while in office.

The impasse leaves the US at risk of lagging Europe and other jurisdictions and relying on an uneven array of state rules to police digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies, frustrating some industry professionals. 

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already mounted an effort to revive the stablecoin legislation, with lead bill sponsor Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) urging bill passage before Congress reaches its Memorial Day recess.

“The statement about how this could allow the Trump family to make money with impunity is kind of fearmongering,” said Jonathan Schmalfeld, an associate at Polsinelli PC who focuses on blockchain technology. “It's hard to see how regulating something that is currently legal by creating a regulatory framework that provides more consumer safeguards and protections could somehow benefit the Trump family directly.”

World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's decentralized finance project, announced a $2 billion investment using its new stablecoin in early May. The transaction by Abu Dhabi's MGX uses the USD1 token to invest in Binance Holdings Ltd., the world's largest crypto exchange, which pleaded guilty several years ago to money laundering and other violations.

The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who warned the stablecoin legislation would “make it easier for the President and his family to line their own pockets.” In addition to the stablecoin investment, the creators of Trump's memecoin held a contest offering its top holders the chance to win a private dinner with the president scheduled for May 22.

Regulating stablecoin issuers won't necessarily curb the Trump family's digital asset operations, though it may stave off potential fraud by entities purporting to offer dollar-backed tokens and help avoid a repeat of the 2022 collapse of TerraUSD and Luna, according to lawyers specializing in cryptocurrency.

Stablecoin issuers and consumers both seek more predictability and clarity over what regulations apply—or even which regulator oversees the dollar-backed investments. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission under Biden-era Chair Gary Gensler approached the tokens and other digital assets as securities, while the agency under Trump-appointed leadership has taken the opposite stance.

“Until there is predictable, equitable legislation in place, the US is going to be a less desirable place to launch some of these products than other places like Europe, which has a full-bore market structure regulation in place with MiCA,” said Meagan Griffin, a partner at Paul Hastings LLP who focuses on digital assets, referring to the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets policy. “They don't want the regulation-by-enforcement that was really the hallmark of the prior administration's agencies.”

Falling behind foreign jurisdictions is just one obstacle posed by the delay in Congress after the Senate measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance. 

A policy vacuum at the federal level also means stablecoin issuers are at the mercy of varying state policies. 

Texas has long treated stablecoins as “money or monetary value” under its existing money transmitter law, California lawmakers passed a measure broadly limiting stablecoins unless the issuer is licensed or otherwise exempt, and Wyoming plans to issue a stablecoin of its own this year.

The current mix of rules could persist without a unifying definition of how stablecoins function, what assets they are pegged to, and who can issue them, according to Braeden Anderson, a managing partner at Anderson PC who has advised clients on crypto regulation.

“It really should be a bipartisan bill that regulates fiat-backed digital dollars, not necessarily related to speculative crypto or memecoins,” he said. “This isn't casino chips; it's banking infrastructure for the blockchain age.”

As a banking tool, stablecoins should be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency instead of the SEC, which may prompt broader adoption and invite more large financial institutions to act as issuers in an update to their current procedures and systems, Anderson said.

Time is of the essence. Stablecoin issuers are expected to outpace foreign investors as the primary buyers of US Treasuries by 2030, according to an April study by the Citi Institute.

“If those purchases go to foreign currency bonds, that has a huge impact on the US dollar and the US economy,” Schmalfeld said. “It isn't so much that there's harm to crypto generally, but that the US dollar might not be the thing that people are pegging their digital asset transactions to, which is a huge danger for the US.”

Opponents of the bill, including small banking institutions and some consumer groups with influence in Washington, see the potential for stablecoins to disrupt a time-tested business model.

Those who embrace the technological shift in dollar-backed transactions see the passage of a unified law governing stablecoin issuers as inevitable, likening it to an evolutionary step as part of broader market structure changes.

“This is like going from 2D to 3D,” Anderson said. “This is better technology, it's certainly the future, and hopefully Washington can get it together quickly so our digital economy can flourish.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Crypto exchange Coinbase faces up to $400m hit from cyber attack","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80k5plpx8do","Thu, 15 May 2025 15:19:08 GMT","

One of the world's biggest cryptocurrency firms, Coinbase, says a recent cyber attack will cost it up to $400m (£301m).

The firm said it was contacted by hackers who claimed to have gained access to customer information, obtained by making payments to Coinbase contractors and employees.

In a blog post, Coinbase said the criminals had gained access to ""less than 1%"" of its customer data, which they then used to impersonate the firm and trick people into handing over their crypto.

The group then demanded $20m from Coinbase to keep it quiet - but it refused to pay the bribe and instead promised to pay back every person who got scammed.

The disclosure prompted the firm's share price to fall by 4.1%.

The cyber attack comes days before the US company is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index - a landmark moment for the crypto industry.

It also reflects how, as it grows, the industry has increasingly become a target for cyber criminals.

A report from research firm Chainanalysis suggests funds stolen from crypto businesses totalled $2.2bn in 2024.

""Security remains a challenge for the crypto industry despite its growing mainstream acceptance,"" said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo.

""As our nascent industry grows rapidly, it draws the eye of bad actors, who are becoming increasingly sophisticated in the scope of their attacks.""

The company says it received an email from an ""unknown threat actor"" on May 11.

""We will reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker,"" it said in its statement.

""We're cooperating closely with law enforcement to pursue the harshest penalties possible and will not pay the $20 million ransom demand we received. 

""Instead we are establishing a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible for this attack.""

In a filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission, it estimated costs between $180m and $400m.

It said this figure came from ""remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements"", however this figure could change as a result of ""potential losses, indemnification claims, and potential recoveries"".

The staff members who shared customer information with the hackers have been fired.

Coinbase told its customers to expect further attempts from scammers in the future, and advised them to be vigilant.

""Coinbase will never ask for your password, 2FA codes, or for you to transfer assets to a specific or new address, account, vault or wallet,"" it said. 

And it warned customers they should lock their accounts if they are suspicious.

""To the customers affected, we're sorry for the worry and inconvenience this incident caused,"" it said. 

""We'll keep owning issues when they arise.""

Some of its employees and contractors went rogue after they were bribed by hackers to gather information.

Crypto company Coinbase reported that some contractors and employees based outside the U.S. stole the data of some of its customers, including names, addresses, and emails, for hackers who used them to trick its customers into moving their funds to accounts linked to the attackers. According to Reuters, the crypto exchange projects a loss of $180 million to $400 million because of this cyberattack, which affected only a small segment of the company's customer base. Customers who lost money also need not worry, as the company said it will reimburse them.

The company received an email from the threat actor last May, saying that they had information on customer accounts and internal documents, and were asking for a $20 million ransom. But instead of paying off the hackers, Coinbase instead alerted law enforcement and established a reward of the same amount for information that will lead to the arrest of the attackers.

“Instead of funding criminal activity, we have investigated the incident, reinforced our controls, and will reimburse customers impacted by this incident,” Coinbase said. It also added, “Remember, Coinbase will never ask for your password, 2FA codes, or for you to transfer assets to a specific or new address, account, vault, or wallet. We will never call or text you to give you a new seed phrase or wallet address to move your funds to. If you receive this call, hang up the phone. Coinbase will never ask you to contact an unknown number to reach us.”

Coinbase has since fired all the involved overseas customer support agents who stole the customer data. It also reiterated that “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed, and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched.” The $400 million loss is also relatively small compared to the $328 billion worth of assets it holds and its more than $67 billion market capitalization.

Despite not being widely used for day-to-day transactions, losses from blockchain hacks have reached over $2.2 billion in 2024. Earlier this year, ByBit, another cryptocurrency exchange platform, fell victim to a $1.5 billion hack — the largest crypto heist in recorded history — which the FBI suspects was the work of North Korean hackers.

TORONTO — Lucas Matheson, CEO of Coinbase Canada, made a case for Canada's new government to create a national crypto strategy during his appearance at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. 

Speaking on a panel titled, ""What the new Canadian Government Needs to do to Lead In Crypto,"" Matheson outlined some key steps he believes will help position Canada as a leader in the blockchain space.

Matheson highlighted that Canada has long been a hub for crypto innovation, citing Ethereum's origins and the strong presence of Web3 developers at Canadian universities. 

However, he said the country risks falling behind as other nations actively shape crypto policies. ""We need leadership. We need champions in government to embrace this technology and legitimize it in the eyes of the everyday Canadian,"" Matheson said. He emphasized the importance of having a dedicated federal crypto leader, similar to the U.S. crypto czar.

One of his primary suggestions was for Carney to establish a government-led crypto task force within the first 100 days of the new administration. 

This task force would develop a national crypto strategy, including defining digital assets, regulating stablecoins, and allowing banks to hold crypto securely. Matheson also proposed creating a strategic bitcoin reserve and integrating crypto mining with existing data centers.

Matheson noted that stablecoins could play a key role in making digital assets less speculative, suggesting that Canada needs a stable, Canadian-dollar-denominated coin to boost financial efficiency. 

""One in five Canadians remit money abroad. We pay between 6% and 12% to remit money all around the world. And today, with crypto, you can click different buttons on your phone and send your friends and family 6% to 12% more money,"" he said.

Metheson also noted that 15% of Canadians are considered underbanked in Canada, which creates ""a significant opportunity for us to drive innovation and change,"" in the country via crypto. 

To further advocate for policy change, Matheson pointed to the ""Stand with Crypto"" initiative. 

This aims to educate lawmakers about blockchain's benefits and address misconceptions. He noted that the initiative is gaining traction among industry leaders and aims to build support among the members of Parliament.

As Canada transitions to a new government led by Mark Carney, Matheson expressed optimism about the new administration's new mandates regarding innovative technology. 

""They [Liberals] are mandated to build Canada to find economic growth and opportunities for us to embrace technology. And we have a government that is highly motivated to think of opportunities to help our country gain more economic advantage. And I think crypto and other technologies will need to be embraced, and to do that, we need to educate them,"" he said. 

However, Matheson cautioned that Canada risks being left behind in the global race to integrate crypto into the financial system unless it takes swift action.

He compared the current challenges in Canada as ""a square peg, round hole, legal definitional problem,"" due to several different layers of securities regulators.

This means that Canadians are forced to look elsewhere for crypto-related services, potentially resulting in a loss of opportunity for the country and opening users to risks.

""We're at risk for not moving fast enough to embrace the types of technology and products and services in Canada, and as a regulated financial institution, it's a priority for us to make sure that we can introduce these products and services in a compliant way, so that Canadians aren't just using a VPN and jumping off and using non compliant platforms around the world.""

Coinbase expects to pay $180 million to $400 million relating to remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements related to this incident, which saw attackers gain access to users personal information.

Coinbase received an email communication from the unknown threat actor on May 11, according to the firm. Attackers were able to access customers personal details, such as name, address, phone number, masked social security number, masked bank account numbers and other crucial details.

They accessed those details by essentially bribing Coinbase's overseas employees/contractors and subsequently demanding customer details to be sent. The exchange fired staff involved in the breach on the spot and referred to U.S. and international law enforcement. It will also press criminal charges.

""Based on facts that continue to evolve, the Company has preliminarily estimated expenses to be within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million relating to remediation costs and voluntary customer reimbursements relating to this Incident,"" the exchange said in an SEC filing.

Shares of Coinbase fell over 4% to under $253 during early U.S. trading hours.

The crypto exchange said in a blog post that it will ""reimburse customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attacker."" It has also offered a $20 million bug bounty for anyone that provides information leading to an arrest.

The confirmation of cyber criminal activity comes three months after on-chain sleuth ZachXBT claimed that Coinbase users had lost $300 million to social engineering scams.

Coinbase also said that the criminals secured government ID images, account balances and corporate data. Two-factor authentication codes and private keys were not breached, it added.

When asked for comment on the breach, Coinbase directed CoinDesk to the blog post and a statement from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

Armstrong said that he ""received a ransom note"" for $20 million in bitcoin (BTC) in exchange for these attackers not releasing some information they claim to have obtained on Coinbase customers.

UPDATE (May 15, 12:48 UTC): Updates headline, adds details on the breach. 

UPDATE (May 15, 14:19 UTC): Adds details on the breach and share price details.

CORRECTION (May 15, 16:49 UTC): Changes ""breach"" in the second paragraph for ""email received by threat actor."" Adds ""remediation and voluntary reimbursements in the opening paragraph.

Jim Chanos, the veteran investor who made his name shorting Enron, is betting on bitcoin (BTC) trade while shorting Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of the biggest cryptocurrency.

In an interview at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York with CNBC, Chanos detailed the bet. “We're selling MicroStrategy stock and buying bitcoin,” Chanos said, calling it an arbitrage move: “Basically buying something for $1, selling it for $2.50.”

Strategy started acquiring bitcoin in 2020 and has since morphed into a bitcoin proxy for investors. The firm has issued debt and equity to accumulate the cryptocurrency, and now has a 568,840 BTC hoard bought at an average cost of $69,287 per coin.

The aggressive bitcoin accumulation, backed by Wall Street analysts, has made its stock sensitive not just to bitcoin's price, but also to investor appetite for risk. Strategy's shares are up 3,500% in the last five years to now trade at $416 a piece, giving it a $115 billion market capitalization.

To Chanos, Strategy's valuation doesn't make sense as MSTR shares have surged more than the price of bitcoin.

The fund manager argues that this rise reflects retail speculation more than fundamentals, a theme he believes is echoed by other firms now trying to replicate Strategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet (3350) generated 592 million yen ($4 million) in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025, largely through bitcoin-based income strategies.

The company reported 877 million yen in revenue, with 88% coming from option premium harvesting on bitcoin BTC$103,946.66, according to its first quarter earnings release.

Metaplanet's bitcoin stash grew by more than 5,000 BTC in the quarter to reach 6,796 BTC. The firm has achieved 68% of its 10,000 BTC target just over four months after adopting its bitcoin standard on April 8, 2024, according to the document.

This aggressive accumulation has helped it become the 11th-largest public company by bitcoin holdings globally and the top in Asia. The company recently overtook El Salvador in the metric.

To finance its BTC accumulation, Metaplanet sold bonds, issued equity, and sold moving-strike stock warrants that only activate when share prices rise. The company raised 86.1 billion yen through this mechanism, becoming the largest public equity issuer in Japan so far this year.

Metaplanet's capital strategy hinges on leveraging operating cash flow and market-raised funds into bitcoin, boosting its BTC Yield, a metric tracking bitcoin per fully diluted share. That figure jumped 170% year-to-date.

Metaplanet's shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange went down 2.47% in the last trading session to 593 yen each. The firm's shares are up 65.8% year-to-date, while BTC is up 8.45% over the same period.

 Coinbase rejected a $20 million ransom demand after insiders leaked user data in a phishing scheme. The exchange expects up to $400 million in reimbursement and remediation costs. 

Coinbase, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, was hit by a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals recruited overseas support agents to leak user data, the company said.

According to a May 15 blog post, Coinbase said a group of external actors bribed and coordinated with several customer support contractors to access internal systems and steal limited user account data.

“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” Coinbase said, adding that no passwords, private keys, funds or Coinbase Prime accounts were affected.

Less than 1% of Coinbase's monthly transacting users' data was affected by the attack, the company said.

After stealing the data, the attackers attempted to extort $20 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach. Coinbase refused the demand.

Instead, the company offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the scheme.

Scammers often masquerade as recognizable brands to inspire a false sense of trust in their victims.

In 2024, Coinbase was the most impersonated cryptocurrency brand by scammers.

Coinbase said it will reimburse users who were tricked into sending cryptocurrency to phishing scammers, with expected remediation and reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.  

The crypto exchange disclosed the estimate in an 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, noting the expenses relate to “voluntary customer reimbursements” and other remediation efforts.

The attackers have been approaching the exchange's overseas customer support agents for months, aiming to “bribe” them in exchange for customer information, said Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong in a May 15 X post.

Following the attack, the exchange will strengthen its internal data management processes and relocate some of its customer support operations to avoid similar incidents.

Social engineering schemes are a growing concern for Coinbase users. Blockchain security analyst ZachXBT estimated that users lost around $45 million to phishing schemes in the week leading up to May 7.

The blockchain security analyst previously claimed that social engineering scams cost Coinbase users over $300 million annually, Cointelegraph reported on Feb. 4.

 XRP's short-term technicals show signs of upside exhaustion, with some patterns pointing to a drop under $2. 

Key takeaways:

XRP forms a double top and rising wedge, signaling short-term downside risk toward $1.94.

NUPL indicates traders are in denial, resembling past pre-crash phases.

Long-term charts still point to bullish targets between $3.69 and $17.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in a month after forming a local low at $1.80. Improving risk appetite and prospects of an “altseason” have boosted its price.

Could XRP rally further from current levels or risk a pullback in the coming days? Let's examine.

XRP formed a double top near $2.65, signaling a possible trend reversal. The pattern includes two clear peaks and a neckline around $2.47. After the second peak, XRP dropped below the neckline, confirming the bearish setup. 

A confirmed breakdown below this level points to a downside target near $2.30. The double top suggests weakening momentum after a strong rally. If buyers fail to break above $2.65, the pattern remains in play and bearish.

XRP also broke down from a rising wedge pattern, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Recent failed attempts to break above the pattern's upper trendline from the pattern reiterate the same.

A wedge breakdown is confirmed when the price falls below its lower trendline, which XRP appears to be attempting as of May 15. The cryptocurrency is additionally testing support from the 50-4H exponential moving average (50-4H EMA; the red wave). 

Breaking below the support zone increases the chance of XRP falling another 20% to around $1.94. This level comes from measuring the height of the rising wedge pattern and subtracting it from the breakdown point.

The $2.00–$2.04 range is also important because it holds a large number of leveraged long positions worth around $50 million, according to data resource CoinGlass.

If XRP drops below this range, many of these positions could be forced to close, causing a long squeeze. That would add selling pressure and push the price closer to the $1.94 target.

XRP's Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has shifted into the Belief–Denial zone, shown in green on the Glassnode chart below. When in denial, many still expect prices to rise, even as momentum fades.

This NUPL level has historically marked the early stages of major corrections. For example, XRP entered this phase before sharp declines in 2018 and 2021. 

If history repeats, XRP may face more downside in the short term, paving the way toward the price targets highlighted by the double top and rising wedge technical setups.

A counter analysis indicates a potential 45% rally toward $3.69 by June if a breakout from a multimonth falling wedge pattern plays out as intended. 

However, if XRP falls back below the wedge's upper trendline and loses support at the 20-day (purple) and 50-day (red) exponential moving averages (EMA), the bullish setup could be invalidated, risking a decline toward $1.75.

Several long-term XRP price projections have targets of $5.24 and even $17, based on symmetrical triangle patterns and Fibonacci extensions shown below.

XRP's long-term charts show a persistent bullish bias despite short-term pullback risks, indicating that the rally is probably not over.

 “Ultimately, the goal is not to replicate TradFi's weaknesses, but to reimagine private credit with the transparency and efficiency of DeFi,” a Pareto spokesperson said. 

Private credit marketplace Pareto has introduced a new synthetic dollar aimed at linking institutional investors with decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities — a move that highlights the expanding role of stablecoins in global finance.

The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDS, which are then held as collateral.

The deposited funds are placed into Pareto's credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants, Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.

To maintain its peg to the US dollar, Pareto uses what it calls a “native backing” process. Each USP token is minted only when an equivalent amount of USDC or USDS is deposited, ensuring full collateralization when the token is created. An arbitrage mechanism also supports the dollar peg's ongoing stability.

In addition, Pareto has set up a protocol-funded stability reserve to act as a buffer in case of borrower defaults.

The company said the synthetic dollar gives institutional investors a regulated onchain entry point into real-world asset (RWA) credit markets — a segment of the tokenization industry that has expanded rapidly over the past year. 

Recent examples of private credit tokenization include Tradable's portfolio of 30 credit positions and Apollo's Diversified Credit Securitize Fund.

When asked about the potential risks of connecting DeFi to the often opaque private credit sector, Pareto acknowledged the concern but emphasized its approach to risk management.

“That's a fair concern, but Pareto was specifically built to address the inefficiencies and opacity that have historically plagued traditional credit markets,” Pandolfi said, adding:

Although synthetic dollars account for a small fraction of the total stablecoin market, they are driving innovation by introducing new methods for creating and managing fiat-pegged assets.

Ethena, the largest synthetic dollar network by market capitalization, offers Staked USDe (sUSDe) tokenholders an annual percentage yield of 10%. Roughly 368,000 investors were earning yield as of January, Cointelegraph reported.

Despite the success of synthetic variants, collateralized stablecoins continue to dominate the market — a position US regulators are keen to preserve through proposed legislation like the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act.

Under President Donald Trump, the US government has recognized the role of stablecoins as a “way to support the dollar's worldwide use as a reserve currency,” Komodo Platform's chief technology officer, Kadan Stadelmann, told Cointelegraph in a written statement.

“Stablecoins are the second-most adopted blockchain use case behind Bitcoin — more than NFTs and DeFi,” he said. “US dollar-pegged stablecoins account for a mind-boggling 1% of the M2 money supply.”

Sergey Gorbunov, CEO of Interop Labs and co-founder of Axelar Protocol, told Cointelegraph that US regulators have prioritized stablecoin legislation because they know there's more at stake than just crypto. 

“This is about setting the conditions for regulated US financial firms to lead on stablecoins and preserve the primacy of the US dollar, globally,” he said.

 Once a staunch Bitcoin critic, famed short-seller Jim Chanos now sees an arbitrage opportunity by shorting Strategy stock and buying BTC. 

Prominent short-seller Jim Chanos, once a vocal critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, revealed a new trading play that involves shorting shares of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and buying Bitcoin.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he's “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch.

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.

Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of retail speculation.”

Chanos' recent move assumes investors overpay for Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers like Strategy and other firms that follow its Bitcoin accumulation blueprint. The investor's move reflects a stance that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing Strategy's stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. 

Chanos' move suggests that holding Bitcoin through companies reflects excessive speculation and risk mispricing. It assumes that retail investors' idea of having Bitcoin indirectly through corporate wrappers can inflate the company's stock valuations. 

While shorting Strategy may seem like a good idea, investors have already lost billions shorting Saylor's company. In 2024, investors who bet against the firm lost about $3.3 billion as the stock rose. 

As of May 2025, Strategy holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, valued at around $59 billion. Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, its stock price has surged by 1,500%, outperforming the S&P 500's gains during the same period. 

In a recently released documentary from the Financial Times, Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company's Bitcoin holdings would help it become the “number one publicly traded equity in the entire market” in the future.

Chanos has not always been favorable toward Bitcoin. In a 2018 interview, Chanos described Bitcoin as a “libertarian fantasy.” 

Chanos said that having digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario wouldn't work. The investor said that if fiat currency brings the world down, the last thing he'd want to own is Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. 

He also criticized Bitcoin for enabling illicit activity, calling the crypto sector “the dark side of finance” in a 2023 interview, and accusing the industry of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.

Chanos also expressed skepticism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in crypto to profit from the fees. 

Despite those critiques, Chanos now appears to see value in holding Bitcoin directly, particularly in contrast to investing in public companies with large BTC treasuries.

Chanos is best known for his short position against the energy company Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The move generated profits for Kynikos Associates, a firm that he founded. 

A short position involves borrowing assets from a broker, selling them at the current price, and then repurchasing the assets once the value falls to give back what is owed to the broker. Short sellers profit when the asset's value declines, but face losses when the asset appreciates. 

While the investor profited from short-selling Enron, Chanos' predictions weren't always correct. Chanos was bearish on Tesla and announced a short position in 2016. Tesla stock skyrocketed by 2,200% between 2015 and 2021. 

The event caused major losses to Chanos' fund. In 2020, the fund ended with $405 million in assets under management after having over $900 million the previous year. The fund was converted into a family office, and external assets were returned to investors.

Remember VIPER, NASA's Off-Again, On-Again Lunar Rover? It's Still in Limbo

NASA's nearly complete yet canceled lunar rover VIPER isn't going to get carried to the moon by a private space exploration company—but it's also not quite dead yet

By Stephanie Pappas edited by Jeanna Bryner

NASA's VIPER, or the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, can be seen in this artist's impression.

The only consistent thing about NASA's VIPER lunar rover is that the road to the moon has been a rocky one. And now the space agency has nixed its attempt to find a commercial partner to launch VIPER moonward, leaving the nearly complete little space vehicle in a continued state of limbo.

VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Explorer Rover) was intended to launch this year to explore the lunar south pole in search of buried ice and other chemical compounds. But NASA canceled it in July 2024 after delays led to cost overruns. This is the second time NASA has nixed a lunar rover mission in recent years, says Philip Metzger, a planetary physicist at the University of Central Florida (UCF). In 2018 NASA axed the Resource Prospector rover, which would have done similar exploration.

In January NASA raised hopes that VIPER might somehow still see space when it put out a call for proposals for private aerospace companies to launch and operate the rover. On May 7, however, NASA canceled that call for proposals.

The agency says it is exploring new strategies for VIPER in the future.

“We look forward to accomplishing future volatiles science with VIPER as we continue NASA's Moon to Mars exploration efforts,” said Nicky Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, in a recent statement.

The rover's budget problems started with supply chain disruptions during the COVID pandemic, says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society. It was also slated to launch on a platform built by aerospace company Astrobotic, which failed its first landing of a scaled-down version of that platform

The mission was unusually far along when NASA pulled the plug: the rover was fully assembled and was in the final stages of testing for a launch. By that point, NASA had sunk nearly $800 million into its construction and the contract with Astrobotic.

It's not clear why NASA has been unable to find a private partner to launch the rover, but such a company would have assumed the costs of the mission and agreed to share the data freely with the space agency. That made for a tough business case for private companies, SpaceNews reported earlier this month.

The 2.5-meter-tall rover was designed to search for resources such as water ice, carbon dioxide and helium in the lunar subsurface. The goal, says Clive Neal, a lunar expert at the University of Notre Dame, is to find resources that humans could use to establish a permanent research base on the moon. The data on where such volatiles might be and whether they're accessible and extractable are crucial for the Artemis program's plans for long-term human presence on the moon.

The rover carries four instruments: a neutron spectrometer to detect water as deep as a meter below the surface, a near-infrared spectrometer to determine the makeup of samples, a mass spectrometer to analyze gases in the environment at touchdown and a drill called TRIDENT (The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrains). The drill is one of VIPER's blockbuster features, designed to pull samples from up to a meter deep.

The cancelation of VIPER, after 2018's loss of Resource Prospector, is short-sighted, given NASA's goals, Neal says. “Is NASA actually serious about getting humans back to the moon?” he says. “Are they actually serious about enacting our current space policy? Have they actually read it?”

VIPER could also answer basic science questions about the origin of the water on the moon, says UCF's Metzger. It may have been part of the lunar core from the moment of its formation, or the water could have arrived with planetary dust or large impactors over time, among other possibilities. “Understanding those processes is crucial for understanding our solar system,” Metzger says. The answers could reveal more about how common water-rich bodies are in the galaxy and how many planets or moons might host life.

That's the big question. Until NASA releases more details on potential future partnership structures, the project remains in a state of suspended animation.

“I don't know what to make of it because there is so little information,” Dreier says.

It's possible NASA could reopen negotiations with Astrobotic, the company that was originally going to launch the rover, Neal says. Or, Metzger suggests, the agency might be seeking international partners that could take on some of the operational costs.

There are no other U.S. missions on the horizon with the drilling capabilities of VIPER. If the rover doesn't find a way to the moon, Neal says, two other lunar explorers from China could pick up the banner of volatiles science: Chang'e 7 and 8.

As uncertain as things are looking for VIPER, though, it's an optimistic sign that NASA hasn't dropped the rover outright, Dreier says, given that the White House has proposed a 50 percent cut to NASA's science programs and a more than 20 percent cut to the agency overall in 2026. “If it's not openly identified as being canceled,” Dreier says, “you are winning as a NASA science mission right now.”

This Strange Mutation Explains the Mystifying Color of Orange Cats

Your orange cat may host a never-before-seen genetic pathway for color pigmentation, according to new studies

By Gayoung Lee edited by Lauren J. Young

Cats are arguably perfect. At least, evidence suggests that felines, which have evolved with minimal variation and maximal efficiency, have reached the “perfect” genetic form.

“Everything you need to know about genetics, you can learn from your cat,” says Leslie Lyons, a veterinary scientist specializing in cat genetics at the University of Missouri. Studying cats' coat colors, for instance, has informed various aspects of modern genetics, she says. But one cat fur hue has stumped scientists for decades: orange. In house cats, orangeness appears to be sex-linked; it almost always occurs in males because of a mutation on the sex-determining X chromosome. Scientists have long been unable to pinpoint any specific gene responsible for pumpkin-colored cats, however.

Now two papers, published concurrently on Thursday in Current Biology, reveal a remarkably unique genetic pathway that has never been seen in other felines—or any other mammals. With their colleagues, two separate groups at Stanford University and Kyushu University in Japan independently arrived at the same surprising conclusion: a tiny deletion in a cat's X chromosome increased the activity of a gene called Arhgap36, which scientists had never previously associated with pigmentation. In this case, it appeared to be coaxing the cat's melanin-producing cells to shift orange.

These findings close decades' worth of investigations surrounding house cats with a ginger hue—a coat coloration that had “been recognized for more than a century [as] kind of an exception to the genetic rules that explain coloration in most mammals,” says Christopher Kaelin, a geneticist and lead author of the Stanford study.

That's partly because what seemed to be causing orange fur in cats wasn't so much an “orange gene” as it was an “orange mutation” in an unknown gene, Kaelin says. The term mutation refers to changes to the original DNA, notes geneticist Greg Barsh, senior author of the Stanford study. “So how do you know that a visible trait [like orange fur] is caused by a change in DNA sequence?” Barsh adds. “The answer is pretty simple: you see it inherited from parent to child.”

The marked abundance of male orange cats had long led scientists to suspect the trait is sex-linked—more specifically, tied to a variation in the X chromosome. British geneticist Mary Lyon confirmed this theory in 1961 through the discovery of X-inactivation, wherein female mammals' cells randomly switch off one of the two X chromosomes they inherited from their parents. For most mammals, including humans and cats, this helps prevent genetic complications that might arise from having an additional X chromosome.

Male kittens, also like most other male mammals, have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Male cats with orange-colored parents only get one copy of the orange mutation and thus end up with entirely orange fur. Female cats, however, have two X chromosomes. If one of these happens to have the orange mutation, the process of X-inactivation will produce orange, brown or black patches depending on which X chromosome—orange or nonorange—is activated in that part of their skin. This will give the kitten an overall coat pattern that is either mottled orange and black (tortoiseshell) or a patchwork of orange, black and white (calico).

Over the years, scientists had incrementally closed in on the key mutation's general location on the cat genome. “The candidate region had more than 10 genes, none of which was known for pigment regulation,” says Hiroyuki Sasaki, a geneticist and senior author of the Kyushu University study. Sasaki and his team decided to sequence the whole genomes of cats with different coat colors to single out any variations on the X chromosome. Similarly, the Stanford team collected a variety of data from a wide assortment of cats, directly comparing the DNA sequences of orange and nonorange ones.

Both teams identified the small mutation, which was not in the Arhgap36 gene “but close to it,” Kaelin explains. That meant that the mutation didn't disrupt the gene's expression in the cat's genome but that it was close enough to affect the gene's activity, specifically in cells that produce melanin. “That's a very unusual kind of mutation,” Barsh says.

“The [mutation's] pathway is interesting because it adds to the knowledge about this gene and how it functions,” says Lyons, who was thanked for contributing to cat genomic resources in the Stanford paper but wasn't involved in either study. “This tells us that health is a complex interaction of genes and occurrences during the developmental process.”

Orange and tortoiseshell cats' tendency toward amusing, friendly and sometimes mischievous behavior is a running joke among cat owners, but there's no scientific evidence linking coat colors and behavioral differences, Barsh says. Researchers aren't yet sure if the mutation could play a role in this—it's a question they'd like to ask next, however. “Because Arhgap36 is expressed not only in pigment cells but also in the brain and hormonal glands, an interesting possibility is that its altered expression causes changes in neuronal activity and even behavior,” Sasaki suggests.

“We think that there is no advantage—or really, disadvantage—to having an orange mutation in a cat,” Barsh says. “It's just something that happened [because] they're attractive; people like them, and so people saved it.”

Friend or Food: Why Are Iceland's Orcas Taking in Pilot Whales?

Newborn pilot whales have been spotted mysteriously swimming among pods of orcas. Scientists are trying to puzzle out how the pilot whale calves got there and what happened to them

By Marina Wang edited by Andrea Thompson

A neonate long-finned pilot whale surfaces in echelon position next to a killer whale (adult female IS069) on June 20, 2023.

“Interactions between Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) and Neonate Long-Finned Pilot Whales (Globicephala melas) off South Iceland,” by Chérine D. Baumgartner et al., in Ecology and Evolution, Vol. 16, No. 4, Article No. e71193; April 2025 (CC BY 4.0)

One day in June 2022 Chérine Baumgartner, a researcher at the Icelandic Orca Project, was watching from a dinghy as a pod of killer whales fed on herring—when she noticed something very odd about what seemed to be a young member of the pod. “At first, we were like, ‘Oh my god, this killer whale calf has a problem,'” she says. It was far tinier than normal and lacked an infant orca's characteristic black-and-pale-orange coloration. Baumgartner, now a Ph.D. student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, suddenly realized she was seeing an entirely different species: a baby pilot whale. She and her team observed the pod for nearly three hours before weather conditions forced them back to land. They found the pod the next day, but the pilot whale calf was nowhere to be seen.

Scientists noticed orcas interacting with baby pilot whales off Iceland every year from 2021 to 2023. Each instance was short-lived and featured different individual pilot whales (dark-gray members of the dolphin family with a bulbous forehead) and different pods of orcas. Now, in a new study in Ecology and Evolution, Baumgartner and her colleagues describe the 2022 and 2023 incidents and posit three potential explanations: predation, play or parenting.

In all the sightings, a weeks-old pilot whale swam by a female killer whale in what scientists call an echelon position, with the young whale located beside and slightly behind the adult orca. In the 2022 and 2023 instances, the killer whales occasionally nudged the calf along. In 2023 a calf was seen swimming ahead of the group, possibly as if to run away—and at one point it was lifted, belly-up, out of the water on the back of an orca.

With the first possible explanation, the killer whales could have been keeping the young pilot whales around like a living lunch box; some orcas in Iceland are known to eat harbor seals and porpoises. But Baumgartner notes that these Icelandic killer whales are predominantly fish eaters and that they didn't display overtly aggressive behavior toward the pilot whale calves. So predation is less likely, though not impossible, she and her colleagues say.

Alternatively, the killer whales could have been playing with the young whales or using them to practice hunting. Iceland's orcas often herd herring, and they could have been incorporating the pilot whale calves in their hunting games.

Finally, the killer whales could have been extending their parental instincts to the young calves. Whales and dolphins in the wild often care for the young of other members of their pod, and although it's rare, dolphins have adopted calves from different species. In the pilot whales' case, Baumgartner says, she wouldn't categorize the relationship as adoption because the interactions seemed to be short-lived. The young pilot whales would likely have died without milk, and none of the female orcas were lactating at the time.

These three possibilities also aren't mutually exclusive, she says. “It could be [that the orcas] encountered the pilot whale opportunistically, and some individuals played with the whale, and others tried to nurture it,” Baumgartner adds.

The other conspicuously missing pieces of the puzzle are how, in each instance, the orcas came across a pilot whale calf in the first place and what happened to that calf afterward. “Was it lost or abandoned?” asks study co-author Filipa Samarra, principal investigator at the Icelandic Orca Project and director of the University of Iceland's research center on the Westman Islands. “Or did the killer whales actively approach to take the calf away?” The researchers also wonder if the calves escaped or died or were killed or eaten by the orcas.

Sarah Teman, a graduate student in ecology at the University of Washington, who was not involved with the new study, says her jaw dropped when she saw pictures of the pilot whales with the orca pods. Teman previously studied southern resident killer whales interacting with porpoises in the Salish Sea off British Columbia and Washington State. In that research, she observed interactions that may have been motivated by nurturing, hunting practice or “play”—and often ended up killing the porpoises. “It was fascinating to see such similar behaviors” in the Icelandic orcas, she says, adding that the animals' interactions with the pilot whales seemed to be largely driven by nurturing or play behavior, just as had been seen in the southern resident killer whales' interactions with porpoises.

Samarra also speculates that the unusual interactions off Iceland could be a result of climate change because pilot whales increasingly follow schools of mackerel moving into warmer waters that overlap with the killer whales' range. She hopes that, next summer, her group will finally observe how the young pilot whales get entangled with the orcas and what happens to them next.

Hobby metal detectorists strike again! 

Metal detectors work by transmitting an electromagnetic field from the search coin (that round part that detectorists sweep back and forth) into the ground. If a metal object falls within the pulse, it becomes energized and returns its own electromagnetic field to the machine, alerting the user. The detector can be set off by discarded bottle caps, modern coins, or even chunks of lead in the ground, but sometimes the treasure proves to be more exciting. 

The machines prove so effective that researchers often include metal detector surveys in their archaeological studies. Even amateur detectorists have found incredible artifacts with their machines. Just recently, one found a golden raven head and another found a hoard of Iron Age artifacts. And that list of big discoveries is still growing, as one metal detectorist scanning a field unearthed nearly 1,500 Romanian coins. 

The man who discovered the hoard, Bebe Mangeac, went out for a typical day with his trusty metal detector—a model he described to What's The Jam as “average and neither cheap nor top end.” He explained that he goes out for the exercise, never knowing what he's going to find. The area he picked for this particular hunt was in Letca Veche, a hilly area with soft soil and little vegetation southwest of Bucharest, Romania.  

Mangeac began scouting the area, and his machine soon picked up a signal not far beneath the surface. Mangeac gently dug into the topsoil—that's when he saw them: the first silver coins. They appeared oxidized yet still well defined. 

“My hands were shaking,” Mangeac said. “The coins kept coming out. I didn't want to leave any behind. When you realise you've made a hard-earned discovery, part of you wants to celebrate. The other, more instinctive part tells you to hurry up. Every minute of light was important, especially since the size of the monetary treasure was enormous.”

As he kept digging, Mangeac hit ceramic. Well, more like ceramic shards of what once was a storage vessel, likely an amphora or a dolium. The broken vessel could indicate that the owner of the hoard smashed it intentionally in a protective ritual before burying it. He continued to carefully unearth the collection—and the coins just kept coming. Once he was finished at the site, Mangeac uncovered 1,469 silver coins along with the ceramic pieces. 

“I didn't count them all there and then, but it felt like there were a lot,” he remarked. “I mean, a lot.”

The coins are believed to be Denarius coins (Roman coins) buried around 1,700 years ago. Some depict Emperor Trajan and others elephant iconography. The coins appear to be from several different periods, likely a result of accumulating the collection over time. 

The real time crunch began when Mangeac got home with the hoard. In Romania, citizens have 72 hours to hand artifacts of historical significance over to the authorities. Mangeac notified the police and they took note of where he found the treasure. The site will later be deemed an archeological site and subjected to further research. 

The hoard, originally discovered in mid April, is currently held by the County Directorate for Culture. The collection will eventually be put on display at the Teohari Antonescu County Museum in Giurgiu. Though the worth has yet to be calculated, Mangeac is entitled to a hefty 45% of the value if the haul is classified as treasure. 

Perhaps Mangeac is the perfect example of why metal detecting should be the next hobby you pick up—and maybe you and your “average” machine will make the next monumental archeological discovery in your area.

Nature wants to know what PhD students love about their experiences — and what could be improved.Credit: Christopher Kimmel/Getty

Nature has launched its seventh global survey of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) doctoral students. Tell us why you decided to pursue a PhD or other doctorate, what you love about your supervisor and how they or your programme could do better — anonymously, of course.

Created in partnership with London-based consultancy Thinks Insight & Strategy, the survey will probe graduate students' views about their goals and challenges, and their experiences of their studies so far. Enter for a chance to win £250 or the equivalent in your local currency.

Widespread reductions in research funding, immigration crackdowns and rapid technological developments in artificial intelligence (AI) tools for academic use make this a crucial time to take the temperature of doctoral students around the globe, says senior Nature Careers editor Kendall Powell. 

“Federal funding cuts to education and research are already having profound effects on graduate and research programmes inside the United States — and elsewhere,” she says. “We hope this survey will show how the turmoil is affecting PhD students' attitudes and choices worldwide.”

As in previous years, survey-takers will be asked to rate key aspects of their PhD, such as mentorship, work–life balance, mental-health support and salary levels, as well as their feelings about their career outlook. New questions probe how supervisors can best support their students and the challenges and opportunities that come with studying outside your home country.

Metrics details

Intracellular delivery of biomacromolecules is hampered by low efficiency and cytotoxicity. Here we report the development of elastin-based nanoparticles for therapeutic delivery (ENTER), a recombinant elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based delivery system for effective cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules in vitro and in vivo. Through iterative design, we developed fourth-generation ELPs fused to cationic endosomal escape peptides (EEPs) that self-assemble into pH-responsive micellar nanoparticles and enable cytosolic entry of cargo following endocytic uptake. In silico screening of α-helical peptide libraries led to the discovery of an EEP (EEP13) with 48% improved protein delivery efficiency versus a benchmark peptide. Our lead ELP–EEP13 showed similar or superior performance compared to lipid-based transfection reagents in the delivery of mRNA-encoded, DNA-encoded and protein-form Cre recombinase and CRISPR gene editors as well as short interfering RNAs to multiple cell lines and primary cell types. Intranasal administration of ELP–EEP13 combined with Cre protein achieved efficient editing of lung epithelial cells in reporter mice.

Metrics details

Viromics produces millions of viral genomes and fragments annually, overwhelming traditional sequence comparison methods. Here we introduce Vclust, an approach that determines average nucleotide identity by Lempel–Ziv parsing and clusters viral genomes with thresholds endorsed by authoritative viral genomics and taxonomy consortia. Vclust demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing tools, clustering millions of genomes in a few hours on a mid-range workstation.

Metagenomics and viromics are identifying new viruses at an unprecedented rate, but recognizing which sequences were seen before remains challenging1,2. Calculating average nucleotide identity (ANI), essential for classification, is limited by the scalability of alignment tools like anicalc3, commonly used to cluster viruses into virus operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), or VIRIDIC4, recommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to delineate bacteriophage species and genera. Large-scale sequence comparisons rely on efficient, albeit less accurate, k-mer approaches such as sketching (FastANI5) or sparse approximate alignments (skani6). Moreover, most tools lack clustering functionality or do not scale to large metagenomic datasets (Extended Data Table 1).

Vclust is a fast alignment-based method that calculates ANI measures for complete and fragmented viral genomes and clusters them according to ICTV and Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG) standards1,4 (Extended Data Table 1). It introduces three components (Fig. 1a). First, Kmer-db 2, a successor of Kmer-db7, rapidly determines related genomes using either all k-mers or a predefined fraction. Second, LZ-ANI, a Lempel–Ziv parsing-based algorithm (Fig. 1b and Methods), identifies local alignments within related genome pairs and calculates overall ANI from these aligned regions with high sensitivity and accuracy. Third, Clusty efficiently implements six clustering algorithms suited for sparse distance matrices with millions of genomes (Fig. 1c).

a, Vclust's workflow: (1) prefilter similar genome sequence pairs with sufficient k-mer-based identity estimated using Kmer-db 2; (2) align similar genome pairs and calculate ANI using LZ-ANI; and (3) cluster genomes based on defined cutoffs using Clusty. b, Sequence alignment using Lempel–Ziv parsing (Methods). c, Vclust's clustering algorithms. Vertex size represents genome sequence length, and edge lengths indicate the distance (1 − ANI) between genomes. A more detailed depiction of the clustering algorithms is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. d, Illustration of the calculation of Vclust's sequence similarity measures.

We first tested Vclust's accuracy of total average nucleotide identity (tANI) estimation (Fig. 1d) among 10,000 pairs of phage genomes containing simulated mutations, including substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications and translocations (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). Vclust and VIRIDIC, both alignment-based tools, provided tANI values close to the expected ones, with mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively, outperforming FastANI (6.8%) and skani (21.2%; Fig. 2a). Vclust predictions consistently approached expected values as tANI increased, while VIRIDIC underestimated tANI (Fig. 2a). Among genome pairs above the ICTV's species threshold (tANI ≥ 95%4, n = 1,188), Vclust reported only 22 pairs below the threshold, whereas VIRIDIC underestimated nearly 10× more (n = 210; Supplementary Table 2).

Vclust and VIRIDIC include clustering, while FastANI and skani only calculate ANI. d, Venn diagrams comparing numbers of contig pairs meeting MIUViG thresholds (ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85%) predicted by BLASTn (purple) and other tools (red). The boxen plot shows the error distribution of predicted ANI and AF values relative to corresponding BLASTn-based reference values for 4,361,743 contig pairs meeting MiUVUG thresholds. The center line denotes the median, while each box level from the median contains half of the remaining observations. e, Wall time and peak memory usage for calculating ANI and AF among 15,677,623 IMG/VR contigs (64 threads). BLASTn values were estimated from a random sample of 1,000 query contigs. Vclust was tested in its default setting and with a 0.2 fraction of k-mers used at the ‘prefilter' step. f, Wall time and peak memory usage of Vclust's clustering algorithms for grouping IMG/VR contigs into vOTUs.

Next, we determined tANI using VIRIDIC in an all-to-all comparison of 4,244 bacteriophage genomes. Vclust had a higher correlation with VIRIDIC tANI (Pearson's r = 0.983) than skani (r = 0.902) and FastANI (r = 0.671) across the entire tANI range ≥ 70% (22,606 genome pairs; Fig. 2b) and outperformed both tools within their reliability range ≥ 80%5,6.

Then, we compared the consistency of the bacteriophage species groupings (tANI ≥ 95%) with the official ICTV taxonomy (Methods). Vclust and VIRIDIC showed moderate agreement with ICTV (73% and 69%, respectively), followed by FastANI (40%) and skani (27%). Upon examining genome pairs where both Vclust and VIRIDIC diverged from the ICTV's classification, we found inconsistencies in 50 ICTV taxonomic proposals (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Excluding these cases improved the agreement of both tools with ICTV taxonomy, with Vclust retaining superiority (95%) over VIRIDIC (90%) and the other tools (Supplementary Table 5). For genus groupings (tANI ≥ 70%), Vclust achieves 92% agreement with ICTV taxonomy, comparable to VIRIDIC's 93%, despite inconsistent application of the threshold we found across ICTV genera (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Given Vclust's high agreement with ICTV taxonomy, accurate tANI determination and processing speed >40,000× faster than VIRIDIC (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 8), it emerges as the prime tool for bacteriophage classification.

We then assessed Vclust's accuracy in matching contig pairs that satisfy MIUViG thresholds (ANI ≥ 95% and aligned fraction (AF) ≥ 85%; Fig. 1d). We subsampled over 90,000 metagenomic contigs from the IMG/VR database and used BLASTn8+ anicalc3 (most accurate alignment-based method) to identify over 4 million sequence pairs that met MIUViG thresholds. Vclust recovered the highest number of pairs (99%), followed by MegaBLAST + anicalc (97%), skani (96%, or 86% in the fastest mode), FastANI (96%) and MMseqs2 (ref. 9) (70%; Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 9). Both Vclust and MegaBLAST produced ANI and AF estimates consistently with the BLASTn values (Pearson r > 0.96), outperforming the other tools (r = 0.2–0.8). On average, ANI and AF values obtained by Vclust and MegaBLAST showed minimal deviation from the expected values (MAE < 1%; Supplementary Table 9), with Vclust having the narrowest error range among all the tools (Fig. 2d). This trend is consistent across varying contig sizes, from smallest (<5 kb) to largest (>100 kb; Supplementary Table 10).

The scalability of the tools was tested using the entire IMG/VR database of 15,677,623 virus contigs. Vclust performed sequence identity estimations for ~123 trillion contig pairs and alignments for ~800 million pairs, resulting in 5–8 million vOTUs depending on the clustering algorithm (Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These vOTUs are generally consistent with those identified by MegaBLAST, with Vclust clustering approximately 75,000 more contigs on average, indicating higher sensitivity (Supplementary Table 11). Vclust was >115× faster than MegaBLAST, >6× faster than skani or FastANI, and ~1.5× faster than MMseqs2 (Fig. 2e,f, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 12). Although skani in its fastest mode was 7× faster than Vclust (Supplementary Table 12), it was substantially less accurate (Supplementary Table 9). In addition, Vclust's runtime and memory usage can be further reduced by ~40% and ~60%, respectively, by analyzing 20% of the k-mers in each genome during prefiltering (Fig. 2e), with negligible impact on sensitivity and specificity (Extended Data Fig. 4).

In conclusion, Vclust surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods in viral genome comparison in both accuracy and speed, remaining effective in datasets of millions of sequences. It provides a complete solution for calculating intergenomic similarities and clustering complete, partial and circularly permuted (Extended Data Fig. 5) virus genomes using various ANI measures and clustering algorithms. Given the astonishing diversity of viruses in metagenomic data, we believe that Vclust will be essential for large-scale dereplication and taxonomic classification of viral sequences. It is freely available on GitHub, with a web service option for smaller projects (https://www.vclust.org/), and its core components—Kmer-db, LZ-ANI and Clusty—are available as stand-alone tools for broader applications in sequence comparison and general clustering tasks. Similar to other tools6, Vclust's performance may decrease with large datasets of highly similar genomes owing to the high number of sequence pairs requiring alignment and clustering after prefiltering (Methods). Future work will focus on improving scalability for large homogeneous datasets, including bacterial genomes, and implementing amino acid-based computations (for example, average amino acid identity).

Vclust is a workflow that introduces and integrates three tools:

Kmer-db 2: performs the initial k-mer-based estimation of sequence identity of all genome pairs (‘Sequence identity estimation: Kmer-db 2').

LZ-ANI: aligns sequence pairs with nucleotide identity exceeding a specified threshold and calculates ANI and AF measures (‘Sequence alignment: LZ-ANI' and ‘Calculating ANI and AF').

Clusty: clusters sequences based on ANI and/or AF criteria (‘Clustering sequences: Clusty').

We implemented Kmer-db 2, LZ-ANI and Clusty in C++20 as stand-alone tools, adaptable for various sequence comparison and clustering tasks (‘Code availability'). Vclust, a Python script, integrates these tools to calculate and cluster viral genomic sequences (‘Vclust implementation').

Kmer-db 2 is an updated tool for k-mer-based estimation of pairwise similarities among nucleotide sequences, using either all or a selected fraction of k-mers. Unlike fixed-sized sketching (used, for example, by Mash10), Kmer-db 2 retains a proportional fraction of k-mers per genome, preserving the relationship between sequence lengths.

Kmer-db 2 introduces several improvements enabling the processing of tens of millions of sequences. First, unlike its predecessor, which stored similarity values in RAM as a dense matrix7, Kmer-db 2 uses sparse matrices that retain only nonzero elements in all-to-all pairwise genome comparison mode (‘all2all-sp'), allowing it to handle large and diverse genome sets. Second, Kmer-db 2 supports genome datasets partitioned into multiple input files, each generating a separate Kmer-db database. A new mode, ‘all2all-parts', calculates shared k-mers within and across databases, optimizing memory by loading one or two databases into RAM sequentially, although at the expense of additional computational time from repeated database loading. Third, Kmer-db 2 further minimizes RAM usage by storing only genome pairs that meet a minimum threshold of shared k-mers and sequence identity. Finally, all modes in Kmer-db 2 support multithreading, except for the distance calculation step, which is sufficiently fast without parallelization. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the computational performance improvements of Kmer-db 2 over Kmer-db 1, with runtime reductions of 3× to 100× across modes and substantially lower RAM requirements.

The LZ-ANI algorithm uses Lempel–Ziv parsing11 to align two sequences (the query and the reference).

First, the algorithm constructs two indices (dictionaries): for anchors and seeds. The anchor index maps all a-mers (substrings of length a) from both strands of the reference sequence to their positions, while the seed index performs the same mapping for shorter s-mers (Fig. 1b, step 1).

Next, the query is read from left to right using a sliding window of a nucleotides, moving one nucleotide at a time. The parsed a-mers are used to search the anchor index for matches in the reference. Upon finding an exact match, the algorithm extends it in both directions (Fig. 1b, step 2). In each direction, a window of size aw slides until it encounters more than a certain number of mismatches (am) at a time. Then, the extensions of terminal windows are trimmed to remove poorly aligned ends until they have at least ar exactly matched nucleotides. This extended anchor initiates the first ‘region', which corresponds to a local alignment, and is constructed as described below.

The algorithm then moves to the next nucleotide after the extended anchor and looks for a-mers (anywhere in the reference) and s-mers (within r nucleotides from the end of the extended match in the reference) in the dictionaries. Four scenarios may arise:

No anchor or seed is found: shift by one position in the query and repeat the process of finding a new anchor or a seed match. However, if the distance in the query between the current position and the end of the previous match exceeds q nucleotides, the seed search is discontinued.

Only a seed match is found: extend the seed similarly to the initial anchor match, append it to the region, and continue the search for a new anchor or seed match (Fig. 1b, step 3).

Only an anchor match is found: close the current region and extend the anchor match to initiate a new region (Fig. 1b, step 5).

Both anchor and seed matches are found: select the match less likely to occur by chance, based on their lengths, seed proximity (r nucleotides) and the reference sequence length, leading to either scenario 2 or 3 (Fig. 1b, step 4).

Upon closing a region, the algorithm realigns the nucleotide stretches between all the extended matches within the region (Fig. 1b, step 6). This realignment aims to maximize the number of matching nucleotides between neighboring extended matches by allowing a single multi-symbol insertion in the reference or query sequence. As a result, the region represents a local alignment containing both matched and mismatched nucleotides, along with approximated indel fragments. To remove spurious alignments, regions shorter than g nucleotides are excluded from further analysis.

The LZ-ANI tool reads input sequences and stores them in RAM in a compact format with three nucleotides per byte. The tool processes sequences in parallel, with each thread comparing a reference sequence to all other sequences. By default, the tool performs all-versus-all pairwise alignments, but it can also accept a filter specifying sequence pairs to align, such as a file generated by Kmer-db (used by Vclust by default).

LZ-ANI parameters are adjustable and were optimized for virus genome sequences (Extended Data Table 2). The default anchor length was set to 11 nucleotides, matching the BLASTn default word size, which provides greater sensitivity than MegaBLAST's 28-nucleotide word size. The remaining LZ-ANI parameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process minimization. This optimization involved 100 evaluations on a dataset of 10,000 pairs of complete genomes with simulated mutations (that is, substitutions, insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations) and known expected ANI values of ≥70% (Supplementary Table 13). The default Vclust parameters were selected based on the lowest MAE between the predicted and reference tANI values. Supplementary Fig. 3 compares the length, number and identity of alignments generated by Vclust (using default parameters), BLASTn and MegaBLAST.

Similarly to BLAST-based ANI methods3,4, LZ-ANI alignment between query (A) and reference (B) encompasses ‘regions', analogous to BLAST's high-scoring segment pairs. This alignment allows direct calculation of:

L(A, B)—the total length (sum) of all regions when aligning query A to reference B, in nucleotides

M(A, B)—the total number of matching nucleotides in all regions

These values are used to compute seven sequence similarity measures as follows:

ANI for A and B: \(\frac{M(A,\,B)}{L(A,\,B)}\)

ANI for B and A: \(\frac{M(B,\,A)}{L(B,\,A)}\)

AF of query A to reference B: \(\frac{L(A,\,B)}{{|A|}}\)

AF of query B to reference A: \(\frac{L(B,\,A)}{{|B|}}\)

Global ANI for A and B: \(\frac{M(A,\,B)}{{|A|}}\)

Global ANI for B and A: \(\frac{M(B,\,A)}{{|B|}}\)

Total ANI: \(\frac{M(A,\,B)+M(B,\,A)}{{|A|}+{|B|}}.\)

Clusty is a versatile package facilitating rapid clustering across diverse data types, using six algorithms: single linkage, complete linkage, UCLUST12, greedy set cover9, CD-HIT13 and Leiden14. Our implementations of these algorithms were optimized for sparse distance matrices. A linear memory complexity with the number of distances allows the clustering of tens of millions of objects, provided the matrix remains sufficiently sparse.

Clusty uses threshold-based clustering, assigning an object to a cluster if its distance from the cluster does not exceed a user-defined threshold. Depending on the algorithm, this distance can refer to the closest, furthest or centroid member. While UCLUST, greedy set cover and CD-HIT are inherently threshold-based algorithms, single and complete linkage algorithms construct dendrograms that can be pruned at customizable distance thresholds. Clusty's sparse data representation assumes all input values to meet the distance or similarity threshold. However, the tool allows clustering data at more stringent thresholds through additional filtering of any combinations of distance/similarity values (for example, tANI, ANI and AF) and/or other measure values (for example, minimum/maximum number of alignments, minimum/maximum number of matched nucleotides). Consequently, the matrix provided to Clusty does not need to be sparse; the tool can handle dense matrices and apply filtering at the loading stage.

Clusty interprets input data as a graph, where vertices represent objects and edges represent connections. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows details of the clustering algorithms and their time complexities.

Vclust is a Python tool integrating Kmer-db 2, LZ-ANI and Clusty for streamlined computation of intergenomic sequence similarities and clustering of viral genomes. Vclust provides three commands: ‘prefilter', ‘align' and ‘cluster' (Fig. 1a). ‘prefilter' and ‘align' accept a single FASTA file containing viral genomic sequences or a directory of FASTA files (one genome per file), with support for gzipped inputs and outputs.

The ‘prefilter' command uses Kmer-db 2 to screen out dissimilar genome pairs before alignment, reducing the number of genome pairs to only those with sufficient k-mer-based sequence similarity (that is, minimum number of common k-mers and/or the minimum sequence identity. Sequence identity in Kmer-db 2 is calculated similarly to ANI in Mash (1 − Mash distance) but uses the overlap coefficient15 instead of the Jaccard index. The overlap coefficient measures the intersection size of two k-mer sets (representing two genomic sequences) relative to the smaller set size, rather than the union of both sets. As a result, sequence identity values in the prefiltering step are generally higher than ANI from the alignment step. This allows users to set the minimum sequence identity in prefiltering close to the final ANI threshold without risking the exclusion of relevant genome pairs; for example, if targeting an ANI threshold of 95% or higher, the minimum sequence identity can be set to approximately 0.95 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The ‘align' command uses LZ-ANI to perform pairwise sequence alignments and compute ANI and AF measures between genome pairs identified by the pre-alignment filter. If the filter is not provided, Vclust aligns all possible genome pairs. The output includes two TSV files that are used for clustering: one containing ANI measures for genome pairs and the other listing genome identifiers sorted by decreasing sequence length. Optionally, Vclust can output detailed alignment results in a TSV format similar to BLASTn/MegaBLAST, with coordinates, strand orientation, matched/mismatched nucleotides and sequence identity for each local alignment.

The ‘cluster' command uses Clusty for genome clustering, allowing users to specify a similarity measure (for example, tANI, ANI) and its threshold for clustering genomes, with optional additional filtering thresholds for other similarity measures, including AF. Output includes a TSV file listing genome identifiers and numerical cluster identifiers (including identifiers for singleton genomes). Alternatively, Vclust can output representative genomes instead of numerical cluster identifiers, which is particularly useful for dereplication tasks.

Vclust is designed for dereplication and clustering of viral sequences across a range of identity values. Computational performance may decline with datasets of highly redundant genome sequences (for example, tens of thousands of sequences from the same species; Supplementary Fig. 5). In all-versus-all pairwise genome comparisons in the ‘prefilter' step, the high frequency of similar sequences expands the similarity matrix, increasing memory consumption and the number of pairs to align, which in turn raises computational demands for alignment and clustering. Vclust has three additional techniques to optimize performance and mitigate excessive resource consumption. First, it partitions a dataset into smaller, equally sized batches of genome sequences using the built-in multi-fasta-split C++ tool. This option considerably reduces memory requirements of the ‘prefilter' step without altering results, although it may slightly increase runtime (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Second, Vclust can limit the number of k-mers analyzed from each genome sequence, reducing memory usage and runtime with minimal impact on sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Third, similarly to MMseqs2 and BLAST-based methods, Vclust's ‘prefilter' can restrict the number of sequences reported per query genome by selecting those with the highest sequence identity, reducing the overall number of genome pairs passing initial similarity assessment.

All runtimes were benchmarked on a workstation equipped with an AMD Epyc 9554 CPU (64 cores clocked at 3.1 GHz) and 1,152 GiB (approximately 1,237 GB) RAM. Unless otherwise specified, all tools were run using 64 threads. The exact commands are shown in Supplementary Tables 8, 9 and 12.

The tANI accuracy of Vclust v1.2.8, FastANI (v1.33)5, skani (v0.2.1)6 and VIRIDIC (v1.1)4 was assessed using two reference sets. In both reference datasets, VIRIDIC was run with default parameters (--word_size 7, --reward 2, --penalty 3, --gapopen 5, --gapextend 2) for highly sensitive BLASTn alignments. Similarly, skani was run in its most accurate mode optimized for small sequences (--slow, --s 0, --m 200). FastANI and Vclust were run with default parameters. The first reference dataset comprised 22,606 tANI values ranging from 70% to 100%, as determined by VIRIDIC across 4,244 complete genomes of bacteriophages affiliated with the ICTV using ICTV's Virus Metadata Resource (VMR v38.3). Since FastANI and skani do not directly report tANI, their values were calculated from ANI, AF and genome lengths: tANI = (ANI1 × AF1 × LEN1 + ANI2 × AF2 × LEN2)/(LEN1 + LEN2). The second reference set contained expected (true) tANI values in the 70–100% range, derived from 10,000 pairs of bacteriophage genomes subjected to simulated mutations, including different levels of substitution, insertion, deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation events. Specifically, we randomly selected 100 genomes from the bacteriophage dataset and generated 100 copies of each genome. For each genome copy, we introduced mutations using Mutation-Simulator (v3.0.2)16 by randomly selecting a combination of mutation events and their corresponding frequencies (Supplementary Table 1). The expected (true) tANI value between each copy and reference genome was determined based on the variant call format produced by Mutation-Simulator, describing the exact locations of introduced mutations and the number of altered nucleotides.

The ANI and AF values predicted by Vclust, FastANI, skani, MegBLAST v2.13.0+ and MMseqs2 v2fad714b525f1975b62c2d2b5aff28274ad57466 (ref. 9) were compared to reference ANI and AF values determined by BLASTn (v2.13.0+)8. Since running BLASTn on the entire IMG/VR v4.1 database was not feasible, we subsampled 94,225 viral contigs and performed an all-to-all BLASTn search to identify 4,361,743 contig pairs meeting the MIUViG thresholds (ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85%). MegaBLAST, MMseqs and BLASTn outputs were used by the anicalc script from CheckV (v1.0.3)3 to compute ANI and AF values. Pearson correlation and MAE between the predicted and expected ANI and AF values were calculated based on the 4,361,743 contig pairs meeting MIUViG thresholds (ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85%) determined by BLASTn. Given the high level of sequence identity of the reference contig pairs, if a tool did not return a result for a given contig pair, the ANI and AF values were set to zero for that pair.

The agreement between clustering results from different tools and the reference clustering was assessed using the adjusted Rand index (ARI). ARI assesses clustering similarity by comparing the number of correct clustering overlaps and disagreements17 against those expected by chance. An ARI of 0 indicates random assignment, while a score of 1 indicates a perfect match. We used the scikit-learn (v1.3.2)18 implementation of the ARI.

The dataset is represented as a graph: objects (genomes) are shown as vertices with sizes proportional to user-assigned weights (for example, sequence length) and edges indicate distances (for example, 1 – tANI). In the consecutive steps of each algorithm objects are assigned to clusters marked with distinct colors. The left panel shows each algorithm's time complexity, with n as the number of vertices and e as the number of edges. Distance values for this example are available in the source data provided with the paper.

Source data

The subtree of Bastillevirinae branch from the maximum-likelihood tree based on a concatenated alignment of 10 marker proteins in Herelleviridae family. Leaves are labeled with species names and four species are represented by more than one genome (for example, multiple strains). Snippets of the total heatmap on the right highlight instances where Vclust clustering algorithms and/or ICTV disagree. Numbers in these boxes show tANI (only values higher than 60% - Vclust reliability threshold are shown). Despite recommended rank-demarcation criteria, the classification of viruses is based on multiple forms of evidence, ranging from calculating tANI between pairs to protein content and phylogenetic analyses. Therefore, inconsistencies between Vclust clustering and the official ICTV taxonomy may arise, especially if the tANI oscillates around the demarcation criterion, such as between Bastillevirus hoodyT and Bastillevirus evoli, where the tANI is 95.2%.

The dataset was sampled from IMG/VR v4.1, and the execution commands for the tools are detailed in Supplementary Table 12. Vclust was tested with all k-mers (default) and 0.2 fraction of k-mers retained at the prefilter step. The left panel shows execution times. The runtimes of all tools decrease linearly with up to eight threads, but beyond this, FastANI, MegaBLAST, and Vclust showed reduced speed-up while skani and MMseqs2 maintained linear scaling. Vclust with 0.2 k-mers fraction was the fastest algorithm independently of the number of threads. It was followed by the default Vclust setting with the exception of 64 threads, where slow-down caused by the task fragmentation overhead at the prefilter step made it inferior by a small margin to less accurate MMseqs2. In the right panel, memory usage was constant across thread counts for all algorithms except FastANI, which showed a linear increase in memory consumption.

Source data

a, Wall time and peak memory usage for prefiltering genomes in a varying number of equally-sized sequence batches. The prefilter was configured to consider all k-mers (default) or 0.2 fraction of k-mers. Increasing the number of batches slightly increased runtime, significantly reducing memory usage for both k-mer fractions. b, Wall time and peak memory usage for different combinations of k-mers fractions (1 to 0.001) and minimum shared k-mers (20 to 1) during prefiltering. Below each combination, the outputs of prefilter and align steps are compared to the default settings (k-mers fraction 1 and minimum shared k-mers 20). The numbers represent: contig pairs passing the prefilter step (≥95% sequence identity; blue), pairs passing the align step (ANI ≥ 95%, AF ≥ 85%) common to the pairs obtained using all k-mers (green), contig pairs missed compared to using all k-mers (red), and additional contig pairs detected at the specified k-mers fraction but missing compared to using all k-mers (magenta). For instance, a 0.2 k-mers fraction reduces time and memory usage threefold, with a minimal impact on sensitivity and specificity.

Source data

Comparison of a, total average nucleotide identity (tANI) and b, aligned fraction (AF) values on a reference dataset of 4,244 complete bacteriophage genomes and the same dataset where two regions in each genome were swapped at a random breakpoint position. Both plots cover 40,618 genome pairs with tANI ≥ 70%.

Supplementary Figs. 1–5

Supplementary Table 1. The expected (true) tANI values in the 70–100% range, derived from 10,000 pairs of bacteriophage genomes subjected to simulated mutations, including different levels of substitution, insertion, deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation events. Mutation-type frequencies and corresponding altered nucleotide counts are detailed in the table. Supplementary Table 2. Comparison of the tANI values predicted by Vclust and VIRIDIC in the reference to true ANI values in the ≥95% range. True tANI values were determined among 1,188 genome pairs with simulated mutations, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations (Methods). Vclust shows superior accuracy in determining tANI, with a maximum difference (error) from the true tANI of 0.6%, whereas VIRIDIC's maximum error in tANI values reaches up to 4.7%. Supplementary Table 3. List of bacteriophage genome pairs showing tANI ≥ 95% as predicted by both Vclust and VIRIDIC, yet classified into different species by the ICTV. For each such pair, the history of all involved taxa was reviewed using the ICTV Taxonomy Browser and taxonomic proposals were checked for adopted demarcation criteria and presented. List of bacteriophage genome pairs showing tANI ≥ 95% as predicted by both Vclust and VIRIDIC, yet classified into different species by the ICTV. For each such pair, the history of all involved taxa was reviewed using the ICTV Taxonomy Browser (https://ictv.global/taxonomy/taxondetails/) and taxonomic proposals were checked for adopted demarcation criteria and presented evidence of genome-genome similarity. Supplementary Table 4. List of bacteriophage sequence pairs showing tANI < 95% as predicted by both Vclust and VIRIDIC, yet classified into same species by the ICTV. The identity of such records was reviewed by manual inspection of the GenBank records and associated literature. As our pipeline investigated complete genomes only, all sequences were interpreted as separate genomes. This fragmented genome was flagged, as the sequences belong to the same species, but show almost no sequence similarity. Supplementary Table 5. Comparison of species-level agreement between Vclust and other tools with the ICTV taxonomy (Virus Metadata Resource v38.3) across six different clustering algorithms. Clustering for the evaluated tools was conducted using Clusty based on a tANI threshold of ≥95%. Agreement between the tool clusterings and ICTV species-level clusters was assessed using the ARI, where an ARI of 0 represents no agreement beyond random chance, and an ARI of 1 indicates identical clustering results. Supplementary Table 6. List of 614 ICTV bacteriophage genera containing more than one species or genome. For each genus, the mean and maximum tANI values were calculated using VIRIDIC, the recommended and most widely used tool for genus delineation in ICTV taxonomic proposals. Notably, in nearly 10% of genera (n = 57), no genome pair exceeds the genus threshold of 70% tANI, and an additional 8% of genera (n = 43) have a mean tANI below 70%. Supplementary Table 7. List of 39 ICTV genera pairs with tANI values exceeding the genus threshold of 70%. The table includes the 609 pairs of genomes from different genera where tANI > 70%, encompassing 60 genera. Only the genome pairs (ID1 and ID2) with the highest tANI values are presented. Supplementary Table 8. Wall time and peak memory usage for all-to-all comparisons on the 4,244 bacteriophage genomes in Fig. 2b,c with 32 threads. The time and memory measurements of Vclust and VIRIDIC also include the clustering step, while FastANI and skani perform only ANI calculations. The table also contains the method commands and parameters used for benchmarking. Supplementary Table 9. Comparison of ANI and AF values predicted by the tools in reference to the expected ANI and AF values obtained from BLASTn. The ANI and AF values were calculated among 94,225 viral metagenomic contigs subsampled from IMG/VR v4.1. Only the contig pairs that satisfied the MIUViG's threshold of ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85% were considered in the comparison. As shown in the third column, BLASTn returned 4,361,743 contig pairs satisfying the MIUViG's threshold. The columns include the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson r) between the predicted and reference ANI/AF values, the MAE representing the average absolute difference between predicted and reference ANI/AF values, and the maximum error, which indicates the largest single absolute difference between a predicted ANI/AF value and its corresponding reference. Supplementary Table 10. Comparison of ANI and AF values predicted by the tools in reference to the expected ANI and AF values obtained from BLASTn. This table shows results of Supplementary Table 9, stratified by different contig sizes: <5 kb (n contigs = 19,280), 5–10 kb (n = 29,853), 10–20 kb (n = 17,238), 20–50 kb (n = 22,100), 50–100 kb (n = 4,747), >100 kb (n = 1,007). Only the contig pairs that satisfied the MIUViG's threshold of ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85% in BLASTn were considered in the comparison. Supplementary Table 11. Clustering 15,677,623 virus contig sequences from IMG/VR v4.1 into vOTUs based on the MIUViG thresholds (ANI ≥ 95% and AF ≥ 85%). As a reference, ANI and AF values between all-versus-all contigs were calculated from MegaBLAST (--max_target_seqs 20000 and --evalue 1e-03) and clustered with six algorithms using Clusty. The clustering outputs were evaluated against the MegaBLAST-based reference clustering using ARI (10th column). Additionally, comparisons were made with the original IMG/VR vOTU assignments (11th column). Notably, vOTU clusters based on ANI values from Vclust and MegaBLAST showed high ARI values across different clustering algorithms. Vclust with the ‘--kmers-fraction' option set to 0.2, using 20% of k-mers during prefiltering, has minimal impact on the number of clusters compared to the default setting, which uses all k-mers. Discrepancies between the original IMG/VR vOTUs and Vclust/MegaBLAST clusters are due to differences in the implementation of the Leiden algorithm between the studies. vOTU clusters generated by each clustering algorithm were compared based on the distribution of intra-cluster and inter-cluster ANI values, as presented in Supplementary Fig. 1. Supplementary Table 12. Wall time and peak memory usage for calculating ANI and AF among 15,677,623 IMG/VR contigs, with 64 threads. Vclust performed k-mer-based estimation of sequence identity for 122,893,931,465,064 contig pairs (in the prefilter step), and aligned 811,099,152 contig pairs (in the ANI calculation step). BLASTn measurements were estimated from a random sample of 1,000 contigs used as a query to search a database of 15,677,623 contigs. ANI and AF values from MegaBLAST and BLASTn outputs were calculated using the anicalc tool from CheckV. Vclust with the ‘--kmers-fraction' option set to 0.2, using 20% of k-mers during prefiltering, reduces runtime and RAM usage threefold compared to the default setting, which uses all k-mers. Supplementary Table 13. Selection of default LZ-ANI parameter values based on Bayesian optimization. The table summarizes the results of Bayesian optimization performed using scikit-optimize v0.9.0 on a dataset of 10,000 pairs of complete genomes, each with simulated mutations and known true tANI values of ≥70%. Each row represents one of the 100 evaluation runs, with different sets of LZ-ANI parameter combinations. The columns include the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson r) between the predicted and reference tANI values, the MAE representing the average absolute difference between predicted and reference tANI values, and the maximum error, which indicates the largest single absolute difference between a predicted tANI value and its corresponding reference. The evaluation run with the lowest MAE is highlighted in bold and is set as the default parameter configuration in Vclust.

Metrics details

Optical beam steering enables optical sensing, imaging, and long-range communication over free space. Despite the inherent speed of light, advanced applications increasingly require simultaneous steering of multiple, independently controlled beams, to enhance imaging throughput, boost communication bandwidth, and control qubit arrays for scalable quantum computing. However, precise multi-beam steering and control remain a significant challenge with current solid-state beam steering technologies, driving the need for integrated and scalable multi-beam steering solutions. Here, we report a scalable multi-beam steering system comprising an array of integrated acousto-optic beam steering channels on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Each channel generates tens of individually controllable beams at 780 nm with sub-microsecond switching time by exciting acoustic waves using multi-tone microwave signals. We demonstrate the system's unique capabilities through multiple-input, multiple-output free-space communications, simultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers at megabits/sec data rates. This technology is readily scalable to steer hundreds of optical beams from a compact chip, potentially advancing many areas of optical technologies and enabling novel applications.

Solid-state optical beam steering is crucial for a wide array of optical technologies (Fig. 1a), including light detection and ranging (LiDAR)1,2, bioimaging3,4, optical trapping5,6,7, and performing parallel gate operations of optically addressed qubits, such as neutral atoms8,9,10,11, trapped ions12,13,14, and defect centers in solids15,16. It also enables free-space optical communications (FSOC)17,18,19. Various solid-state beam steering technologies have been developed, including optical phased arrays (OPA)20,21,22, focal plane switch arrays (FPSA)23,24, digital micromirror devices (DMD)25,26, and spatial light modulators (SLM)27. These technologies share a common principle: they steer light by creating a synthetic aperture composed of an array of microscale pixels, which relies on sophisticated peripheral control circuits to precisely control optical amplitude or phase at each pixel. Demands on wider steering angles and higher steering resolutions necessitate an increasing number of pixels, presenting significant scaling challenges. Moreover, while existing solid-state beam steering technologies primarily focus on steering a single beam, multi-beam steering28,29 could address performance requirements in advanced applications. For instance, the imaging frame rate of a single-beam-scanning LiDAR system is fundamentally limited by the time of flight and insufficient for autonomous driving systems. This limitation can be addressed by scanning multiple beams simultaneously28,29. Multi-beam steering also enables scalable quantum computing using optically addressed qubits11. These applications demand high beam quality, fast scanning speeds, and independent control of individual beams, critical capabilities that can only be achieved through high-performance, solid-state multi-beam steering technology. Achieving multi-beam steering with SLM or OPA is possible, but they face challenges that make them impractical for many applications. For example, SLMs can segment their aperture into several sub-apertures to diffract and scan multiple beams. However, the scanning speed is limited to the kHz range, which is insufficient for high-speed applications27. OPAs can generate multiple beams by superimposing multiple phase patterns on the array, but they suffer from low extinction ratios due to high crosstalk between the beams30,31. In general, multi-beam steering using integrated photonic systems must overcome several common challenges. The first is power handling capability: each beam must carry the same optical power as in single-beam mode, significantly increasing the total power handling requirement. The second challenge is the increased crosstalk between different beams, which is caused by reduced beam quality when multiple beams are generated from the same aperture. Lastly, there is the challenge of controlling and modulating individual beams so that they can be utilized independently and multiplexed to enhance sensing and imaging throughput or overall system communication bandwidth. The limitations of existing technology call for the innovation of new optical beam steering techniques.

The emerging integrated acousto-optic devices could provide a powerful solution to overcome the abovementioned challenges. Acousto-optic devices utilize acoustic waves that are electromechanically excited in materials to generate a moving phase mask, which coherently modulates and shapes optical waves that pass through. Conventional acousto-optic devices using bulk materials, including acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) and modulators (AOMs), have already proven to be effective as optical switches and intensity modulators in various laser tools32,33. Recently, AODs operated in the multi-beam mode have played a critical role in performing parallel gate operations on neutral atom arrays for quantum computing8,9,10,11. With the emergence of new material platforms and the advancement of optomechanical systems, acousto-optics have been incorporated into integrated photonics, demonstrating versatile applications on various platforms34,35,36,37,38. Guided-wave acousto-optic devices for RF signal processing, optical filtering, and switching have been demonstrated on bulk lithium niobate substrates with a compact footprint39,40. Previously, on a lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform, we demonstrated an integrated acousto-optic beam steering (AOBS) device in which GHz frequency acoustic waves are generated to steer waveguided light into free space with a wide field of view and diffraction-limited resolution41. Here we achieved multi-beam steering where individual beams can be independently controlled and modulated, advancing beyond single-beam AOBS capabilities. In contrast to schemes using pixelated apertures, AOBS has a continuous aperture and uses only a single acoustic transducer to control beam steering. Moreover, the coherent acousto-optic scattering process allows one AOBS device to be driven simultaneously by multiple control signals of different frequencies. Each tone of the generated acoustic wave scatters light into a different angle to achieve multi-beam steering. The compact size of AOBS allows multiple devices to be closely integrated on one chip, proportionally increasing the number of steerable beams. Furthermore, the amplitude and phase of each beam can be independently modulated by the corresponding control signal with an overall bandwidth of hundreds of MHz.

In this work, we report an integrated multi-beam AOBS (mAOBS) array and demonstrate free-space optical communication (FSOC) with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) by combining multi-beam steering and modulation. The mAOBS features an array of monolithically integrated channels, each capable of generating and steering more than twenty visible-band beams along one axis with high beam quality and superior dynamic performance. An array of such channels generates a 2D array of beams. By modulating each beam using Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) coding, we achieve MIMO communication with an aggregate bandwidth exceeding 100 megabits per second (Mbps). MIMO-enabled FSOC affords precise and swift multi-channel communication between decentralized drone swarms or autonomous vehicles, ensuring secure and efficient coordination42. It also enables fast-deployed, reconfigurable, and broad bandwidth satellite or air-to-ground communications43. Our results demonstrate that the mAOBS array is a scalable and flexible multi-beam steering solution that has the potential to enable many emerging optical technologies (Fig. 1a).

Our mAOBS array consists of three main components (Fig. 1b, c): interdigital transducer (IDT) arrays for surface acoustic wave (SAW) generation; a continuous acousto-optic (AO) aperture for beam steering, and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for on-chip light coupling, distributing, and shaping. The AO aperture, as in Fig. 1b, is the slab area between the IDTs (Fig. 1d) and mode converters (Fig. 1e). It comprises multiple AOBS channels that are formed by collimated acoustic and optical beams, rather than by patterning, to maximize the interaction area and reduce background scattering by etched structures. In each channel, the SAW is launched by an IDT to scatter light off the chip and steer along the horizontal axis (H-axis). The array of AOBS channels is distributed along the vertical axis (V-axis), as denoted in Fig. 1b. We place the mAOBS chip at the focal plane of a cylindrical convex lens, which collimates the beams from different channels. For light steered from each AOBS channel, the steering angle along H-axis is controlled by the frequency of the control signal, while the angle in V-axis is determined by the position of the AOBS channel. With each AOBS channel driven by multiple control signals of different frequencies, a 2D array of beams is generated. In addition, each beam can be individually modulated by the corresponding control signal at each channel.

The device is fabricated on an X-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) substrate with 300 nm thick LN layer. A visible-band laser with 780 nm wavelength (Newport TLB-6712) is coupled from fiber to the chip through a waveguide edge coupler. PICs (Fig. 1f) of single-mode waveguides are patterned and etched in the LN layer to route and distribute light to different channels on the chip. Before entering the AO aperture, the waveguide mode is expanded to the \({30}{\mbox{-}}\mu{\rm{m}}{\mbox{-}}{\rm{wide}}\) slab mode to increase the AO interaction area and aperture width. At the end of the mode expander, the slab mode is converted from the TE0 mode to the TE1 mode by a mode converter (Fig. 1e), and then freely propagates into the AO aperture. Our simulation has shown that the TE1 mode can be more efficiently steered by the SAW, propagating along Y-axis of the LN layer than the TE0 mode due to the enhanced moving boundary effect (See Supplementary Information S1). The pitch (d) between the AOBS channels is 250 \(\mu{\rm{m}}\), sufficient to prevent crosstalk. On the other end of the AO aperture, an array of broadband IDTs is fabricated. The IDT periods are linearly chirped from 1.05 to 1.25 \(\mu{\rm{m}}\) to generate SAW with frequencies centered at f0 = 2.45 GHz over a bandwidth of BW = 450 MHz. Each IDT is wire-bonded to a microwave circuit board to be connected to signal sources.

We characterized the mAOBS array's steering performance by imaging the 2D beam array using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera placed on the image plane of the collimating lens. Four AOBS channels are operated simultaneously. Figure 2a shows a superimposed image of an array of 4×21 beams captured by the camera. The beams are generated by scanning the control signal frequency across the IDT bandwidth with a step of \(\varDelta f=\)15 MHz. Each row of beams is generated by each AOBS channel. The distortion of the beam in the second row is attributed to a small blemish of contamination on the surface of the chip. The average beam divergence is 0.19°. By fitting the beam's intensity profile, we determine the effective aperture length (l) of the AOBS channel is 373 \(\mu{\rm{m}}\), which is the overlap between guided acoustic mode and optical mode, limited by acoustic loss. The best beam steering efficiency of a single beam is 3.3% (−14.8 dB), referred to the optical power in the waveguide, when 14.8 dBm control signal power is used (See Supplementary Information S1). The theoretical number of resolvable spots of a single channel is given by \({N}_{1}={BW\cdot l}/v=\) 54, using the SAW velocity of v = 3,110 m/s. For multiple channels, each controlled by different control signals, the total number of resolvable spots Nt simply increases proportionally with channel count. The area-normalized resolvable spot density of our device thus is \(\sigma={N}_{t}/({d\cdot l})=\)579 (spots/mm2), where d is the width of the whole AO aperture. Compared with conventional bulk AODs (ISOMET D55-T80S-2, \(\sigma\)=64 spots/mm2), the mAOBS array has a significant advantage.

Beams in the second row suffer distortion due to a blemish of contamination on the chip surface. b Normalized intensity profile measured along H-axis of 4 (top), 8 (middle), and 16 (bottom) beams simultaneously generated from a single AOBS channel. The channel is driven by control signals comprising 4, 8, and 16 frequency tones, respectively. Cyan curves show the optical intensity at the focal plane while the shaded areas show the background when the control signals are turned off. Circles on the top mark the position and on (solid) or off (hollow) of each site. The H-axis position is normalized to the average beam width w0. The annotations show the sidelobe suppression ratios. c 2D intensity profile of 16 beams generated simultaneously by a single AOBS channel. b, c are captured by scanning a fiber on the focal plane of the collimating lens. The color bar applies to both (a, c).

Another important metric of beam steering systems is the extinction ratio between beams. Figure 2b shows beam profiles of 4, 8, and 16 beams generated by a single AOBS channel (cyan lines). Because the extinction ratio exceeds the dynamic range of the CCD camera (14 dB), to quantify the on/off contrast and crosstalk between beams, we collected the steered beams by scanning a single-mode fiber on the focal plane of the collimating lens and measured the optical power with a photodetector. For comparison, the background signal, when the SAW is turned off, is plotted as the shaded region. We used an arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix AWG70001A) to synthesize control signals with up to 16 frequency tones in the range from 2.35 to 2.65 GHz with \(\varDelta f=\)20 MHz. The corresponding angular positions of the 16 beams are marked with circles in Fig. 2b. The x-axis of Fig. 2b is the beam position on the image plane, normalized to the average beam width w0 = 43.9 μm. When four beams are generated simultaneously using four frequency tones with a total power of PT = 16 dBm, the maximum (average) on-off contrast achieved is 29.7 (27.8) dB. As more beams are generated, the on/off contrast gradually reduces because of reduced power at each RF tone when PT is fixed. The IDT has a limited power handling capability, beyond which it can be damaged due to overheating in ambient conditions. This power limit can be improved using more robust material with protection by a passivation layer and by operating in vacuum or inert gas environment. As shown in Fig. 2b, the maximum (average) on/off contrast is 27.4 (24.8) dB for 8 beams and 27.8 (20.9) dB for 16 beams. The contrast degradation with more beams is due to RF power constraints: as the total power is distributed across more beams, the power per tone decreases while the noise floor remains constant, resulting in reduced signal strength. While the beam power is uniform with less than 1% variation, the background has a larger variation due to scattering by etched device structures on the chip. From the recent results of high-Q LN ring resonators44,45,46, we can estimate the optical scattering limit of LN photonic structures and expect the on/off contrast to be further improved to above 60 dB. The crosstalk between beams separated by 5w0 (~1° in angular position) is ~−20 dB, reducing to ~−25 dB at 10w0 separation. Figure 2c shows the detailed 2D mapping of 16 concurrently generated beams, featuring uniform beam shapes and contrasts across the whole field of view.

Besides the multi-beam steering capability, the mAOBS array also shows superior dynamic performance than conventional technologies. We first characterize the linearity, accuracy, and stability of the beam power controlled by the control signal. Figure 3a plots the measured power of a steered beam versus the control signal power varied from 0 to 13 dBm. The optical power is measured with a photodiode using 100 \(\mu{\rm{s}}\) integration time. We repeated the measurement among 16 control signal power levels with overall 3 × 104 switching cycles. The result and linear fitting of it in Fig. 3a show excellent agreement, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) is very low at 0.42%. Figure 3b displays the photodiode voltage waveform captured on an oscilloscope when the control signal is switched on, showing a very short switching rising time of 116 ns (10% to 90%).

Each data point is averaged over approximately 1875 measurements, with a total of 30,000 switching cycles. Symbol color represents the relative standard deviation (RSD), calculated as the standard deviation divided by the mean for each data point. b Time trace of the photodetector voltage receiving the beam when the control signal is switched on. The 10–90% rising time is measured to be 116 ns. c Eye diagrams of the AOBS transmitted data of pseudo-random sequence encoded by OOK (upper) at 2 Mbps and PAM4 (lower) at 4 Mbps. d Constellation diagram of the AOBS transmitted data using 64-QAM modulation at 6 Mbps.

The demonstrated linearity, repeatability, and speed of AOBS are important attributes for applications such as optical control of qubits and FSOC. To demonstrate the latter, we modulated the control signal and encode pseudo-random pulse sequence data using various coding schemes. The data was carried by the steered beams and transmitted over free space in a direction controlled by the frequency of the control signal. The steered beam was detected by a receiver and characterized by performing eye diagram and constellation diagram analysis. Figure 3c shows measured eye diagrams when on-off keying (OOK) and 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) coding are used, respectively. The data rate is 4 Mbps, which is equivalent to Bluetooth 5.0 transmission rate. Both diagrams show clear eye openings, with a quality factor of 14, indicating a high signal-to-noise ratio. We then advanced the coding scheme to 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM). Figure 3d shows the measured constellation diagram transmitted at 6 Mbps. All 64 symbols are clearly separated with a −26 dB error vector magnitude (EVM).

The multiple beams steered by an AOBS channel in different directions can be modulated by corresponding control signals to transmit different data simultaneously, thereby realizing MIMO optical communication (Fig. 4a). The total communication throughput of each AOBS channel is upper bound by the bandwidth of the IDT, which is 450 MHz in the current device. For multi-beam communication, the available bandwidth is reduced to avoid crosstalk, which requires an inter-beam frequency separation higher than 8 MHz set by beam divergence. The total throughput of the mAOBS array increases proportionally with the number of channels. We demonstrate MIMO optical communication with the scheme as shown in Fig. 4a. Due to the limited number of signal generators, we drove a single AOBS channel with only four control signals to generate four beams, each transmitting a different image. Figure 4b shows the spectrum of the four control signals with frequencies ranging from 2.27 to 2.39 GHz and 40 MHz spacing. Each control signal carries the data stream of an image encoded using 16-QAM return-to-zero coding at 2 Mbps, which helps reduce inter-symbol interference. The transmitted optical signals are received by photodetectors and decoded using digital signal processing (DSP). Figure 4c displays samples of 20 μs duration of the transmitted signals. The aggregated constellation diagrams after demodulation and corresponding images recovered from the data streams are shown in Fig. 4d. The clearly separated constellation demonstrates the communication fidelity of four beams with a combined data rate of 8 Mbps. If all four channels of the mAOBS array are used, each generating 16 beams and transmitting data at 2 Mbps, the aggregated data rate of the current system will reach 128 Mbps.

Multiple control signals are used to drive the mAOBS array to steer multiple beams at angles (θi) controlled by the control signal frequency (Ωi).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a multi-beam AOBS array, which monolithically integrates PICs with acousto-optics on a scalable platform. This system, with its compact footprint, high extinction ratio, superior dynamic performance, and broadband modulation capabilities, presents a promising multi-beam steering solution for diverse applications in optical sensing, imaging, and communication. There are several enabling innovations that are worth noting. The use of lithium niobate and the large steering aperture enable AOBS to handle high optical power over a broad spectral range from near-IR to visible, which is significantly advantageous over OPAs and FPSAs that use silicon photonics. The system's high beam quality and broad acoustic bandwidth result in lower than -20 dB inter-beam crosstalk. Future improvement in fabrication quality and device structure are expected to further reduce crosstalk. Additionally, the broadband IDT design provides ample bandwidth for modulating individual beams, making the mAOBS array particularly powerful for applications like LiDAR, quantum gate operations, and MIMO-enabled FSOC. The latter is especially valuable in scenarios such as communication among drone swarms and emergency communication reconstruction, when the ability to communicate distinct information to different receivers is crucial. Further development of this technology will enhance its efficiency and versatility, making it an optimal solution for high-speed, multi-beam imaging, control, and communication in a variety of demanding applications.

The mAOBS array is fabricated on x-cut lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) wafers with 300 nm thick LN layer (from NanoLN Inc.). The optical waveguides are patterned with electron-beam lithography and then etched by inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etcher (ICP-RIE). After stripping the resist, piranha and standard cleaning solution are used to remove resist residue and smooth the surface. The mode converter is patterned with electron-beam lithography using negative resist hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). The IDT was patterned with electron-beam lithography and followed by a lift-off process of 100 nm thick aluminum film.

A fiber-coupled laser (Newport TLB-6712) operating at 780 nm is used as the light source in all measurements. An arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix AWG70001A) is used to generate the control signals for the measurement shown in Fig. 2 and 3. For multi-beam steering and communication measurement in Figs. 4, multi-tone control signals are generated by a multi-channel FPGA system. The beam profiles in Fig. 2a are captured by a CCD camera (Lumenera Infinity2) at the focal plane of the collimating lens. A beam splitter is placed between the camera and the lens. This enables simultaneous measurement using a fiber to measure beam intensity with a high dynamic range. A fiber is scanned in the focal plane by a 2-axis motorized micropositioning system (MCL Micro-Stage) with closed-loop control to collect the scattered light. The light collected by the fiber is detected by a photodetector (APD130A2). The electrical signal from the photodetector is measured by an oscilloscope (MSO/DPO70000DX).

Metrics details

Persisters are phenotypically switched bacteria that survive antibiotic exposure despite being genetically susceptible. Three pathways to persistence—triggered, spontaneous and antibiotic-induced—have been described, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we used antibiotic time–kill assays as well as single-cell approaches to show that all of the pathways depend on a common switch involving the alarmone guanosine tetra/penta-phosphate ((p)ppGpp) in Bacillus subtilis, each stemming from different alarmone synthetase(s). The accumulation of (p)ppGpp promotes persistence through depletion of intracellular GTP. We developed a fluorescent GTP reporter to visualize rare events of persister formation in wild-type bacteria, revealing a rapid switch from growth to dormancy in single cells as their GTP levels drop beneath a threshold. While a decrease in GTP in the bulk population slows growth and promotes antibiotic tolerance, (p)ppGpp drives persistence by driving rapid, switch-like decreases in GTP levels beneath the persister threshold in single cells. Persistence through alarmone–GTP antagonism is probably a widespread mechanism to survive antibiotics in B. subtilis and potentially beyond.

Antibiotic persisters are individual bacterial cells that survive prolonged bactericidal antibiotic treatment despite being genetically sensitive to antibiotics1,2,3. Joseph Bigger originally proposed that persisters can be generated before or after treatment with antibiotics2. Later, persisters were categorized by their pathways of generation—starvation triggered, spontaneously generated and antibiotic induced1—yet their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Although persistence can be triggered by nutrient deprivations4 through the intracellular accumulation of the alarmone (p)ppGpp5,6,7,8,9, it is also argued that slow growth or a reduction in ATP levels, rather than (p)ppGpp, is responsible for triggering persistence10,11. In addition to starvation, persisters can form spontaneously3. However, spontaneous persisters exist in natural populations at a low frequency, making their identification challenging and making it difficult to establish the mechanisms of their formation. While toxin–antitoxin (TA) modules are strongly implicated in persistence3,5,8,12,13, their roles in spontaneous antibiotic persistence of wild-type bacteria remain unclear14. Finally, persisters were observed both before and after treatment with antibiotics15, and bacteriostatic antibiotics are known to induce persisters16. However, it is difficult to differentiate antibiotic-induced persistence from antibiotic tolerance1, spontaneous persistence, transcriptional response to specific drugs or by-products of cellular damage from drug treatment1. The mechanisms of antibiotic-induced persistence remain poorly understood. Here we directly visualize the formation of starvation-triggered, spontaneous and antibiotic-induced persisters in the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis belonging to the phylum Bacillota and reveal that multiple cellular mechanisms of persistence can converge on a common pathway of alarmone–GTP antagonism.

To quantify persistence in B. subtilis, we began by treating cells with the cell-wall-targeting antibiotic vancomycin at concentrations of 20 times higher than its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig 1). The results revealed biphasic killing kinetics, with a rapid elimination of the majority of cells followed by the prolonged survival of a small subpopulation. This surviving fraction (approximately 0.1%) remained consistent across varying drug concentrations and, after regrowth, became resensitized to antibiotics (Fig. 1a), confirming that these are phenotypically switched persisters rather than genetically altered resisters1,2,17. We also tested the effect of prophages on persistence, given that persistence against the DNA-damaging antibiotic ciprofloxacin has been shown to be complicated by prophage activation in Escherichia coli14. We confirmed that, similar to E. coli, persistence against ciprofloxacin is weakened by prophages (Supplementary Fig. 2), but persistence against vancomycin remains unaffected regardless of the presence or absence of resident prophages SPβ and PBSX within the genome. Furthermore, the levels of persisters in prophage-cured cells were consistent across different classes of antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and kanamycin, that target translation (Fig. 1b). This suggests that the persisters originate from a common subpopulation that is refractory to multiple antibiotics1.

Rekill indicates that cells that survived 20× MIC vancomycin treatment were regrown and treated with vancomycin again. b, Survival curves of prophage-cured WT B. subtilis treated with 20× MIC vancomycin, 20× MIC ciprofloxacin or 8× MIC kanamycin. c, Starvation-triggered persistence of WT B. subtilis depends on (p)ppGpp. Biphasic kill curve assays of vancomycin treatment were performed after treatment with several starvation-inducing or (p)ppGpp-inducing conditions.

Persisters that remained through the passage were defined as spontaneous persisters. g, In B. subtilis and many Gram-positive bacteria, (p)ppGpp is synthesized by three (p)ppGpp synthetases. Rel is the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase, whereas SasB (also known as SAS1, RelQ or YjbM) and SasA (also known as SAS2, RelP or YwaC) are monofunctional synthetases. h, Persister levels in starvation-induced (arginine hydroxamate; black) WT and (p)ppGpp mutants. i, The levels of spontaneous persisters (green, second passage) in WT and (p)ppGpp mutants. relSyn (relD264G) is a synthetase-inactive variant of Rel that retains its hydrolase activity essential for viability in the presence of sasB and sasA. sasBF42A encodes an allosteric pppGpp-binding-site mutant of SasB. For a–d, f, h and i, data are mean ± s.d. from three or more biological replicates. For d, f, h and i, P values were calculated using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.

(p)ppGpp is a starvation-induced alarmone that is strongly implicated in antibiotic survival9. We therefore examined the effect of (p)ppGpp on antibiotic resistance, tolerance and persistence using mutant B. subtilis lacking all three (p)ppGpp synthetases (hereafter, (p)ppGpp0)18,19. Compared with the wild-type strain, the (p)ppGpp0 strain exhibited similar resistance to a variety of antibiotics (MIC assay; Supplementary Fig. 1), a modestly reduced antibiotic tolerance (approximately 5% reduction in MDK99, where MDK99 is the minimum duration of killing for 99% of the population; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b) and strongly reduced (around tenfold) antibiotic persistence (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1c). These results indicate that (p)ppGpp predominantly promotes antibiotic persistence.

Antibiotic persistence can be triggered by starvation or occur spontaneously1. To investigate the role of (p)ppGpp in starvation-triggered persistence, we starved cells using several methods: allowing growth into stationary phase, inducing amino acid starvation, or depleting ATP with arsenate10 or CCCP20. We then performed kill curves with vancomycin under these conditions or after starvation was removed by back-diluting in rich medium. The biphasic kill curves (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a) showed a high level of triggered persisters (around 500-fold increase from 0.1% to about 50%) after all starvation treatments and even after starvation removal, consistent with the established definition of triggered persistence1.

Notably, all starvation conditions also induced (p)ppGpp accumulation. We observed (p)ppGpp buildup not only after amino acid starvation but also during ATP depletion (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, starvation-triggered persistence was abolished in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant, indicating that (p)ppGpp induction is necessary for triggered persistence (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 5). Finally, we found that, even in the absence of starvation, gratuitous induction of (p)ppGpp by overexpressing its synthetase21 was sufficient to produce high levels of persisters (Fig. 1c; p-sasA). These findings demonstrate that (p)ppGpp accumulation is both necessary and sufficient to trigger persistence.

We next investigated the occurrence of spontaneous persistence. To differentiate spontaneous persisters from those triggered by starvation, we performed a classical serial passage experiment1,3 (Fig. 1e). In this method, cells are repeatedly diluted into fresh medium during exponential growth, which removes starvation-triggered persisters from the lag-phase culture while leaving a consistent, basal fraction of spontaneously generated persisters. This approach enabled us to identify a rare population of spontaneous persisters (around 0.05%) after the starvation-triggered persisters have been eliminated (Fig. 1f). Notably, the spontaneous persisters were absent in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant, indicating that (p)ppGpp has a key role in both spontaneous and starvation-triggered persistence.

In B. subtilis, (p)ppGpp is synthesized by three enzymes: Rel, SasA and SasB (Fig. 1g). To assess their roles in persister formation, we analysed single, double and triple mutants of these synthetases (Fig. 1h,i, Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Our findings show that only the starvation-responsive synthetase, Rel, is essential for starvation-triggered persistence (Fig. 1h). By contrast, spontaneous persistence is controlled by both Rel and SasB, as mutations in either rel or sasB significantly reduce spontaneous persister levels and, in combination, they completely abolish this phenotype (Fig. 1i). Rel can be activated by pppGpp (Supplementary Fig. 6), aligning with recent findings22. SasB, a tetrameric enzyme, enables allosteric activation of (p)ppGpp synthesis by pppGpp, with a Hill coefficient of around 3.0 (ref. 23). A mutation that disrupts the allosteric pppGpp-binding site in SasB (sasBF42A) leads to a similar decrease in spontaneous persistence as observed in the ΔsasB mutant (Fig. 1i). These results suggest that self-amplification of (p)ppGpp synthesis is crucial for spontaneous persister formation.

We next searched for the downstream effector of (p)ppGpp that mediates antibiotic persistence. (p)ppGpp is a bacterial alarmone with pleiotropic functions including upregulating competence and sporulation24. We found that disruption of competence, sporulation or three known TA systems in B. subtilis has little impact on persistence (Supplementary Fig. 7). (p)ppGpp also antagonizes the essential nucleotide GTP in B. subtilis and downregulates macromolecular biosynthesis18. (p)ppGpp production consumes GTP, and (p)ppGpp directly inhibits multiple enzymes along the pathway of GTP production18,25,26,27 (Fig. 2a). Moreover, (p)ppGpp binds to the purine transcription regulator PurR to inhibit transcription of the pur operon, encoding de novo purine biosynthesis genes upstream of GTP synthesis28. Furthermore, (p)ppGpp competes with GTP to regulate macromolecule synthesis enzymes, including the DNA replication enzyme primase29,30, and GTPases for ribosome biogenesis, assembly and protein translation31,32,33,34. Under starvation conditions that trigger persisters, GTP levels were significantly depleted, whereas ATP levels varied (Fig. 1d), suggesting that GTP depletion may be a common effector leading to persistence.

a, (p)ppGpp robustly inhibits de novo GTP biosynthesis by inhibiting the guanylate kinase Gmk and the IMP dehydrogenase GuaB, as well as inhibiting expression of the pur operon through the PurR repressor. (p)ppGpp also inhibits GTP synthesis by purine salvage, which is not illustrated here. b,c, Vancomycin-survival curves of WT, purine-biosynthesis mutants ∆purB, ∆purL and ∆purF, the GTP-synthesis mutant ∆guaA and the guaB-repressed mutant (guaBDown) (b); the slow-growth mutants ∆pyk (pyruvate kinase) and ∆ctaA (haem synthase) (c); and the (p)ppGpp0 and (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R strains (b).

Populations were measured for their growth rate, PlowGTP fluorescence and levels of high PlowGTP fluorescence cells using flow cytometry (around 1.5 × 106 cells), and their tolerance and persistence were determined on the basis of vancomycin-survival curves as shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. Each value represents a single replicate. Three replicates for each condition are shown. r represents the Pearson correlation coefficient. P values were calculated using two-tailed Pearson correlation tests. Est., estimated.

To test whether GTP depletion mediates antibiotic persistence even in the absence of (p)ppGpp induction, we used our previously published strain with inducible downregulated expression of the guanine nucleotide synthesis gene guaB35 (guaBDown), lowering GTP without inducing (p)ppGpp (Supplementary Fig. 8). We observed an increase in persistence by about tenfold (Fig. 2b), indicating that GTP depletion is sufficient to generate persisters. Moreover, we performed a non-biased transposon-insertion-sequencing (Tn-seq) analysis in B. subtilis to identify genes of which the disruption increased cell survival after prolonged antibiotic treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3). The strongest hits mapped to 12 de novo purine biosynthesis genes in the pur operon and guaA, encoding GMP synthetase (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). We verified that disruption of the pur operon or guaA reduces purine levels, including GTP (Extended Data Fig. 3d), and the corresponding kill curves confirmed increased antibiotic persistence (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3e). We next wanted to determine whether reducing GTP in the complete absence of (p)ppGpp can still promote persistence. Using a genetic screen, we identified a mutation in gmk (encoding guanylate kinase; Methods) that reduces the GTP levels of the (p)ppGpp0 strain back to the wild-type level (Extended Data Fig. 4). This mutant (hereafter, (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R) restored persistence back to wild-type levels (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4), confirming that GTP depletion is sufficient for antibiotic persistence.

In addition to increased persistence, we also noted a modest increase in antibiotic tolerance in the GTP-synthesis mutants (Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with our previous findings that GTP depletion leads to slower growth35. Slower growth has been shown to contribute to antibiotic tolerance11,36. This raises questions of whether increased antibiotic persistence is simply a consequence of slow growth, and whether it is always correlated with tolerance.

Genetic screens in B. subtilis have identified slow-growing mutants, some of which deplete GTP while others do not. We tested a couple of slow-growing mutants that do not rely on GTP depletion. Notably, although these mutants exhibited increased tolerance, they do not show an increase in persistence; in fact, some showed decreased persistence (Fig. 2c). This suggests that, although tolerance and persistence are correlated in certain mutants or conditions11, they can be genetically uncoupled.

To further distinguish between tolerance and persistence, we grew wild-type cells in different carbon sources, measuring their growth rates and antibiotic killing dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Our results revealed a strong correlation between slower growth rates and increased tolerance (Fig. 2e), but no significant correlation between growth rates and persistence (Fig. 2h). This demonstrates that, although tolerance and persistence can share overlapping characteristics, they represent distinct biological phenomena that can be independently regulated.

Our findings, while unexpected, are explainable: although both slow growth and antibiotic tolerance are population-level phenomena, persistence reflects the behaviour of a phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulation of cells functioning as outliers. To differentiate population-based tolerance from the phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulation of persisters, it is critical to measure GTP levels in single cells.

To achieve this, we constructed a fluorescent reporter for GTP levels in single cells. Building on our previous result that the ilvB gene is induced by approximately 20-fold after GTP depletion through the CodY repressor—which uses GTP as a co-repressor37,38—we cloned the CodY operator from ilvB to control fluorescent protein expression ectopically (Extended Data Fig. 6a). This reporter, termed PlowGTP (Fig. 2d), is fully repressed in (p)ppGpp0 cells, with fluorescence indistinguishable from background autofluorescence (Extended Data Fig. 6b). In (p)ppGpp+ cells, the reporter displays a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence across a physiological range of (p)ppGpp induction and GTP depletion (Extended Data Fig. 6c-d). This response to amino acid or ATP starvation is abolished in (p)ppGpp0 mutants (Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, neither the PlowGTP reporter nor the CodY regulator interferes with antibiotic survival (Supplementary Fig. 10). The PlowGTP reporter activity is inversely related to the ribosomal P1 promoter activity (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is activated by GTP35. Although increased fluorescence could theoretically result from a failure to dilute the fluorescent protein during slow growth, our data show that PlowGTP fluorescence responds to changes in GTP levels rather than slow growth (Supplementary Fig. 12).

After calibrating the PlowGTP reporter in the bulk population, we examined whether it reflects GTP levels in individual cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of cells with high PlowGTP fluorescence, followed by analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS), confirmed that the bright cells had notably lower GTP levels (Supplementary Fig. 13). This demonstrates that the reporter accurately reflects GTP levels at both the population and single-cell levels. Together, these results confirm that our reporter reliably tracks GTP depletion rather than slow growth, enabling us to distinguish between slow-growing tolerant cells and GTP-depleted persister subpopulations.

Using this reporter, we examined GTP distributions in single cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 14). Most cells are dark during growth in rich medium, consistent with bulk measurements (Extended Data Fig. 6b). However, we identified a heavy-tailed subpopulation of rare, bright cells that depended on the presence of the reporter (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 14b), indicating substantial GTP depletion. This subpopulation was absent in (p)ppGpp0 cells but reappeared in (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R cells with rescued persistence (Supplementary Fig. 14c).

The fractions of bright, low-GTP cells varied when cells were grown in medium with different carbon sources (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Notably, the fraction of low-GTP cells was strongly correlated with the fraction of persisters, measured using kill curves (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b; 5 h survivors), but was not correlated with the growth rate (Fig. 2g,h,j) or antibiotic tolerance (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5d). These results distinguish persistence from tolerance, demonstrating that persistence under various growth conditions is driven by the fraction of low-GTP outliers, not by the population's average growth rate.

Despite the strong correlation between persisters and low-GTP cells, it is essential to determine whether these two subpopulations were indeed the same. To explore this, we used two methods. First, we used FACS to sort exponentially growing wild-type cells containing the PlowGTP reporter (Fig. 3a). FACS-isolated cells with high PlowGTP fluorescence (top 0.1%) were immediately treated with vancomycin. After 5 h of treatment and subsequent antibiotic removal, cells were plated. Around 80% of the sorted low-GTP cells formed colonies compared with only about 0.1% survival in the low-fluorescence population (Fig. 3b). This demonstrates that nearly all low-GTP cells are antibiotic-refractory persisters capable of regrowth after antibiotic removal. We confirmed that this persistence was specifically dependent on PlowGTP, using a differentially labelled Pveg control that measured the effect of protein dilution (Supplementary Fig. 15a), or through fluorescent protein swapping (Supplementary Fig. 15b).

a, Schematic of the FACS sorting and antibiotic survival assay using the PlowGTP reporter. The bacterial population containing the reporter was sorted based on PlowGTP fluorescence and was immediately treated with antibiotic. Survival was measured by serial dilution and plating followed by colony counting. b, WT cells containing the PlowGTP–GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter were FACS-sorted into low or high PlowGTP fluorescence fractions. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were sorted per sample per replicate. The fractions were treated with vancomycin and measured for survival over time. Data are mean ± s.d. from three biological replicates. c, Representative time-lapse micrograph from three biological replicates of WT cells containing the PlowGTP reporter in response to antibiotic treatment. Exponentially growing WT cells containing the reporter were patched onto agarose pads made with growth medium. High PlowGTP fluorescence cells were identified (arrow) and monitored for antibiotic survival using carbenicillin and Sytox Blue staining (cyan) for viability. The numbers indicate time in minutes. Scale bar, 10 µm. d, The survival of low-GTP cells in biofilm. Representative time-lapse micrograph of WT cells containing both PlowGTP (for low GTP, green) and PrrnBP1 (for high GTP, yellow) reporters were grown into colony biofilm and then treated with vancomycin for 6 h. Scale bar, 50 µm. The bar graphs indicate changes in the high-GTP and low-GTP populations before and after treatment. Data are mean ± s.d. of four biological replicates. P values were calculated using unpaired two-tailed t-tests. e, Representative single-cell dynamic trace of persister formation. A total of around 30,000 cell growth and division events was recorded to reveal about 10 persistence entrance events. The numbers indicate time in minutes. Scale bar, 10 µm. The arrows indicate a cell with increased PlowGTP fluorescence followed by growth attenuation. f, Quantified changes in cell length (left) versus PlowGTP fluorescence (right) from the single trace in e. The dotted lines indicate persistence entrance. g, Summary data of the specific growth rate and reporter fluorescence from about 100 independent single-cell traces, similar to e (ten entrance traces). The solid lines indicate the nonlinear regression model fitted to the data.

In addition to FACS sorting, we used time-lapse microscopy to monitor cell fate during antibiotic treatment. We found that only bright cells were non-growing before antibiotic treatment and remained viable during the treatment, while the rest of the cells, which elongated and divided, were rapidly killed (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Video 1).

To further investigate persisters in biofilms, where they are commonly found39, we developed a microfluidic biofilm system with confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 16). Using dual-labelled cells (PrrnBP1 and PlowGTP), we identified a mixture of persisters and growing cells in microfluidic biofilms (Fig. 3d). After prolonged (6 h) antibiotic treatment, the low-GTP cells survived within the biofilm (Fig. 3d), confirming that the majority of persisters in biofilms are low-GTP cells.

After confirming that PlowGTP-bright cells are persisters, we investigated how these persisters form before antibiotic treatment. Our goal was to observe how rare, spontaneous persisters emerge from actively growing wild-type cells, and to examine how this process relates to GTP levels. We seeded highly diluted, growing cells onto solid growth medium and monitored around 30,000 growth and division events (Supplementary Fig. 17a,b). From this, we identified ten cells that entered a persister state before reaching a high cell density (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 17c–k and Supplementary Video 2). We retrospectively analysed the dynamics of their transition into persistence by quantifying their growth, division and GTP reporter activity. This revealed distinct, switch-like behaviours at the single-cell level (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 17c–k). Initially, each pre-persister cell maintained the same elongation rate as actively growing cells, while its PlowGTP fluorescence gradually increased, often over more than one cell division (Supplementary Fig. 17c–k). This was followed by a sudden stop in elongation, marking entry into dormancy when the PlowGTP fluorescence reached a threshold (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8a–i). In all cases, the reporter fluorescence increased before growth inhibition occurred (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8a–i), indicating that GTP depletion triggers growth inhibition rather than resulting from it.

The fluorescence thresholds were highly consistent across different persister entry events (Fig. 3g), suggesting that the switch to persistence is activated when intracellular GTP levels fall to a specific threshold. This threshold aligns with values seen in our microscopy and flow cytometry experiments, corresponding to an estimated GTP concentration of around 0.1–0.2 mM (ref. 40). This range is comparable to what is observed in wild-type cells experiencing strong (p)ppGpp accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d), where most cells became starvation-triggered persisters.

While GTP depletion leads to persistence, we next examined the role of (p)ppGpp in persister dynamics. Notably, the (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R mutant, which has GTP levels similar to wild-type cells but lacks (p)ppGpp (Fig. 2c), can still form spontaneous persisters (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 8j–l, Supplementary Fig. 17l–n and Supplementary Video 3). However, these mutants do not exhibit the switch-like dynamics characteristic of persister entry in wild-type cells. Instead, their entry into dormancy is gradual, with elongation slowing as reporter activity increases (Fig. 3f). Moreover, in these mutants, GTP levels and growth rates show a linear relationship (Fig. 3g), contrasting with the switch-like relationship seen in wild-type cells. Thus, (p)ppGpp promotes GTP depletion, enabling the rapid switch-like entry into persistence observed in wild-type cells.

Finally, we used our established system to investigate the poorly understood phenomenon of antibiotic-induced persistence1. We found that PlowGTP fluorescence increased in cells exposed to lethal concentrations of cell wall antibiotics, including carbenicillin, vancomycin and bacitracin (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). While most cells were killed by irreversible damage, a few PlowGTP-bright cells survived and resumed growth after the antibiotics were removed (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c and Supplementary Video 4). LC–MS analysis revealed that exposure to both lethal and sublethal doses of bacitracin led to the accumulation of alarmones, such as ppGpp and ppApp, and a decrease in GTP levels (Fig. 4b–d). These results suggest that cell wall antibiotic treatment induces alarmone production and depletes GTP. Using mutants of (p)ppGpp synthetases, we found that a single alarmone synthetase, SasA21, is responsible for (p)ppGpp accumulation and GTP depletion during cell wall antibiotic treatment (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).

a, Cell wall antibiotics induce PlowGTP reporter fluorescence. WT cells containing the PlowGTP reporter were treated with 20× MIC ciprofloxacin (CIP), 4× MIC kanamycin (KAN), 200× MIC carbenicillin (CARB), 20× MIC vancomycin (VAN) or 3× MIC bacitracin (BAC) for 2 h. Fluorescence was measured using microscopy (>200 cells each, three biological replicates). b–d, The levels of ppGpp (b), ppApp (c) and GTP (d) in WT cells treated with sublethal or lethal concentrations of bacitracin for 0.5 h. Sublethal (SL), 0.5× MIC bacitracin; lethal (L), 3× MIC bacitracin. e,f, The levels of cell wall antibiotic-induced persisters in WT and (p)ppGpp mutants. e, Strains containing the PlowGTP reporter before and after 0.5× MIC bacitracin treatment for 0.5 h were measured for generation of low-GTP cells using flow cytometry (around 1 × 106 cells per sample per replicate, three replicates). The levels of induced low-GTP cells were determined by subtracting the levels in uninduced populations. f, The survival of WT or (p)ppGpp mutants pretreated with 0.5× MIC for 0.5 h, followed by lethal (3× MIC) bacitracin treatment for up to 5 h. The levels of induced persistence were determined by subtracting the survival of uninduced populations at 5 h. g, Survival curve of WT or ∆sasA cells pretreated with sublethal (0.5× MIC) bacitracin for 0.5 h, followed by lethal (3× MIC) bacitracin treatment for up to 5 h. For a–g, data are mean ± s.d. from three or more biological replicates. Statistical comparisons were performed between WT and mutant pairs or untreated and treated pairs using unpaired two-tailed t-tests. h, Model for persistence pathways mediated by (p)ppGpp-GTP antagonism. Starvation-triggered persistence (purple) is mediated primarily through the (p)ppGpp synthetase Rel. Spontaneous persistence is mediated through the activities of two (p)ppGpp synthetases, Rel and SasB (green). Persisters can also be induced by cell wall antibiotics through SasA (orange). Thus, (p)ppGpp enables integration of different signals to trigger persistence through GTP depletion.

To assess whether this alarmone response provides a protective effect, we measured persistence due to treatment with sublethal concentrations (below MIC) of bacitracin (Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 20). While sublethal bacitracin did not impact cell viability, it did induce SasA expression41,42 (Supplementary Fig. 21). Notably, when followed by a lethal dose of bacitracin (3× MIC), cells pretreated with sublethal antibiotics showed approximately five times more persisters than non-pretreated cells, with minimal differences in tolerance (Fig. 4g). This survival mechanism, dependent on SasA but not on other alarmone synthetases (Fig. 4f), enables pre-exposed cells to better resist lethal antibiotic exposure. Thus, antibiotic-induced persistence may serve as an adaptive strategy, substantially enhancing cell survival against a later lethal antibiotic challenge.

Our data highlight the pivotal role of (p)ppGpp in persistence. We demonstrate that conditions triggering persistence10 also induce (p)ppGpp accumulation, that persistence depends on (p)ppGpp accumulation, and that three (p)ppGpp synthetases are differentially responsible for starvation-triggered, spontaneous and antibiotic-induced persistence (Fig. 4h). While (p)ppGpp senses environmental signals to initiate persistence, GTP antagonism functions as a critical effector, probably through coordinated suspension of multiple GTP-dependent processes such as protein translation and DNA synthesis, as well as potentiating competitive inhibition by (p)ppGpp (Extended Data Fig. 10). Our research also distinguishes persisters from tolerators, revealing that persisters arise through specific genetic pathways that generate individual cells with low GTP, independent of population-wide growth rates or bulk GTP levels.

Our results suggest a metabolic model for spontaneous persistence. Phenotypic switch into persistence can be mediated by competition between toxins and antitoxins in TA modules to provide a threshold-like mechanism3,12,43. Our findings suggest that cells can also use an alternative mechanism for the spontaneous entrance, through allosteric enzyme cooperativity and self-amplification of (p)ppGpp synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 22). This enables rapid amplification of a small signal, such as from noise in (p)ppGpp synthesis, to allow spontaneous persister formation in rare individual cells.

Our study also provides strong evidence for bactericidal antibiotic-induced persistence. While previous research suggested that antibiotics induce persistence through cellular damage15 and stress responses such as the SOS pathway44, our results show that antibiotics, particularly cell-wall-targeting ones, induce persistence through the accumulation of alarmones like (p)ppGpp, driven by SasA expression in response to cell envelope damage41,42,45. In the soil bacterium B. subtilis, the evolution of this regulation may be shaped by a fitness advantage from its habitat to enhance survival to diffusible antimicrobials from neighbouring microorganisms. For example, bacitracin, which we show to induce persistence, is a diffusible natural antibiotic produced by other soil Bacillus species46. Clinically, this model may explain why (p)ppGpp mutants in pathogens in the Bacillota phylum, such as Staphylococcus aureus, show reduced survival against cell-wall-targeting drugs47 and diminished clearance under combination antibiotic therapies48.

Finally, persistence may have a key role in the emergence of genetic resistance by expanding the reservoir of surviving bacteria during antibiotic treatment. Given that antibiotic overuse increases bacterial exposure to these drugs, driving the evolution of resistance49, targeting persister formation could improve treatment outcomes and help curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections.

A list of all of the bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study is provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4. LB and LB agar were used for cloning and maintenance of strains. For selection in B. subtilis, media were supplemented with the following antibiotics when required: spectinomycin (80 µg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 µg ml−1), kanamycin (10 µg ml−1) and tetracycline (10 µg ml−1). The combination of lincomycin (12.5 µg ml−1) and erythromycin (0.5 µg ml−1) was used to select for macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (MLS) resistance. Carbenicillin (100 µg ml−1) was used for selection in E. coli.

B. subtilis (p)ppGpp biosynthesis mutants were constructed by transformations of integration plasmids containing an I-sceI endonuclease cut site and regions of homology upstream and downstream of specific synthetase genes (pJW300 for ∆sasB; pJW370 for sasBF42A; pJW306 for ∆sasA; and pJW371 for relD264G) followed by transformation of pSS4332 for marker-less recombination50. Successful recombination was verified by PCR. For the construction of the (p)ppGpp0 mutant, ∆sasA ∆sasB cells were transformed with ∆rel::mls PCR product from genomic DNA using the oligos oJW902 and oJW903 followed by MLS resistance selection26. Construction of integration plasmid for sasBF42A was performed using site-directed mutagenesis of pJW370 by PCR using the oligos oJW2309 and oJW2310.

The (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R mutant was obtained from isolating suppressor mutants from (p)ppGpp0 cells by plating on S7 minimal medium plates containing 1% glucose. The surviving colonies were plated on S7 minimal medium plates containing 0.5% casamino acids and 0.5 mM 8-azaguanine, or S7 minimal medium plates containing 0.5% casamino acids and 0.1 mM guanosine26 to differentiate between mutants with mutations in hprT or gmk. Colonies that can grow on guanosine but not 8-azaguanine were sequenced to identify the mutant gmk allele. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to confirm that gmkQ110R is the only mutation in the strain.

The guaBdown mutant in the (p)ppGpp+ background was constructed by transformation of pJW30526, which replaces the chromosomal copy of guaB with an isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible copy of guaB (Pspac-guaB). This enables controllable guaB expression using IPTG during strain construction and growth to avoid generation of suppressors.

B. subtilis deletion mutants were constructed by serial transformation of PCR products from the B. subtilis knockout collection (BGSC, Gross laboratory)51. Where required, the lox-site-flanked ermR or kanR cassette was removed using pDR244-cre followed by selection for the loss of MLS or Kan resistance.

Construction of PlowGTP fluorescence reporters was done by fusion of PCR products containing the PlowGTP promoter (primers oJW1935 and oJW1936) with coding regions of fluorescence proteins (primers oJW1995 and oJW1996 (for GFP) or oJW2805 and oJW2806 (for mCherry)) using ligase cycling reaction (LCR)52. The promoter–fluorescence protein gene fusions were cloned into the pDR110 backbone flanked by amyE without the Pspank promoter for subsequent transformation.

For the construction of the PrrnBP1-GFPns (unstable GFP sequence described previously53) reporter, DNA fragments of PrrnBP1 (primers oJW2083 and oJW2084), GFPns (primers oJW1995 and oJW2020), the flanking regions of lacA (primers oJW1990 and oJW2414, and oJW2413 and oJW2082) and lox-site-flanked ermR cassette (primers oJW2133 and oJW2134) were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides or genome DNA. The resulting PCR products were fused by LCR followed by amplification using PCR to generate the linear recombination fragment of lacA::PrrnBP1-GFPns-lox-ermR-lox for transformation.

For the construction of PsasA-mCh reporter, DNA fragments of PsasA (primers oJW3099 and oJW3079), mCh (primers oJW2805 and oJW2806), the flanking regions of lacA (primers oJW1990 and oJW2414, and oJW2413 and oJW2082) and lox-site-flanked ermR cassette (primers oJW2133/oJW2134) were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides or genome DNA. The resulting PCR products were fused by LCR followed by amplification using PCR to generate the linear recombination fragment of lacA::PsasA-mCh-lox-ermR-lox for transformation.

For the construction of Pveg-GFP reporter, DNA fragments of Pveg (primers oJW3928 and oJW2806), GFP (primers oJW1995 and oJW1996), the flanking regions of lacA (primers oJW1990 and oJW2414, and oJW2413 and oJW2082) and lox-site-flanked ermR cassette (primers oJW2133 and oJW2134) were amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides or genome DNA. The resulting PCR products were fused by LCR followed by amplification using PCR to generate the linear recombination fragment of lacA:: Pveg-GFP-lox-ermR-lox for transformation.

Removal of the lox-site flanked ermR cassette was done by transformation with pDR244-cre and selecting for the loss of MLS resistance. All of the mutants and constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.

B. subtilis strains were grown in S7 defined medium54; MOPS was used at 50 mM rather than 100 mM, supplemented with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids. Growth of the YB886 strain background was supplemented with 20 µg ml−1 tryptophan and 50 µg ml−1 methionine. For growth in minimal medium, both glutamate and casamino acids were replaced with 200 µg ml−1 l-isoleucine, 200 µg ml−1 l-leucine and 200 µg ml−1 l-valine, and 1% carbon sources were used as indicated.

Routinely, cells from young colonies on overnight LB-agar plates at 37 °C (<12 h) were inoculated into growth medium and then grown at 37 °C with 250 rpm shaking. Cultures in logarithmic phase (optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of around 0.1–0.3) were treated with antibiotics or inducers, including arginine hydroxamate (RHX, 0.5 mg ml−1), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, 5 µM), sodium azide (NaN3, 4 mM) or arsenate (2.5 mM). IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce guaB expression from an IPTG-inducible promoter (Pspac), while depletion of guaB expression was done by omitting IPTG in the growth medium.

The following inducers and concentrations were used unless otherwise specified: RHX, 0.5 mg ml−1; CCCP, 5 μM; NaN3, 4 mM; arsenate, 2.5 mM; carbenicillin, 0.5 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 100 μg ml−1 (200× MIC); bacitracin, 64 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 384 μg ml−1 (3× MIC); ciprofloxacin, 0.1 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC); kanamycin, 0.625 μg ml−1 (0.3× MIC) or 8 μg ml−1 (8× MIC); vancomycin, 0.1 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC) along with the non-induction controls.

MICs for chloramphenicol, tetracycline, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, rifampicin, bacitracin and vancomycin were determined using the microdilution method55. Logarithmic-phase cells were back-diluted to a final titre of around 5 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml into 96-well plates containing twofold serial dilutions of respective antibiotics in S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids. After incubation for 16–20 h at 37 °C with 250 rpm shaking, the MIC was determined as the lowest drug concentration that prevented visible growth.

For growth measurement, fresh colonies of B. subtilis strains on LB agar were resuspended into different growth media as specified and diluted to OD600 ≈ 0.005 in 96-well plates. Growth was monitored by OD600 at 37 °C under shaking in the Synergy2 microplate reader (BioTek). Doubling times were estimated by fitting the growth data to the exponential growth curve using a custom Python script.

To prepare exponentially growing B. subtilis populations, cells from young colonies on overnight LB-agar plates at 37 °C (<12 h) were inoculated into S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids, and grown to OD600 ≈ 0.1–0.3 at 37 °C, 250 rpm. For growth in minimal medium, both glutamate and casamino acids were replaced with 200 µg ml−1 l-isoleucine, 200 µg ml−1 l-leucine and 200 µg ml−1 l-valine, and 1% carbon sources were used as indicated. Treatments with bactericidal antibiotics were performed at the following concentrations: ciprofloxacin, 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC); vancomycin, 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC); kanamycin, 8 μg ml−1 (8× MIC); and bacitracin, 384 μg ml−1 (3× MIC). To determine cell viability, culture aliquots were taken at T = 0 and at designated times after treatment, serially diluted and plated onto LB agar. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The viability at different timepoints, determined as the CFU per ml and relative survival (versus T0), was calculated.

For experiments involving pre-induction of cells with (p)ppGpp-inducing agents, cells were grown to OD600 ≈ 0.1 and divided into two cultures: one containing the inducing agent (RHX, 0.5 mg ml−1; bacitracin, 64 μg ml−1; CCCP, 5 μM; NaN3, 4 mM; arsenate, 12.5 mM) and other as a non-induction control. The cultures were grown for an additional 30 min under the same conditions (T = 0.5 h) and subjected to the persister assay, as described above.

In the case of measuring spontaneous persistence, we defined spontaneous persisters as those that are generated during growth in a non-stressed condition1,3. To achieve this, early-exponentially growing cultures were 1:100 back-diluted into fresh medium and regrown to exponential phase (OD600 ≈ 0.1–0.3) for one or two rounds followed by antibiotic treatment1.

For the estimation of population tolerance, we used the MDK99 (ref. 1). To exclude the contribution of persisters to population tolerance, we determined the level of persisters in the biphasic killing curve and subtracted this subpopulation from the bulk population. The MDK99 of the population was estimated from the logarithmic killing phase in the killing curve.

To measure intracellular nucleotides, cells were first collected from overnight plates, back-diluted to OD600 = 0.005 and grown in low-phosphate (0.1× phosphate, 0.5 mM) S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids. Once cultures reached OD600 ≈ 0.05, 1 ml cells was labelled with 50 µCi of 32P orthophosphate (900 mCi mmol−1; Perkin Elmer) for 2–3 generations before treatment or sampling. At OD600 ≈ 0.15, RHX, CCCP or arsenate were added to the cultures and the samples were collected at regular timepoints for nucleotide extraction. Nucleotides were extracted by incubating 100 µl cells with 20 µl of 2 M formic acid on ice for at least 20 min. The samples were spotted onto PEI cellulose TLC plates (Millipore, 1055790001) and resolved in 1.5 M or 0.85 M potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4, pH 3.4) buffer to separate (p)ppGpp or GTP, respectively. TLC plates were exposed on storage phosphor screens (GE Healthcare) and scanned on the Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare).

LC–MS quantification of nucleotides was performed as described previously21. Cells were grown in S750 medium supplemented with 20 amino acids21 to OD600 ≈ 0.3 at 37 °C, 250 rpm before collection. Then, 25 ml of cultures was sampled and filtered through PTFE membrane (Sartorius, 14555419). For experiments involving bacitracin induction, cells were collected before and after 0.25× MIC (sublethal) or 1.25× MIC (lethal) bacitracin treatment for 30 min. Membranes with cell pellets were submerged in 3 ml extraction solvent mix (on ice 50:50 (v/v), chloroform:water) to quench metabolism, lyse the cells and extract metabolites. Mixtures of cell extracts were centrifuged at 5,000g for 10 min to remove organic phase and then centrifuged at 20,000g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The samples were analysed using an HPLC–MS system, consisting of a Vanquish UHPLC system linked through electrospray ionization (ESI, negative mode) to the Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in full-scan mode to detect targeted metabolites based on their accurate masses. LC was performed on the Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Waters). The total run time was 30 min with a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1, using solvent A as denoted above and acetonitrile as solvent B. The gradient was as follows: 0 min, 5% solvent B; 2.5 min, 5% solvent B; 19 min, 100% solvent B; 23.5 min, 100% solvent B; 24 min, 5% solvent B; 30 min, 5% solvent B. Quantification of metabolites was performed using MAVEN software56 and normalized to the OD600 at the time of cell collection.

For LC–MS analysis of FACS-sorted cells, membranes with filtered cells (about 8 × 106 cells) were submerged in 1.5 ml extraction solvent mix (methanol:acetonitrile:H2O, 40:40:20) to quench metabolism, lyse the cells and extract metabolites. The cell extract was centrifuged at 21,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 1 ml of supernatant was then transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and dried completely with the SpeedVac. Dried metabolites were then resuspended in 100 μl solvent A (97:3 (v/v) water:methanol, 10 mM tributylamine ~pH 8.2–8.5 adjusted with ~9 mM acetic acid). The samples were analysed using an HPLC-MS system consisting of a Vanquish UHPLC system linked through heated electrospray ionization (ESI, negative mode) to a hybrid quadrupole high-resolution mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in full-scan selected ion monitoring (MS-SIM) mode to detect targeted metabolites on the basis of their accurate masses. MS parameters were set to a resolution of 140,000, an automatic gain control (AGC) of 3 × 106, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and a scan range of 400–1,000 m/z. Only ions with a retention time of 10–15 min were scanned by MS. LC was performed on the Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Waters). The total run time was 30 min with a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1, using solvent A and 100% acetonitrile as solvent B. The gradient was as follows: 0 min, 5% B; 2.5 min, 5% B; 19 min, 100% B; 23.5 min, 100% B; 24 min, 5% B; and 30 min, 5% B. Raw output data from the MS was converted to mzXML format using custom software. Quantification of metabolites was performed using MAVEN software56 and normalized to an internal standard of six most represented nucleotides detected in the sample.

To monitor (p)ppGpp induction using fluorescence reporters, cells were grown to OD600 ≈ 0.1–0.3 followed by 30 min induction with the following inducers at concentrations listed below unless otherwise specified: RHX, 0.5 mg ml−1; CCCP, 5 μM; NaN3, 4 mM; arsenate, 2.5 mM; carbenicillin, 0.5 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 100 μg ml−1 (200× MIC); bacitracin, 64 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 384 μg ml−1 (3× MIC); ciprofloxacin, 0.1 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC); kanamycin, 0.625 μg ml−1 (0.3× MIC) or 8 μg ml−1 (4× MIC); vancomycin, 0.1 μg ml−1 (0.5× MIC) or 4 μg ml−1 (20× MIC), along with the non-induction controls.

All of the imaging samples were spotted onto 1.5% agarose pads made with the same growth medium, and immediately imaged on the Olympus IX-83 inverted microscope (Olympus) using a ×60 phase-contrast objective with fluorescence filters (excitation: 470/20 nm, dichroic mirror: 485 nm, emission: 515/50 nm for GFP; excitation: 575/20 nm, dichroic mirror: 595 nm, emission: 645/90 nm for mCherry or propidium iodide; and excitation: 427/10 nm, dichroic mirror: 595 nm, emission: 472/30 nm for Sytox Blue). Metamorph Advanced (v.7.8.3.0) (Molecular Devices) was used for microscopy data collection. Single-cell time-lapse imaging was performed at 15 min intervals for each field at 37 °C using a temperature-controlled imaging chamber (Tokai Hit) coupled to an automatic stage and the microscope control as described previously57. The measurement was generally over the course from the birth of the cell until the time lapse stopped owing to crowding of the microcolony or, in rare cases, severe drifting of focus. When comparing phenotypes between strains, both strains were imaged in parallel on the same imaging dish using the same microscope with same settings. For imaging persister survival in time-lapse experiments, final concentrations of 5 μg ml−1 carbenicillin (10× MIC) and 200 nM Sytox Blue or propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) were applied to the agarose pads at designated times. To remove carbenicillin after treatment, 5 U ml−1 final concentration of penicillinase (Sigma-Aldrich, P0389) was applied. Strains without the fluorescence reporters were used for autofluorescence measurement.

B. subtilis biofilms were grown on a custom microfluidic device fabricated with polydimethylsiloxane. The device contains a central chamber connected to inlet and outlet media channels, allowing for constant medium flow through the central chamber. A semipermeable dialysis membrane was fixed on top of the central chamber to provide a platform for biofilm growth. This setup allows diffusion of nutrients or small molecules from the medium flow underneath to support biofilm growth on the membrane and allows subsequent treatment with antibiotics. To grow B. subtilis biofilms, 1 µl of early exponential phase culture (OD600 ≈ 0.05) was applied onto the membrane and grown at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 h under a constant flow of S750 medium supplemented with 0.5% glutamate and 0.5% glycerol.

Imaging of biofilms was performed with the IXplore SpinSR confocal imaging microscope (Olympus) using a ×20 phase-contrast objective with fluorescence filters (488 nm laser with 510–550 nm emission filter for GFP; 561 nm laser with 575–625 nm emission filter for mCherry). Biofilms at 24 h after inoculation were imaged before and after switching to the same growth medium containing 4 µg ml−1 vancomycin. In total, 51 stacks at 1 µm intervals were taken for each timepoint. Images were projected along the z axis from the top of the biofilm using maximum-intensity projection using cellSense Dimension v.2.2 (Olympus). For quantitation of reporter signals within the biofilm, we sampled around four random regions within the centre of the biofilm and measured their GFP and mCherry intensities. The background fluorescence was measured from regions without biofilm and used for background subtraction.

Flow cytometry was performed at the UWCCC flow cytometry core. To prepare samples for flow cytometry, cells from young colonies on overnight LB-agar plates at 37 °C (<12 h) were inoculated into and grown in S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids to OD600 ≈ 0.1–0.3 at 37 °C, 250 rpm. For growth in minimal medium, both glutamate and casamino acids were omitted and 1% carbon sources were used as indicated. Cells were immediately fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with 1× PBS and kept at 4 °C until analysis. Fixation was verified by viability plating and microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using the BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a 70 µm nozzle. BD FACSDiva v.8.0.2 was used for data collection. Cell populations were detected using both forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC). Single-cell fluorescence was measured using the 488 nm laser and detection filters for GFP (530/30 nm, 505LP dichroic filter). Autofluorescence was measured by analysing parental strains without the fluorescence reporter and subtracted from the raw reporter fluorescence. Approximately 1.5 million events were measured for each sample. For the determination of antibiotic-induced persistence, the frequency of low-GTP cells after antibiotic induction was subtracted from the frequencies before induction.

FACS was performed at the UWCCC flow cytometry core. To prepare samples for cell sorting, cells were collected from young colonies on overnight LB-agar plates at 37 °C (<12 h) and grown in S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids to OD600 ≈ 0.3 at 37 °C, 250 rpm. FACS analysis was performed using the BD FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) with a 70 µm nozzle at room temperature using the 488 nm laser and 530/30 nm detection filters for GFP, and the 561 nm laser and 610/20 nm detection filters for mCherry. BD FACSDiva v.8.0.2 was used for data collection. Autofluorescent cells were eliminated by gating using an isogenic strain without the fluorescent reporters. At least 1,000 cells were obtained from the rarest gate for each sample. Cell recovery rate was estimated to be >90% based on viability counting on LB plates. For antibiotic treatment, cells were directly sorted into tubes containing 4× MIC of vancomycin followed by shaking at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at different times for serial dilution and plating to measure survival by colony counting. The number of cells before treatment (T0) was measured using the cell sorter.

For FACS-sorting of cells for LC–MS analysis, cells containing the PlowGTP reporter were grown in S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids to either exponential (OD600 ≈ 0.2) or stationary (OD600 ≈ 4.0) phase. Both populations were mixed at a 10:1 ratio, and immediately FACS-sorted into low-fluorescence or high-fluorescence fractions. Autofluorescent cells were eliminated by gating using an isogenic strain without the fluorescent reporters. Approximately 8 × 106 cells were sorted and filtered on the PTFE membrane (Sartorius, 14555419) to remove the sheath fluid. Membranes with filtered cells were then subjected to metabolite extraction and LC–MS analysis. CFU count analysis was performed from a small aliquot of the sorted fractions to account for potential variations in the number of cells sorted between fractions.

The B. subtilis 168 transposon mutant library was provided by the Grossman laboratory58. Construction of the library was performed as follows. In brief, in vitro transposition of B. subtilis 168 genomic DNA (gDNA) with magellen6x transposon was performed by mixing 1.3 µg pCJ41 (containing magellen6x transposon), 34 ng purified MarC9 transposase, 5 µg B. subtilis gDNA, 10 µl 2× buffer A (41 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 19% glycerol, 187 mM NaCl, 19 mM MgCl2, 476 µg ml−1 BSA and 3.8 mM DTT) into a 20 µl reaction in vitro and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The transposed DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 2 µl 10× buffer B (500 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT), 2 µl 1 mg ml−1 BSA and 11 µl H2O followed by 4 h incubation at 37 °C. After incubation, 4 µl of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1 µl of 3U µl−1 T4 DNA polymerase were added to the DNA and further incubated for 20 min at 12 °C, followed by heat-inactivation at 75 °C for 15 min. Next, 0.2 µl 2.6 mM NAD and 1 µl of 10 U µl−1 E. coli DNA ligase were added and the reaction was incubated overnight at 16 °C. The resulting in vitro transposed and repaired gDNA was transformed into B. subtilis 168 and plated onto LB agar containing spectinomycin and incubated overnight. Colonies containing the transposon were washed off and pooled into a single library. The library was estimated to contain around 50,000 unique transposon inserts across the genome.

For the selection experiment with the transposon library, an aliquot of the library was inoculated and grown in S750 medium with 0.1% glutamate, 1% glucose and 0.5% casamino acids supplemented with tryptophan (20 µg ml−1) at 37 °C, 250 rpm. At OD600 ≈ 0.1–0.3, the cultures were treated with 20× MIC vancomycin or ciprofloxacin. Cultures before and after antibiotic treatment were plated onto LB plates and recovered after incubation for around 14 h at 37 °C. Around 650,000 colonies from each sample were pooled and snap-frozen for gDNA extraction and sequencing library preparation.

Preparation of the sequencing library was performed as previously described59. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 500 µl lysis buffer with lysozyme and RNase A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 120 µg ml−1 RNase A) and incubated at 37 °C for 20–30 min. Next, the incubated cell lysate was mixed with 60 µl 10% N-lauroylsarkosine and further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. gDNA was purified using 600 μl phenol, then 600 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and finally 600 µl pure chloroform. DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated using 1/10 volumes of 3 M NaOAc and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried on the bench and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and stored at 4 °C. For each sample, 6 µg of DNA was used for MmeI digestion in 200 µl (6 µg gDNA, 6 µl MmeI (2,000 U ml−1, NEB), 0.5 µl 32 mM S-adenosylmethionine, 20 µl NEB CutSmart Buffer and double-distilled H2O up to 200 µl). DNA was digested for 2.5 h at 37 °C, after which 2 µl calf intestinal phosphatase (10,000 U ml−1, NEB) was added to the digest and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Digested gDNA was extracted with 200 µl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by 200 µl of pure chloroform. DNA in the aqueous phase was first mixed with 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc and 67 ng ml−1 glycogen, and then 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. The tubes were then placed at −80 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. Precipitated DNA was washed with 150 µl 70% ethanol twice at room temperature, air-dried and resuspended in 15 µl of double-distilled H2O.

For annealing of the DNA adaptor, 20 µl of 100 µM synthesized oligos (IDT) were mixed with 1 µl of 41 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (final concentration of adaptor, 50 µM in 1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). Oligos were annealed by heat denaturation (95 °C for 5 min) and stepwise cool-down (94 °C for 45 s then repeat with −0.3 °C per cycle for 250 cycles, then hold at 15 °C) using a PCR machine. Annealed adaptors were diluted to 3.3 µM in double-distilled H2O and stored at −20 °C.

For adaptor ligation, 5 µl of digested DNA was mixed with 1 µl of 3.3 µM DNA adaptor, 1 µl of 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB), 1 µl of T4 DNA ligase (400,000 U ml−1, NEB) and 2 µl double-distilled H2O. The ligation mix was incubated overnight at 16 °C in a PCR machine.

Amplification of the adaptor-ligated DNA library was performed using barcoded primers and Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) for 18 cycles according to the provided instructions. The PCR products were mixed in equal amounts, purified by size exclusion and submitted for sequencing using the Illumina sequencing primer (5′-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′). Deep sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) system by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. Analysis of sequencing data was performed using a custom Python script and mapped to the B. subtilis 168 reference genome (NCBI: NC_000964.3). Visual inspection of transposon insertion profiles was done using GenomeBrowse (Golden Helix).

The plasmid for Rel purification was constructed as follows. The B. subtilis rel coding sequence was PCR amplified from NCIB3610 genomic DNA using the primers oJW3196 and oJW3197. The pE-SUMO expression vector was amplified using the primers oJW3194 and oJW3195. The PCR products were assembled to generate pJW753 by Golden Gate assembly (New England BioLabs). Plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.

To express His6–SUMO–Rel, fresh transformants of E. coli BL21 carrying pE-SUMO-rel were grown in LB at 37 °C to OD600 ≈ 0.5, followed by 1:50 dilution into Terrific Broth and grown at 30 °C until OD600 ≈ 1.5. His6–SUMO–Rel expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C until use. Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, DNase and cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche)), and lysed using a French press at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C, 16,000g for 30 min to obtain the supernatant. The filtered supernatant was injected into the ӒKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) and passed through the HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). His6–SUMO–Rel was eluted with a gradient of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole) and buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 500 mM imidazole). The fractions containing the protein were pooled with 300 µl SUMO protease into Spectra/Por dialysis tubing (Spectrum), and dialysed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol overnight. Rel without the His6–SUMO tag was passed through the HisTrap FF column and then purified by size exclusion using the Superose 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with the ӒKTA FPLC system. The fractions containing the Rel protein were pooled and measured for its concentration using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots were snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

In vitro pppGpp synthesis by Rel was monitored by measuring synthesis of radiolabelled pppGpp over time. The reaction contained 236 nM B. subtilis Rel, 0.05 µM [α32P]GTP, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM ATP in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, with or without 10 µM non-radioactive pppGpp. The reaction lacked manganese to avoid a potential effect of pppGpp hydrolysis. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 10 µl of the reaction was mixed with 2 µl of 2 M formic acid and chilled on ice for 20 min to quench the reaction. Then, 1 µl samples were spotted onto PEI cellulose TLC plates (Millipore, 1055790001) and resolved in 1.5 M potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4, pH 3.4) buffer to separate pppGpp. TLC plates were dried and exposed on storage phosphor screens (GE Healthcare) and scanned on the Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare).

For TLC experiments, nucleotide spots were quantified using ImageQuant v.5.0 (Molecular Dynamics). The raw intensities were corrected to the number of phosphates in the corresponding nucleotide and normalized to OD600 or ATP level before treatment (ATPT=0) for comparison between samples. For in vitro pppGpp synthesis assays, changes in pppGpp levels were normalized to T = 0.

Microscopy image analysis and cell parameters (cell area and fluorescence intensity) measurements were performed using Metamorph Advanced (v.7.8.3.0) (Molecular Devices). Background and autofluorescence were subtracted by comparing images obtained from identical strains without the fluorescence reporter. The single-cell specific growth rate (µ) at each frame was calculated using the equation \(\mu =\frac{1}{l}\frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}\), where l is the cell length, Δl is the change in cell length and Δt is the change in time (in min). Flow-cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo X (FlowJo); an example gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 14a. Cells within a narrow range of cell sizes were gated, subgated to filter cell aggregates and then measured for their fluorescence distribution. Autofluorescence was measured using isogenic strains without the fluorescent reporters and subtracted from raw reporter signals. Gating for PlowGTP-high cells was set at fivefold or higher above mean population fluorescence. This cut-off agrees with our FACS sorting experiment in which cells with reporter fluorescence above this threshold are predominantly persisters. For the determination of antibiotic-induced persistence, the frequency of low-GTP cells after antibiotic induction was subtracted from the frequencies before induction.

Statistical information of individual experiments is included in the figure legends. n represents the number of biological replicates or number of cells for experiments involving single-cell measurements as indicated in the legends. Significance was tested using unpaired two-tailed t-test or as specified in the figure legend. Confidence intervals were calculated based on binomial distribution. Prism 7 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis.

(a) Measuring tolerance from kill curve. The biphasic killing curve is composed of two phases: an initial killing phase (red) where the non-persister population dies rapidly upon antibiotic treatment, followed by an antibiotic-refractory phase (black) where persisters survive prolonged treatment. To measure tolerance of the bulk population, we subtracted the persister fraction from the population and estimated its MDK99 (minimum duration of killing for 99% cells) from the killing phase. (b-c) Tolerance (b) and persistence (c) of exponentially growing WT or (p)ppGpp0 mutant after 5 h vancomycin treatment. Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. p values were derived from unpaired two-tailed t-test.

(a) Vancomycin survival curves of WT cells after starvation or (p)ppGpp induction. stationary: stationary phase, RHX: pre-treated with amino acid starvation inducer arginine hydroxamate, +CCCP: pre-treated with ATP synthesis inhibitor CCCP, +As: pre-treated with ATP synthesis inhibitor arsenate. Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. (b) Vancomycin survival curves of (p)ppGpp0 after starvation or (p)ppGpp induction. RHX: pre-treated with amino acid starvation inducer arginine hydroxamate, +CCCP: pre-treated with ATP synthesis inhibitor CCCP, p-sasA or p-sasASyn: (p)ppGpp0 strains overexpressing the (p)ppGpp synthetase SasA or its synthetase-dead variant SasASyn (SasAD87G). Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. See also Supplemental Data Table 5 for a summary of resistance, tolerance and persistence in starvation-induced wild type and (p)ppGpp0 mutant.

(a) Schematic of Tn-Seq experiment. Transposon mutant library was grown to log phase followed by treatment with Vancomycin or Ciprofloxacin. Populations before and after treatment were sampled for sequencing library preparation and deep sequencing. In this assay, only insertions in non-essential or conditionally essential genes (due to availability of casamino acids) will be selected. (b) Genome-wide insertion profile from the experiment in (a), red box indicates enrichment of the pur operon disruptions after antibiotic treatment. (c) Pathway of de novo purine and GTP biosynthesis. Enriched gene disruptions in the pur operon and guaA from the Tn-Seq library screen were highlighted in cyan. Numbers in parentheses indicate relative enrichment of disruptions in log2 (vs before Vancomycin treatment). Overall, the insertions before the IMP step would all lower GTP and ATP synthesis, while guaA insertion would lower GTP but not ATP synthesis. guaB and gmk have been reported as essential genes and were not present in the library. (d) ATP and GTP levels of WT, ∆purB, ∆purL, ∆purF, and ∆guaA. Nucleotide levels were measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and normalized to OD600. Values represent mean and error bars indicate s.d. from three biological replicates. p values were derived from unpaired two-tailed t-test between WT and mutant pairs. (e) Vancomycin survival curves of WT, ∆purB, ∆purL, ∆purF, and ∆guaA. Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. Importantly, guaA deletion which only lower GTP but not ATP showed the same increase in persistence as the pur mutants. This implies that GTP depletion is critical to persistence.

(a-b) Vancomycin survival curves of WT, gmkQ110R,(p)ppGpp0, (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R, and guaB repressed mutant (guaBDown). WT and gmkQ110R kill curve in (b) was performed at 30⁰C to minimize the generation of suppressor mutant in gmkQ110R in (p)ppGpp+ background. Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. (c-d) GTP levels (c) and persister levels (d) of WT, gmkQ110R,(p)ppGpp0, (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R, and guaB repressed mutant (guaBDown). Nucleotide levels were measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and normalized to OD600. Values represent mean and error bars represent s.d. from three biological replicates. p values were derived from unpaired two-tailed t-test.

(a) Wild type cells containing the PlowGTP reporter were grown in minimal media with different carbon sources as indicated. Growth was monitored by OD600 measurement. Each curve represents a single replicate. (b) Survival curves of the populations in (a) to vancomycin treatment. (c) Distribution of cells with high PlowGTP fluorescence analysed using flow cytometry ( ~ 1.5×106 cells per sample per replicate, three biological replicates). Numbers indicate the fraction (%) of GFP-high cells. The fluorescence cut-off for GFP high cells was selected based on FACS and antibiotic treatment experiment that these high fluorescence cells display persistence phenotype (see Fig. 3a-b). (d) Panel of growth rates, tolerance, population PlowGTP fluorescence, frequency of high PlowGTP-GFP-high cells, and persistence to vancomycin treatment from the data in a-c. Values represent mean ± s.d., three biological replicates.

(a) Architecture of the PlowGTP reporter derived from the CodY regulatory regions in the ilvB promoter. Low GTP inactivates CodY binding thus de-repressing the promoter (that is reporter ON) and vice versa. It has been demonstrated that ilvB promoter activity is proportional to GTP over a physiologically relevant range in vitro38. Our previous transcriptome work showed that the ilvB promoter is responding almost exclusively to GTP levels in a variety of conditions and mutants in vivo37. Sequence of PlowGTP is included in Supplemental Table 4. (b) PlowGTP fluorescence in wild type or (p)ppGpp0 population during exponential growth in rich media with or without (p)ppGpp induction using arginine hydroxamate (RHX). Background fluorescence was subtracted using strains without the reporter. (c-d) Correlation of PlowGTP fluorescence versus (p)ppGpp (blue) and GTP (red) in wild type upon (p)ppGpp induction by amino acids starvation. PlowGTP fluorescence was determined using microscopy from averages of > 200 cells each from three biological replicates. AU stands for arbitrary units. (c) Nucleotide levels were measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and normalized to their levels before induction. R square was derived from linear regression from three biological replicates for each data point. (d) Nucleotide levels were measured by LC-MS and normalized to OD600. Values represent mean and error bars indicate s.d. from three biological replicates for each data point.

(a) Flow cytometry analysis of low GTP persisters in exponentially growing populations of wild-type and (p)ppGpp biosynthesis mutants containing the PlowGTP reporter ( ~ 1.5×106 cells each in triplicate). Numbers indicate the fraction (%) of GFP-high cells. ~1.5×106 cells in each sample. The fluorescence cut-off was chosen based on FACS and antibiotic treatment experiment that these high fluorescence cells display persistence phenotype (see Fig. 3a-b). (b) Correlation between persisters and GFP-high cells. Persister levels were determined from vancomycin kill curves in Supplemental Data Fig 4. Error bars indicate s.e.m., three biological replicates. Solid line indicates linear regression.

(a-l) Single cell traces of spontaneous persistence entrance plotted as growth rate against time in (a-i) wild type and (j-l) (p)ppGpp0 gmkQ110R mutant. Changes in PlowGTP reporter fluorescence (green) and growth rate (black) are shown. Persistence entrance in each trace is highlighted by the shaded area. Overall, we observed that, the first event in pre-persister is that PlowGTP reporter fluorescence (reflecting drop in GTP) increases, sometimes over several cell cycle (up to 120 min) while cells are growing at a normal rate without slowing down. Only as the fluorescence reaches a common threshold (on our microscope ~600 fluorescence unit), growth suddenly stopped within our 15 min observation window. If bacteria stop growth first, then we would see fluorescence increase only after growth cessation. This conclusion applies to all our cell trajectory measurements. The results suggest that GTP drop occurs before growth cessation, rather than GTP drops once bacteria stop growing.

(a) (Left) Example images of wild type cells containing the PlowGTP reporter before and after treatment with 200x MIC carbenicillin (CARB) and cell death dye propidium iodide (PI, magenta) for 2 h. (Right) Quantitation of PlowGTP fluorescence in survivors (PI-negative cells) before and after treatment. About ~300 survivors were counted. Scale bar: 10 µm. (b-c) Representative time-lapse images from three biological replicates of antibiotic-induced survival upon antibiotic treatment. Exponentially growing wild type cells containing the PlowGTP-GFP reporter (green) were allowed to grow in the absence of antibiotic followed by carbenicillin treatment with the cell death dye propidium iodide (PI, magenta). Antibiotic was removed by penicillinase treatment. Arrow indicates a cell that regrew after drug removal. Numbers indicate time in min. Scale bar: 10 µm. (c) Same experiment as (b) but with PlowGTP-mCherry reporter (red) and cell death dye sytox blue (cyan). Numbers indicate time in min. Scale bar: 10 µm.

How does low GTP lead to growth suspension and persistence? Although reduction of GTP levels elicits a fundamental change in transcription, the effect of depleting GTP is far beyond transcription. Low GTP is sufficient to broadly suspend diverse growth-determining cellular processes that utilize GTP, including DNA replication, rRNA synthesis, translation initiation and elongation, ribosome assembly, 100S ribosome dissociation, and potentially cell wall synthesis. In addition, since the majority of (p)ppGpp regulation on targets such as protein synthesis, rRNA maturation via ribosome-dependent GTPases, or DNA synthesis all stem from competition between (p)ppGpp and GTP binding to the enzyme active site, low GTP would exacerbate the inhibitory effect of (p)ppGpp on most (p)ppGpp targets. Since lethality of conventional antibiotics stems from deleterious disruption of these growth-associated processes, low GTP bacteria will be able to better survive antibiotic treatment. Therefore, persistence can be due to a global metabolic brake of multiple cellular processes triggered by low GTP. (p)ppGpp-GTP may also facilitate coordinated shut down of macromolecular synthesis, such as transcription and replication, to minimize detrimental conflicts. Finally, the growth suspension may also reduce generation of reactive oxygen species which have been implicated in antibiotic lethality. Contributions of these downstream effects require further investigation.

For over a decade, Sony has been taking direct aim at Bose's noise-cancelling domination. Every year or two, Japan's best and brightest engineers revise its flagship WH-1000 noise-canceling over-ears to beat out whatever the folks in Boston have cooked up, to great effect. The battle has led to some of the best headphones in history, with one or both brands topping our list of the best wireless headphones in nearly endless succession.

With Sony's new WH-1000XM6 (""1000X mark six”), we're now half a dozen iterations into a pair that began life as a good pair of headphones. This new version uses that experience to create something astonishing. You get a dramatically refined sound signature and streamlined design, you get 12 microphones and, Sony claims, seven times the processing speed of the previous model (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's enough to have even the famously superlative-averse brand calling the noise canceling offered by the WH-1000XM6—accurately, in my experience—the best noise canceling headphones on Earth.

If you are shopping for a pair of premium over-ears for work, travel, or just to escape your neighbor's annoying dog while you watch Netflix, these are probably the best all-around wireless headphones on sale right now. They cost $50 more at launch than their predecessors, but they're more than worth the extra cash.

There are two distinct eras of Sony's WH-1000 line visually, with the latest starting with a refined, streamlined look in the WH-1000XM5—abandoning the more businesslike Bose design it used for generations 1-4.

Visually, the latest version is even prettier than the model that came before, with clever folding earcups that help them fit more easily inside a streamlined hard case that now uses a magnetic clasp instead of a zipper.

It's a sleek hard-shell protector that comes with a clever pocket inside for cables and adapters like most high-end headphones offer these days. A slightly protruding clasp at the edge of the case keeps it from ever tumbling open.

On the headphones themselves, it's all about subtlety. Even the Sony logo is somewhat hidden on the side of the headband, rather than prominently featuring on an earcup like you'd see in most headphones in this price range—heck, Focal even goes so far as to put a light behind its logo so folks know how fancy you are.

There isn't much in the way of visible controls either; you'll find a power button on the bottom of the left earcup, with a button that adjusts the noise-canceling setting that's a different shape (for easily remembering which is which) above it. On the bottom of the left earcup you'll find a 3.5 mm port for wired listening. The USB-C charging port is on the bottom right.

As usual, the majority of the playback controls come in the form of touch controls on the right earcup, where you can swipe back and forth to change songs, tap to play and pause, and swipe up or down to adjust volume. Most touch-based controls are woeful when compared to clever physical counterparts like the cool bezel you'll find on Apple's AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but these are the best in the business. In multiple days of testing I didn't have the usual misfires and mishaps that often come with a system that lacks physical feedback. I have a theory that Sony simply makes its touch pad larger than competitors in the space, thus allowing more flexibility in use, but I have yet to pry one of these very much non-replaceable earcups open to see if I'm right.

Speaking of: At first, I was convinced that the new pleather earpads weren't replaceable. They are, they just latch a bit below where you think they might inside the earcups with plastic tabs, providing the clean look you see on from the outside of the headphones. It's clever, and it likely works to help provide even better passive noise isolation.

The earpads aren't the most comfortable things in the world, especially when compared to higher-end offerings like the Focal Bathys MG (9/10, WIRED Recommends), which come with such fine leather you'd imagine it being sewn into King Charles' dress shoes. These are somewhat cheap-feeling and rubbery faux leather, but they do have very comfortable memory foam that ensures a soft seal around your ears. The non-leather is a good choice for durability, and is shockingly resistant to sweat, which I found out while spreading a fresh layer of mulch around my raspberries.

The headband, however, does leave a bit to be desired. I found it to be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours of solid listening, which is something I can't say about the previous model. Maybe it's a head-shape thing, but I feel there could be a bit more padding.

The eight microphones on the outside of the two earcups and four inside the earcups do an excellent job of parsing what is going on in the outside world, and when paired with the increased processing power of the WH-1000XM6, they create a staggering level of silence. I was routinely terrified by my wife or dog sneaking up on me while at work, and things like my riding lawn mower and HVAC system were rendered mute.

The increased speediness of the processing is particularly noticeable in the high end, where the fast frequencies are harder to tame than lower, slower sounds. Even my bright and clicky mechanical keyboard was hardly a match for the WH-1000XM6. You can hear them with nothing playing, but the noise disappears as soon as even the lightest music or podcast starts playing.

I didn't have time to take these on a flight during my short review period, but I did play hours of plane and HVAC noises at real-world decibels through my studio monitors while listening to music on them, and they proved to be more capable than any headphones I've ever tested in dealing with those sounds. It's almost shocking how well they do with a low hum like that of a robovac—I kept accidentally bumping into the moving puck on my floor when wandering around the house with these on, forgetting it was active at all.

Hearthrough functionality is extremely lifelike, which makes these great for putting on music at low volumes and still hearing what's going on around you. Likewise, call quality from the microphones, and especially the ability to isolate your voice amidst a dense background, is great. The work great on Zoom calls.

Sound quality is something I never fell fully head over heels in love with in previous generations of the WH-1000X, but these come closest to my platonic ideal of studio-style flatness with a tinge of high and low end boost to add a bit more fun to more tepid mixes. I have been enjoying the slurry lo-fi vibes of BRONCHO's latest record, particularly the song “Dreamin,” on these headphones. I still have essentially no idea what half of the words—which are definitely in English, the language I speak—are thanks to the layered vocal mixing and delivery, but I love the way the acoustic guitars come through at the edges, and the punchy kick drum in the very center of the stereo image.

Everything feels accurate, but there is a certain joy to the musical reproduction coming from the redesigned dynamic drivers inside these headphones that I was missing on older Sony headphones. Classics like The Marshall Tucker Band's “Can't You See” come through with smooth tape warmth, perfectly layered bass, and a searing, gravely vocal.

The WH-1000XM6 use noise canceling create a perfectly silent musical backdrop with which to enjoy your favorite music. If you shut your eyes you really can go anywhere with no distractions, as long as the volume is up above about one quarter, and you're not standing dangerously close to a running jet engine. This is the type of total audio separation I could only have dreamed of with the first model.

Sony has spatial audio on board, so you can also use these to great effect with movies while traveling. I thoroughly enjoyed watching a few episodes of Andor season 2 with them—the excellent low end is particularly noticeable on explosions and during other heavy-action effects.

App-based controls let you dial in said spatial effect, and you can also adjust noise canceling, transparency, and equalization settings inside the app—relatively standard fare for any modern headphones.

One unique Sony feature I love is that you can still cup your hand over the right earcup to temporarily pause your media and pipe in outside sound, which is awesome on airplanes when you don't want to take your headphones off to give a drink order, or to hear an announcement in the airport.

Sony really has made these some of the easiest to use headphones on the market. Pairing is nearly instant, you have multi-point Bluetooth for connecting to your phone and laptop or tablet at the same time, and 30 hours of battery life is more than enough for any journey, especially with quick charging that can give you 3 hours of power in 3 minutes.

The most annoying thing in my testing? It took me a couple tries to get used to folding the headphones the proper way to put them back in the case. You learn the method—place the left earcup pad-side down in the case, then fold it over—pretty quickly, but it's not as intuitive as you'd think from such a streamlined pair of headphones.

Otherwise? These sound better than the latest Bose model, offer better noise canceling, and are generally better to use. Compared to the equivalently priced AirPods Max, all those things are also true, except that you might be enough of an iOS stan that the AirPods integrate better into your ecosystem. In any case, I'd strongly recommend you check out a pair of Sony's new flagship headphones before you make a purchasing decision. They're one of the finest wireless pairs of headphones ever made.

The Moto X from 2013 was one of my favorite smartphones of all time. Motorola, owned by Google back then, debuted a build-a-phone workshop that let you customize the handset's design, from changing the color on the front and back to adding different accents for the buttons. You could even throw in a signature for an extra dose of personalization.

That kind of playful nature remains elusive in the smartphone world, but there are glimpses thanks to companies like Nothing and Motorola. Case in point: the new Razr 2025 family, consisting of the Razr Ultra, Razr+, and Razr. Motorola could have taken the Samsung approach and kept the ordinary glass-slab design we're used to for its folding phones, but no. The Razr Ultra lets you choose between Alcantara, wood, leather-inspired, and satin-inspired designs. The base Razr comes in bright, punchy colors, with acetate, nylon, or leather-inspired finishes.

I have the Pantone Spring Bud Razr, a leather-inspired mint green color—my wife's eyes lit up when she saw it (and asked if she could take a bite, naturally). Even my hard-to-impress dad stoically said, “It's a nice color.” I love the FSC-certified Pantone Mountain Trail on the Razr Ultra even more, which is a real wood back that exudes class. Guess what? The original Moto X had a wood back, too. They might not be customizable, but these Razrs look great, feel great, and there's nothing that looks like 'em.

The Razr 2025 lineup is not wholly different from last year's models. Quite literally, the Razr+ 2025 ($1,000) is almost the same as the Razr+ 2024, now with the company's titanium-reinforced hinge plate for better durability. Its specs are identical, which is likely why Motorola didn't bother sending a review unit. Instead, I've been testing the Razr 2025 ($700) and the Razr Ultra ($1,300).

Adding a third entry into the Razr lineup adds unnecessary complexity, so I'm adding a spec table here to help you make sense of these devices. Essentially, the Razr Ultra is the best of the best, with the latest flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, higher storage and RAM options, the biggest battery, faster charging speeds, a dedicated AI button, and even a more durable ceramic glass screen. It also has better cameras and is the only one that offers Dolby Vision video recording for richer colors in your footage. The Razr+ sits a rung below, though its battery life is its weakness since it has the smallest capacity, and the Razr remains one of the cheapest folding flip phones.

Performance is excellent, though this is more meaningful on the base Razr model, which has given me some choppy performance in prior models. You might still see some stutters here and there on the $700 phone, but it's sparse, and overall, I've been quite happy with it. The displays—external and internal—have been high notes on both phones, even if I prefer the slightly larger screens on the Razr Ultra. They get plenty bright, and the high refresh rates make everything appear fluid.

The battery capacities between the Razr Ultra and Razr aren't too different, and my results were unsurprisingly similar. These phones lasted me a full day with 25 to 30 percent remaining by bedtime with average use. If your screen time extends past five or six hours, you'll more than likely need to recharge the phone in the middle of the day (wired or wirelessly).

One improvement I'd like to see in future versions (which I have mentioned before) revolves around opening the phone. It might just be my short fingernails and thick thumbs, but it's a small struggle to wedge a finger into the gap one-handed and unfold the Razr. A small lip would help. Thankfully, you can make the external displays even more functional without constantly opening the phone, with new widget panels for glanceable information.

There's less of a crease on the interior display, though it's still noticeable when viewed at an angle, and you can feel it when your finger glides over, but I've never had a problem with it. The phone is tougher overall—the IP48 rating helps make it more dust resistant than before—and the hinge feels sturdy. I've dropped the Ultra twice onto my wood floors, and I don't see a scratch.

It bears repeating, but the number one benefit of a folding flip phone is that it's a fantastically tiny phone. I love that I can grip the whole thing with my palm and still interact with it, and then get the benefits of a full-size smartphone screen when I need it. I'll take this over an ultra-thin and ultra-light smartphone any day.

The cameras showcase the biggest difference between the Razr and Razr Ultra. You'll see richer details, better exposure, and nicer skin tones on the Ultra, whereas the Razr often has more noise and generally looks a smidge more processed. Low-light photos still require you to be very still, even on the Ultra, but they deliver solid photos that are sharp and colorful. The results don't match up to the quality of similarly priced phones, like the Pixel 9a or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, but that's par for the course.

What's most bizarre is the camera app itself. Motorola still hasn't figured out a way to enable Night mode automatically when it detects you're shooting in low light, a staple feature on most phones. You have to manually go to the “More” tab to find it, and that's where you can drag it to your camera menu. Most people aren't going to do that. (It also still doesn't support Night mode for selfies, though it relies on flashing the screen to compensate.)

Even stranger is that the new Group Shot feature on the Ultra, which selects the best frame so that no one is blinking in group photos, is a dedicated mode hidden in the same “More” tab. Google has a similar feature called Best Take on its Pixel phones, but it's a post-capture feature, so you can fix a photo quickly if you notice someone blinked. I'm not sure how many people will remember to switch to Group Shot mode when trying to snap a fast selfie with friends.

If you film videos a lot with your phone, the Ultra offers a big jump in video quality over the Razr. The Ultra has Dolby Vision video capture, though you need to manually enable it (again, why?). Using the Camcorder Mode, which lets you hold the phone like an old-school camcorder to record, the quality difference was noticeable between the two devices. The Ultra's footage was sharper, smoother, more color-accurate, and didn't blow out in high-contrast scenes, whereas the Razr had super-grainy clips, especially in low light.

Motorola spent a lot of time talking up the AI features in its phones during the launch. Perplexity! Gemini! Copilot! Moto AI! I have to be blunt: I did not care much for any of this. None made a meaningful difference in my life, except for Pay Attention—once enabled, it kickstarts a recording session with real-time transcription, and offers a summary after the recording is over. I like that you can enable this in “tent mode” so the screen faces you. It worked pretty well when I used it during a meeting, but it's also a standard feature now available on most high-end phones.

Motorola's Catch Me Up AI notification summaries proved useless when half of my notifications are just people sending me Instagram Reels to watch. When you do have normal notifications, it does a decent job of summarizing everything, though I don't see how the summary is that much faster than reading the source directly. Maybe I don't get as many notifications as I thought.

Then there's Remember This, which feels a little clunky. Half the time, I can't remember what I asked it to remember (Remembrall, much?), and I have to go to a Settings menu in the Moto AI app to find my list of Memories. Why this isn't a primary tab in the app, I don't know. This feature requires a little re-wiring of how you use your phone, because asking an AI assistant to remember something is not something I've done before.

Having just reviewed the Minimal Phone, I took two pictures of it sitting on my desk with the Razr Ultra, and asked Moto AI to remember each. With the first shot, I didn't add any supplementary information, and with the second, I wrote in that it was the “Minimal Phone.” Later, when I asked Moto AI what phone I took a picture of, it said I took a picture of the Unihertz Jelly Titan (which I do not own), and then it said it didn't know what model the phone in the second picture was, even though I provided a name. So useful!

You'll see a lot of marketing for these AI features, but they're not the reasons to buy the Razr or Razr Ultra. Buy them if you want a small and gorgeous phone—a device with real character that's not just another glass slab.

Three years after it was first announced, and following two missed launch promises, with no comment from Apple on when it would actually show up, CarPlay 2 will finally be available in a matter of weeks. And now, it's called CarPlay Ultra.

Aston Martin has announced it will be the first car manufacturer to actually deliver Apple's long-awaited next-gen in-car experience, with any of its vehicles ordered in the US or Canada from today shipping with CarPlay Ultra installed as standard.

Current Aston owners will also be able to get the Ultra update from their dealerships in June, but the car must be running the marque's most recent infotainment system to make the switch, which launched back in 2023. Owners will also need an iPhone 12 or later running iOS 18.54 or later.

The first look at Apple CarPlay Ultra in the driving seat in Aston's DBX.

Current cars that meet this criteria include the Aston Martin DBX SUV, alongside its core sports car models—Vanquish, Vantage, and DB12. This update will also be for US and Canadian owners only for now, but a full market rollout is expected over the next 12 months.

As we saw when it was teased at WWDC in 2022, CarPlay Ultra will see Apple's ecosystem extend from the main infotainment screen to the instrument cluster, merging with the automaker's design language for a more consistent look and feel across the board.

Drivers can finally have their iPhone nav directions appear in front of them as the new CarPlay interface stretches across multiple screens.

It means that along with core car features such as Aston Martin's on-screen speedometer and tachometer dials, you can also have your Apple Music playlist or Google Maps directions in front of you as you drive. Things like tire pressure monitors and air-con controls will also at last be able to sit within the CarPlay interface.

This is all supposedly fully customizable, from the instrument cluster theme down to the color scheme, offering both car brands and drivers the ability to build and curate their own multiscreen setup for the things that matter most to them while driving.

The new software displays speed, gear selection, rpm, tire pressures, and more on the driver screen.

Of course, if you prefer physical buttons, they're still available for functions, provided the car in question has them already, of course. Siri will again be on hand when you prefer to bark commands at a voice assistant. However, how next-generation Siri will precisely work in CarPlay Ultra, as Apple's AI tech develops, remains unclear—but from launch, essentially, the tech mirrors the phone experience. That means if you have ChatGPT-powered Apple Intelligence enabled on your iPhone, the in-car UI will ask for a voice command to shunt a query to Open AI's model or stick with on-device Siri.

Conversely, in what could be seen as unfortunate timing for Apple, Google beat the news of CarPlay Ultra to the punch with the announcement of Gemini for cars just a few days ago—and we've already got more detail on how Gemini will enhance the driving experience than we have on Siri at this point.

This includes helping you craft text messages on the go, find good restaurants en route, and even brainstorm on the way to a meeting. Gemini will roll out to Android Auto cars over the next few months, likely appearing in myriad car brands well before CarPlay Ultra.

Core car controls now sit within the CarPlay Ultra experience, such as the car's HVAC system.

As for CarPlay Ultra, it had been confirmed a while ago that Aston Martin would be one of the first manufacturers to feature Apple's next-gen experience, with Porsche expected to follow. Audi, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis are also thought to be on board to take the tech. Mercedes-Benz, however, has remarked that handing over control of its cockpit head unit to someone else “was a no.”

As CarPlay fans await confirmation from more manufacturers about rollout dates for Ultra in their vehicles—not to mention finally getting to see it in action—it'll be interesting to see if Mercedes-Benz bows to consumer pressure and becomes one of them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","US Tech Visa Applications Are Being Put Through the Wringer","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-immigration-visa-secrutiny-tech/","Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Since the end of January, Ryan Helgeson, a Chicago-based immigration attorney, has noticed an unusual trend: He's been getting significantly more pushback from US Citizenship and Immigration Services as he files employment visa petitions on behalf of his foreign-born clients.

Helgeson's firm, McEntee Law Group, represents tech workers who hope to emigrate or remain in the US by way of visas granted for specialty occupations or extraordinary abilities. On average, Helgeson's firm files 50 to 75 visa petitions per month. This goes up to as many as 90 per month at the height of “H-1B season,” when employers enter a lottery for visas on behalf of foreign workers, and candidates then file a formal petition. During his many years of practicing law, Helgeson and his team have occasionally received requests for additional evidence, or RFE's, from USCIS, as a part of the agency's process for vetting applicants.

But since Donald Trump took office and began cracking down on immigration, Helgeson says, there has been “an absolute increase in the number and rate of RFE's” on the visa petitions he has filed. That tracks with what three other immigration attorneys told WIRED. Whether their clients are applying for H-1B visas, O-1 extraordinary ability visas, intracompany visas for foreigners looking to move to a US office, or visas specific to traders and investors, USCIS has been seeking an increased amount of information from applicants.

This includes more requests for letters of support, certificates of education, and biometric data, immigration lawyers tell WIRED. Some of the pushback is based on “adverse information” about the applicant or an applicant failing to update their address, lawyers say. But other RFE's are redundant, requesting information that has already been provided. In some cases, attorneys are struggling to determine what else USCIS could be seeking.

“The tone of the requests for evidence has remained the same, but the whole process is overtly more hostile,” Helgeson says. These requests from USCIS can double the amount of time it takes for a visa to be processed, he adds.

It's also expensive to resubmit visa petitions. Matt Doyle, a British-born tech entrepreneur living in Austin, Texas, and one of McEntee Law Group's clients, recently had his EB-1 visa application denied. Now he's having to reapply. Doyle will pay another $4,000 to the government to expedite his reapplication, on top of the $20,000 he says he has already spent in legal fees for him and his family. For now, the law firm is waiving any additional fees.

“I was approved on two out of the three criteria, and they acknowledged [my company's] innovation and uniqueness, but they didn't feel the evidence showed broader impact,” Doyle says. The entrepreneur is now soliciting several additional letters of support from customers and colleagues. He's paying to expedite the process, he says, in the hopes that his visa gets approved before his current extension expires this fall.

“In the 30-plus years combined of me and my legal partner practicing immigration law, we have seen more denials in cases like Matt's within the past few weeks than we had cumulatively seen before in our careers,” Helgeson says.

Immigration lawyers and technologists are concerned that a more restrictive visa process could limit the talent pipeline in Silicon Valley. Around 66 percent of tech workers in the Valley are foreign-born, according to the think tank Joint Venture Silicon Valley. US tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are some of the largest recipients of H-1B visas.

H-1B visas are for newly-employed, high-skilled workers. First introduced in 1990, the visas are issued for three years and allow a worker to extend by three years. The allotment is capped at 65,000 per year, with an additional 20,000 available for workers with a master's degree or higher. Workers from India make up the overwhelming majority of H-1B petitioners—73 percent—while workers from China and Hong Kong are the next largest group, at 12 percent.

Proponents of the H-1B say it's a way to fill highly specialized roles within US companies and help those companies remain competitive. Critics say it undercuts the US job market and that the petition process is rife with fraud. During his first presidential run, Trump lambasted the H-1B visa as part of a system that took jobs from Americans and vowed to “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.”

During the Biden administration, H-1B applications jumped up 61 percent, and USCIS began investigating whether multiple applications were being filed for the same visa. Shortly before Biden left office, his administration attempted to modernize the H-1B visa by expanding eligibility categories and speeding up the application process, while also allowing immigration officials to defer to previous approvals on visa extensions. In theory, this would reduce the need for requests for evidence.

The influence of immigrant founders on Silicon Valley is undeniable. Several tech unicorn founders and top CEOs are immigrants, including Sergey Brin, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Max Levchin, and perhaps most famously, Elon Musk. Musk, Trump's unofficial adviser, has expressed support for bringing in outside talent to the US. So has Sriram Krishnan, a former partner at Andreessen Horowitz and currently one of Trump's AI advisers, who posted on X in November that “anything to remove country caps for green cards / unlock skilled immigration would be huge.” The following month, Trump softened his tone on H-1B's: “I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them,” he told the New York Post.

But in the absence of any official policy directives on employment or skill-based visas, and amid a broader crackdown on immigration in the US, attorneys and technologists believe that the administration's hard-line approach is beginning to impact the tech sector.

In late April, Pejman Nozad, an Iranian American who runs a Palo Alto venture capital firm called Pear VC, posted on X that “too many Pear VC founders are getting their visas challenged—and it's downright absurd. Entrepreneurs build America, so let's open the doors for innovators, not shut them!” Nozad tagged Musk and David Sacks, a South African–born venture capitalist and Trump's AI and crypto czar. (Nozad declined to elaborate on his remarks when contacted by WIRED, saying that the founders he was referring to were too nervous to speak out.)

Aizada Marat, a lawyer and cofounder of the firm Alma Immigration in Menlo Park, California, says her firm processes “hundreds” of visa petitions per month, including extraordinary ability visas like the O-1 visas and EB-1. Marat says that her firm has seen a recent jump in RFEs, estimating that last year 8 percent of petitions were sent back with RFEs and that this year, the number has nearly doubled.

“It's alarming,” Marat says.

Marat recently filed an O-1 visa petition on behalf of a client who was a board member of a national bank in their home country and who had raised venture capital funding from well-known angel investors and VCs in order to start a company in the US. She says the person's accomplishments were well-documented in the press. USCIS rejected their application—twice—due to a supposed lack of evidence, Marat says. She resubmitted a third time, and the visa was later granted. If it had been denied again, she planned to sue USCIS.

“We suspect the agency is just rejecting certain petitions without reading through them first, and asking for more evidence right off the bat,” Marat says. “It has definitely changed since the [2024 US presidential] election.”

Nell Barker, a partner and immigration lawyer at the Chicago-based firm Kempster, Corcoran, Quiceno & Lenz-Calvo, works with academics and tech workers filing for visas. She recently received a request for more information on a postdoctoral researcher who was applying for an H-1B. She says USCIS was seeking more evidence certifying that the person's degree supported their work in the field. “If the person is a postdoc in physics, they likely studied physics,” Barker says dryly.

Another client of Barker's who was petitioning for an H-1B received notice that USCIS couldn't process the application until the client presented in person at an application support center and submitted their biometric data, including a photograph and fingerprint scan. Barker says this request for biometrics is standard for many types of visa applications, including green cards, but it's “new for I-129 applicants,” meaning employer-led visa petitions.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization with more than 16,000 members, recently acknowledged the uptick in RFEs. In early May, the AILA put out a practice advisory to its members, telling them that “while the information being requested on RFEs may appear duplicative, RFEs must still be responded to in order to prevent any application or petition denials.”

USCIS told the AILA that “as part of the Trump administration's commitment to restoring integrity to our immigration system, we are increasing the screening and vetting of all aliens filing for immigration benefits and reserve the right to request additional information and conduct additional security checks at any point in the immigration lifecycle,” according to a copy of the advisory viewed by WIRED. The agency said that collecting beneficiary information and biometric data is a necessary part of USCIS's efforts to promote national security and public safety and to mitigate fraud.

In a statement to WIRED, USCIS Spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser reiterated the remarks given to AILA.

Some lawyers say that the jump in RFEs is unsurprising: It happened with certain visa categories during Trump's first term, too. The Massachusetts law firm Parker Gallini noted that from 2016 through 2021 the RFE rate for H-1B's doubled, based on USCIS data. H1-B final approvals also dropped to 85 percent, down from 94 percent, during Trump's first term. But other visa categories, like the one for extraordinary abilities, only saw single-digit increases in RFEs during Trump's first term, and RFE's actually rose from 26 percent during Trump's term to 31 percent during the early months of Biden's presidency.

While requests for evidence from USCIS appear to be on the rise again, it's too soon to determine if outright visa denials will increase as well. Still, immigration attorneys say, the effects of a more stringent petition process are already being felt by their clients.

“I do think a lot of what the administration is doing, between a surge in RFEs, USCIS staff cuts, and erratic immigration policies, is a deterrent for both foreign talent and US employers,” says Ayda Akalin, a Los Angeles–based lawyer at LandUS Law who has also encountered more RFEs in her practice. “And this is ultimately bad for the US economy and harmful to American companies, particularly those in tech and the creative industries.”

Helgeson also believes this will have a “chilling effect” on the US tech industry, especially for young people who might have once found their way into the US through the education system and remained in the US on specialty visas to build companies.

“A lot of people are reconsidering right now whether they want to deal with this uncertainty,” he says. “If the administration gets its way, the US risks becoming a technological backwater. And the talent will just drain.”

Last August, KJ Muldoon was born with a potentially fatal genetic disorder. Just six months later, he received a Crispr treatment designed just for him.

Muldoon has a rare disorder known as CPS1 deficiency, which causes a dangerous amount of ammonia to build up in the blood. About half of babies born with it will die early in life. Current treatment options—a highly restrictive diet and liver transplantation—aren't ideal. But a team at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine was able to bypass the standard years-long drug development timeline and use Cripsr to create a personalized medicine for KJ in a matter of months.

“We had a patient who was facing a very, very devastating outcome,” says Kiran Musunuru, professor for translational research at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who was part of the team that made KJ's treatment.

When KJ was born, his muscles were rigid, he was lethargic, and he wouldn't eat. After three doses of his custom treatment, KJ is starting to hit developmental milestones his parents never thought they'd see him reach. He's now able to eat certain foods and sit upright by himself. “He really has made tremendous strides,” his father Kyle Muldoon says.

The case is detailed today in a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine and was presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy annual meeting in New Orleans. It could provide a blueprint for making customized gene-editing treatments for other patients with rare diseases that have few or no medical treatments available.

When the body digests protein, ammonia is made in the process. An important enzyme called CPS1 helps clear this toxic byproduct, but people with CPS1 deficiency lack this enzyme. Too much ammonia in the system can lead to organ damage, and even brain damage and death.

Since KJ's birth, he has been on special ammonia-reducing medicines and a low-protein diet. After receiving the bespoke Crispr drug, though, KJ was able to go on a lower dose of the medication and start eating more protein without any serious side effects. He's still in the hospital, but his doctors hope to send him home in the next month or so.

Both KJ's parents and his medical team stop short of calling the Crispr therapy a cure, but they say it's promising to see his improvement. “It's still very early, so we will need to continue to watch KJ closely to fully understand the full effects of this therapy,” says Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, director of the Gene Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Disorders Frontier Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn Medicine, who led the effort with Musunuru. She says the Crispr treatment probably turned KJ's severe deficiency into a milder form of the disease, but he may still need to be on medication in the future.

Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru teamed up in 2023 to explore the feasibility of creating customized gene-editing therapies for individual patients. They decided to focus on urea cycle disorders, a group of genetic metabolic conditions that affect the body's ability to process ammonia that includes CPS1 deficiency. Often, patients require a liver transplant. While the procedure is possible in infants, it's medically complex. Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru saw an opportunity to find another path.

When KJ was born, the researchers used genome sequencing to determine the specific genetic mutation driving his disease. It turns out KJ had actually inherited two different mutations in the CPS1 gene—one from each parent. The team decided to target the mutation that had been reported before in an unrelated patient known to have severe CPS1 deficiency; the other hadn't been seen before.

KJ's team turned to Crispr, the Nobel Prize-winning technology that can precisely edit DNA. So far, only one Crispr-based medicine is commercially available. Approved in late 2023, it treats sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Other Crispr-based therapies are in development for more common diseases that affect tens or hundreds of thousands of patients.

The allure of Crispr is its potential to directly address the underlying genetic cause of a disease rather than simply treat symptoms, as the vast majority of current medicine does. The approved Crispr therapy, Casgevy, is given as a one-time treatment. But the Philadelphia-led team specifically designed KJ's therapy to be redosable out of safety concerns, starting with a low dose to ensure there were no adverse effects. Terry Horgan, a 27-year-old with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, passed away in 2022 shortly after receiving the first known custom Crispr treatment. His death was likely due to a reaction to the virus used to deliver the Crispr molecules.

For KJ's treatment, researchers used a version of Crispr called base editing that can change one “letter” in a DNA sequence to another. They packaged the base-editing components in tiny bubbles called lipid nanoparticles, which were then delivered via an IV infusion.

Before it could be given to KJ though, it was tested for safety in mice and monkeys. Since the drug was unapproved, the team needed permission from the Food and Drug Administration to use the experimental treatment in an individual patient. The researchers applied to the FDA on February 14 and received approval on February 21. They gave KJ his first dose on February 25.

“The clinical responses described are impressive,” says Timothy Yu, a neurologist at Boston Children's Hospital who wasn't involved in making KJ's treatment. He says the Philadelphia team's approach was a “very thoughtful and comprehensive end-to-end process.”

Yu's lab has been working on customized genetic medicines based on antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs—short molecules that block the production of proteins. Yu developed a personalized ASO in 10 months for a young girl with Batten disease, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The treatment was dubbed milasen, after the patient, Mila. It was the first medicine that was tailor-made to treat a single patient's genetic mutation. The treatment temporarily improved Mila's condition and quality of life, but ultimately, she died in February 2021 at 10 years old.

“The superpower of Crispr base editing is its broad applicability to many types of genetic mutations. Its kryptonite is that we are in the very early days of demonstrating efficient and safe Crispr delivery to many different organs,” Yu says. ASOs, meanwhile, are well vetted for use in the brain, spinal cord, and eye, which are more difficult to address with Crispr.

Crispr could potentially address a variety of genetic diseases and types of cancer, but getting it to the right place in the body remains a challenge. The approved Crispr medicine, Casgevy, involves removing a patient's cells and editing them outside the body, an arduous and expensive process. A drug given directly to the body would be much more practical. The liver is an easy first target because lipid nanoparticles naturally gravitate there, but only some diseases can be treated in this way.

Since urea cycle disorders primarily originate in the liver, they could be a prime target for custom Crispr medicines. “We've just written a new playbook,” says Fyodor Urnov, scientific director at the Innovative Genomics Institute at UC Berkeley, who collaborated on the paper.

Urnov says KJ's case demonstrates that bespoke genetic treatments can be made quickly and used successfully to treat critically ill patients. “This could have failed in so many ways,” he says. “Nothing was a given.” Every day, he worried that KJ would pass away before they could finish making the therapy.

The team did not say exactly how much the therapy cost to produce, but Musunuru says it was comparable to the cost of a liver transplant, around $800,000. The companies involved in manufacturing—Aldevron, Danaher, and Integrated DNA Technologies—made in-kind contributions.

“Though it will take a lot of work to get there, my hope is that someday no rare disease patients will die prematurely from misspellings in their genes, because we'll be able to correct them,” Musunuru says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Blocked From Selling Off-Brand Ozempic, Telehealth Startups Embrace a Less Effective Drug","https://www.wired.com/story/telehealth-pivot-liraglutide-fda-shortage/","Thu, 15 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

After telehealth startups recently lost the ability to sell exact copies of patented GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, some firms have begun turning to a different, less effective medication that has been on the market in the United States since 2010. Often considered a precursor to blockbuster products like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, liraglutide is becoming the new darling of online clinics offering prescription weight loss and diabetes meds—despite its relative old age.

Originally sold by Novo Nordisk under the brand names Victroza and Saxenda, the drug has been available in generic form in the US since last year. Like Ozempic, liraglutide is a GLP-1 agonist that mimics a naturally occurring hormone and works by suppressing hunger cues and regulating insulin levels. But it doesn't have the same name recognition or popularity as the newer GLP-1 drugs for a very simple reason: It doesn't work as well, can cause more severe side effects, and patients have to inject it daily rather than weekly.

The FDA determined earlier this year that patented medications like Zepound and Ozempic were no longer in shortage, ending provisions that allowed online clinics to sell off-brand, compounded versions of the drugs. As clinics and manufacturers wind down sales of those compounds, many online clinics and manufacturers are embracing liraglutide. Leading telehealth company Hims added generic liraglutide to its lineup last month, joining over a dozen competitors already offering the product in compounded, generic, or name-brand forms.

Large compounding pharmacies, like Florida-based Olympia Pharmaceuticals, are already pivoting to producing the medication, expecting that demand will rise. “We've signed some pretty large contracts for liraglutide,” says chief financial officer Joshua Fritzler. “We can treat it kind of the same way we treated semaglutide and tirzepatide,” the active ingredients in Ozempic and Zepbound. Fritzler says Olympia plans to begin ramping up production this summer.

GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Zepbound have been heralded for their unparalleled success in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. Researchers believe they also have the potential to help patients suffering from a wide variety of other conditions, from addiction to Parkinson's. After demand for GLP-1s exploded in recent years, the FDA declared that some of the name-brand versions were officially in shortage. That meant doctors could legally prescribe cheaper “compounded” versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide with the same active ingredients as the originals.

Compounding pharmacies and telehealth startups flourished selling these alternative GLP-1 products online, attracting millions of customers who couldn't afford or were unwilling to pay higher prices for the name-brand medications, which are frequently not covered by insurance. Now, the shortages for both these meds have ended. The FDA's grace period for manufacturers to stop producing and selling compounded tirzepatide is over, and the cut-off date for semaglutide is May 22. Liraglutide, though, has been in shortage since April 2023, so the compounders are free to keep making it.

Some telehealth companies are continuing to offer compounded medications they say aren't technically direct copies of patented drugs because they come in customized doses or with added vitamins. Eli Lilly has already sued some of them, alleging that these versions are illegal. Other telehealth firms and compounders are playing it safe, ceasing sales altogether. (Olympia, for example, is stopping production of semaglutide.)

Liraglutide is especially appealing for these companies, since it's the closest thing they can safely produce and sell that still qualifies as a kind of Ozempic dupe. Some are even marketing it as a substitute for other drugs. The online clinic Ageless RX, for example, calls liraglutide as “an easy transition for those switching from another GLP-1 medication.” (Ageless RX did not respond to a request for comment)

Doctors tell WIRED that prospective patients should carefully assess whether liraglutide is really an appropriate alternative for them. While many people will likely respond positively to the medication, data suggests that tirzepatide and semaglutide are superior drugs for most patients. In clinical trials and other studies, those drugs outperform liraglutide, producing substantially more weight loss while causing fewer side effects.

“It is better than nothing, but expectations should be held in check,” says Justin Ryder, a pediatric obesity expert at Northwestern University and vice chair of research in the surgery department at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. “People who are looking for profound weight loss will likely be disappointed.” Since patients often need to stay on GLP-1 medications indefinitely to maintain results, liraglutide's daily injection may also prove to be a major hurdle for long-term success.

“People should do the math,” suggests obesity medicine specialist Angela Fitch. While the liraglutide sold by online clinics may initially appear to be cheaper than newer generations of drugs, the savings might not be so clear-cut in reality. The fact that liraglutide is prescribed to be taken daily rather than weekly means larger doses may be required to trigger comparable weight loss. “It might be more affordable to take a more potent drug,” Fitch says.

Crypto giant Coinbase has confirmed its systems have been breached and customer data, including government-issued identity documents, were stolen.

In a legally required filing with U.S. regulators, Coinbase said a hacker this week told the company that they had obtained information about customer accounts, and demanded money from the company in exchange for not publishing the stolen data.

Coinbase said the hacker “obtained this information by paying multiple contractors or employees working in support roles outside the United States to collect information from internal Coinbase systems to which they had access in order to perform their job responsibilities.” The support staff are no longer employed, the company said.

The filing said Coinbase's systems detected the malicious activity “in the previous months,” and that it has “warned customers whose information was potentially accessed in order to prevent misuse of any compromised information.”

Coinbase said it will not pay the hacker's ransom. According to a social post by CEO Brian Armstrong, the hackers demanded $20 million from the company. 

The company said the hacker stole customer names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and the last four-digits of users' Social Security numbers. The hacker also took masked bank account numbers and some banking identifiers, as well as customers' government-issued identity documents, such as driver's licenses and passports. The stolen data also includes account balance data and transaction histories. 

The company said some corporate data, such as internal documentation, was also stolen during the breach. 

In a blog post, Coinbase said it was opening a new U.S.-based support hub and will strengthen its security defenses.

When reached for comment, Coinbase spokesperson Natasha LaBranche told TechCrunch that the number of affected customers is less than 1% of its 9.7 million monthly customers, per the company's latest annual report ending March 2025. 

Coinbase said it expects to incur costs of around $180 million to $400 million relating to incident remediation and customer reimbursements.

Chips are a critical component of the AI industry. But new chips don't hit the market with the same speed as new AI models and products do.

Cognichip has a lofty goal of creating a foundational AI model that can help bring new chips to market faster.

San Francisco-based Cognichip is working to build a physics-informed foundational AI model that can be used by semiconductor companies to speed up the development process of new chips. The company is calling this approach “artificial chip intelligence” and hopes it can help speed up chip production times by 50% and reduce the associated costs as well.

This ambitious idea comes from semiconductor industry veteran Faraj Aalaei, who worked at various companies including Fujitsu Network Communications and Centillium Communications.

Aalaei told TechCrunch that his company's origin story begins back in 2015. At the time, Aalaei was a member of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which would often meet to talk about what was ailing their industry.

He was growing concerned about what was happening in the semiconductor industry. He gave a presentation to the group about the stark drop in venture capital investing into semiconductor companies, which peaked at 200 deals a year in 2000, he said, and dropped to just one or two a year by 2015.

“I essentially warned the other CEOs that this cannot be good for us,” Aalaei said. “It cannot be good for the semiconductor industry in America, and that what we needed to do is to fundamentally change things about it. If that trend continues, then we're going to lose our competitiveness. We're going to lose the energy that brings in new ideas to the table.”

Considering how long it takes new chips to come to market, it's not surprising these companies weren't attracting venture investors, he said. Then he sat on the idea for almost a decade.

He went on to found Candou Ventures in 2016, and through that fund got to watch the rise in AI startups. When he realized that advancements in generative AI had gotten to a point where it could be used to potentially help solve some of the semiconductor industry's existent challenges, he decided to launch Cognichip in 2024.

Cognichip has been operating in stealth ever since and has amassed a team of AI experts from places like Stanford, Google, and MIT to start building. Aalaei said it will take at least a few years to build the model to “ultimate performance” but said it should be able to help companies before it reaches that goal.

“When we get to that point, this artificial chip intelligence, we will be building a system that can actually act like an expert engineer,” Aalaei said. “Once we achieve that vision, then you can actually get the same work done with a fraction of the people and in much, much shorter time.”

Cognichip is now emerging from stealth with $33 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Lux Capital and Mayfield with participation from FPV and Candou Ventures.

Navin Chaddha, a managing partner at Mayfield, told TechCrunch that when he was introduced to Aalaei, he felt they were “cut from the same cloth.” The vast majority of work in the semiconductor industry is still being done by humans; he said he thinks the timing is right to bring AI into the mix.

“This is a major pain point, and the solution this company will provide will be a pain killer and not a vitamin for the semiconductor industry,” Chaddha said. “If you don't have humans doing the job, can AI do it where there's shortage of talent? Number one, great team, second, [they are] solving a real pain point in a massive, trillion-dollar industry.”

Aalaei said that he hopes Cognichip will also be able to help democratize access to building chips so that more semiconductor companies can get started and land investment. Easier access also means that smaller companies can build more specific chips for specialized or smaller models, too, he said.

All of this will depend on when, or if, the company can reach artificial chip intelligence.

“What we're doing is not some incremental change,” Aalaei said. “We're not building an [electronic design automation] tool, we're not trying to tweak the process a little bit. We're trying to set a new goal for our industry and bring some major change.”

Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would start importing iPhones manufactured in India to meet the majority of demand stateside. It seems U.S. president Donald Trump is not happy with that.

Speaking at a business summit in Doha, Trump said he met with Cook and asked him to stop building in India and instead increase production in the United States.

“I said to him, ‘Tim, you're my friend, I've treated you very good. You're coming up with $500 billion, but now I hear you are building all over India. I don't want you building in India. You can build in India, if you want to take care of India because India is one of the highest tariff nations in the world',” Trump said.

Trump, who has been on a tariff offensive against most of the world, said Apple would now be “upping” production in the U.S., though he didn't give a timeline or any specifics.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, Apple said that it would spend $500 billion over the next four years to expand manufacturing in the U.S. by setting up facilities in various locations, opening new units, hiring over 20,000 people, and opening a manufacturing academy.

Trump's comments come a day after India approved a $435 million Foxconn project to manufacture Apple chips in the country. The company has had ambitious plans to ramp up production in India and create alternative manufacturing units that reduce its reliance on China. 

A Bloomberg report in April suggested Apple already produces 20% of its iPhones in India. At the time, the Financial Times also reported that Apple planned to import all iPhones sold in the U.S. from India by 2026.

For years, big tech companies like Amazon and Google have been trying to make virtual try-ons engaging to encourage consumers to shop more online. Startups also tried to solve for inspiration and fit in fashion using AI.

A new startup called Doji is now entering this space with an app designed to make apparel try-ons both fun and social. It does so by creating your avatar and then serving you different looks that may inspire you to buy new clothes. 

So far, early adopters have been impressed by it.

Only days after publicly launching on the App Store, the company is announcing a $14 million seed round led by Thrive Capital with participation from Seven Seven Six Ventures. The funding will be used to improve Doji's AI models, the company says.

An app like Doji only exists thanks to recent advancements in AI. The company uses its own diffusion models to create its personalized avatars and to make clothing try-ons more realistic.

  @doji_com Try it on. Try Doji. Download the app to secure your spot, or find a friend with an invite.

The startup was founded last year by Dorian Dargan and Jim Winkens — hence the name Doji (Dorian + Jim). 

Dargan previously worked at Apple on VisionOS and at Meta on games and experiences on Oculus Quest. Winkens was a researcher at DeepMind and also worked on a generative AI-based consumer product at Google.

The duo connected on Twitter/X around 2022. After realizing a shared interest in the fashion world, they began exploring side projects to work on together. Later, when the controversial avatar creation app Lensa was released, Dargan saw how deep a connection people had with their avatars.

“Lensa was doing stylized avatars with different themes,” Dargan told TechCrunch. “We saw Lensa and thought, what if we could do this for fashion, but in a photo-realistic way?” 

Thrive Capital partner Miles Grimshaw said he's been captivated by Doji's app since the first time he used it. He notes that diffusion models create an opportunity to build a “virtual mirror” to try on clothes.

“Going around the web to hundreds of click links to shop is laborious. Doji has an opportunity to make shopping fun as it puts me at the center of the experience. The app also has a social aspect of making me want to share different looks [with friends and family],” he added.

Doji, which is still in invite-only mode, guides users through the process of taking six selfies and uploading two full-body images to create an avatar. The app takes roughly 30 minutes to create an avatar, then notifies you when the avatar is ready. You can also choose your favorite brands during onboarding to see more items from them in the app.

Other apps like Google-backed lock screen app Glance have tried to create AI-powered shopping inspiration flow by using a single image. However, Doji opted for a more in-depth setup process to create higher-quality avatars and better match users with the right clothes.

By default, the app shows you clothes that might suit you through a series of looks with your avatar. You can scroll through the different tops and bottoms listed on the site and tap on them to create a new look for your avatar. 

Plus, you can post a link to apparel from the web to check if it would suit you.

In tests, I felt that some of the images of the avatar made me look thinner or taller than I am. (Doji notes that users have the option of retraining the avatar through a new set of images if they don't like their results.) 

While the app lets you try on different clothes to see how certain apparel would look on you, it can't yet tell you how an item would fit. That's something the startup wants to tackle later, we're told.

The team is also working to make the virtual try-on process faster and integrate the buying process in the app, instead of directing users to external sites.

The startup, whose app is available in more than 80 countries, didn't specify when it will remove the invite system to allow everyone to use the app. 

Dargan said that what sets them apart from other try-on apps is that Doji also offers a fun way to explore clothes. Plus, he believes Doji is better at human representation than others, thanks to his experience designing avatars over the years. 

“I think people who have explored this idea before either haven't had the technology chops to make it good or the taste to understand what actually makes a person feel good about an image of themselves,” Dargan said. “We have invested a lot in core technology to ensure the way you perceive yourself through images is interesting and inspiring.”

Instagram Threads is taking on Linktree and other “link-in-bio” solutions by introducing a way for creators to use their Threads profile to share links to their other interests and online presences. At launch, the feature will support adding up to five links to a bio, which can connect visitors to the creator's blog, newsletter, website, or other social profiles, for example. In addition, creators will be able to access new tools to see how well those links perform.

The Meta-owned social app, which now has over 350 million monthly active users, is positioning the feature as an alternative to its competitor X. 

However, Threads' ability to point users to a host of other social and web profiles from links easily accessed from within a creator's bio is something that could eat into the business of services like Linktree, Beacons, Linkin.bio, Koji, and others that offer tools that allow creators to build a landing page for multiple links. These services initially emerged because social media apps only offered one place to add a URL to a bio, and creators needed a way to direct their fans to everything else they published online, including their posts on other social networks as well as their own websites or storefronts. 

With the update, Threads will provide creators with insights that allow them to see how many people have visited the links in their profile as well as any links shared in their posts. 

The company explained that the idea is to make Threads a place where creators can grow their reach, even if that means helping creators promote a presence that's outside Meta's app. 

In addition, Meta says it will soon launch a weekly recap feature for Insights that offers a summarized snapshot of the past week, including a week-over-week comparison of the number of posts they've shared, total views, new follower counts, and replies on their posts. These recaps will also include other personalized tips to help creators learn how to better engage their community.

South Korea has once again postponed a decision on whether to approve Google's request to transfer high-precision map data on the country's geography to its international servers.

In February, Google had requested approval from the Korean National Geographic Information Institute to deploy a 1:5,000 scale map on its app in the country and to transfer that data to its servers abroad, a spokesperson for the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport confirmed to TechCrunch.

The government was supposed to finalize its decision within 60 days, by mid-May, but the deadline has now been moved to August 11, as they are still in discussions, the spokesperson said.

This is Google's third request to South Korea on this topic, following previous requests in 2011 and 2016. The tech giant currently uses a 1:25,000 scale map in the country that includes points of interest and satellite images, according to media reports. A 1:5,000 scale high-precision map would offer a more detailed view that would include even the narrowest streets.

When South Korean officials rejected Google's request in 2016, they said an approval would only be granted if the U.S. tech firm sets up a data center in South Korea. The country also asked Google to blur sensitive locations, like national security facilities, on its maps for security purposes.

Google has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates an array of data centers around the world, including in Asian countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.

Data restrictions by the government have impacted the performance of Google Maps and Apple Maps in South Korea. Foreigners and tourists often struggle to navigate with Google Maps due to the limited information and languages supported, often resorting to using local apps that do not support many foreign languages.

Local navigation apps such as Naver Map, TMaps, and Kakao Map are most popular among local users. These apps offer map data at a scale of 1:5,000, and therefore, much more information and detail. Naver Map, launched in 2002, has about 27 million monthly active users (MAUs), while Kakao Map and TMaps have around 11 million and 24 million MAUs, respectively.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since AI performs better the more context you give it, we think solving AI privacy will unlock more valuable AI applications, just how TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish knowing that your credit card info wouldn't be stolen by someone sniffing internet packets.We come from backgrounds in cryptography, security, and infrastructure. Jules did his PhD in trusted hardware and confidential computing at MIT, and worked with NVIDIA and Microsoft Research on the same, Sacha did his PhD in privacy-preserving cryptography at MIT, Nate worked on privacy tech like Tor, and I (Tanya) was on Cloudflare's cryptography team. We were unsatisfied with band-aid techniques like PII redaction (which is actually undesirable in some cases like AI personal assistants) or “pinky promise” security through legal contracts like DPAs. We wanted a real solution that replaced trust with provable security.Running models locally or on-prem is an option, but can be expensive and inconvenient. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is not practical for LLM inference for the foreseeable future. The next best option is using secure enclaves: a secure environment on the chip that no other software running on the host machine can access. This lets us perform LLM inference in the cloud while being able to prove that no one, not even Tinfoil or the cloud provider, can access the data. And because these security mechanisms are implemented in hardware, there is minimal performance overhead.Even though we (Tinfoil) control the host machine, we do not have any visibility into the data processed inside of the enclave. At a high level, a secure enclave is a set of cores that are reserved, isolated, and locked down to create a sectioned off area. Everything that comes out of the enclave is encrypted: memory and network traffic, but also peripheral (PCIe) traffic to other devices such as the GPU. These encryptions are performed using secret keys that are generated inside the enclave during setup, which never leave its boundaries. Additionally, a “hardware root of trust” baked into the chip lets clients check security claims and verify that all security mechanisms are in place.Up until recently, secure enclaves were only available on CPUs. But NVIDIA confidential computing recently added these hardware-based capabilities to their latest GPUs, making it possible to run GPU-based workloads in a secure enclave.Here's how it works in a nutshell:1. We publish the code that should run inside the secure enclave to Github, as well as a hash of the compiled binary to a transparency log called Sigstore2. Before sending data to the enclave, the client fetches a signed document from the enclave which includes a hash of the running code signed by the CPU manufacturer. It then verifies the signature with the hardware manufacturer to prove the hardware is genuine. Then the client fetches a hash of the source code from a transparency log (Sigstore) and checks that the hash equals the one we got from the enclave. This lets the client get verifiable proof that the enclave is running the exact code we claim.3. With the assurance that the enclave environment is what we expect, the client sends its data to the enclave, which travels encrypted (TLS) and is only decrypted inside the enclave.4. Processing happens entirely within this protected environment. Even an attacker that controls the host machine can't access this data.
We believe making end-to-end verifiability a “first class citizen” is key. Secure enclaves have traditionally been used to remove trust from the cloud provider, not necessarily from the application provider. This is evidenced by confidential VM technologies such as Azure Confidential VM allowing ssh access by the host into the confidential VM. Our goal is to provably remove trust both from ourselves, aka the application provider, as well as the cloud provider.We encourage you to be skeptical of our privacy claims. Verifiability is our answer. It's not just us saying it's private; the hardware and cryptography let you check. Here's a guide that walks you through the verification process: https://docs.tinfoil.sh/verification/attestation-architectur....People are using us for analyzing sensitive docs, building copilots for proprietary code, and processing user data in agentic AI applications without the privacy risks that previously blocked cloud AI adoption.We're excited to share Tinfoil with HN!* Try the chat (https://tinfoil.sh/chat): It verifies attestation with an in-browser check.

At a high level, a secure enclave is a set of cores that are reserved, isolated, and locked down to create a sectioned off area. Everything that comes out of the enclave is encrypted: memory and network traffic, but also peripheral (PCIe) traffic to other devices such as the GPU. These encryptions are performed using secret keys that are generated inside the enclave during setup, which never leave its boundaries. Additionally, a “hardware root of trust” baked into the chip lets clients check security claims and verify that all security mechanisms are in place.Up until recently, secure enclaves were only available on CPUs. But NVIDIA confidential computing recently added these hardware-based capabilities to their latest GPUs, making it possible to run GPU-based workloads in a secure enclave.Here's how it works in a nutshell:1. We publish the code that should run inside the secure enclave to Github, as well as a hash of the compiled binary to a transparency log called Sigstore2. Before sending data to the enclave, the client fetches a signed document from the enclave which includes a hash of the running code signed by the CPU manufacturer. It then verifies the signature with the hardware manufacturer to prove the hardware is genuine. Then the client fetches a hash of the source code from a transparency log (Sigstore) and checks that the hash equals the one we got from the enclave. This lets the client get verifiable proof that the enclave is running the exact code we claim.3. With the assurance that the enclave environment is what we expect, the client sends its data to the enclave, which travels encrypted (TLS) and is only decrypted inside the enclave.4. Processing happens entirely within this protected environment. Even an attacker that controls the host machine can't access this data.
We believe making end-to-end verifiability a “first class citizen” is key. Secure enclaves have traditionally been used to remove trust from the cloud provider, not necessarily from the application provider. This is evidenced by confidential VM technologies such as Azure Confidential VM allowing ssh access by the host into the confidential VM. Our goal is to provably remove trust both from ourselves, aka the application provider, as well as the cloud provider.We encourage you to be skeptical of our privacy claims.

Do you run into rate limits or other issues with TLS cert issuance? One problem we had when doing this before is that each spinup of the enclave must generate a fresh public key, so it needs a fresh, publicly trusted TLS cert. Do you have a workaround for that, or do you just have the enclaves run for long enough that it doesn't matter?


reply



This will let us fix the rate limit issue.


reply



Also, if you're decoding TLS on the enclave, wouldn't that imply that you're parsing HTTP and JSON on the GPU itself? Very interesting if true.


reply



HTTP parsing and application logic happens on the CPU like normal. The GPU runs CUDA just like any other app, after it's integrity is verified by the CPU. Data on the PCIe bus is encrypted between the CPU and GPU too.[1] https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvtrust/blob/main/guest_tools/atte...

Yes.>How do you load balance or front end all of this effectively?We don't, atleast not yet. That's why all our model endpoints have different subdomains. In the next couple months, we're planning to generate a keypair inside the enclave using HPKE that will be used to encrypt the data, as I described in this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43996849

Does the CPU have the ability to see unencrypted data?


reply



When the enclave starts, the CPU does a few things:1. The CPU does a key exchange with the GPU (in confidential compute mode [1]) to derive a key to encrypt data over PCIe2. The CPU verifies the integrity of the GPU against NVIDIA's root of trust [2][1] https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/confidential-computing-on-...[2] https://github.com/tinfoilsh/cvmimage/blob/b65ced8796e8a8687...edit: formatting

It's a pattern we've seen across government and private sectors: infrastructure designed for care is being exploited for behavioral targeting through advertising motions. The public doesn't expect their health decisions to be fed into social ad networks, but the platforms already assume ownership of that data trail.And of course, it's all connected. The same companies monetizing behavioral profiling at scale are now running the most powerful generative AI systems. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is also the key infrastructure partner of OpenAI. Meta's ad tools were present on these health sites too. Google's trackers are everywhere else.When you strip away the techno-mystique, what's driving the AI and data arms race isn't wisdom. It's ego, power consolidation, and a pathological fear of being second.And Sam Altman? He's not stupid. But brilliance without wisdom is just charisma in a predator suit. Why do you think all these services tie directly into AI?

Yes, the workers' demands were reasonable, but they were met with warfare by the upper class who did not want to accept reasonable demands. The most extreme example is the Battle of Blair Mountain, but there are countless records of strike breakers beating and killing workers for striking and unionizing.





The class struggle is a perspective. It points to how blind rich people are to social issues, and how blind the poor are to economic issues. These two need the struggle, gently. Without it, there is either bloody revolution or cruel autocracy.That's as simple as it gets. Many people get it wrong.

Scientists have finally solved the greatest feline mystery of our time: Why is it, exactly, that some cats are orange?

Two separate research teams have detailed the answer in two studies published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. They've identified the precise genetic mutation in these cats that explains their orangeness—a mutation not seen in other animals with similar coloration.

Orange-furred cats are often referred to as gingers. And according to Chris Kaelin, lead author of one of the new studies, the same basic mechanism underlying red hair in humans applies to orange cats, too: their pigment cells switch from making eumelanin pigment (brown/black) to making pheomelanin pigment (red/orange). But scientists have known for a while that the genetic cause of orangeness in cats is very different from the one in humans and other mammals.

“What motivated us to study orange cats is that the trait is sex-linked (the mutation and the affected gene are on the X chromosome) and sex-linked pigmentation traits are not observed in other species,” Kaelin, a geneticist at Stanford University, told Gizmodo in an email. “So, we recognized that orange cats provided an opportunity to learn something new and potentially insightful.”

The location of this mutation also explains why ginger cats tend to be male (males only possess one X chromosome). Previous studies have narrowed down the mutation's likely location on the X chromosome, but thanks to more comprehensive genomic data from a variety of cats, Kaelin's team and a separate research team from Japan were independently able to isolate the specific genetic quirk underpinning a cat's gingerosity.

“We used genetic approaches to pinpoint a mutation, a small deletion of sequence on the X chromosome, that causes orange color. All orange cats have this deletion, but non-orange cats do not,” Kaelin explained. “The mutation is not located in a gene (the part of the genome that encodes for proteins). Instead, it's in what we call a non-coding region—the remaining 98% of the genome that does not code for proteins.”

According to Kaelin, the mutation activates a nearby gene called Arhgap36 so that it's expressed in pigment cells when it normally shouldn't be. The activation then blocks eumelanin pigment from being produced, causing pheomelanin to be made in its place by default. While genetic variants that trigger orangeness in other animals interact with this same pathway as well, the ginger cat mutation is stranger still because it disturbs a later step of this process. Interestingly, this marks the first time Arhgap36 has been linked to pigmentation.

“This type of mutation is very unusual,” Kaelin notes.

The team's discovery doesn't explain everything about why orange cats are the way they are. These felines are commonly depicted as especially dim or mischievous, to the point that they're said to possess a single brain cell that must be shared among all orange cats in the world. But the researchers found no evidence that their mutation causes any other changes, including those related to behavior or temperament.

“One of the key findings of our study is that we observe altered activity of the affected gene in pigment cells, but remarkably not in other cells or tissues including brain areas where the gene is normally expressed,” Kaelin said. “This suggests that the mutation does not have broad effects.”

While the single brain cell theory will have to await more scientific inquiry, the researchers do think their work can lead to more insights. Simply figuring out how this deletion can activate Arhgap36 so precisely might open up a whole new bag of intriguing discoveries waiting to be explored further.

“We would like to understand how the deletion has such a remarkably specific effect on gene activity and we expect that answering this question will have broad implications about how mammalian genes are turned on and off in specific cell types,” Kaelin said.

So if you have an orange cat in your life, be sure to thank them for their contribution to science with some extra treats today.

A newly described creature from the Cambrian period is putting a bizarre twist on what we thought we knew about early animal evolution. Meet Mosura fentoni—a three-eyed, clawed, and flappy-limbed predator about the size of your finger, recently identified from Canada's famed Burgess Shale.

The alien-looking animal is part of a group called radiodonts, a now-extinct lineage of arthropods best known for Anomalocaris, a three-foot-long (one-meter-long) sea terror with spiny limbs and a circular mouth full of teeth.

Like its cousins, Mosura had a similar feeding disk and paddle-like limbs for swimming. But it also had a strange surprise out back: a tail-like segment of 16 tightly packed body sections, each lined with gills. The Royal Society Open Science published the team's description of the creature today.

“As much as we learn about radiodonts, there always seems to be something new and surprising about this group around the corner,” said study lead author Joe Moysiuk, curator at the Manitoba Museum, in an email to Gizmodo. “The ‘abdomen' in Mosura is different in that its segments are small and they have only tiny flaps that would have been basically useless for propulsion.”

The researchers aren't totally sure why Mosura needed this extra breathing real estate, but it could be related to how or where it lived—maybe hanging out in low-oxygen environments in the lively Cambrian seas, or leading an especially active lifestyle.

Its unique shape, with broad swimming flaps and a slender abdomen, earned it the nickname “sea-moth” from the researchers—hence the name Mosura, a nod to the Japanese kaiju Mothra. But despite its nickname, Mosura is only distantly related to moths. Mosura is part of a much more ancient lineage of arthropods—and though the radiodonts are long-gone, their remarkable preservation in the Burgess Shale is routinely yielding new species to science.

Beyond its sci-fi looks, Mosura is also offering rare glimpses of internal anatomy from half a billion years ago. Some of the 61 fossils of the creature studied show preserved nerve tissue, eye structures, a digestive tract, and even reflective patches representing an open circulatory system—essentially a heart pumping blood into internal cavities called lacunae. Those same features, previously mysterious in other fossils, are evident in the team's Mosura specimens.

The fossils, mostly collected by the Royal Ontario Museum over the last 50 years, came from Yoho and Kootenay National Parks—part of the Burgess Shale region. The region was part of the ancient seafloor and is known for its exceptional preservation of the soft-bodied organisms that called the seafloor home.

Moysiuk has recently unearthed a couple of other creatures from the Cambrian Explosion, including Titanokorys gainesi in 2021 and Cambroraster falcatus, named for the Millennium Falcon, in 2019.

“So many science fiction creatures have been inspired by living organisms,” Moysiuk said. “It seems only natural that scientists should take some inspiration in return.”

“There are loads of other possible inspirations for species names, but I do think there's a lot of potential with the ‘Tremors' franchise,” Moysiuk added. “The giant worms in that series are supposed to be relicts of the Precambrian, and although that makes no sense scientifically, it could make for a fun reference.”

You heard it here first: As long as the creatures getting discovered keep looking as alien as Moysiuk's recent finds, no science fiction franchise is safe from becoming scientific nomenclature.

The company will provide AI and CPU solutions for HUMAIN AI

Qualcomm has confirmed its long-rumored data center CPU rollout will start in collaboration with Saudi Arabia's state-backed AI cloud infrastructure project, in partnership with HUMAIN AI. In a press release, the company confirmed it has signed a memorandum of understanding with HUMAIN, a new Saudi Arabian venture backed by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

The move represents a return to making data center CPUs after Qualcomm's first failed initiative. Qualcomm famously developed Centriq data center CPUs in 2017 but then canceled the project in 2019. The company later purchased the startup Nuvia, which was designing Arm-based data center CPUs. Qualcomm repurposed the tech for its Snapdragon processors for Windows machines, but speculation has continued that the company would re-enter the data center CPU market with Nuvia's tech under the hood.

Qualcomm and HUMAIN AI say they will partner in developing next-generation AI data centers, infrastructure, and cloud-to-edge services. Specifically, Qualcomm says it intends to develop and build ""cutting-edge AI data centers in Saudi Arabia designed to deliver highly efficient, scalable cloud-to-edge hybrid AI inferencing solutions for local and international customers based on Qualcomm Technologies' edge and data center solutions.""

Qualcomm says it will also develop and supply state-of-the-art data center CPU and AI solutions to HUMAIN's data centers and speed up the use of the infrastructure by leveraging Snapdragon and Dragonwing processors.

Qualcomm and HUMAIN say their data centers ""are intended to provide both government and enterprise organizations with access to high-performance and power efficient CPU and AI cloud infrastructure and cloud-to-edge services.""

As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will also establish a Qualcomm Design Center in Saudi Arabia for semiconductor technology.

Cristiano Amon, President and CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated, said Qualcomm was ""pleased to be working with HUMAIN to support the realization"" of its goal to become a global AI leader.

Qualcomm hinted at plans to develop server CPUs earlier this year when it hired Sailesh Kottapalli, former chief architect of Intel's Xeon server processors. Kottapalli's tenure included projects such as x86, Itanium, and multiple Xeon generations.

The news follows Nvidia's own announcement that it will send 18,000 AI GPUs to the country, which will be used to build a 500-megawatt data center. It follows the Trump administration's official scrapping of the AI Diffusion Rule, which restricted the export of AI chips to most countries.

Antec just announced the new Vortex View AIO cooler that features a 5-inch IPS display that rotates a full 360 degrees. This ensures that the display stays upright, no matter how you configure or mount the water block. TechPowerUp also said that the screen features an ARGB backglow, which softly illuminates the rest of your motherboard to showcase each and every component. The Vortex View is compatible with both AMD and Intel processors, although Antec did not say which generations are supported.

Aside from being Antec's latest AIO offering, the Vortex View will also be the first unit to use the company's updated iUnity platform. This PC monitoring and control app now features smarter fan and pump curve control, as well as support for multi-device syncing and personalized dashboards. The company said that it will also be compatible with upcoming product releases, so we anticipate an Antec ecosystem of cases, power supplies, coolers, and more in the near future.

“The Vortex View is a natural evolution of what performance cooling should be,” said Antec CEO Frank Lee. “With a 360-degree free-rotational five-inch IPS display powered via USB 3.0, it delivers real-time system insight with total flexibility, without compromising on thermal efficiency. It's also the first AIO to launch with our revamped iUnity platform, enabling deeper customization and seamless future integration across Antec products. This cooler stays true to our core principle: prioritizing performance first, then layering in meaningful functionality.”

Antec put a high-efficiency PWM pump on the Vortex View, allowing it to vary the pump speed as needed, based on your computer's power load and temperature. It also reduced noise levels, and when paired with Antec's ARGB fans that prioritize airflow and silence, you don't have to worry about your gaming PC sounding like a drone taking off. The company also used premium braided tubing, ensuring that it will last longer and prevent any leaks that could damage your computer.

We don't know yet if the Vortex View will come in both 240 mm and 360 mm or other colors. Hopefully, Antec will give PC builders those options, especially as the Vortex and Vortex Lum AIO coolers are available in those sizes. The company will show off its latest AIO cooler at the upcoming Computex 2025 in Taiwan, where we expect to see its other products. Hopefully, we can get a chance to test out the Vortex View to see how it stacks up against the best AIO coolers of 2025.

But there is a major catch.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Right now, AMD's Instinct MI300-series accelerators are aimed at both AI and HPC, which makes them universal but lowers maximum performance for both types of workloads. Starting from its next-generation Instinct MI400-series, AMD will offer distinct processors for AI and supercomputers in a bid to maximize performance for each workload, according to SemiAnalysis. However, there might be a problem with the scalability of these compute GPUs.

AMD plans to offer the Instinct MI450X for AI and the Instinct MI430X for HPC sometime in the second half of 2026. Both processors will rely on subsets of the CDNA Next architecture, but will be tailored for low-precision AI compute (FP4, FP8, BF16) or high-precision HPC compute (FP32, FP64). Such bifurcation of positioning will enable AMD to remove FP32 and FP64 logic from MI450X as well as FP4, FP8, and BF16 logic from MI430X, therefore maximizing die space for respective logic.

In addition to workload optimizations, AMD's Instinct MI400-series accelerators will also feature not only Infinity Fabric but also UALink interconnections, which will make them some of the first AI and HPC GPUs to feature UALink, a technology designed to challenge NVLink. But there is a major problem with UALink.

Support for UALink will be limited in 2026 due to the absence of switching silicon from external vendors, including Astera Labs, Auradine, Enfabrica, and XConn. As a result, the Instinct MI430X will only be usable in small configurations in topologies like mesh or torus, as there will be no UALink switches next year. AMD does not develop its own UALink switches and therefore relies entirely on partners, which may not be ready in the second half of next year.

Progress in UALink development has been slow due to coordination delays in the standards body. According to SemiAnalysis, chipmakers like Broadcom view the market for such switches as too small and are not assigning enough engineering resources to accelerate timelines. By contrast, networking initiatives under the Ultra Ethernet Consortium are advancing more quickly and already have compatible hardware available commercially.

In a bid to compete against Nvidia with its own rack-scale solutions, AMD intends to offer systems called Instinct MI450X IF64 and MI450X IF128 that will rely on the Infinity Fabric technology, possibly over Ethernet. SemiAnalysis believes that such solutions could be competitive with Nvidia's VR200 NVL144 platforms in the second half of 2026, though it remains to be seen how these systems will stack up.

Company president shrugs off concerns about U.S. constraining GPU supplies.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


During an earnings call with investors on Wednesday, Tencent boasted of a ""strong stockpile"" of GPUs. Furthermore, when asked about how U.S. trade policy regarding advanced AI chips was impacting Tencent's product development and launch plans, company President Martin Lau seemed to shrug off investor concerns.

In response to a question about high-end GPUs from Kevin Fong of international investment bank UBS, Lau started by characterizing the GPU situation as dynamic. Lau backed up his point by sharing the 'good news' that ""I think we have a pretty strong stockpile of chips that we acquired previously and that would be very useful for us in executing our AI strategy.""

Right now, investors might be happy to hear that Tencent is leveraging these GPUs for the best immediate returns, in advertising, for example. However, an important point comes next, when Lau explains that Tencent is moving away from ""the belief of the American tech companies, which they call the scaling law,"" and towards smaller clusters which can still get ""very good results.""

Thanks to this adaptation, Tencent's Lau asserts that ""we should have enough high-end chips to continue our training of models for a few more generations going forward.""

On the software side, things are also being optimized for Tencent's business. In his answer to Fong, Lau floated the idea of improving inference efficiency twofold, and ""basically that means the amount of GPUs gets doubled in terms of capacity.""

Another important point raised concerned Tencent's potential use of ""other chips."" Its engineers appear to be looking at other AI accelerators, be they ASICs or GPUs, that can be sourced from within China, or can still be imported.

Lau concluded by highlighting that Tencent had ""a lot of ways to which we can fulfill the expanding and growing inference needs,"" and not just keep buying (Western tech) GPUs.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Though Tencent is obviously being smart with its GPU purchases, it has still splurged a huge amount on them. In the financials released yesterday, it was notable that ""Operating CapEx was RMB26.4 billion ($3.6 billion), up almost 300% year-on-year, driven by increased investments in GPUs and servers to ramp up our AI capabilities."" This expenditure has had a sizable impact on free cash flow.

GPUs are well known as the current lifeblood of the AI industry. But for years now, the U.S. and its allies have sought to restrict the supply of the most advanced GPUs to hostile nations like China. The big fear is that these advanced technologies could multiply the effectiveness of advanced enemy weaponry, which could be turned against its creators in places like the U.S. and Taiwan.

The imposition of trade sanctions and export rules may have backfired, though. For a long time, the sanctions seem to have only loosely been enforced and have been easy to work around. Now, several years into the process, China appears to have established software and hardware that sidelines the requirement for AI tech from the Western allies. Now, here we are, with the Tencent boss seemingly unconcerned about U.S. trade restrictions, and a thriving domestic AI industry to help realize future plans.

Fractal sent us the Meshify 3 in white and the 3 XL in black. I was able to spend some time with them, but didn't have time to do a full build because of time constraints ahead of Computex. I was, though, able to take several photos, and the cases definitely have some interesting features. Some of those choices, though, lead to the frame feeling a little flimsy.



The main difference between the two cases is depth, with the 3 XL adding room for larger motherboards, lengthier graphics cards and PSUs, and larger radiators up top. The 3 XL also has mounting points for a side-mounted radiator or three more fans (behind a cover in the image above).



From the back, you can see the extensive cable routing options, with three removable plastic cable brackets to keep a plethora of wires in check. The 3 XL also has pre-installed velcro loops along the back edge of the case for wrangling the CPU power connector and an exhaust fan cable (if you install an exhaust fan). Also shown here is the Adjust Pro Hub, which has what looks like four USB-C ports (two occupied out of the box), along with its PWM and USB connector. It's a PWM and RGB hub that works with Fractal's Momentum RGB fans, which combine both PRM signals and lighting controls in a single cable that terminates in a plug that's physically identical to USB-C (but is not actually USB-C). Combining multiple cables into one is nice for simplified building and wire hiding, but of course, this locks you into using Fractal's newer fans if you want to use the hub.Fractal is touting the ability to change lighting and fan speed settings through a web app, with all the settings actually stored in the hub itself. This is an interesting move similar to what we've seen on keyboards that support VIA or Keychron's Launcher. I much prefer this to the bulky (and often buggy) RGB and peripheral software from Asus, Corsair, Razer, and others.

You just have to hope Fractal keeps hostingits app for as long as you keep using your case – I don't see that as a huge concern (Fractal has been around since 2007), but some might prefer software you can download and run.



Both cases feature a scooped-out area behind the bottom intake fan that is designed to angle airflow up toward the graphics card. This is similar to designs we've seen from NZXT and others. But where it's typically a flat, angled slope, Fractal has used molded plastic to round out the shape in a way that, if nothing else, feels more in line with Scandinavian design. The cases also feature some interesting elements designed to make component installation easier. Not only can you remove the top mesh panel (which pulls off the back with the help of a strap), but the entire top portion of the frame can be removed by loosening a couple of captive thumb screws.



This lets you mount a radiator or fans to the top of the frame from outside the case, then reinstall the top portion afterward. Likewise, the entire front fan mount section (and fans, if installed) can swing out on hinges.

While these are nice enough features, making these structural parts easy to remove results in the steel frame not feeling as rigid as I'd expect from Fractal (or any company making a case in this price range). I don't think it is a major drawback for most people. Just know this case does have some noticeable flex.



Top port selection is pretty typical, with two USB-A ports, a USB-C (20 Gbps if your board has the appropriate header), power button, and a headphone / mic combo jack.



Fractal will offer the Meshify 3 and 3 XL in white or black, and there doesn't seem to be a price premium for the lighter shade. There are, though, plenty of options for both cases: You can choose a glass side or metal (again, for the same price) on the non-RGB models. Paying $20 extra gets you the model with RGB rings around the fans. But if you want the Ambience Pro RGB model, which has the RGB ring fans plus an RGB strip around the front frame and along the side of the PSU area, that will set you back an additional $60, topping out at $249 for the 3 XL Ambience Pro RGB version. As nice as the RGB glow does look on the high-end option, I'm not sure I'd pay $80 for it over the base / no-RGB model. Still, I try to never knock a company for giving us options. And at $169 sans RGB, the Meshify 3XL in particular looks like a nice airflow-focused option for big builds. That's as long as you can live with its SATA drive limitations. It feels like this case is big enough to handle more than two 3.5-inch hard drives.

Optimized treatment can reduce the mortality risk for chronic heart failure (HF) by as much as 60%. The role of appropriate drug combinations and rapid diagnosis was discussed at the 91st Annual German Society of Cardiovascular Medicine Annual Conference.

“It is important to start drug treatment for HF immediately after diagnosis, in parallel with investigating the underlying causes, as the benefits of treatment appear very quickly,” said Birgit Assmus, MD, cardiologist and head of the Heart Failure Department of the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.

For HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, as well as for HF with moderately reduced ejection fraction (LVEF between 41% and 49%), the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend a quadruple combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

A loop diuretic is added in cases of fluid retention. Studies such as PARADIGM-HF (sacubitril and valsartan/enalapril) and dapagliflozin in HF have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization within 30 and 27 days, respectively.

Rapid diagnosis is essential for timely treatment; however, delayed diagnosis remains a significant barrier.

The REVOLUTION HF study from Sweden, presented at last year's ESC Heart Failure Congress, revealed that only 29% of patients with elevated natriuretic peptide levels > 2000 ng/L received an HF diagnosis within a year. On average, it took 40 days to perform the first transthoracic echocardiography.

“If natriuretic peptide levels were lower, the likelihood of diagnosis of HF was significantly reduced, which translated into dramatically increased mortality, as without a diagnosis, we do not implement drug treatment,” said Assmus.

“We must all work to promptly support general practitioners in patients suspected of HF and to offer echocardiographic diagnostics in a timely manner from a cardiological perspective,” she emphasized.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, quadruple treatment should be initiated immediately to prevent complications. However, the order in which medications are introduced often depends on the phenotype of the patients with HF. General recommendations based on data analysis from six randomized controlled trials suggest an optimal sequence to maximize survival benefits within 1 year.

The recommended sequence for initiating quadruple treatment was as follows:

From a clinical perspective, Assmus noted that SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs can be initiated simultaneously. Depending on the patient's phenotype, beta-blockers may also be administered immediately followed by ARNI.

The benefits of the optimized treatment were remarkable. An analysis of three randomized studies from 2020 demonstrated that a 55-year-old patient with HF could gain an additional 6.3 years of life by switching from conventional dual treatment (ACE inhibitor/ARNI and beta-blocker) to quadruple treatment. Even for an 80-year-old patient, life expectancy increased by 1.4 years.

“The effect diminishes somewhat due to competing causes of death as age increases, but even an 80-year-old can still gain 1.4 years of life,” Assmus emphasized, adding that the reduction of HF-related hospitalizations should also be considered, as these “significantly affect patients' quality of life.”

While medication is central to HF management, Assmus stressed the importance of additional therapeutic options for patients whose conditions worsen despite optimal medication. These include the use of devices such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization treatments. Telemonitoring can be performed using either implanted or external devices to monitor patients remotely.

“We are not good at implementing this potentially life-saving treatment,” said Assmus, highlighting the underutilization of telemonitoring.

Another key point is the treatment of arrhythmias in patients with HF and atrial fibrillation. “There are increasing signs that we can reduce mortality and hospital admissions in patients by maintaining rhythm even in advanced HF,” Assmus said.

The current quadruple combination of ACE inhibitors or ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors may evolve with the emergence of novel treatment options.

Assmus pointed to vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, which is recommended for patients with HF that worsens under optimal treatment or for those with medication intolerance. “The great strength of this drug is that it can be administered up to an eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate] of 15 mL per minute,” Assmus stated.

The ongoing phase 3 VICTOR study, expected to be completed in 2024, will determine whether vericiguat reduces cardiovascular mortality and HF-related hospitalizations in patients with stable chronic HFrEF.

Iron deficiency is a common comorbidity in HF, and intravenous iron carboxymaltose is recommended (Class IIa) to improve symptoms and exercise capacity and reduce hospitalization in hospitalized patients.

Since the 2021 guidelines, several new studies, including IRONMAN, HEART-FID, and FAIR-HF2, have been initiated by the German Center for Cardiovascular Research. These studies have shown trends toward improved outcomes but lack statistical significance due to the limited number of participants.

A meta-analysis of six major studies, led by Stefan Anker, MD, cardiologist at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, and published in Nature Medicine, found a 28% reduction in the combined endpoint of recurrent HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death.

For HF with preserved ejection fraction, current guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors and diuretics for fluid retention, in addition to managing comorbidities. However, the 2026 guidelines may also include new options.

The FINEARTS-HF study demonstrated that the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone significantly improved the primary endpoint of HF events and cardiovascular death compared with standard care. This reduction was primarily driven by fewer HF-related hospitalizations.

Finerenone is recommended for the prevention of HF in patients with diabetic nephropathy and significant albuminuria to prevent HF. Based on the current data, HF-specific treatments may be used in the future.

A substantial proportion of perimenopausal and menopausal women expressed willingness to undergo assessment for osteoporosis, especially among those of Chinese ethnicity and those with an older age, fracture history, and higher scores in perception of their osteoporosis risk.

“Knowledge of these factors will be useful when developing interventions to improve preventive behaviours for osteoporosis and increase uptake of osteoporosis assessment for those at risk,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Jacqueline Giovanna De Roza of the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics in Singapore. It was published online on May 9, 2025, in BMC Primary Care.

Due to the cross-sectional design, the researchers could not establish that certain factors caused women to be willing to undergo an assessment. Potential recall bias may have existed due to self-administered questionnaires. The study did not assess how serious participants were about their reported beliefs about osteoporosis.

This study did not receive any funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interests.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to telisotuzumab vedotin-tllv (Emrelis, AbbVie) for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high c-Met protein overexpression after prior systemic therapy. 

The FDA also approved the VENTANA MET (SP44) RxDx Assay (Roche Diagnostics) as a companion diagnostic to detect high c-Met protein overexpression, defined as 50% or more of tumor cells with 3+ staining.

The antibody-drug conjugate consists of a c-Met–directed antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate. 

Telisotuzumab vedotin-tllv “is the first and only treatment approved for previously treated advanced NSCLC patients with high c-Met protein overexpression who often face poor prognosis and have limited treatment options,” AbbVie said in a press release. 

C-Met is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in approximately 25% of patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type, nonsquamous NSCLC, driving tumor progression. Roughly half of overexpressors have high c-Met expression.

Approval was based on the phase 2 LUMINOSITY trial in 84 patients with EGFR wild-type, nonsquamous NSCLC and high c-Met protein overexpression. Patients received telisotuzumab vedotin-tllv as monotherapy in the second or third-line setting.

The overall response rate was 35%, and the median duration of response was 7.2 months. 

The most common adverse reactions, in 20% or more of study participants, were peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, decreased appetite, and peripheral edema. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, in 2% of more of participants, were decreased lymphocytes, increased glucose, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased gamma glutamyl transferase, decreased phosphorus, decreased sodium, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased calcium.

The recommended telisotuzumab vedotin-tllv dose is 1.9 mg/kg intravenously up to a maximum of 190 mg for patients who weigh 100 kg or more every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The treatment is being further evaluated in the phase 3 trial TeliMET, AbbVie noted in the press release.

On a cold Wednesday morning in January, Ruben Olivares, MD, sat down at a computer workstation in Cleveland to perform surgery on a man with prostate cancer. Olivares, a urologist at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, directed a robot to send high-intensity, focused ultrasound waves to the tumor. But this time, the patient was not in a nearby operating room, or in the same building — or even the same country. Instead, the man was in a facility more than 7000 miles away, at Cleveland Clinic's hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

In what is believed to be the world's first remotely-conducted, transcontinental robotic-assisted focal therapy for prostate cancer, Waleed Hassen, MD, MBA, department chair of urology for the Abu Dhabi hospital, sat near the patient to launch the software program and transferred to Olivares control of the robotic arm used to deliver the therapy.

“During the procedure, I forgot I was 7000 miles away,” Olivares told Medscape Medical News. “I did a case in a regular fashion and, with all the people interested, I started doing teaching and educated everyone. The case was seamless,” thanks in part to an imperceptible video lag of less than 120 milliseconds, he added. The patient, expected to have a life expectancy of at least 10 more years, is now cancer-free, Olivares said.

The procedure was intended to serve as proof that this type of remote surgery was possible using a regular landline. The achievement was the result of 2 years of planning, Olivares said, including testing the equipment and finding an appropriate patient who was agreeable.

Olivares traveled to the Abu Dhabi location in 2023; he has since established a tumor board for which colleagues at Cleveland Clinic's various locations — including outposts in Florida, Canada, Nevada, and the United Arab Emirates — send him MRIs, biopsies, and other test results, and they discuss who is an appropriate candidate for focused ultrasound for prostate cancer.

Olivares and his colleagues incorporate MRI images and a robotic platform that scans the prostate in real-time to determine exactly where to aim the ultrasound to ablate the tumor while sparing nearby healthy tissue. If a patient moves, Olivares can adjust the robotic arm accordingly.

“The future looks very promising,” Olivares said. “We have to be able to offer new alternatives, new ways to solve all problems, regardless of where the patient lives.” He foresees a time when he could help guide physicians performing the procedure elsewhere while staying connected in real time: “If a problem happens, I can take over and do the case from here.”

Teleinterventions between physical locations have occurred since the 1990s, but the field is gaining momentum, said Louis Kavoussi, MD, MBA, chairman of urology and director of Teleintervention at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York. The first widely known telesurgery occurred in 2001, when surgeons at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City performed a remote, robotic gallbladder removal on a patient in Strasbourg, France. While successful, the procedure, supported by French Telecom, was determined to be too expensive for the transatlantic cable to be done on any regular basis, and garnered little interest, he said.

With recent advances in technology, surgeons in China, Japan, and India have been performing robotic urological telesurgeries in remote locations, said Vipul Patel, MD, medical director of the Global Robotics Institute at AdventHealth in Celebration, Florida, and director of Urologic Oncology at the AdventHealth Cancer Institute.

“There's just a huge interest” in the technology, Patel said. “All the societies, all the countries, all the robotic companies — I think we're starting to realize that we can truly help healthcare equity globally with telesurgery, and everyone's just jumping on board now.”

Patel said the COVID-19 pandemic gave the field an important push. “Patients could be seen virtually for medical issues but not for surgery. Telesurgery was born out of the need to treat patients remotely,” he said. A small number of medical schools, including Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, have started training programs in telesurgery.

In 2023, Patel and colleagues from AdventHealth traveled to China, Japan, and India to see their equipment and work with companies there to develop telesurgery applications. As part of the visit, they were given licenses to operate in China, where Patel performed five robotic prostatectomies on patients located up to 5000 km (about 3106 miles) away to test the capabilities, with surgical colleagues at the patients' bedsides in case the equipment malfunctioned or another problem arose. The surgeons present locally never had to intervene.

“It was the same as if the patient was in our home OR [operating room],” Patel said. “It was amazing that we could operate at such distances, and it was if the patient was in the room with us.”

Patel's training facility in Florida is now connected to robotic systems in Brazil, Kuwait, Angola, China, and Morocco to teach and coach surgeons through telesurgeries in those countries.

“The global implications in terms of humanitarian healthcare equity are massive,” said Patel, who gave a plenary talk on telesurgery for the American Urological Association (AUA) 2025 Annual Meeting in Las Vegas last month. “If we could teach remotely from here to underserved areas of the world, we could actually advance healthcare. Obviously, it helps patient care as well, But I think first, if you could teach remotely, you can help so many more people.”

Some hurdles still to be worked through are determining how far apart surgeons can be from the patient to perform operations safely, achieving a lag of < 155 milliseconds in some areas, and ensuring secure connections that cannot be breached. Still, telesurgeries could become more mainstream in the United States and other areas within 2-5 years, Patel and Kavoussi said.

Legal and patient care issues also must be worked out, he said. Patel is executive director of the Society for Robotic Surgery, where he is working on guidelines for telesurgeries to ensure the patient is protected and clinicians conduct procedures in an ethical, orderly manner.

Device manufacturers are working on designs for “several hundred” new robots with different capacities, Kavoussi said. For example, some could be employed in telestroke programs where experts in one hospital can use them remotely to guide a wire through a patient's body to the site of a clot for the delivery of clot-busting drugs or devices to remove a blockage, in any emergency room.

“This is something that's coming,” he said. “This is just the tip of the iceberg is what we're beginning to see now.”

Kavoussi is on the board of Sovato. Olivares and Patel reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Diet-induced inflammation is associated with a higher risk for fatty pancreas in patients with common bile duct stones, as confirmed by analyses using multiple dietary inflammatory indices.

“The findings of the present study showed that higher scores of DII, EDIP and DIS were significantly associated with higher risk of fatty pancreas,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Maedeh Chegini, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. It was published online in Scientific Reports.

As a case-control study, the findings are subject to recall and selection bias. Dietary data were self-reported, which may have introduced inaccuracies. The study focused solely on patients with common bile duct stones, limiting generalizability.

 May 15, 2025  

In the United Sates, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups. Not only that but also the number of heart-disease related deaths began increasing in 2012, following decades of progress. There are numerous theories as to why, but the bottom line as a primary care physician is that you're going to have patients with high risk factors for heart issues.

In that role, your own understanding of heart disease is critical, so that you can translate the information to your patients. One sometimes misunderstood factor in heart disease is inflammation — what it is, how it raises heart health risks, and how patients can keep its impact to a minimum. One thing is for certain: Chronic inflammation plays a contributing role to heart disease in several ways.

When occurring in the right dose, inflammation is a key piece of your immune system. Say you twist an ankle — the immediate puffing up is an inflammatory response and is designed to help with the healing process. In this acute, specific setting, inflammation is good. Where it becomes problematic — especially with regard to heart health — is when it enters a chronic, and/or systemic state.

“Inflammation works in both chronic and acute ways to increase cardiovascular disease,” said Erica Spatz, MD, cardiologist and associate professor at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut. “In its chronic form, inflammation can be subclinical, only detectable with biomarkers such as hs-CRP [ high-sensitivity C-reactive protein test] and IL-6 [interleukin-6]. Subclinical inflammation can lead to atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.”

Even when controlling for traditional risk factors, studies have revealed how big a role inflammation plays. The liver makes CRP, and when there's inflammation in the body, these numbers increase. A simple blood test can reveal this information, and a hs-CRP picks up on smaller increases in CRP.

High levels of hs-CRP are linked to increased risks for heart attack, and for people who have already experienced a heart attack, the risks for another are higher if they have a high hs-CRP. While these tests cannot point specifically to where the inflammation is occurring, they are a good indicator that the patient could be vulnerable to heart disease and its related issues.

To help your patients mitigate inflammation in their systems — and thus help them reduce the odds of heart-related health issues, you need to be armed with the right information.

Inflammation in many settings or body parts can be a positive thing, but when it's chronic and occurring in the arteries, it contributes to plaque buildup and a narrowing of the arteries — atherosclerosis. That same plaque buildup can also create an environment that produces blood clots, another life-threatening effect.

This result and inflammatory state don't happen overnight.

“It builds up slowly over time,” said Niya Jones, MD, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center. “Even more concerning is that we're seeing these changes earlier and earlier. People in their 20s are already presenting with changes that predispose them to a heart attack later.”

Lifestyle choices are a likely contributing factor in this unfortunate trend. “Given our current diets, young people are setting up for issues down the road,” said Jones.

Research long ago established that diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and highly processed foods are all contributing factors to heart disease. Yet Americans continue to eat diets rich in all these foods. Providing your patients with standard heart-healthy diet advice and warning against diets full of foods that raise inflammation is essential, and it's never too early to begin those conversations.

Other common contributing factors to inflammation include smoking, obesity, and even high stress levels.

“We know people are more likely to have heart attacks on Monday morning before returning to work,” Jones said. “It's important to prioritize overall wellness and find stress release.”

Another contributor — and a growing trend — is mental health issues, which is why it's important from primary care providers to address things like depression, anxiety, and trauma/posttraumatic stress disorder, “which can directly increase inflammation and thereby increase cardiovascular risk,” Spatz said.

The role of adequate sleep and rest is also key. Studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation contributes to inflammation. Coaching patients on good sleep hygiene — dark, cool rooms, shutting down screens an hour before bed, and a regular bedtime — can all be a part of your toolkit.

While lifestyle is likely the biggest role you can address with your patients when it comes to reducing inflammation that might lead to heart disease, don't overlook preexisting conditions.

“Autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are hard on the body,” said Jim Liu, MD, a cardiologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Upper Arlington, Ohio. “Dysregulation is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, so it's important that your patients have those conditions under control, too.”

While addressing these conditions is essential, sometimes you'll need to add medications to the mix.

“There are also several pharmacological classes that lower inflammation,” Spatz said. “Statins not only lower cholesterol but they also lower inflammation. In doing so, they reduce plaque progression and stabilize existing plaque, so it doesn't rupture.”

Other medications can play a role in inflammation reduction, too.

“Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication typically used for pericarditis and gout,” Spatz said.

Clinical trials, however, have shown colchicine also helps reduce cardiovascular events in patients discharged from the hospital after acute coronary syndrome and in with chronic coronary disease, Spatz said. Also, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have anti-inflammatory effects, which may contribute to their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, he said.

Another preventative is getting an annual flu shot, especially in the case of patients with autoimmune disease.

“This is a recommendation from the American College of Cardiology,” said Liu. Research shows that when patients understand flu prevention is linked to heart attack prevention, they're more likely to seek the annual vaccine.

Finally, whenever you believe a patient is likely to be suffering chronic inflammation and more likely to therefore suffer a heart-related incident, referring them on to your cardiologist partners is the right move.

“It's really never too early for that,” said Liu. “If you're wondering if they should have bigger preventative measures, or if they show any risk factors, it's fine to send them on to a specialist.”

Jones agrees with this. “Most primary care physicians can handle the garden variety of high cholesterol,” she said. “But if they're on a statin and their numbers are still sky high, consider a cardiologist.”

Likewise, if your patients' triglycerides are high, it may be a harbinger of a predisposition. “A specialist might have more time to dig into a patient's history and lifestyle, and uncover a contributing factor,” said Jones. “These can be tough conversations to have with patients, but it's smart to act before they develop coronary disease.”

Among six distinct patterns of substance use identified in young adults in the United States in 2019, nicotine vaping and cannabis smoking were the most common, new research showed. Additionally, stress, boredom, and loneliness were linked to specific substance use patterns.

“Understanding these patterns is important for developing intervention strategies that are responsive to specific substance use on a given day,” the investigators wrote.

“Just-in-time or adaptive interventions that aim to be delivered during moments of stress, boredom, or loneliness, and help individuals to identify and develop alternative coping strategies in that moment may be particularly salient for reducing high-risk patterns of cannabis use,” they added.

This study was led by Rebecca J. Evans-Polce, PhD, Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was published online on April 29 in Addictive Behaviors.

This study relied on self-reported substance use data, which may be affected by social desirability bias or memory recall issues. Additionally, it focused on individuals with a mean age of 19 years and was conducted in 2019, potentially limiting the generalizability of the study to young adults of other ages or to different time periods. Low prevalence hindered the inclusion of substance use beyond alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine/tobacco.

This study was funded by research grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Cancer Institute. The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 May 15, 2025  

A new tool presented at the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting may give clinicians practical and safer alternatives to risky medications for patients.

Developed as a companion to the widely cited AGS Beers Criteria, the new Alternatives List was unveiled by a panel of clinicians and researchers who spent months identifying and reviewing safer options for high-risk medications. The list has pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches and is tailored to the realities of treating geriatric patients.

Originally updated in 2023, the AGS Beers Criteria outlines medications that may be inappropriate for use in older adults who are not receiving end-of-life care.

“The real goal is to help older adults feel better and function better while reducing the risk of medication harms,” said Michael Steinman, MD, geriatrician and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who led the development of the list.

Eight workgroups covered 21 conditions commonly linked to potentially inappropriate medications, such as insomnia, anxiety, and allergic rhinitis. Clinicians from a range of disciplines — pharmacy, nursing, psychology, physical therapy, and medicine — collaborated to ensure the recommendations were practical, evidence-informed, and clinically relevant.

Yet even assembling the list came with challenges.

“Treatments for common conditions are often not well-studied in older adults, and practice guidelines often give little information on how approaches to treating these conditions should be modified to meet the unique needs of older adults,” Steinman told Medscape Medical News.

Each entry on the list includes commonly used medications flagged in the Beers Criteria, safer nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic alternatives, and resources for clinicians and patients.“We focused on what clinicians actually see and treat every day,” Steinman said. “If someone's taking diphenhydramine for sleep or allergies, what should we be recommending instead? That's what this tool answers.”

During the panel, members of the AGS-convened work group shared insights from the development process.

Judith Beizer, PharmD , clinical professor of pharmacology at St. John's University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York City, highlighted treatment considerations for gastroesophageal reflux disease, a condition often treated with medications deemed high-risk for older adults.

“We know that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are often continued far longer than necessary,” Beizer said.

Beizer presented a range of safer alternatives for long-term PPI use to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, emphasizing first-line nonpharmacologic strategies such as avoiding trigger foods, elevating the head of the bed, and modifying meal timing.

When pharmacologic intervention is necessary, Beizer recommended transitioning to H2 blockers like famotidine or using antacids with alginic acid while tapering patients off PPIs.

“It's not just about stopping the medication,” she said. “It's about doing so thoughtfully and supporting the patient through the transition.”

The panel also addressed nocturia, another condition in older adults that is often treated with desmopressin, a drug the Beers Criteria advises avoiding due to the risk for hyponatremia.

Instead of using this drug, clinicians should conduct a comprehensive review of underlying causes of nocturia using the SCREeN approach, which examines sleep disorders, cardiovascular health, renal function, endocrine issues, neurologic conditions, and medication side effects, Beizer said.

“Nocturia is a symptom, not a diagnosis,” she said. “We have to explore the root cause before prescribing.”

Alternative approaches to treating nocturia include bladder retraining, fluid management, and, in certain cases, pharmacologic agents such as beta-3 agonists or, for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. For women, Beizer noted that vaginal estrogen could be beneficial.

Steinman said that the tool is not just about safer prescribing but about creating a more individualized approach to care.

“Deprescribing is not just about stopping a medication — it's about communication and trust,” he said. “Sometimes a potentially inappropriate medication is still the right choice, but that decision should come after weighing risks, exploring safer alternatives, and engaging in shared decision-making.”

But implementing alternatives — especially nondrug strategies — can be difficult in time-constrained primary care settings. Steinman acknowledged this reality but offered solutions.

“The list is designed to be easy to use in busy practice settings,” he said.

In some cases, nonpharmacologic strategies can take longer to explain than simply writing a prescription, he said. But clinicians can hand patients off to nurses or other staff to offer more detailed explanations.

 May 15, 2025  

We've long known that migraine is an insidious disease. Patients with a variety of existing illnesses — atopic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and sleep and/or psychiatric disorders — are at a risk for migraine. The revelation that migraine, a neurologic, life-altering disorder, has comorbidities isn't new. What is new, said Stephen Landy, MD, a neurologist and headache specialist, is that certain diseases and disorders can predispose patients to migraine — instead of the other way around, something new research has now shown.

Here, Landy, director of the Tupelo Headache Center, Tupelo, Mississippi, and clinical professor in the Department of Neurology at The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, discussed the implications of this study, recently published in the European Journal of Neurology.

Medscape Medical News: Can you explain what this paper says?

Landy: The authors combed through 38 studies, based on registry, insurance, and/or cohort data, looking for significant risk for migraine among various preexisting conditions. Atopic conditions were strongly associated with migraine development. New-onset migraine was also strongly connected to psychiatric and sleep disorders.

In fact, asthma and depression were found to be bidirectional — one can be associated with the other and vice versa. The cardiovascular connection also could be bidirectional, meaning a connection or interaction exists between the entities in a two-way manner.

Medscape Medical News: Were you surprised by these findings?

Landy: No. Preexisting disease states can activate migraine and can present before migraine does.

Medscape Medical News: Migraine already has been connected with many diseases, correct?

Landy: Yes, many, at least 24, including stroke, epilepsy, and endometriosis.

Medscape Medical News: Why do you think there are so many migraine comorbidities?

Landy: The body has interconnecting vascular and neurologic systems: Neurovascular, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and so on. And migraine is heterogeneous: It can follow different pathways to the brain's pain receptors, which is why all migraine medications are not effective on all patients, including the calcitonin gene–related peptide inhibitors.

Medscape Medical News: Will everyone who develops one of these disorders develop migraine?

Landy: No. If a person doesn't have a predisposition to migraine, it won't develop.

Medscape Medical News: Please explain that.

Landy: A shared gene, or genes, between the comorbidity and migraine is key to development. A comorbidity develops frequently due to genetic, environmental, and social influences and behavior. So if someone doesn't have that genetic predisposition, they are less likely to develop migraine but could have migraine-like symptoms because these symptoms may activate a response in the neural network, similar to migraine.

Medscape Medical News: What concerns you about these authors' findings?

Landy: A main concern is that patients may develop migraine progression, from episodic — fewer than 14 monthly headache days— to more than 15 monthly headache days, with 8 of those 15 considered to be migraine. Migraine frequency can increase if not properly diagnosed and treated. Once it becomes chronic, the patient's quality of life will be sorely affected: Missed work days, missed social events, let alone dealing with the pain.

Another concern is that a missed migraine diagnosis or a misdiagnosis in a patient with comorbidities becomes more critical because both diseases may progress without proper treatment. The longer one disease is left inappropriately treated or not diagnosed, a concern is the odds of developing migraine increase.

Patients may rely on over-the-counter (OTC) medications to deal with their headache pain. The more they rely on OTC medications, the less effective those medications may be. The brain is increasingly overreacting to the pain stimuli. There is an exaggeration of response because the incoming stimuli increasingly activates the trigeminal nociceptive system, which transmits sensory information, like pain. This constant activation can make a patient more refractory to treatment.

Medscape Medical News: What should primary care physicians (PCPs) do for their patients with migraine?

Landy: First, all patients, especially women, as more women report migraine, should be screened for migraine. Physicians, especially general practitioners, need to take a complete and comprehensive history. Migraine has a genetic component, so getting a family history is critical. An important question physicians should ask is whether the patient is experiencing cutaneous allodynia. Cutaneous allodynia is a surrogate clinical marker of central sensitization. So ask the patient if it hurts to take a shower, to comb their hair, and to shave because these activities shouldn't hurt. It is an augmentation of pain perception for the patient.

Also ask about depression, anxiety, noncephalic pain and fibromyalgia, and sleep disorders, especially if the patient has obesity. Gastrointestinal disorders should be a consideration in all patients with migraine. Once the physician diagnoses migraine, consider referring the patient for further headache evaluation.

Medscape Medical News: What is the takeaway for this paper?

Landy: This paper is likely the first of its kind to identify patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary issues and so on with new-onset migraine. This paper shows that PCPs and specialists should screen every patient for migraine. We are trying to figure out a way to evaluate and diagnose comorbidities in a better way. The evidence this paper produced is the reason we should do that.

 May 15, 2025  

That Americans today report sitting for an average of more than 9 hours a day, despite all we know about how harmful this can be, is a true testament to the universal instinct to kick the can down the line when it comes to personal health.

Mountains of evidence tell us that an overly sedentary lifestyle can take a toll on the heart and brain and can elevate cancer risk. A 2024 JAMA study of nearly a half-million people over a dozen years found that sitting most of the day at work leads to a 16% higher risk for early death.

But hey, these are all longer-term dangers and are both tempting and easy to ignore when faced with the immediacy of the deadlines, meetings, emails, and doomscrolling that can keep us glued to chairs and sofas for hours at a time.

As research has begun to look more closely at the mechanisms causing some of the more well-documented effects of prolonged sitting, newer findings connecting certain movement patterns to the body's ability to build muscle provide a compelling reason to get up and move.

One element making get-up-and-move logic truly work often gets short shrift in relation to all the other recs about physical activity and long periods of sitting: Protein synthesis.

Daniel Moore, PhD, associate professor in muscle physiology at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, jokes that he essentially studies an old adage: Use it or lose it.

In 2022, Moore published the first study on prolonged sitting and amino acid utilization, in which he found that taking regular, short walking or squatting breaks in the hours after eating improved the body's ability to turn dietary proteins into the building blocks of muscle. Though his results were based on a small group of just 12 people, the effect was consistent and large, and also lines up with 2019 findings that showed a 27% decrease in this muscle fueling when people were forced to reduce their daily steps by 90%.

Plenty of previous attempts to understand the more immediate effects of sitting have focused on diet and metabolism, or the body's ability under different conditions to utilize what we fuel it with, explained Janice Thompson, PhD, emeritus honorary professor of public health, nutrition, and exercise at the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England, who wasn't involved with Moore's study. It's just that protein never gets the spotlight over carbohydrates and fats.

Of the three major macronutrients, “we predominantly use protein for building and repair,” said Thompson. “That's its primary purpose, whereas carbohydrates and fats predominantly provide us with energy.” Because of this, carbohydrates and fats play significant roles in controlling blood sugar levels, which makes them key catalysts for the sort of later-in-life cardiovascular issues tied to sitting (and therefore key research targets).

Even so, said Thompson, proteins represent “an exciting other piece of the puzzle,” in the interconnected story of metabolic health. Research like Moore's is essential to completing the big picture.

In fact, parts of Moore's findings closely mirror what other researchers have found about the importance of muscle movement itself in metabolic output. Previous studies on glycemic control have found that “any sort of muscle contraction has what we call an insulin-like effect,” said Thompson. “There's something about that muscle contraction that's quite critical.”

That something is the control of blood flow throughout the body. If blood vessels are like the train tracks on which nutrients and other tools navigate the body to ensure every worksite has all the supplies it needs to go without breaks, muscles are the steam-powered engines, keeping everything moving as long as they are. This also means that standing, unfortunately, just won't cut it as a helpful intervention for any of the harmful metabolic effects of sitting.

Building muscle isn't just for bodybuilders, explained Stuart Phillips, PhD, professor of kinesiology and the director of the Physical Activity Centre of Excellence at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, who wasn't involved with Moore's study. Protein synthesis, the final stage of the process that transforms what we ingest into muscle mass, is an ongoing necessity as damaged proteins are flushed from the same muscles. This turnover process is essential for everyday muscle function, but “to drive it and store protein, you have to do some form of movement,” said Phillips.

So how much movement is enough? The answer, according to Moore and Phillips, isn't so simple. The last few years of exercise science have ultimately taught us that “it's not just about how much we move during the day, but when we move,” said Moore. That's why he and others who study movement patterns most often recommend what are now widely called “activity snacks,” short yet regular bursts of movement throughout the day that successfully counteract the effects of sitting (yep, they boost cardiovascular health, too).

But not all snacktivity — a word right from the literature — is created equal. In Moore's study, which looked at twice-hourly breaks of either a 2-minute walk or 15 squats, the squats activated an additional biological pathway for protein synthesis that wasn't present in the walkers.

It's possible, he said, that this reflects the enhanced benefits of resistance exercise compared to everyday movements, which the body may be more used to. Other, creative ways to engage the muscles that don't move much at a desk, like lunges, jumping jacks, or even dance breaks, are totally viable options.

As Thompson suggests, let's put the spotlight on protein here.

How much protein should one eat? General recommendations are 0.8 g per kg of body weight (a kg equals 2.2 pounds, so a 220-pound person would need 80 g of protein daily by that measure,) but research suggests higher amounts may be better.

One small study split women into two groups, high-protein intake (2.5 g per kg of bodyweight) and low-protein intake (0.9 g per kg of bodyweight), with both groups performing the same 8-week resistance training program. Both groups increased strength at similar rates, but the high-protein group added more than triple the muscle than the low-protein group, with fat mass decreasing in the high-protein group and remaining unchanged in the low-protein group.

A 2024 JAMA study of more than 8000 people over 10 years found higher protein intake was associated with lower mortality rates, particularly in older age (the study also looked at older people with kidney disease — higher protein intake also benefitted them). The type of protein — animal, plant, or both — didn't matter.

A January 2025 study of middle-age and older people with type 2 diabetes and low fitness markers found that higher protein intake may improve muscle mass, low strength, and physical performance. One group ate 0.8-1 g/kg daily for 12 weeks, the other ate 1.2-1.5 g/kg. The high-protein group showed “significant improvement” in handgrip strength and physical performance, while the lower-protein group saw declines.

The combination of protein intake and even the bare minimum “exercise snacks” can still be helpful to those who sit all day. But what's important is that it doesn't take much. In particular, for older adults with more sedentary lives than the 20-somethings included in Moore's study, studies have shown that small bits of movement can make even more pronounced differences when it comes to functions such as mobility and heart health. This is probably true for protein synthesis as well, Moore added. That's a great reason to get out of the chair at any age.

A meta-analysis found that paediatric patients with Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli–associated haemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) and neurologic complications who received eculizumab did not show a significant improvement in neurologic outcomes compared with those who received standard supportive care, despite eculizumab being more commonly used for these patients.

""While eculizumab may offer benefits for specific subgroups, current evidence does not support its routine use to improve neurological outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Rachele Spagnol, University of Padua, Padua, Italy, and was published online on May 08, 2025, in European Journal of Pediatrics.

The included studies were retrospective in nature, which may have introduced potential biases. They also had small sample sizes and short follow-up durations, which limited the ability to assess long-term neurologic outcomes. Additionally, the heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria and neurologic outcome assessment across studies may have affected result comparability.

Nearly 19 million US children live with at least one parent meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition; DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorder (SUD), representing one quarter of all US children in 2023. Over 6.1 million of these children have parents with comorbid SUD and mental illness, making them particularly at risk for adverse childhood experiences.

“Children exposed to parental SUD are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes than their peers without parental SUD exposure, including early substance use initiation, substance-related problems, and mental health disorders...These findings signal the need for more attention at the federal, state, and local levels on the children and families affected by addiction. Evidence-based, family-based treatments for SUD and mental illness can prevent adverse health consequences in this population,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Sean Esteban McCabe, PhD, Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking, and Health, University of Michigan School of Nursing in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was published online in JAMA Pediatrics.

According to the authors, the study faced limitations common to large-scale national surveys, including potential sampling bias, selection bias, and self-report bias. Additionally, the number of offsprings in households was truncated at three or more, suggesting that the estimates represented the lower bound of youths exposed to parental SUD.

This study was supported by grants RO1DA031160 and RO1DA043691 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health. McCabe reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse during the conduct of the study. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

 May 15, 2025  

MÁLAGA, Spain — An online obesity clinic named Embla was associated with weight loss like that seen in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of semaglutide, but with less than half of the semaglutide dose, according to new real-world data.

Average weight loss reached 16.7% after 64 weeks' use of the digital health platform, which combines tailored semaglutide dosing with intensive behavioral therapy delivered via an app. In clinical trials of semaglutide, the dose was 2.4 mg/wk, but patients in the present study used an average of 1 mg/wk. Similar mean weight loss was observed across baseline body mass index (BMI) classes and with all medication doses.

“This [study] showed us that combining an intensive behavioral intervention within an e-health weight management clinic can reproduce some of the results we see in confirmatory trials but in the context of a real-world cohort and with far less medication used,” said lead researcher Henrik Gudbergsen, MD, chief medical officer at Embla and general practitioner.

“The intensive behavioral therapy is key, and it goes a long way when you want to lose weight,” Gudbergsen added. He presented the findings at European Congress on Obesity (ECO) 2025. Publication of the study in The Lancet Digital Health is pending, but a preprint version is available.

Real-world data on semaglutide use in digital weight-loss interventions remain limited. Studies in this setting often show less weight loss than in RCTs of semaglutide and rarely report the details of lifestyle interventions or dosing patterns, said Gudbergsen. Real-world data also suggest that few patients follow the dose titration used in clinical trials, and most stay on lower doses than the standard 2.4-mg once-weekly dose, he added.

This study of the Embla platform evaluated the effects of combining video and chat-based coaching with diet, exercise, and psychological support using cognitive-behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. Embla users interact with a multidisciplinary team, including doctors, nurses, and psychologists. The artificial intelligence–powered app also tracks weight, medication, physical activity, and patient-reported outcomes.

Semaglutide was prescribed to participants using a personalized, treat-to-target approach, titrated based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was percentage weight change at 64 weeks. The average weekly semaglutide dose was a key secondary outcome.

A total of 2694 participants with a BMI ≥ 27 were enrolled. At 64 weeks, 465 participants remained in the study. “Although this is a large dropout [rate] after 1 year in more conventional RCT terms, it is actually very good for a real-world intervention,” Gudbergsen said in response to an audience comment by practitioner and semaglutide drug trialist Donna Ryan, MD, professor emerita at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Mean weight loss after 64 weeks was 16.7% (95% CI, 17.4%-16.0%) with an average semaglutide dose of 1.02 mg/wk (SD, 0.56). Women had 17.6% (95% CI, 18.4%-16.9%) and men had 13.4% (95% CI, 14.3%-12.5%) weight loss.

The app captured engagement metrics, and Gudbergsen noted that women tended to interact with it more frequently. “We do see a higher engagement among women and a tendency for women to engage more in communities. This might explain some of the differences between the cohorts,” he pointed out.

Weight loss was approximately similar across baseline BMI categories for the first 6 months. Participants with a BMI of 27-29.9 lost 10.8% (95% CI, 12.7%-8.8%), those with a BMI of 30-34.9 lost 15.9% (95% CI, 16.6%-15.1%), those with a BMI of 35-39.9 lost 17.5% (95% CI, 18.2%-16.7%), and those with a BMI of ≥ 40 lost 17.2% (95% CI, 18.2%-16.2%). “Then there's a split, with people with a baseline BMI between 27 and 30 losing slightly less than those with a BMI above 30,” said Gudbergsen.

Weight-loss outcomes remained consistent across semaglutide dose levels. For a dose of 0.25 mg/wk, weight loss was 17.3% (95% CI, 18.5%-16.0%); for 0.5 mg/wk, 17.3% (95% CI, 18.4%-16.2%); for 0.75 mg/wk, 18.1% (95% CI, 19.4%-16.7%); and for 1 mg/wk, 17.6% (95% CI, 18.6%-16.5%).

Weight loss of at least 5% and 10% was achieved by 98% and 82% of participants, respectively, over the 64 weeks. About 29% of participants who reached 64 weeks titrated above the 1-mg semaglutide dose.

When asked about adverse event reporting, Gudbergsen responded, “There's spontaneous reporting, but in addition, the healthcare professionals ask patients if they've experienced adverse events.”

According to the preprint, depending on the severity of the adverse event report, the participant could either be “maintained at current dose, reduced to a dose in between standard doses, reduced to the previous titration dose, or terminated until the adverse event was properly handled.”

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Jason Halford, PhD, head of the School of Psychology at the University of Leeds, Leeds, England, and past president of the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said, “It shows an important element of weight management: That is, the support.

“If you've got an app, and there's somebody to provide help with behavioral challenges through interacting with the app, then that's providing the support we need,” Halford added.

“These drugs are not meant to be given on their own. This [study] shows the benefit of additional obesity support mechanisms or tools we can bring to bear,” he said. “Not only do we find people lose similar amounts of weight on a lower amount of drug, but it might also protect them when they come off the drug because there's lasting change. If you don't get the behavior change in while you're on the drug, once the drug is not there helping you, you're set up for failure.”

Embla costs users €150 per month to start, while patients can shift to a maintenance program once appropriate.

Embla funded the research. Gudbergsen reported being an employee of Embla and having stock options in the company. Ryan reported receiving consulting honoraria from companies, including AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biohaven, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly, Nestlé, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Regeneron, and others. Halford reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Changing the default for a behavioral change smoking cessation program from opt in to opt out resulted in large gains for referrals to treatment in new research. However, gains in referrals didn't lead to gains in quitting smoking.

Scott Sherman, MD, MPH, with VA New York Harbor Healthcare System in New York City presented his team's poster at Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) 2025 Annual Meeting in Hollywood, Florida.

“This change, which did not require additional staff, had a profound effect on care,” the authors wrote. But Sherman told Medscape Medical News he was disappointed when they found out with surveys at 2 years and electronic health record information that increased referrals and engagement didn't lead to the ultimate goal of quitting.

Behavioral treatments for helping patients quit smoking are effective but underused, and most use an opt-in approach so patients have to enroll, the authors wrote. This opt-out approach refers everyone to treatment unless they choose not to participate.

The researchers conducted a cluster randomized trial at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System and randomized all nursing assistants and registered nurses (NAs/RNs) either to an opt-in or opt-out approach.

In the opt-in approach group (n = 1975), providers got clinical reminders annually to refer patients who smoke either to the New York State Quitline program or to a text messaging service. Interested patients completed a referral form. In the opt-out group (n = 749), the reminder instructed the NAs/RNs to tell people who smoke that they would be automatically referred to the Quitline or to text messaging unless they opted out by completing a form.

They found people seen by NAs/RNs in the opt-out group (n = 749) were much more likely to be referred to text messaging (46% vs 6%; odds ratio [OR], 21.0; 95% CI, 8.9-49.8) or the Quitline (45% vs 5%; OR, 29.2; 95% CI, 11.5-74.2) than those seen in the opt-in approach.

Those in the opt-out group were also much more likely to participate in text messaging (43% vs 5%; OR, 23.5; 95% CI, 9.7-56.9) and more likely to engage in counseling through the Quitline (5% vs 0.7%; OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 4.1-19.5) than patients in the opt-in group.

Patients were just as likely in either group to report they were strongly encouraged to receive a referral (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.87-2.51) and that the overall quality of discussion was very good or better (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.79-1.98). However, the researchers noted, those in the opt-out group were twice as likely to report they felt forced to receive a referral (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.14-3.68).

Jennifer Hauler, DO, a family and emergency medicine physician and chief medical officer at Premier Health in Dayton, Ohio, noted that behavioral counseling programs have proven effective in helping people to quit smoking. She told Medscape Medical News that strategies that increase referrals to these programs are of high interest especially when they don't require additional staffing.

However, she said, “While the study highlights that no additional staff resources were required, it does not quantify the potential increased costs incurred by the Quitline or cessation programs.”

Hauler added that combination with pharmacotherapy may boost results.

“The addition of pharmacotherapy to behavioral interventions has been shown to enhance cessation outcomes,” she said.

Sherman said he hopes to tweak the protocol in future research to see if changes could bring better results in quitting.

“We got them to treatment, so why didn't it work?” he said he asks himself.

He said there are still messages in the work for physicians. One is that “simple changes to the way we deliver care can have profound effects,” Sherman said. “The only thing we did was change the default.” 

More physician encouragement for patients trying to quit may also help those who have gotten as far as treatment, he said. “Patients often say that the doctor's advice really matters to them.”

Sherman said he was surprised to see that twice as many patients in the opt-out group felt forced to receive a referral.

“As a primary care doctor, I certainly don't want to force my patients to do anything, but at the same time I don't mind pushing them to do something that's really good for their health.” Finding the right balance is key, he said.

While it may seem intuitive that people would die without life-saving medications, Penn and Harvard researchers have connected losing a federally funded prescription drug assistance program and an increase in mortality. The program, called the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS), helps 14.2 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are older Americans, afford their medications. Nationally, 12.5 million people who are eligible for and enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (""dual eligibles"") automatically qualify for the LIS, which is worth about $6,200/year. 

The study, published today in New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, reveals that losing Medicaid coverage-and with it, the LIS-was associated with significant increases in mortality among low-income Medicare beneficiaries. 

When Medicare beneficiaries lose Medicaid, which happens to more than 900,000 people each year, they also risk losing the LIS and therefore, being able to afford the medicines they need.""

Eric T. Roberts, PhD, lead author, associate professor of General Internal Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and a Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics Senior Fellow

The study included nearly 1 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries whose Medicaid coverage ended. Due to program rules, the exact month people lose Medicaid impacts when they are removed from the LIS. 

The researchers compared two groups: individuals who lost Medicaid from January to June who were removed from LIS by the following January (7–12 months later), and those who lost Medicaid from July to December lost LIS the next January (13–18 months later). This allowed the team to compare mortality rates during the period when some had lost LIS and others had not. 

Mortality was 4 percent higher among individuals who lost the LIS earlier than those who retained it for a longer period. Over the study period, more than 2,900 people died. The risks were even greater among subgroups of people who had greater clinical needs and on more expensive medications. For example, mortality was 22 percent higher among people using HIV antiretroviral therapy. 

The researchers found that over one half of individuals who lost Medicaid regained it within one year, suggesting that many were dropped from Medicaid despite remaining eligible. 

""These findings show that helping low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid stay enrolled and retain the LIS can save lives since it preserves access to essential medications,"" said senior author José F. Figueroa, MD, MPH, an associate professor of health policy and management at Harvard Chan School. 

The authors note that recent increases in Medicaid coverage losses among older adults raise concerns about potential losses of the LIS. Added Roberts, ""As policymakers consider major changes to the Medicaid program, preserving Medicaid coverage for older adults is critical to ensuring that they keep the LIS.""

To help neurologists, clinicians and families understand the current evidence for a new gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy called delandistrogene moxeparvovec, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has issued an Evidence in Focus article, published May 14, 2025, online in Neurology®.

AAN Evidence in Focus articles highlight the strength of the current evidence for new therapies for neurological conditions. Their purpose is not to provide recommendations for practice, but rather to provide an overview of the available data and a framework to support care. This article reviews evidence available for the efficacy and safety of delandistrogene moxeparvovec.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which primarily affects those of male sex, is an inherited genetic condition that causes muscle weakness. Symptoms usually appear between the ages of two and four and become more severe over time. People with this disease are missing a protein called dystrophin that helps maintain muscle health.

Delandistrogene moxeparvovec is a one-time gene therapy infusion approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2024 for use in those age four and older. The therapy uses a disabled virus to inject a miniaturized version of the gene that makes a small form of dystrophin into the muscle cells.

""While the prognosis for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has improved in recent decades thanks to corticosteroids and supportive care, significant functional limitations persist for those affected by the condition,"" said author Maryam Oskoui, MD, of McGill University in Quebec, Canada, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology. ""Recent advances in genetic therapies for this disease have brought hope to many, with several gene replacement therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials, and one-delandistrogene moxeparvovec-already approved by the FDA. This Evidence in Focus article offers a timely and objective overview of the existing data and explores key clinical considerations surrounding the use of delandistrogene moxeparvovec. However, it is important to acknowledge that evidence supporting its potential effectiveness and safety remains limited.""

The Evidence in Focus article states that both Class I studies of delandistrogene moxeparvovec failed to meet their primary outcome measures related to motor function, a person's ability to control movements.

Research showed the therapy may possibly slow the decline of other measures of motor function by a small amount. However, the article states it is difficult to know how much of this benefit is due to the gene therapy and how much may additionally be influenced by the high dose steroid medications that are taken with the therapy.

The article highlights that neurologists and other clinicians treating people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy should be aware of the limitations of this treatment and the need to monitor and counsel patients for side effects including muscle inflammation and related muscle pain and weakness, heart inflammation, low blood platelet count, liver injury and possible death.

Based on the current research, it has yet to be determined whether the therapy will extend a person's life or improve their quality of life. The therapy does not cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Those considering this gene therapy should ask their doctor if insurance will pay for the treatment. The one-time infusion costs $3.2 million, not including other costs related to the infusion in the hospital and the close follow-up required.

""Additional clinical studies that closely follow people receiving this treatment are essential to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of delandistrogene moxeparvovec and to inform the understanding of the benefits and risks of this therapy across a person's lifetime,"" said author James J. Dowling, MD, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.

The article was developed with financial support from the American Academy of Neurology.

A new study uncovers how working at 35,000 feet may disrupt DNA repair and immune function in flight attendants, offering fresh insights into the health risks faced by cabin crews and the urgent need for stronger protections.

 Study: Suppressed DNA repair capacity in flight attendants after air travel. Image Credit: Feruzbek / Shutterstock.com

An increased cancer risk and compromised reproductive health among flight attendants (FAs) could be due to impaired genomic stability and altered immune responses linked to their air travel. A recent study in the journal Scientific Reports investigates whether alterations in DNA damage and repair in FAs are related to flight travel.

FAs experience strong radiological and toxin exposure from cosmic radiation and cabin air. These workers are also exposed to many biological, physical, and psychosocial stressors through difficult interactions with passengers or quick turnaround times between flights.

As compared to the general population, epidemiological studies have reported that FAs are at a greater risk of developing breast and skin cancer, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and experiencing adverse reproductive outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms associated with this increased cancer risk and other health issues in FAs remain unclear.

Previous studies have reported that environmental and occupational exposure to DNA-damaging agents can lead to transcriptional stress, cell death, genomic instability, stress, and senescence. Occupational hazards may also increase the risk of DNA damage by inducing inflammatory responses that produce endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS).

In humans, many DNA repair mechanisms, such as mismatch repair (MMR), base excision repair (BER), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and nucleotide excision repair (NER), are inherently present to protect the native genome from DNA-damaging agents. However, a defective DNA repair system increases the risk of several diseases, particularly cancer.

This preliminary investigation hypothesized that altered DNA repair and immune responses are the potential underlying mechanisms responsible for increased cancer risk in FAs. To test this hypothesis, the effect of air travel on DNA damage and repair responses in FAs was assessed.

Blood samples from FAs were collected before flight (BF) and after flight (AF). DNA repair capacity (DRC) for DNA repair pathways, including NHEJ, BER, NER, MMR, and HR, was assessed using functional high-throughput, fluorescence multiplex-based host cell reactivation (FM-HCR) assays. FA blood samples were analyzed using an unprecedented method of DNA repair based on host cell reactivation technology in resting lymphocytes.

Blood samples for BF measurements were collected five to 12 hours before flight departure from Boston Logan International Airport, and blood samples for AF assessments were collected within 1.5 hours of landing at the same airport. The duration between departure and return varied between 27 hours and 10 days, depending on each individual's flight schedule.

This pilot study included a small sample of nine FAs, three of whom were male and six females between 24 and 64 years of age, were included in the research. All study participants were White and non-smokers, whereas five individuals were considered overweight. The employment duration as an FA ranged from two to 41 years.

Employment duration and age were associated with chronic mutagenic exposure and disease risks. Differential blood cell counts indicated the impact of flight travel on the immune system.

There was no significant difference in the blood cell count landscape between the BF and AF samples. However, lymphocyte counts were significantly higher in AF samples, suggesting an inflammatory response associated with flight travel-related exposures.

Higher basophil counts were also observed in AF blood samples; while a statistically significant increasing trend was noted in a subgroup of FAs (after excluding two individuals with notably high counts), the trend did not reach statistical significance when all nine participants were included due to high variability. Likewise, no statistically significant difference in the average basal DNA damage was observed between BF and AF samples.

DNA repair kinetics were measured in response to secondary exposure to a DNA-damaging agent. A statistically insignificant trend towards a marginal increase in the time needed to repair initial genomic DNA damage was observed in AF samples compared to BF samples using the CometChip assay. Thus, increased DNA damage could be due to impaired DNA repair, particularly linked to impaired single-strand breaks (SSBs) repair by BER processing, which may arise from oxidative DNA damage.

Although most ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage was repaired within one hour, considerable heterogeneity in repair kinetics data was observed. The paper detailed that while some individuals' after-flight samples showed slower repair kinetics compared to their before-flight samples, others showed more rapid kinetics, highlighting inter-individual differences and varied responses to air travel.

Although no significant difference in transfection efficiency between BF and AF samples was observed, the FM-HCR analysis identified alterations in DRC in some pathways in AF and BF samples. As compared to the BF samples, a significant reduction in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and IR-induced plasmid damage was observed in the AF samples.

The findings from this pilot investigation, which involved a small number of participants, indicated alterations in blood cell count, decreased activity in repairing oxidative and IR-induced genomic lesions, and heterogeneity in repair kinetics in AF samples of FAs as compared to their BF samples. These observations suggest a potential mechanistic link where flight-related exposures might simultaneously promote inflammatory processes that increase oxidative DNA damage while also suppressing the DNA repair mechanisms that protect against such damage, contributing to genomic instability. These results should be interpreted with caution, given the study's scale.

This initial study serves as the foundation for future large-scale studies on in-flight crew, which are needed to confirm these preliminary findings and may support the development of informative policies to protect FAs from unnecessary health risks.

A recent study published in Life Metabolism has uncovered a surprising new player in the body's ability to regulate blood sugar after eating. Researchers from Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Namur found that an enzyme called hyaluronidase-1 (HYAL1) plays a crucial role in suppressing excessive glucose production in the liver, particularly after meals. This discovery could open new doors for treating metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, where blood sugar control is impaired.

The study focused on hyaluronan (HA), a sugar molecule that naturally surges in the bloodstream after eating. While HA is known for its roles in tissue structure and inflammation, this research reveals its unexpected connection to glucose metabolism. The team discovered that HYAL1, which breaks down HA in the liver, helps shut down gluconeogenesis—the process by which the liver produces glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Normally, gluconeogenesis is suppressed after meals to prevent blood sugar spikes, but in diabetes, it remains overactive.

Using genetically modified mice, the researchers found that deleting the Hyal1 gene led to higher glucose production, especially in mice fed a high-fat diet. Conversely, boosting HYAL1 levels in the liver improved glucose tolerance and reduced gluconeogenesis, even in insulin-resistant animals.
Digging deeper, the team uncovered the mechanism: HYAL1's breakdown of HA redirects cellular Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), reducing a key modification (O-GlcNAcylation) on mitochondrial proteins that are key in energy metabolism. This lowers ATP production, making it harder for the liver to sustain glucose synthesis. Importantly, this regulation remains functional even in insulin-resistant conditions, making it an attractive target for therapies.
While more research is needed to quantify the contribution of this pathway, the study provides a fresh perspective on how the body fine-tunes glucose metabolism beyond the classic insulin-glucagon system. With diabetes affecting millions worldwide, this research highlights an overlooked yet vital piece of the metabolic puzzle that could lead to new strategies for managing diabetes, such as enhancing HYAL1 activity or manipulating HA levels after meals.

How cancer patients relying on daratumumab feel physically before starting the therapy can predict how long they will live and how well they will respond to the anti- multiple myeloma (MM) drug, according to a new study published in the European Journal of Haematology.

The study analyzed data from 1,804 patients enrolled in three large-scale clinical trials-MAIA, POLLUX, and CASTOR. Across these trials, the median patient age was 66 years, and 44% were female. About half of the patients were randomly assigned to receive daratumumab-containing therapy, while the other half received standard treatments without daratumumab.

Patients were asked, before starting treatment, to complete a standardized questionnaire assessing their ability to carry out everyday tasks. This patient-reported measure of physical function was then used to examine whether it could predict survival and response to daratumumab-based therapy.

The responses revealed that patients with lower scores benefited more from daratumumab, lived longer, and had a lower risk of disease progression. This is the first study to demonstrate that patient-reported physical function at treatment initiation can predict which patients derive the greatest survival benefit from daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody widely used in the treatment of multiple myeloma.""

Dr. Ahmad Abuhelwa, lead author, University of Sharjah

The study offers a simple, low-cost way to improve treatment decisions, particularly for older or frail patients. ""How well cancer patients can perform daily tasks like walking or getting dressed-is a powerful predictor of survival outcomes and treatment benefit in people with multiple myeloma receiving daratumumab-based therapies."" Dr. Abuhelwa went on.

The study found that patients who reported having more difficulty with everyday physical activities experienced the greatest benefit from daratumumab treatment. In this low physical function group, daratumumab reduced the risk of death from any cause by 47% (hazard ratio 0.53 [95% CI: 0.40–0.70], P < 0.001) and the risk of cancer progression by 66% (hazard ratio 0.34 [0.22–0.53], P < 0.001) compared to those not receiving daratumumab. A hazard ratio (HR) below 1 means the treatment group had a lower risk; for example, an HR of 0.53 corresponds to a 47% lower risk of death.

In contrast, patients who reported being physically well before treatment-the high physical function group-had less benefit. Their risk of death was reduced by only 14%, which was not statistically significant (HR 0.86 [0.62–1.19], P = 0.364) compared to those not receiving daratumumab. They did, however, experience a 47% reduction in the risk of cancer progression (HR 0.53 [0.42–0.67], P = 0.034), showing that while daratumumab was still effective in this group, the magnitude of benefit was smaller (47%) than that seen in patients with low physical function (66%).

These results held true regardless of the patient's age, sex, weight, cancer stage, doctor-assessed health score (ECOG), or number of other health problems. Interestingly, the commonly used doctor rating of a patient's general health (ECOG) did not help predict who would benefit more - but the patients' own reports of their physical function did.

""Physical function is a predictive and prognostic marker that complements ECOG-PS, supporting its use in informing therapy decisions for daratumumab-based treatments,"" the authors write.

Doctors often use the ECOG Performance Status – a scale from 0 (fully active) to 5 (dead) – to determine how well a patient is functioning. But the study, according to Dr. Abuhelwa, found that many patients classified as ""fully active"" by ECOG reported significant physical challenges themselves.

""Patient-reported scores gave a more accurate and sensitive prediction of survival and treatment effect. This highlights a critical gap-ECOG alone may not capture the full picture. We need to start listening to patients.""

The authors draw two major conclusions from their extensive analysis.

In the first, they found that patients who reported lower physical function at treatment initiation received the greatest survival benefit from daratumumab. In the second, the analysis found that patients with higher physical function showed a less pronounced treatment benefit.

""These findings were independent of traditional doctor-assessed tools, such as ECOG performance status. In fact, patient-reported scores outperformed ECOG in predicting survival outcomes. Importantly, daratumumab did not lead to more serious side effects in patients with low physical function,"" Dr. Abuhelwa points out. ""Bottom line: What patients say about their physical limitations-right at the start of therapy-provides critical, actionable insights to guide cancer treatment decisions.""

Patients with multiple myeloma are often treated with complex therapies like daratumumab – a life-prolonging monoclonal antibody that can also carry risks. Multiple myeloma is becoming an increasing global burden. In 2022, there were an estimated 188,000 new cases and 121,000 deaths worldwide. By 2045, incidence and mortality are expected to rise by 71% and 79% respectively. In the United States alone, the American Cancer Society projects approximately 36,110 new cases and 12,030 deaths from multiple myeloma in 2025.

On the importance of the study, co-author Dr. Ashley Hopkins, Associate Professor at Flinders University in Australia, said, ""This is a timely and significant contribution. It highlights how patient-centered data can meaningfully guide complex treatment decisions in oncology. The study serves as a strong reminder to health professionals to seriously consider what cancer patients say about their physical function before initiating treatment.""

Prof. Humaid Al-Shamsi, a co-author from the UAE's Burjeel Cancer Institute, added, ""This study highlights the growing importance of patient-centered care in oncology. By listening closely to how patients feel at the start of treatment, we can better personalize therapies and improve outcomes – especially for those who are older or more physically vulnerable. It's a step forward in making cancer care more precise, compassionate, and effective.""

The authors suggest their study could have wide-reaching implications. In it, they call on clinicians to incorporate patient-reported physical function into treatment planning; urge policymakers to promote the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical trials and routine care; and encourage drug developers to consider PROs when designing future cancer studies.

However, they maintained that further research and prospective studies were warranted to confirm the identified treatment benefits and explore whether they would extend to other contemporary multiple myeloma treatment regimens.

Said Dr. Abuhelwa, ""With further validation, patient-reported outcomes could become an essential part of personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving both survival and quality of life for people living with multiple myeloma.""

The research is the outcome of collaboration between scientists from H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (USA), Flinders University (Australia), the University of North Carolina (USA), and the Burjeel Cancer Institute in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Most dental offices are independent practices and often don't have access to a patient's medical history. For providing dental care, it is critical that dentists have up-to-date medical and medication histories of their patients to reduce risk during procedures and ensure the success of the treatment.

Thankam Thyvalikakath, DMD, MDS, PhD, professor and associate dean of dental informatics and digital health at the IU Indianapolis School of Dentistry and research scientist at the Regenstrief Institute, and Shuning Li, PhD, M.S., M.S., an assistant research scientist at the IU Indianapolis School of Dentistry, have developed an app, in collaboration with the technical staff at the Regenstrief Institute, that connects dentists and medical providers to health information exchanges to access a patient's medical history in a timely manner.

Typically, for each dental visit, the patient must fill out a form to update dentists regarding their latest medical history. However, it can be difficult and time-consuming for patients to recall their medical information when starting from a blank page.

There are outside factors that can negatively impact dental care, whether that's allergies, respiratory problems, or medications. Our app provides this relevant medical history, so patients don't have to remember their history each visit and so dentists don't have to comb through the patient's extensive medical records for pertinent information.""

""The app is intended for anyone to use, whether it's the patient, a small dental practice, or other medical providers,"" Dr. Li said. ""In providing real-time information access, the app facilitates direct communication between dental clinicians and patients, enhancing care coordination and patient outcomes.""

Dr. Thyvalikakath and Dr. Li received a National Institutes of Health grant to develop the app further and have partnered with the IU Innovation and Commercialization Office to disclose the technology and are currently exploring the best way to pilot the app in dental practices.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Private equity ownership improves hospital efficiency without harming care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250514/Private-equity-ownership-improves-hospital-efficiency-without-harming-care.aspx","Thu, 15 May 2025 00:52:00 GMT","

New research by ESMT Berlin and the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH) shows that private equity (PE) acquisitions lead to substantial operational efficiency gains in hospitals, challenging common public concerns. The study reveals that hospitals acquired by PE firms significantly reduce costs and administrative staff without increasing closure rates or harming patient care. 

The paper ""Private Equity in the Hospital Industry"" is co-authored by Merih Sevilir (ESMT and Halle Institute for Economic Research), Janet Gao (McDonough School of Business, Georgetown), and Yongseok Kim (Freeman School of Business, Tulane). Drawing on data from more than 1,200 hospital acquisitions in the United States between 2001 and 2018, the researchers provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of how PE ownership affects hospital survival, employment, pricing, and patient outcomes. 

The study finds that hospitals acquired by PE firms do not experience higher closure rates. Instead, they demonstrate improved operational profitability while sustaining essential medical staff levels over the long term. Cost-cutting efforts are largely concentrated in administrative roles, especially at hospitals that were formerly non-profit institutions. In these hospitals, the number of administrative staff declined by 33 percent over the long term. This highlights how private equity drives restructuring in sectors historically insulated from investor oversight and market pressures. 

""Our study shows that private equity firms do not dismantle hospitals, as is often feared. Instead, they streamline administrative structures while protecting core medical staff and services. This nuanced approach boosts efficiency without compromising patient care,"" said Merih Sevilir, professor of finance at ESMT and head of the Department of Laws, Regulations, and Factor Markets at the Halle Institute. Drawing on proprietary insurance claims data, the research finds no evidence of increased inpatient prices or a shift toward treating younger, wealthier, or healthier patients. It also detects no changes in patient demographics or health outcomes, such as mortality or readmission rates. The only notable negative impact is a decline in patient satisfaction, potentially linked to reductions in administrative staff who support non-clinical services. 

Overall, the findings suggest that private equity involvement can act as a catalyst for improving efficiency in healthcare without sacrificing medical quality, particularly through the reduction of excess administrative costs in nonprofit hospitals and the introduction of more effective operational oversight. 

The study has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Financial Economics, a peer-reviewed academic journal publishing theoretical and empirical research in financial economics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Discovery of second learning system in the brain sheds light on habit formation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250514/Discovery-of-second-learning-system-in-the-brain-sheds-light-on-habit-formation.aspx","Thu, 15 May 2025 01:42:00 GMT","

Neuroscientists at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) at UCL have discovered that the brain uses a dual system for learning through trial and error. This is the first time a second learning system has been identified, which could help explain how habits are formed and provide a scientific basis for new strategies to address conditions related to habitual learning, such as addictions and compulsions. Published today in Nature, the study in mice could also have implications for developing therapeutics for Parkinson's.

Essentially, we have found a mechanism that we think is responsible for habits. Once you have developed a preference for a certain action, then you can bypass your value-based system and just rely on your default policy of what you've done in the past. This might then allow you to free up cognitive resources to make value-based decisions about something else.""

Dr. Marcus Stephenson-Jones, Group Leader at SWC and lead author of the study

The researchers uncovered a dopamine signal in the brain that acts as a different kind of teaching signal to the one previously known. Dopamine signals in the brain were already understood to form reward prediction errors (RPE), where they signal to the animal whether an actual outcome is better or worse than expected. In this new study, the scientists discovered that, in parallel to RPE, there is an additional dopamine signal, called action prediction error (APE), which updates how often an action is performed. These two teaching signals give animals two different ways of learning to make a choice, learning to choose either the most valuable option or the most frequent option.

""Imagine going to your local sandwich shop. The first time you go, you might take your time choosing a sandwich and, depending on which you pick, you may or may not like it. But if you go back to the shop on many occasions, you no longer spend time wondering which sandwich to select and instead start picking one you like by default. We think it is the APE dopamine signal in the brain that is allowing you to store this default policy,"" explained Dr Stephenson-Jones.

The newly discovered learning system provides a much simpler way of storing information than having to directly compare the value of different options. This might free up the brain to multi-task. For example, once you have learned to drive, you can also hold a conversation with someone during your journey. While your default system is doing all the repetitive tasks to drive the car, your value-based system can decide what to talk about.

Previous research discovered the dopamine neurons needed for learning reside in three areas of the midbrain: the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and substantia nigra pars lateralis. While some studies showed that these neurons were involved in coding for reward, earlier research found that half of these neurons code for movement, but the reason remained a mystery.

RPE neurons project to all areas of the striatum apart from one, called the tail of the striatum. Whereas the movement-specific neurons project to all areas apart from the nucleus accumbens. This means that the nucleus accumbens exclusively signals reward, and the tail of the striatum exclusively signals movement.

By investigating the tail of the striatum, the team were able to isolate the movement neurons and discover their function. To test this, the researchers used an auditory discrimination task in mice, which was originally developed by scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Co first authors, Dr Francesca Greenstreet, Dr Hernando Martinez Vergara and Dr Yvonne Johansson, used a genetically encoded dopamine sensor, which showed that dopamine release in this area was not related to reward, but it was related to movement.

""When we lesioned the tail of the striatum, we found a very characteristic pattern. We observed that lesioned mice and control mice initially learn in the same way, but once they get to about 60-70% performance, i.e. when they develop a preference (for example, for a high tone go left, for a low tone, go right), then the control mice rapidly learn and develop expert performance, whereas the lesioned mice only continue to learn in a linear fashion. This is because the lesioned mice can only use RPE, whereas the control mice have two learning systems, RPE and APE, which contribute to the choice,"" explained Dr Stephenson Jones.

To further understand this, the team silenced the tail of striatum in expert mice and found that this had a catastrophic effect on their performance in the task. This showed that while in early learning animals form a preference using the value-based system based on RPE, in late learning they switch to exclusively use APE in the tail of striatum to store these stable associations and drive their choice. The team also used extensive computational modelling, led by Dr Claudia Clopath, to understand how the two systems, RPE and APE, learn together.

These findings hint at why it is so hard to break bad habits and why replacing an action with something else may be the best strategy. If you replace an action consistently enough, such as chewing on nicotine gum instead of smoking, the APE system may be able to take over and form a new habit on top of the other one.

""Now that we know this second learning system exists in the brain, we have a scientific basis for developing new strategies to break bad habits. Up until now, most research on addictions and compulsions has focused on the nucleus accumbens. Our research has opened up a new place to look in the brain for potential therapeutic targets,"" commented Dr Stephenson Jones.

This research also has potential implications for Parkinson's, which is known to be caused by the death of midbrain dopamine neurons, specifically in substantia nigra pars compacta. The type of cells that have been shown to die are movement-related dopamine neurons, which may be responsible for coding APE. This may explain why people with Parkinson's experience deficits in doing habitual behaviours such as walking, however they do not experience deficits in more flexible behaviours such as ice skating.

""Suddenly, we now have a theory for paradoxical movement in Parkinson's. The movement related neurons that die are the ones that drive habitual behaviour. And so, movement that uses the habitual system is compromised, but movement that uses your value-based flexible system is fine. This gives us a new place to look in the brain and a new way of thinking about Parkinson's,"" concluded Dr Stephenson-Jones.

The research team is now testing whether APE is really needed for habits. They are also exploring what exactly is being learned in each system and how the two work together. This research was funded by an EMBO Long-Term Fellowship (ALTF 827-2018), a Swedish Research Council International Postdoc Grant (2020-06365), the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre Core Grant from the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and Wellcome (219627/Z/19/Z), the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre PhD Programme, and a European Research Council grant (Starting #557533).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Rethinking the public health workforce for a changing world","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250515/Rethinking-the-public-health-workforce-for-a-changing-world.aspx","Thu, 15 May 2025 04:55:00 GMT","

As the U.S. continues to face complex public health challenges, a new paper published by a researcher at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health calls for a redefinition of the public health workforce-one that goes beyond traditional boundaries and acknowledges the growing number of professionals outside government agencies who contribute to public health.

Published in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), the paper argues that while government remains the backbone of public health service delivery, it is no longer sufficient to define the workforce solely by occupation or by employment within public health departments. For example, simply counting all nurses does not reveal how many are engaged specifically in public health work.

Author Heather Krasna, PhD, EdM, MS, associate dean of Career and Professional Development at Columbia Mailman School proposes an intersectional framework that classifies the public health workforce into two tiers:

The 10 Essential Public Health Services provide a framework for public health to protect and promote the health of all people in all communities. The Foundational Public Health Services are meant to apply specifically to government health departments and ""define a minimum package of public health capabilities and programs that no jurisdiction can be without."" These frameworks could be used to assess which workers contribute to these services beyond government, according to Krasna.

This innovative approach shifts the focus from job titles to job impact, effectively 'reverse engineering' the workforce definition by starting with the services delivered and identifying who delivers them-regardless of where they work. The paper emphasizes that this model allows researchers and policymakers to better understand and support the broader ecosystem of professionals contributing to the health and well-being of the population.""

Heather Krasna, PhD, EdM, MS, associate dean of Career and Professional Development at Columbia Mailman School

By embracing this expanded definition, Krasna argues, we can assess whether certain services provided by the ""core"" workforce are outsourced to the private sector to in a way which may be less cost-effective, or whether there are gaps in the workforce. With this definition, we can also develop more accurate workforce assessments, shape more effective training programs, and ensure stronger, more resilient public health systems. ""In fact, without more accurate assessments, we lack a clear understanding of who comprises the public health workforce and whether essential public services can be effectively delivered during a crisis or in the face of a future pandemic,"" observes Krasna.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Reinfections lower long COVID risk but raise cumulative burden","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250514/Reinfections-lower-long-COVID-risk-but-raise-cumulative-burden.aspx","Thu, 15 May 2025 00:07:00 GMT","

New data from Canadian healthcare workers show that while reinfections are less likely to cause long COVID, the risk stacks up, especially for those hit hard the first time or infected early in the pandemic.

Study: Long COVID risk and severity after COVID-19 infections and reinfections in Quebec healthcare workers. Image Credit: Niphon Subsri / Shutterstock

*Important notice:  medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

Can a second bout of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) be just as harmful in the long run as the first? In a study posted to the medRxiv preprint* server, Canadian researchers found that healthcare workers in Quebec had a significantly lower risk of developing long coronavirus disease (long COVID) after reinfections than after a first infection. However, the cumulative risk of long COVID increases with each additional infection, so the overall burden remains high.

Long COVID, also known as post-COVID-19 condition, is a condition marked by symptoms that persist for at least 12 weeks following a COVID-19 infection. These symptoms range from fatigue and breathlessness to memory issues and can severely affect daily life.

Globally, over 400 million people may be living with lingering effects of the virus. Despite the growing recognition of long COVID, many questions remain about who is most at risk and how this risk evolves with repeated infections.

A major challenge is that many symptoms overlap with other common conditions, making it difficult to pinpoint COVID-19 as the cause. In addition, the absence of specific diagnostic biomarkers means that long COVID is usually identified based on symptom duration and attribution by the patient. However, as newer variants of the virus continue to spread, people are more likely to experience reinfections. Therefore, understanding long COVID's true burden, especially after repeat infections, is critical.

This population-based study used a retrospective cohort design to investigate long COVID risk and severity among healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada. The research team conducted an electronic survey between May 16 and June 15, 2023, targeting workers, such as doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists, who were active in the provincial healthcare system during the pandemic.

The survey collected data on demographics, employment, infection history (including lab-confirmed infections), symptom presence and duration, severity of each COVID-19 episode, and vaccination status. The researchers also assessed ongoing symptoms and cognitive difficulties and their impact on functional status.

Long COVID was defined as symptoms attributed to COVID-19 lasting at least 12 weeks (three months), and the cases were classified as prevalent, resolved, or undetermined. Additionally, severity was graded based on whether symptoms were mild, moderate, or severe. Control groups consisting of participants who never had COVID-19 and those who had recovered within 12 weeks were also included.

To assess possible participation bias, a parallel telephone survey was conducted among 7,500 randomly selected non-respondents to the online survey and 3,000 non-vaccinated healthcare workers without email access, for a total of 10,500 participants invited to the telephone survey. This shorter survey included five questions about COVID-19 history and persistent symptoms.

Furthermore, variant information for each infection was inferred based on the timing of infection and dominant circulating strains in Quebec. The risk of long COVID was calculated based on infections occurring at least 12 weeks before survey completion, and comparisons were made between first infections and reinfections.

The study found that long COVID remains a widespread and disabling condition among healthcare workers, with about 17% of those who had COVID-19 reporting symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks. However, the risk of developing long COVID was approximately three times higher after a first infection compared to reinfections.

While the risk increased with each additional infection, up to 37% of those with three infections experienced long COVID, the likelihood of developing long COVID was significantly lower for each reinfection than for the initial episode. The highest risk was linked to the ancestral (original) strain of the virus, with decreasing risk seen for later variants, including Omicron. However, because Omicron was so prevalent, it was responsible for nearly 79% of long COVID cases.

Additionally, the severity of the initial illness also played a major role. Individuals who had severe acute COVID-19 episodes, especially those hospitalized or reporting multiple severe symptoms, were more likely to suffer long-term effects. Conversely, the risk was less than 5% for those with mild or moderate illness, whether it was a first infection or reinfection.

Among those still experiencing symptoms at the time of the survey, 43% had moderate and 33% had severe long COVID, based on self-reported symptom intensity. These individuals reported a higher number of symptoms, with many experiencing fatigue, cognitive issues like brain fog, post-exertional malaise, and shortness of breath. Some cases persisted for over a year, and a small fraction lasted three years or more. The researchers also observed seven distinct groups of symptoms (symptom clusters), with systemic, neurocognitive, and respiratory problems being most common in severe cases.

The survey's low response rate was a limitation, as it may have overestimated long COVID prevalence, though a validation study supported the main findings. The researchers also acknowledged that the reliance on self-reported data may have introduced recall bias and that the study population was predominantly middle-aged, white, and female, which may affect generalizability.

High vaccination rates in the cohort (with 78.6% having received three or more doses) may have contributed to the lower risk of long COVID following Omicron infections.

Overall, the study confirmed that long COVID is a persistent and serious health concern, especially after initial infections and severe cases. While reinfections pose a lower individual risk, their cumulative impact remains significant due to ongoing virus circulation.

As frontline workers continue to face exposure, understanding and addressing long COVID's functional consequences is crucial. The findings emphasize that future health policies must factor in both prevention and long-term support for those affected.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mindfulness-based therapy offers new hope for people with persistent depression","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250514/Mindfulness-based-therapy-offers-new-hope-for-people-with-persistent-depression.aspx","Thu, 15 May 2025 01:56:00 GMT","

Mindfulness-based therapy can offer significant relief for individuals who are still depressed after receiving treatment, according to a new clinical trial.

Researchers hope their findings, published in Lancet Psychiatry, could provide a new treatment pathway for people with depression who have not benefitted from previous treatment. The study was led by a researcher from the University of Surrey, sponsored by the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) differs from other psychological therapies by using intensive training in mindfulness meditation to help people develop skills to respond more adaptively to negative mood and stress, in addition to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles which seek to change negative thought patterns.

The new study found that MBCT significantly improved depression symptoms compared to continued treatment as usual. The average effect was in the small-to-moderate range and comparable to treatment with antidepressants. Crucially, the study also concludes that providing MBCT as an alternative to usual treatment was cost-effective, at less than £100 per person, and could save the National Health Service (NHS) money by changing the way people use services.

The UK NHS Talking Therapies programme is the world's largest and most advanced publicly funded psychological therapies service, treating around 670,000 people each year, of which almost half have depression as their primary complaint. About 50 per cent of those individuals still have some degree of depression when their care ends. This rate is comparable to the wider picture in the treatment of depression, which for many patients is a recurring condition.

Among them is Mary Ryan, a patient adviser and co-author who has worked with the research team from the start. The retired GP and palliative care doctor has experienced many episodes of severe depression throughout her adult life, and was first in contact with mental health services when she was 17 years old. She said: ""For most people with severe depression, it's more than a condition – it's a recurring part of their life story. Up to now, people have often been told that they've reached the end of the road for psychological treatment, that there are no other options for them. The findings of this trial are hugely important because we're telling this group of people that they still matter – that there's something else we can try that may work for them.""

The study involved more than 200 patients who had received NHS talking therapies, but still had depression. They were recruited across 20 NHS trial sites. The three lead sites were: Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust, Devon Partnership Foundation Trust and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.

One group of participants received eight weekly group-based MBCT sessions delivered by videoconferences, aimed to develop mindfulness skills and guide participants on how to respond more effectively to difficult emotions. The other group received treatment as usual. Six months after treatment, patients who had received MBCT had larger improvements in depression symptom scores on average, than those who had received treatment as usual. 

We know there's a gap in services for people with depression who haven't got better through NHS Talking Therapies. These people often don't qualify for further specialist mental health care, and so are left with no further options. We've shown that offering MBCT to this group can be effective and cost-efficient to deliver, and we hope this will lead to it being implemented widely. We need investment in this and other areas where there are gaps in service, to ultimately save the NHS money.""

Barney Dunn, Study Co-Author, Professor, University of Exeter

Study co-author Barbara Barret, Professor of Health Economics a King's College London, who analysed cost-effectiveness in the trial, said: ""We are highly encouraged by our findings, which reveal that MBCT treatment offers a powerful dual benefit for this group: superior patient outcomes coupled with notable cost savings for the NHS.""

Clara Strauss, Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Sussex, said: ""For vulnerable people with depression, MBCT is particularly helpful for a number of reasons. It helps people to recognise negative, self-critical thoughts as thoughts, rather than as facts and so helps to lessen their emotional impact. It helps people to be more accepting of their difficult experiences and to be kinder to themselves. MBCT also helps people to avoid getting stuck in unhelpful, repeated cycles of negative thinking. Encouragingly, our trial shows MBCT can even work for people where other forms of talking therapy have had little effect.""

Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR's Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: ""This NIHR-funded study shows that mindfulness-based therapy has the potential to benefit patients with difficult-to-treat depression, as well as the NHS and the wider economy. It's a great example of practical research that could quickly help improve people's quality of life.""

The study is titled 'Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus treatment as usual after non-remission with NHS Talking Therapies high-intensity psychological therapy for depression: a UK-based clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness randomised, controlled, superiority trial', and is published in Lancet Psychiatry. The research was led by Professor Thorsten Barnhofer from the University of Surrey and conducted in collaboration with Exeter Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Exeter.

While GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide help with weight loss, new research shows users often fall short on vital nutrients, spotlighting the urgent need for tailored dietary guidance.

Study: Investigating nutrient intake during use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist: a cross-sectional study.

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers examined nutrient intake when using a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Obesity prevalence has doubled since 1990, with one in eight individuals being obese worldwide. Recent pharmaceutical interventions, especially GLP-1RAs, have advanced treatment for glycemic control and obesity. Notably, GLP-1RAs slow the transit time of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and suppress appetite, which could displace nutrient intake and result in mineral and vitamin deficiencies.

Besides, side effects could interfere with food preferences, leading to suboptimal intake of specific foods. As such, optimal health outcomes with GLP-1RA require a multifaceted approach beyond pharmacological interventions, encompassing lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise. However, limited or no medical nutrition therapy (MNT) guidelines are provided to healthcare providers and patients regarding adequate nutrient intake during GLP-1RA use.

The present study compared the nutrient intakes of GLP-1RA users to dietary reference intakes (DRI). Between September and October 2024, adults aged ≥ 18 years or older who had used a GLP-1RA for at least a month were recruited. Individuals enrolled in other nutrition programs or receiving meal plans were excluded. Self-reported questionnaires for anthropometrics, demographics, dietary habits, and GLP-1RA usage were administered.

Participants were asked about the education they received from healthcare providers during prescription and the level of satisfaction with that information. They were also asked about GLP-RA use, including the specific drug, reasons for use, duration, side effects, and expected period of future use. Participants self-reported general dietary habits, including changes in food preferences since the start of GLP-1RA therapy. Participants also self-reported their daily servings of MyPlate food groups.

Additionally, participants completed a three-day food record using the 2024 version of the Automated Self-Administered Dietary Assessment Tool, which was used to calculate each individual's average intake. The team calculated 95% confidence intervals for each nutrient from the three-day food record relative to their respective daily values based on the DRI.

In total, 99 individuals were recruited and invited to complete the three-day food record. Of these, only 82 completed a food record, and only 70 completed all three days. The final analytic sample included 69 participants (55 females and 14 males), as one subject with incomplete survey responses was excluded. All participants were currently using a GLP-1RA, with semaglutide and tirzepatide being the most common.

Most participants (39.1%) had been using GLP-1RA for over a year. Notably, 48% of participants planned to take GLP-1RA indefinitely. Further, a majority of the sample (82.6%) was White/Caucasian, and 80% of participants reported that GLP-1RA use resulted in greater weight loss than conventional programs. The most common side effects were nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue.

Approximately one in five subjects (19.3%) reported no side effects. The mean calorie intake was 1,748 kcal/day for the overall sample, 1,700 kcal/day for females, and 1,933 kcal/day for males. This overall average calorie intake, the paper notes, exceeds expert recommendations for individuals on GLP-1RAs (typically 1,200–1,500 kcal/day for females and 1,500–1,800 kcal/day for males). Participants consumed significantly more fat (% of total calories), saturated fat, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, selenium, sodium, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B12 than the DRI.

By contrast, the intake of carbohydrates (both in grams per day and as a percentage of total calories), fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, choline, and vitamins A, C, D, E, and K was significantly less than the DRI. Protein intake as a percentage of total calories remained within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). However, the study highlighted a critical nuance: when assessed on a grams per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/day) basis, average protein intake was insufficient to meet the higher needs (1.2–2.0 g/kg/day) recommended during weight loss.

Frequency count categorized three-day average nutrient intake of GLP-1RA participants compared to dietary reference intake.

This shortfall is particularly concerning because adequate protein is crucial to preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss, a factor critical for long-term metabolic health and weight management; only 43% of participants met the lower end of this g/kg/day recommendation. By intake frequency, vitamin D, potassium, choline, magnesium, and iron had the largest deficits compared to the DRI.

The paper noted that continued poor intake of such essential micronutrients could lead to detrimental long-term health outcomes, including impacts on cardiovascular health and bone density.

There were no significant differences in dietary intake based on participants' ethnicity, GLP-1RA usage duration, and education. Most participants consumed one to two servings of fruit, grains, dairy, and vegetables and three to four servings of protein per day. Participants under-consumed servings of fruit, grains, dairy, and vegetables compared to MyPlate recommendations.

The study also revealed a potential knowledge gap, as participants often overestimated their fruit and vegetable intake in self-reports compared to their detailed food records, suggesting a need for better dietary education on portion sizes. Furthermore, the paper indicated that standard MyPlate guidance, typically based on a 2,000-calorie diet, may not be tailored for the lower caloric needs or specific nutritional challenges of individuals on GLP-1RA therapy.

Taken together, the overall nutrient intake of participants using a GLP-1RA did not meet MyPlate guidelines or DRI. Participants consumed excess sodium, saturated fat, and calories. Notably, participants consumed inadequate calories from carbohydrates, adequate calories from protein as a percentage of total calories (though critically insufficient in g/kg/day for muscle preservation), and excess calories from fat.

The authors acknowledged certain study limitations and emphasized that these findings underscore the need for patient-centered nutritional guidance, potentially involving Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, to optimize health outcomes and address identified dietary education gaps. Overall, these results may be used for preliminary MNT guidance for this population, and the researchers call for future large-scale studies to confirm these findings and develop more specific nutritional protocols that account for the unique needs of GLP-1RA users.

Tissues consist of a heterogenous mixture of different cell types, complicating our understanding of their biological functions and studies of disease. Now, a multi-institutional team led by The University of Osaka has developed and provided proof-of-concept of a new technology to visualize the distribution of components within a single cell, paving the way for a much greater understanding of disease in complex biological samples.

t-SPESI (tapping-mode scanning probe electrospray ionization) is a technique that allows analysis of the spatial layout of molecules in a sample. Multiple micro-samples of different regions of a cell are taken and transferred for analysis by a technique called mass spectrometry, which can determine the exact chemical components in that region. ""We have developed a new t-SPESI unit that allows us to visualize the microscopy sample in multiple modes,"" explains lead author Yoichi Otsuka. ""We can also directly observe the sampling process as the micro-samples are taken for mass spectrometry analysis.""

By modifying their previously developed t-SPESI technology, the team enabled the analytical unit to be positioned above an inverted fluorescence microscope. This allows observation of the sampling process, as well as direct observation of the sample itself. The sample can be imaged in various modes, allowing the detection of any fluorescently tagged target molecules, determination of the distribution of features on the cell surface, and imaging of the locations of the chemical components of the cell.

This technology can visualize the distribution of intracellular lipids, fatty compounds that play key roles in metabolic processes. Abnormal distributions and functions of lipids are known to be linked to disease.

When we applied our technology to model cells, we were able to observe the lipids within each individual cell using mass spectrometry imaging, directly visualize the cell by fluorescence microscopy, and also determine the surface shape of the cell.""

Michisato Toyoda, senior author

They were also able to detect distinctions between different types of cells with different cellular compositions. ""This allows an understanding of the multidimensional molecular information of individual cells within a sample of diseased tissue,"" says Otsuka.

This exciting new technology will have a great impact on our ability to understand the processes underlying the development of disease in complex biological samples, allowing us to understand the complex mixtures and interactions of cells present in tissue samples.

With the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, GOAL takes a look at the top 50 players currently in the USMNT player pool

With the World Cup just more than a year away, the time for expanding the U.S. men's national team player pool is nearly over. Mauricio Pochettino is still learning about the players at his disposal, yes, but in the very near future, the USMNT boss will have to narrow his list a core group to build towards 2026.

We've seen players rapidly rise and, on the flip side, we've seen a bad run of form cost players World Cup spots. Things change relatively quickly, particularly on the fringes, which means that, right now, everyone in the player pool will believe they have a legitimate chance at making the World Cup roster.

Any ranking of the U.S. pool could change quickly. The arrival of a top dual-national could add a new starter to the mix. A rapid rise from a young star, such as, say, DeAndre Yedlin back in 2014, could lead to a late surge. But with the Gold Cup kicking off next month and the World Cup starting in June 2026, Pochettino will be in decision-making mode.

Who are the top 50 players in that player pool? Which players will Pochettino be evaluating over the next year? GOAL takes a look.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

We get the impression that, for multiple and largely sound reasons, nobody has really been paying much attention to the fact there's a Club World Cup straight after this season ends and that it doesn't look anything like previous attempts at Club World Cups.

We get it. Mention of a tournament so transparently designed as a FIFA cashgrab and scheduled so inconveniently is generally greeted with sighs and eyerolls and grumbles about the clowns being clowns again before a renewed focus on the actual proper football that is happening now.

There's also undeniably something in the fact that England's representatives are Chelsea and Man City. These are huge clubs, obviously, but they still don't and probably never will attract the attention, column inches and bandwidth occupied by Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal.

We're pretty sure if two of those latter three were involved we'd all be hearing a lot more about the Club World Cup. As it is, Liverpool are still just about the only way the tournament has gained any kind of wider cut-through in this country thanks to Real Madrid's attempts to get turncoat traitor Trent Alexander-Arnold to sign before the tournament.

But there's another reason to think the Club World Cup is still a hugely significant event for Arsenal and Liverpool. Because it is one that surely hands them a massive advantage in next season's title race.

Where previous Club World Cups – even the infamous 2000 event that forced Man United to duck out of the FA Cup – have been fairly brief mid-season affairs with just a handful of games between a handful of continental champions in which the European champions face at most one meaningfully challenging match, this is a full-scale, full-size major summer tournament.

They've even given it the format the actual World Cup should have, just to rub all our noses in it.

But this makes it a nightmare for Pep Guardiola. Sure, it's a potentially lucrative one for Man City themselves with £100m on offer for the winner. But Pep could surely do without it clogging up the entire first half of the summer during what is a crucial rebuild phase that really could decide the club's direction over the next five years.

We all kind of slept on it at the time, but with the tournament just round the corner it seems obvious now that a big part of City's decision to go big and go early on their regeneration in January was at least as much to do with this World Cup being on the horizon as it was writing off a lost season.

Those January deals they got over the line should certainly help, because City are going to have precious little time this summer to integrate new players they bring in now. A potential seven-game post-season leaves their pre-season almost non-existent.

It's not like coping with a summer that contains a major month-long tournament is a new challenge for a Premier League manager; but the specifics of this certainly are. Guardiola himself gets no rest, for one thing, having looked for large parts of this season like he could really do with it, while unlike a Euros or World Cup, this is a huge summer tournament that doesn't affect the preparation of any of City's major rivals.

Guardiola does at least retain control of his players for this tournament, but that benefit is surely significantly outweighed by the fact  Arsenal and Liverpool don't have to worry about it at all.

Even on City's own website, in a puff piece unconvincingly proclaiming the club's delight and excitement about the upcoming summer adventure in the USA, Guardiola is, well, guarded. Guardedola if you will. Or won't, up to you.

In a piece where City themselves puff away about ‘a heightened sense of anticipation and excitement' around ‘a spectacular and memorable showcase of the very best of the beautiful game' Guardiola is clearly having none of it.

City's word-salad assessment that ‘from the manager's perspective the opportunity to view and experience first-hand varied football philosophies and cultures serves as the very essence of what football can bring to the world' doesn't quite ring true with his own words.

Literally the first quote from the great man – in a puff piece about how great this all is, remember – is this:

We will see how we finish the season and see how we arrive in that tournament together and then we will see what happens.

Not quite getting into the spirit there, Pep, old boy. Did you not get the memo? This is an opportunity to view and experience first hand varied football philosophies and cultures. It is the very essence of what football can bring to the world, i.e. money to Manchester City and FIFA and other huge clubs with no concern at all about player welfare because they're not really important, are they?

It all feels like a tournament that's going to sneak up on us all. It's only a month away and nobody cares. Once it's actually happening, and with around a third of the games – including half the knockout matches – live on Channel 5, people are going to tune in and take at least half an interest because what else are you going to do in June and July? Get into cricket? Or tennis? Or, heaven help us all, golf? Behave.

But the true impact of the tournament may only truly be known deep into next season when a summer of effort that has not been required of City's rivals could take its toll.

The same is also true of Chelsea, but they'll probably just buy 20 new players on eight-year contracts next week to get them through the tournament before sending 17 of them back out on loan.

Real Madrid are now in talks to sign a player Manchester United sold in 2024 for just £5m.

Ineos‘ transfer business in the opening year of their time at the helm of Manchester United has largely been considered successful.

Additions such as Leny Yoro and Noussair Mazraoui have proven to be excellent pick-ups for United already, while Patrick Dorgu, Ayden Heaven, and Matthijs de Ligt are all promising to end up success stories.

On the departure front, United sold Mason Greenwood for £25m, which could yet yield further financial income, given the sell-on clause in place and interest across Europe.

There could be some money arriving with Maxi Oyedele wanted by clubs in Europe with a £5m release clause and United's sell-on clause, according to Fabrizio Romano.

🚨 Maxi Oyedele will not join Shakhtar Donetsk despite approaches as there are more European clubs keen on signing former Man Utd player.Understand #MUFC will receive 40% of the future sale for €6m release clause available this summer included into his Legia Warsaw deal. pic.twitter.com/5BkxLLBa5c

Now, another player sold last summer is wanted, and it is by none other than Real Madrid.

Former United starlet Alvaro Fernandez could be on the move again this summer.

It was just last summer that United sold Fernandez to Benfica for just £5m, with the Portuguese side slapping a £42m release clause onto him. Since then, he's gone from strength to strength for Benfica at left-back, making it frustrating that Erik ten Hag refused to give Fernandez a chance.

Now, United in Focus has spoken with transfer expert Graeme Bailey to learn that Fernandez is now the subject of Real Madrid's interest as they look to hand Xabi Alonso a strong team.

“We understand that Real Madrid have opened talks with Benfica over a deal for Alvaro Fernandez. They have almost finalised terms for Dean Huijsen, and now they have moved for Alvaro. They want both players in before the CWC.

“Alvaro has enjoyed a sensational season for Benfica, and analytically speaking, he ranks as one of the best in Europe.

“Real are now talking terms with Benfica, but we know there is only so much they can ask for. United included a buy-back in the deal of around £15 million, and if they asked for too much more, Real would just do a deal with United.

“That, though, is not how Real are doing it as they are progressing with Benfica.

“We are informed that Alvaro is hugely excited about the prospect of joining Real. United did have some interest in signing him prior to bringing in Patrick Dorgu, but I am told the player was never looking to move back to Old Trafford.”

This would see Fernandez re-join his boyhood club, from where he departed in 2020, instead joining United, where he envisioned his breakthrough, only to not get the chance.

In Spain, Marca has also discussed this interest, admitting Madrid's main concern is United, but if Fernandez has no intention of returning to Old Trafford, this means very little.

Selling Fernandez last summer raised eyebrows around the fanbase, with knowledge that he had the potential to be a superstar in the future. However, with his chance unlikely to ever come under Ten Hag, selling was the right move, and now it might pay off.

Due to United including a 50% profit sell-on clause for Fernandez, this could be a transfer that helps ease the PSR concerns at Carrington, without Ineos having to do any work.

If Alvaro leaves for at least £30m, United will pocket around £12.5m of this amount, which would be a huge help for the financial problems currently impacting the club.

So the decision would have greatly paid off for Ineos, and it would surely tempt them to do more deals like this in the coming transfer window.","{'href': 'https://www.unitedinfocus.com', 'title': 'United In Focus'}","soccer"

Chelsea might be tempted to sell Djordje Petrovic before the Club World Cup with the goalkeeper attracting a lot of interest according to reports.

The Blues are once again gearing up for another busy summer and could fund their business by selling as many as seven or eight players.

Chelsea face a critical summer with the club looking to sign a striker, centre back and right footed attacker to strengthen Enzo Maresca's squad.

Whilst incomings are important, Chelsea also have a number of players who are now surplus to requirements, and others who are attracting interest.

Fans would love to see a new goalkeeper signed with Robert Sanchez not popular amongst supporters, and no keeper has made more errors leading to goals in the Premier League than the Spaniard this season.

Filip Jorgensen hasn't had a lot of chances to show what he can do, but in the opportunities he's had it's arguable the Dane hasn't made the most of them.

However, Petrovic is expected to challenge for the number one shirt after excelling on loan at Strasbourg, with the Ligue 1 outfit on course to qualify for European football.

Liam Rosenior has labelled the Serb world class, but his performances haven't gone unnoticed and Petrovic has recently been linked with a shock move to Leeds.

Journalist Nizaar Kinsella has now provided an update on the 25-year-old as cited on X.com and reported Petrovic is attracting interest from within the Premier League and Europe, and the Blues might be tempted to sell before the Club World Cup starts next month.

It's been reported the Blues aren't currently considering signing a new keeper and the club are set to conduct a summer review of the position before taking a final decision.

Despite that Chelsea have still been linked with keepers, most notably Borussia Dortmund's Gregor Kobel, who the Blues have reportedly held conversations with.

Dortmund are believed to want up to €60m, whilst Chelsea have also ben linked with the likes of Mike Maignan and Aaron Ramsdale.

 Contributor. 

When the news became official that LAFC would face Club America on May 31 in a playoff for Club Leon's vacated 2025 Club World Cup berth, the easy comparison to draw was to England's EFL Championship Playoff Final, dubbed the richest game in soccer because of the financial benefit that comes simply from qualifying for the Premier League.

Both involve teams that didn't win their competitions outright. Both matches will come later this month. And both could have an enormous financial benefit.

Here's a closer look at how the details of the two enormous fixtures stack up.

The Blades and the Black Cats both have histories dating back to the 1800s and 13 major domestic honors between them. But only one of them has come since the end of World War II, when Sunderland won the 1972-73 FA Cup.

But both teams clearly have the potential to become valuable commodities again if they could survive and become stable in the Premier League. Sunderland averaged more than 40,000 fans this season at home matches, the most in the EFL Championship. Sheffield United was fourth with an average just north of 28,000.

In terms of profile, it's hard to do better than this fixture when it comes to clubs in the Concacaf region.

Club America is arguably the most historic club anywhere in North America, the all-time winningest side in Liga MX and also the most valuable club in Mexico according to a recent analysis from Sportico.

The Black-and-Gold of LAFC are far newer, having joined MLS only in 2018, but have also won three major domestic titles since 2022 and currently Sportico's most valuable club on the continent.

According to an analysis from the BBC, the winner of the playoff final on May 24 will receive a guaranteed minimum of $290 million in additional funds that they did not have access to while playing in the EFL Championship. A large share of that sum comes from the exponnentially increased TV revenue they'll receive to from the Premier League's new domestic TV contract, which is worth about $2.2 billion annually for the next four seasons.

Every participating club in the Club World Cup from Concacaf will be given a $9.5 million appearance fee, with the potential to win significantly more money if they advance deep in the tournament. Given the elite quality of the opposition in that tournament, the realistic ceiling for Club America or LAFC would probably be a trip to the round of 16, which would net the club a total of just above $21 million. The mathematical ceiling is just shy of $100 million if somehow a Concacaf club won the whole tournament.

As far as international soccer venues go, it doesn't get much bigger, although the location will be a bit of a hike for Sunderland supporters' in particular traveling from England's Northeast. Even so, with nearly two weeks to sell tickets after the semifinals were completed, there's every reason to believe the crowd will approach the 85,000 capacity that is often reached for this occasion. Objectively, Sunderland and Sheffield United are two of the bigger clubs to play in the fixture since the promotion playoff format began in the late 1980s.

It might seem strange to play this match at the home ground of one of the two competing sides. But 1: it's Concacaf. And 2: it's probably as close as you'll get to a neutral venue that is also a sellout. LAFC is very well supported in Los Angeles, regularly selling out its venue of more than 20,000 seats for league games. And Club America is at worst the second-most popular Liga MX team, including in LA where there is an enormous Mexican expat population.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

A group of leading lawyers has submitted an official complaint to Fifa, alleging the governing body has failed to follow its own human rights rules in relation to the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The 30-page complaint has been filed via Fifa's official grievance mechanism and calls for immediate action in five areas.

The complaint has been authored by Fifa's former anti-corruption adviser Mark Pieth, the Swiss lawyer Stefan Wehrenberg and the British barrister Rodney Dixon, who submitted a report to Fifa a year ago warning of the risks of awarding the tournament to the Gulf state.

The complaint argues that the bidding process “failed to ensure that human rights standards were met” and says: “Fifa's decision to approve Saudi Arabia as the next host country now places Fifa, in accordance with its own policy, under an obligation to ensure that internationally recognised human rights are upheld in Saudi Arabia.

“To date there is no evidence that such steps have been initiated, let alone that Fifa has any intention of doing so. This complaint highlights these failings so that they can be rectified without delay.”

The five areas outlined relate to freedom of expression and association; arbitrary arrests, mistreatment and the death penalty; judicial independence; migrants' rights and women's rights.

“Fifa must develop a concrete and transparent action plan in collaboration with the Saudi authorities, rather than relying on the host state to act unilaterally,” the complaint says. “This plan must incorporate minimum requirements … ensure their immediate implementation and establish robust mechanisms for ongoing monitoring. To date, no such steps have been initiated by Fifa.”

This week Fifa faced criticism and demands for action over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. Reports by Human Rights Watch and FairSquare highlighted the risks faced by those involved in the vast development projects commissioned by the Saudi regime under the direction of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The reports said workers continued to face severe risks to life and criticised the lack of transparency surrounding the deaths of migrant workers.

In response to Human Rights Watch, Fifa wrote a letter stating: “Fifa seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of Fifa World Cup sites. This work involves a close collaboration with its Saudi counterparts and engagements with relevant international labour organisations … we are convinced that measures implemented … can set a new standard for worker protection.”

FIFA have announced their decision on potentially banning a country from the 2026 World Cup in an official statement.

In just over a year, the 2026 World Cup will get underway across Canada, Mexico and the United States, with 48 countries from across six confederations set to compete for the biggest trophy in football.

Only seven countries have qualified for the tournament so far, with all three host nations, New Zealand, Japan, Iran and Argentina, all confirmed participants.

Qualification for the remaining 41 spots will continue to take place in the coming months, with the final lineup set to be decided by the end of March 2026.

But before the lineup is finalised, FIFA have announced their decision to lift the suspension of Congo-Brazzaville, handing them a chance of qualifying for the tournament next summer.

The African nation had a sanction imposed in February because of third-party interference in the affairs of Fecofoot, the country's football association.

Because of this, Congo's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Tanzania and Zambia, which were scheduled to be held in March, were postponed.

But FIFA are now satisfied that several conditions required to lift the suspension have been met and released an official statement confirming the decision.

It read: ""The Bureau of the FIFA Council decided on 14 May 2025 to lift the suspension that was imposed on the Congolese Football Association (FECOFOOT) on 6 February 2025. 

""The decision was taken after the conditions requested by the Bureau to lift the suspension of FECOFOOT had been met, including the return of full control of the FECOFOOT headquarters, the Ignié Technical Centre, and the association's other facilities to the FECOFOOT Executive Committee led by Jean-Guy Blaise Mayolas and his administration.""

Advert

It is yet to be announced when Congo's postponed fixtures will be played, but with them currently sitting bottom of their qualifying group for the World Cup, it remains unlikely that they will feature in next year's competition.

The final four games of their group campaign are scheduled to take place in September and October, with African play-offs then due to be played in November.

Updated on May 15, 2025

FIFA has made a major decision regarding the participation of Congo-Brazzaville in the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup. In an official statement released on May 14, the global football governing body confirmed that the suspension of the Congolese Football Association (FECOFOOT) has been lifted, potentially allowing the African nation to rejoin the qualification process.

The 2026 World Cup, set to kick off in just over a year, will be hosted across three North American nations: Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It will be the first time the tournament features 48 teams instead of the traditional 32, creating more opportunities for countries from all six football confederations to take part.

So far, only seven nations have officially booked their places in the tournament: the three host countries, along with New Zealand, Japan, Iran, and Argentina. The remaining 41 spots will be determined over the next several months, with final qualification expected to wrap up by the end of March 2026.

Congo-Brazzaville's road to the World Cup had been halted earlier this year. Back in February, FIFA suspended FECOFOOT due to third-party interference in its operations—an act that goes against FIFA's strict regulations on national football associations' autonomy. The interference disrupted internal governance and led to FIFA postponing Congo's scheduled March qualifiers against Tanzania and Zambia.

However, after months of monitoring the situation, FIFA announced that the necessary conditions to lift the suspension have now been met. The official statement read:

“The Bureau of the FIFA Council decided on 14 May 2025 to lift the suspension that was imposed on the Congolese Football Association (FECOFOOT) on 6 February 2025. The decision was taken after the conditions requested by the Bureau to lift the suspension had been met, including the return of full control of the FECOFOOT headquarters, the Ignié Technical Centre, and the association's other facilities to the FECOFOOT Executive Committee led by Jean-Guy Blaise Mayolas and his administration.”

This announcement reopens the door for Congo-Brazzaville to participate in the qualification campaign. However, their path to the World Cup remains an uphill battle. The team currently sits at the bottom of their qualifying group, and it is unclear when the postponed matches against Tanzania and Zambia will be rescheduled.

The remainder of Congo's qualification campaign includes four more group-stage matches, slated for September and October 2025. Should they miraculously climb the standings, they would also need to go through the African play-offs scheduled for November.

While qualifying for the 2026 World Cup is still a long shot for Congo-Brazzaville, the lifting of their suspension represents a vital first step toward restoring their presence in international football. With just over a year to go before the tournament begins, every game will now count more than ever for the team's hopes of making it to North America.

If there's a coach who understands Brazilian talent, it's Carlo Ancelotti. He's worked with over 40 Brazilian players throughout his storied career.


Amid the 2025 Clausura semifinals, Tigres UANL are reportedly set to sign a World Cup winner and Lionel Messi's Argentina teammate.


The timing of Xabi Alonso's announcement is intriguing, especially given the persistent reports linking him with Real Madrid. What it means for Carlo Ancelotti and his rumored future with the Brazilian national team, is something that adds further drama to an already eventful end of season. 


As Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni released the preliminary list for these crucial matches, the big question on everyone's mind was simple: Will the squad include Lionel Messi returning from injury?

...

Fifa are failing to follow their own human rights rules by holding the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia, a group of leading lawyers have alleged.

The group, which includes Fifa's former anti-corruption adviser Mark Pieth, have filed a 30-page complaint via Fifa's official grievance portal and called for action in five key areas.

Ahead of 2034, they have outlined the need to address freedom of expression and association; arbitrary arrests, mistreatment and the death penalty; judicial independence; migrants' rights; and women's rights.

It is also argued that the bidding process in which Saudi Arabia emerged victorious from “failed to ensure that human rights standards were met”.

“Fifa's decision to approve Saudi Arabia as the next host country now places Fifa, in accordance with its own policy, under an obligation to ensure that internationally recognised human rights are upheld in Saudi Arabia,” the complaint read.

“To date there is no evidence that such steps have been initiated, let alone that Fifa has any intention of doing so. This complaint highlights these failings so that they can be rectified without delay.”

Also at the heart of the complaint was British barrister Rodney Dixon, who submitted a report warning Fifa of the risks of awarding such a mega-event to the Saudis a year ago.

Saudi Arabia has emerged as the globe's leading sportswashing machine in the last decade, utilising major sporting events to launder a reputation tarnished by human rights abuses.

While there is a belief that awarding sporting showcases to nations like Saudi Arabia will spark social development, it's often the case that the opposite is true as they have no incentive to stray from their way of operating.

As such, the complaint also emphasises the need for Fifa to push Saudi Arabia to address key issues, with their no expectation that the Gulf state will alter by themselves.

“Fifa must develop a concrete and transparent action plan in collaboration with the Saudi authorities, rather than relying on the host state to act unilaterally,” the complaint adds. “To date, no such steps have been initiated by Fifa.”

The Glaswegian's genius made United a global phenomenon, but he also had a role in the Glazer takeover which put the club on the path towards disaster

Manchester United fans are experiencing a strange feeling right now. They are immensely looking forward to the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21, but they know that their team is in a rotten state on the pitch as well as off it, as underlined by Ruben Amorim's brutally honest remarks after Sunday's defeat by West Ham.

There are clear parallels with 20 years ago, when United were preparing for the FA Cup final against Arsenal but were in disarray when it came to the controversial takeover by the Glazer family, which had just been completed. Two decades on, and the effects of the American family's leveraged buyout are still being felt at Old Trafford.

United are in even greater financial dire straits than in 2005. The Glazer takeover sunk a club that had been balancing the books since 1931 into £580 million ($776m) of debt. That figure has since increased £731.5m ($965m), too. The club's debt is a huge factor in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's swinging cuts, including his decision to make more than 400 employees redundant over the past year. And it is a big reason why United's spending power has declined and why they are close to breaching the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability limits.

United fans have been protesting about the Glazers ownership since before their bid was launched, and opposition to them has ramped up further since results have declined in the 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. While the team's decline can be blamed on many bad recruitment decisions, the Glazers' running of the club is undoubtedly the biggest underlining factor in their fall.

And the inconvenient truth is that Ferguson himself played a role in the takeover, from angering the club's previous shareholders due to a dispute over a horse to not trying to stop the deal or even speak out against it. So, 20 years on from the deal which began the downfall of Manchester United, GOAL asks: How much blame should be portioned to Ferguson?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The 24-year-old is preparing for Sunday's FA Cup final after a remarkable rise to becoming the best defender on the planet

Naomi Girma's unveiling as a Chelsea player was different to most, befitting of her status as the most expensive transfer in the history of the women's game. It was at Stamford Bridge, ahead of a huge London derby against Arsenal, that fans learned of the 24-year-old's arrival, with her walking out to rapturous applause as she waved to the adoring supporters of her new club. It's a moment that Girma, with her beaming smile, appeared to relish. However, it also probably felt a little bit strange for someone who, in the words of one former team-mate, has “never really made it about her”.

Kennedy Wesley, who played alongside Girma at Stanford University and the San Diego Wave, can't help but be amused when she thinks about all the attention her friend is getting at the moment. “Obviously, she's the best defender in the world, but if you were to ask her about that or tell her that yourself, she would respond in the most humble way possible,” she tells GOAL. “Like, that she still has so much room to improve, she has her team-mates and coaches and everyone else to thank. I feel like she's never going to claim the status that we all view her as [holding] and that's one of the things that I love most about her, that she carries herself with a humility and grace that is just unmatched for someone with her stature.”

Speak to anyone who knows Girma and they will say similar things. It's part of what has made her an exceptional team-mate throughout her career to date, while giving her the determination to hit even greater heights. It's also helped her on a journey that, though arduous at times, has already taken her to world-class status and made her the first million dollar player in the women's game.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Norwegian has been starved of service this season, but has done his best in a team that have fallen way below their usual standards

Erling Haaland has scored at 20 of the 23 English grounds he has played at. The Manchester City striker probably doesn't lose much sleep over the fact he is yet to find the net at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium, although he has unfinished business at the other two.

Haaland has failed to score in three attempts at Anfield, although it is his record at Wembley Stadium which must cause him the most anguish. The Norwegian has played four times at the home of football without scoring, though he will have a fifth opportunity to open his tally under the arch in Saturday's FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.

Or at least, he should. Haaland only returned to action last weekend after six weeks out with an ankle injury and Pep Guardiola admitted after the forward's underwhelming performance in the goalless draw at Southampton that the Norwegian's place in his starting line up at Wembley was not guaranteed. ""I'll have one week to think about it. I don't know. The truth is, it's been five weeks off,"" Guardiola said. ""He's a big man and needs maybe a little bit more time.""

Haaland's return to the pitch at St Mary's also coincided with City's five-match winning streak in all competitions coming to a halt, as the result and performance gave more fuel to the argument that City are a stronger side when the Norwegian is not on the field. There are some statistics to back up the claim, too: City have averaged 2.2 goals this season per match without their superstar striker compared to two goals per game when Haaland has started. The same was true last season, when City scored an average of 2.6 goals per game when Haaland was out with a fractured foot, but 2.5 goals when he played.

City were also unbeaten during his recent seven-game absence, winning six times. Meanwhile, 12 of their 14 defeats in all competitions this season have come while Haaland was playing.

But as the saying goes, there are lies, goddamn lies and statistics. Haaland simply has to start the final, and it is up to his under-performing team-mates to step up and provide him with the service he needs to fire City to FA Cup glory.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Spanish giant, Real Madrid already eager to start their new chapter under new boss, Xabi Alonso, who is set to take over from Carlo Ancelotti soon. According to reports, Los Blancos are already working on signing a new defender, Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth.

The news of Madrid planning on a new chapter with Alonso as their head coach, replacing Ancelotti, is well documented already. Although there's no official news just yet but it's just a matter of time before the Spaniard will start his adventure at Santiago Bernabeu.

Preparing for the new boss' arrival, Madrid reportedly is set to sign a new defender with Bournemouth's Huijsen as the target. According to reports from Fabrizio Romano, both clubs have already reached an agreement regarding the Spanish defender's transfer term.

Although he only joined the Premier League side last summer and is under contract until 2030 but he is available for transfer because of the clause in his contract. Huijsen has a release clause worth 50 million pound which can be triggered by any interested clubs.

Los Blancos are not wasting time with the opportunity, as Romano stated that they already held talks with Bournemouth and agreed on the transfer payment structure. Alonso is reportedly keen on securing Huijsen as soon as possible, knowing there are plenty of competitors among English clubs.

Seeing reports that Bournemouth and Madrid have agreed on a deal, the move looks to be edging closer to completion. This is because of the following reports stating that Huijsen himself has set Los Blancos as his priority among other potential suitors for next season.

The young defender, who always relishes his connection with Spanish football, is certainly keen on being part of a top club in the country, such as Madrid. Notably, with the imminent arrival of Alonso, who is open to playing young players, Huijsen believes that he can be an important player already for Los Blancos.

Madrid are eyeing to close the deal quickly as they would want the 20-year-old to be part of their team for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup tournament. After their failure to win titles this season,

There was no praise for Lorenzo Musetti from Alexander Zverev after their Italian Open quarter-final with the latter quite uncomplimentary about his rival's game while the tournament balls also came under fire from the German.

Musetti won his third match in a row against the second seed as he came back from an early break in the first set to win 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 and end Zverev's title defence in Rome.

The Italian, who has reached the semi-final of all three ATP Masters 1000 clay-court events this year, now leads Zverev 3-1 in their head-to-head rivalry.

When asked if Musetti changed his usual style of play during the clash at Foro Italico, Zverev was far from complimentary about his opponent.

“I think he plays similar when he plays on clay all the time. He depends a lot on defence. He depends a lot on the mistakes from other opponents,” the second seed said.

“Today was difficult for me to hit winners. It was very slow, very, very heavy. The balls were getting very big. Even though I had my chances, I was up three set points, four set points in the first set on my serve. Usually I should win that set and then we'll see.

“Yeah, like I said, it was difficult.”

Next in for some criticism were the balls that are being used at the tournament.

“Balls were a joke today. Generally speaking this is a subject we've had over the last three, four years now. Players are talking about it all the time,” Zverev said.

“They say we play with the same ball in Monaco, Madrid, Munich. Then we come here and the ball is totally different. The ball is very, very big. It's very difficult to hit winners here. It's just how it is these days.

“Of course, for me, for my game style, today was not easy because at the end of the day I'm still somebody that tries to play aggressive. I'm still somebody that tries to serve very fast. That's how it is. It's difficult to get free points today.”

Carlos Alcaraz clinches huge rankings boost as Jack Draper falls short of key milestone

5 men with the best win rate against top 5 players: Carlos Alcaraz 2nd, Novak Djokovic 5th

Zverev has endured an impressive ATP Masters 1000 season so far as he lost in the second round in Indian Wells, the round of 16 in Miami, the second round in Monte Carlo, the fourth round in Madrid and now the quarter-final in Rome.

As a result, he will drop to No 3 in the ATP Rankings after the Italian Open and that means he will be seeded third at the French Open.


                ""Greatness does not make excuses they excuse opponents.""            


                ""I'm really shocked, honestly, to see some of these names on here.""            


                Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas also feature on the elite list.

Carlos Alcaraz delivered a moment of pure magic at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters that earned him April's Hot Shot of the Month despite fierce competition.

“I'm really, really happy to get Hot Shot of the Month for April,” said Alcaraz in a message for fans. “Just trying to show good tennis and good shots. Thank you very much.”

Showcasing his signature blend of speed, power and flair all in a single point, Alcaraz outlasted Daniel Altmaier in a thrilling exchange which included a tweener from the Spaniard.


In just the second game of the match, both players were trading heavy groundstrokes from well behind the baseline until Altmaier changed the rhythm with a delicate drop shot. Alcaraz turned on his jets and skillfully slid into his reply, responding with a sharp angle that drew “ooh's” from the crowd.

 


Seconds later, Alcaraz sprinted towards the baseline and launched a running tweener lob to extend the rally. Alcaraz eventually ripped a backhand that the German could not return, which put an end to the show-stopping sequence. The Spaniard put his finger to his ear, inviting the Monte-Carlo to get involved.


The No. 3 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz went on to claim the title, his first triumph in the Principality.

The 30-year-old has had a torrid time with foot, knee and wrist injuries following his surprise run to the 2022 Wimbledon final and has played only four singles matches this year, winning once at the Miami Open in March.

Kyrgios was not expected to compete on Parisian clay having last played at Roland Garros in a second-round loss eight years ago but said he had changed his mind with Thompson's regular doubles partner Max Purcell serving a doping ban.

""The French Open was never really on the cards,"" Kyrgios told The Canberra Times. ""But after the stuff with Max Purcell, Jordan was looking for a partner and he asked me if I wanted to play.

""We've played at the French Open before, so it'll be good to get out there and play with another fellow Aussie and have a bit of fun.""

While a Grand Slam singles title has eluded him, Kyrgios did capture the 2022 doubles crown at the Australian Open partnering countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis.

He's a major draw on and off the court at Grand Slams with his natural talent and unapologetic personality, which has also landed him in controversies in the past.

Despite question marks about his long-term future in the game, Kyrgios is expected to resume his singles career during the grasscourt swing next month ahead of Wimbledon.

The French Open begins on May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Roger Federer's former coach has shock prediction over who is going to win the French Open, 'I am calling it right now'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/roger-federers-former-coach-has-shock-prediction-over-who-is-going-to-win-the-french-open-i-am-calling-it-right-now/","Thu, 15 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

The 2025 French Open is just a few weeks away, as players finish up their preparations ahead of the year's second Grand Slam.

Several players will head to Roland Garros with title ambitions, having enjoyed strong starts to their clay seasons.

2024 French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte-Carlo Masters and reached the final of the Barcelona Open, producing his best tennis of the year on clay.

Italy's Lorenzo Musetti has been a revelation on clay in 2025, remarkably reaching the semi-finals of all three Masters 1000 events on the surface, and will likely be dangerous when he takes to the court in Paris.

Musetti's countryman has only played three matches on clay since returning from his suspension, but world number one Jannik Sinner will still head to the French Open as one of the favorites.

It's another name, however, that Roger Federer's former coach is picking to win the title, as he continues to rack up wins on the red stuff.

Appearing on the Tennis Channel Live podcast, Paul Annacone named the player he thinks will pick up the title in Paris.

“Casper Ruud has been playing with so much confidence these days,” he said.

“It's great to hear him talk about his health and well-being, he talked very candidly about having to get things better in that hamster wheel, as he talked about, which is life on tour.

“Right now he has that balance, has that confidence, we know he has got the tennis game, and we know on the red stuff he is so difficult to beat.

“How about today, facing no breakpoints? Using the big forehand to dictate from everywhere on the court. A terrific athlete. Really sound. I think he has sured up the backhand side of the court.”

Ruud was impressively solid during his fourth-round Italian Open win over Jaume Munar, advancing to the quarterfinals in straight sets.

With that in mind, Annacone confidently made his pick for the French Open.

“Jim Courier, I am telling you right now that is the man who is winning the French Open,” said Annacone.

“I am calling it right now.”

Ruud has enjoyed real success at Roland Garros over the past three years, reaching two finals and one semi-final.

There's no shame in losing to two of the greatest players of all time in Grand Slam finals, and despite failing to win a set in either final, it shouldn't be overlooked how Ruud performed against Novak Djokovic in 2023.

The Norwegian pushed Djokovic to a tiebreaker in set one and came close to snatching the third set, before losing in the final for the second year in a row.

No player has won more matches at the French Open since 2022 than Ruud, who has picked up 16 victories at the event.

He'll travel to Paris as one of the pre-tournament favorites, but will first want to finish up his clay Masters 1000 campaign with a title in Rome.

Earlier this month, Ruud beat Jack Draper to win his maiden Masters 1000 title at the Madrid Open.

Backing that run up, Ruud has won his opening three matches at the Italian Open to extend his ATP Tour winning streak to nine.

Playing some of the best tennis of his career, Ruud would likely have been considered the favorite for his quarterfinal match against any other opponent.

Unfortunately for the Norwegian, he'll take on Sinner in the last eight, a man who has won his previous 24 matches, a run that extends back to last October.

Sinner's latest win over Francisco Cerundolo was his most impressive since returning from suspension, taking down the Argentine in straight sets, 7-6, 6-3.

The Italian has also beaten Ruud in each of their three previous meetings, a statistic he could well look to for confidence ahead of their quarterfinal match.

Only time will tell who will come out on top when Annacone's French Open favorite takes on Sinner in the Italian Open quarterfinal on Thursday, May 15.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis star Harmony Tan has expressed her disappointment at being excluded from the 2025 French Open. And the WTA contender feels especially slighted, given that numerous players ranked lower than her have been issued invites.

A little more than three years have passed since Tan's sensational victory over Serena Williams during the first round of Wimbledon 2022. The Parisian claimed victory in a gripping 7-5, 1-6, 7-6(7) result, which preceded Williams' retirement from tennis just a few months later.

Tan, 27, advanced to best Sara Sorribes Torbo and local favorite Katie Boulter in the following two rounds of that tournament. However, her remarkable Wimbledon run then came unstuck against American Amanda Anisimova.

Despite not securing a Grand Slam win since that event, world No. 244 Tan took to Instagram to voice her discontent at being overlooked for a wildcard entry to Roland Garros. And the omission is that much more hurtful given it's her home Grand Slam.

""No Roland Garros for me this year,"" she posted on Instagram (via the Daily Express). ""A bitter taste, a feeling of injustice regarding the federation's decision not to grant me a wild card for the qualifiers.

""Especially after all the efforts of recent months and the good results. This week, I'm 244th in the world ahead of the nine players who received a wild card for the qualifiers. And yet... nothing.

""Yes, I'm 27. Yes, I'm no longer a 'young promise'. But I've proved that I can compete in Grand Slams. I've had my ups and downs, and I'm still fighting.""

Tan has participated in the French Open nine times to date. Out of those attempts, she has only made it past the first round on one occasion, with five of her attempts ending in qualifying losses.

Of those nine wildcards invited to the women's qualifying draw, four are aged between 15 and 16 years old. Those girls are Ksenia Efremova (world No. 629), Eleejah Inisan (No. 976), Cindy Langlais (unranked), and Daphnée Mpetshi-Perricard (No. 1158).

Given that each sits considerably below Tan in the WTA pecking order, one can understand her frustration. Not to mention her suspicion that certain talents of a certain age demographic may have received preferential treatment.

The 13-year WTA tour player was visibly upset about being excluded from Roland Garros this time around. Yet she concluded her message on an optimistic note, expressing her determination to continue competing.

""Now I'm going to move on, keep smiling as usual and get back on the court with the same strength,"" she declared. ""Because at the end of the day, tennis remains a game. And I love playing.""

Tan's disappointment is likely intensified after she recently clinched her 11th ITF title at the W50 Yecla in Spain. This victory was her first in more than a year, but the elation was short-lived due to the snub by event organizers in her own country.

TV presenter Clare Balding has said she is “delighted” to announce her debut novel Pastures New.

The 54-year-old's book will tell the story of Alex, a journalist who has “perfected the art of dodging responsibility” until an unexpected letter turns her life upside down, when it is published by HarperCollins on September 12.

Speaking about the book, Balding said: “It has taken a few years and a lot of angst to produce Pastures New, my first novel, but I'm so delighted that HarperCollins will be publishing it this autumn.

“In writing it, I've tried to honestly represent the complicated relationship between family members, the way love can pop up in the most surprising places, the beauty of our landscape and the kindness of small communities.

“This is Alex's story – one of finding meaning in life and finding a group of people that help her feel she belongs.”

The book will see Alex inherit a crumbling sheep farm in Wales as she sets out to uncover the truth behind her mysterious inheritance.

Balding, who has presented coverage of the Olympic Games and Wimbledon tennis tournament for the BBC, published her autobiography, My Animals And Other Family, in September 2012, while a second non-fiction book, Walking Home: My Family And Other Ramblings, was published in September 2014.

Lynne Drew, general fiction publisher at HarperCollins, said: “I've been a fan of Clare's voice ever since reading her funny, honest and brilliant memoir, and the minute we started working together on Pastures New I rejoiced that she had brought that same astute and entertaining storytelling to her fiction debut.

“Her characters shine off the page, and this warm and witty read full of honesty and heart will utterly delight her many fans.”

Balding herself grew up in the Hampshire countryside as the daughter of racehorse trainer Peter Hastings-Bass, and has gone on to present the BBC's Sports Personality Of The Year and Channel 4's coverage of the Crufts dog show.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","tennis"

Young tennis sensation Emma Raducanu has set the record straight on her coaching situation ahead of Wimbledon, leaving fans and critics alike buzzing with anticipation. The 22-year-old starlet has confirmed that she will be continuing her partnership with coach Mark Petchey throughout the upcoming grass season, with Petchey fully committed to his coaching role and ready to prioritize their collaboration over his other commitments, as reported by The Telegraph.

Raducanu's decision to work with Petchey, a former top-ranked British male tennis player, has been a game-changer for the US Open champion. She has expressed admiration for Petchey's coaching philosophy, which focuses on strategic play and repetition of drills and patterns rather than solely technical adjustments. This shift in training approach has already started to shape Raducanu's game, as she revealed during a recent interview in Rome.

The young tennis prodigy emphasized the importance of feeling comfortable with her support team, a criterion that Petchey easily meets due to their pre-existing relationship. Raducanu's choice to stick with Petchey for the grass-court season has put an end to speculations about potential coaching changes, reaffirming her trust in the 54-year-old coach.

With Raducanu fully embracing Petchey's coaching style and committing to their partnership, all eyes are now on the dynamic duo as they gear up for a promising run at Wimbledon. Stay tuned as this powerhouse pair takes the tennis world by storm with their unwavering dedication and synchronized game plan.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka is known for her playful presence on the tennis court, especially when she loses. The Belarusian has often shown her lighter side after losses, such as the Indian Wells final and the Australian Open final. However, she was not in the mood for funny games during the Italian Open quarterfinal against Qinwen Zheng.

Zheng, the Olympic Gold medalist, has created one of the shocks of the season so far, defeating Sabalenka in straight sets 6-4, 6-3. Although the top seed still goes into Roland Garros as the heavy favorite, this loss dented her confidence. However, the loss wasn't the major talking point as the Belarusian was receiving some public interference.

Zheng's stunning display of shot-making and movement caught Sabalenka off guard. As a result, the World No. 1 remained unsettled, and it felt like anger was building inside her. The anger reached a boiling point when a fan from the crowd encouraged her to play well. However, it didn't sit well with Sabalenka as she dropped the F bomb. According to the visuals seen on X, Sabalenka said, “Shut the f*** up.”

The chair umpire immediately warned the World No. 1 for a code violation. Initially, the crowd booed, but the match continued, and it didn't seem to halt Zheng's momentum. The Chinese player has been scintillating on clay. This is arguably the second biggest win of her career after the win over Iga Swiatek last year in the Paris Olympics semifinal.

It has been an emotional couple of months for Sabalenka, who has shown both her banter and angry side. After she lost to Madison Keys in the Australian Open final, she showed her funny side in the post-match ceremony. However, there were also occasions like the one at the Stuttgart Open against Elise Mertens. The World No. 1 confronted the chair umpire on a controversial line call and took a picture of the ball spot with her camera.

Meanwhile, Zheng finally won her first match over Sabalenka in seven attempts. The Olympic champion claimed that she used to give the World No. 1 great respect, which created a negative mindset. Sabalenka has stopped Zheng on the biggest stages, including the 2024 Australian Open final. However, it was Zheng's time at the Italian Open. She will now meet Coco Gauff in the semifinals.

Oak Ridge hosted TSSAA's District 4 Tennis Tournament at the city's Jackson Square Tennis facility. 

In an email, Oak Ridge High School Coach David Bowman shared, “Over 200 players and spectators camped out between West Tennessee and Broadway avenues last night. It was a marathon for many who arrived at 2:30 p.m. to warm up for their matches. It was 11 p.m. at the end of our Lady Wildcat doubles match with William Blount. Joanne and I are very proud of our players who competed this post season.”

Nine East Tennessee high school tennis teams were competing in two singles events and two doubles events.

                Zheng broke Sabalenka's winning streak in Rome.            

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka suffered a shock defeat at the hands of reigning Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen at the 2025 Italian Open on Wednesday. The 22-year-old Chinese sensation produced one of the best performances of her season thus far to oust Sabalenka 6-4 6-3. During the loss, Sabalenka lost her cool at a rogue heckler on Centre Court.

This happened to be the seventh meeting between Sabalenka and Qinwen – the latter of the two had never beaten her three-time Grand Slam winning opponent before. Sabalenka's biggest win against Qinwen was in the final of the 2024 Australian Open. On Wednesday however, the World No. 8 pulled off an upset of epic proportions to marginally improve the head to head record to 1-6.

Sabalenka entered the Internazionali BNL d'Italia as the top seed. She was on a 9-match winning run and looked set to win her first trophy at the Italian capital. Unfortunately, it was an off-colour evening for the Belarusian, who looked fatigued and out of ideas to counter Zheng's strong groundstrokes. The Chinese No. 1 believes that the surface and her acknowledgement that Sabalenka is just another normal player benefited her.

After losing the opener, Sabalenka was broken again in the very first game of the second set. This was when a moment of frustration resulted in a code violation for the defending US Open champion. Just as Qinwen was about to serve at 30-0, someone from the crowd yelled, “Come on Aryna – play tennis!” Sabalenka was having none of it, and made sure to dish out a fitting reply.

“Shut the f**k up,” said the 27-year-old. A code violation and warning for verbal obscenity was quick to follow as Sabalenka's words were loud and clear on Campo Centrale. While the Belarusian attempted a fight back, it was not her day. She failed to convert any of the break points that she generated during the course of the encounter.

Sabalenka will now head to Roland Garros, where she will fight for the title as the top seed. With defending champion Iga Swiatek looking out of form and dropping crucial ranking points, this might be the best opportunity for the World No. 1 to dethrone the queen of Paris. The 2025 Roland Garros begins on May 25.

Tommy Paul continued his impressive form at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Thursday, when he surged back into the last four in Rome.

The 27-year-old tamed a big-hitting Hubert Hurkacz 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach consecutive semi-finals at the Italian ATP Masters 1000 event. Paul edged Hurkacz in a topsy-turvy opening set that featured six breaks before expertly powering to a one-hour, 58-minute victory.

“Every time I come here, I feel at home,” said Paul, who improved to 9-4 in Rome, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “The courts match up with my game really well. I feel comfortable out here and I've been playing some good tennis this week.""

Paul had overcome Hurkacz in three sets at the same stage in Rome last year, and resurrected that form to move past the Pole once more, improving to 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. With his victory, Paul became the first American man to reach consecutive semi-finals in Rome since Pete Sampras in 1993-94.

“Both of us were returning so well, obviously we would have liked to be hitting our spots better on serve,"" Paul said of the first set. ""We were keeping the pressure in our service games. I thought I regrouped pretty well in the breaker, and then into the second set.”

Paul is No. 12 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, and would seal his return to the Top 10 if he reaches the championship match. He awaits the winner of Thursday evening's clash between World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and Madrid champion Casper Ruud.

The four-time Grand Slam champion, who also had a left leg injury, had lost to Draper in their most recent meeting in the semifinals at Indian Wells, California, in March.Alcaraz rallied from 2-4 to claim the first set. A turning point then came in the eighth game of the second set, when Draped looked like he could force a decider. That game lasted almost 10 minutes and Alcaraz saved two break points before coming out on top. Alcaraz broke at love in the next game and sealed the match.""The most important thing that I did today was not thinking about the shots at all,"" Alcaraz said. ""Not thinking about the fact that I was down, just trying to do the things that make me happy. On court I just tried to be aggressive, play good shots, drop shots, go to the net. That's what I like to do on the court, and I think that made the difference today.""Alacaraz's next opponent will be Lorenzo Musetti, who beat defending champion Alexander Zverev 7-6 (1), 6-4.

After being dethroned as defending champion, Zverev dubbed the balls used in Rome as 'a joke' as he lamented his struggles in hitting through Musetti.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 15, 2025 copy_link

Published May 15, 2025

At his final event ahead of a 10th consecutive Roland Garros appearance, Alexander Zverev fell to Lorenzo Musetti in the Internazionali BNL d'Italia quarterfinals after seeing four set points go wasted.The in-form Italian prevailed, 7-6 (1), 6-4, to line up a Monte Carlo final rematch with Carlos Alcaraz. Afterwards, the defending champion downplayed what his opponent produced in Rome on Wednesday evening.“I think he plays similar when he plays on clay all the time. He depends a lot on defense. He depends a lot on the mistakes from other opponents,” the No. 2 seed stated in the mixed zone. “For my game style, today was not easy because at the end of the day, I'm still somebody that tries to play aggressive. I'm still somebody that tries to serve very fast. That's how it is. It's difficult to get free points today.”

As the final statsheet would show, Zverev contributed 36 unforced errors to Musetti's 22—yet the German was matched into the winners department at 20. If anyone's playing defense here, it may just be Zverev.Musetti has now reached the semifinals at all three ATP Masters 1000 events on clay this spring with four Top 10 wins, while Zverev combined to go 5-3 across the board and hasn't posted a completed Top 10 victory this year. Beyond his assessment of Musetti, Zverev felt another element at the Foro Italico contributed to a performance that left him uninspired.“Balls were a joke today. Generally speaking this is a subject we've had over the last three, four years now. Players are talking about it all the time, he asserted.“They say we play with the same ball in Monaco, Madrid, Munich. Then we come here and the ball is totally different. The ball is very, very big. It's very difficult to hit winners here. It's just how it is these days.”

Last month, Zverev triumphed over Ben Shelton to nab the 500-level title on home soil in Munich. But the lack of a notable result on the 1000 stage, combined with Alcaraz's efforts, will see the Hamburg native bumped down to world No. 3 going into the Paris major. The Spaniard denied Zverev a maiden major last June over five sets to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires.“I have to move forward and I have to plan myself [for] Paris and do the best that I can there,” wrapped the 28-year-old.Roland Garros has proven to be Zverev's most promising major of the four, with a 34-9 record and four successive trips to the semifinals or better.

Hamilton gets set for ‘very special' first Ferrari home race as he shares ‘dream I'm working towards'

Adrian Newey believes that Aston Martin possesses the ""best facility in F1"" and that the new regulations in 2026 will provide more ""flexibility for innovation and different approaches than first meets the eye"" as the team looks to become a winning outfit.

Newey has spent two months with Aston Martin having joined the Northamptonshire-based squad from Red Bull after an 18-year stint, which included winning six Constructors' Championships and eight Drivers' Championships.

NEED TO KNOW: The most important facts, stats and trivia ahead of the 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

The 66-year-old has been involved in Formula 1 since 1988 having also achieved titles with Williams and McLaren, which along with his Red Bull accolades, have cemented his place as a legendary designer.

Having decided to seek a new challenge, Newey has now given his first impressions on life with Aston Martin.

Newey achieved 14 titles with Red Bull during an 18-year stint

""When you join a new team, it's always difficult to know what the experience is going to be,"" said Newey in an interview with Aston Martin's website. ""Every time I've joined a new team, each has been very different.

""The first thing I can say about the team is that everyone has been very welcoming, which is great – it hasn't always been the case when I've started with a new team.

""This is a team that has grown a lot in headcount over a very short space of time. We have great facilities, people are keen and enthusiastic, and it is our job to get on and get everything working smoothly. F1 is about people: yes, there is a lot of technology, but it's people who drive things forward.""

Newey joins Aston Martin with the team seventh in the Constructors' standings, with two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso yet to get off the mark from six Grands Prix.

Newey joined Aston Martin at the behest of Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll, who took over the team formerly known as Racing Point Force India, in 2018 before bringing the Aston Martin name back in 2020 while significantly investing in the team's facilities.

""Lawrence's vision has created a great facility – the best facility in F1 – but it is important that we now optimise how we use it. Again, this is a people sport,"" added Newey.

Lawrence Stroll has huge ambitions for Aston Martin, with Newey a key signing

""My previous team had one of the worst wind tunnels in F1 and operates out of an unremarkable series of buildings on an industrial estate, but it managed to get everybody working together and developed a great group of people.

""We have many talented people – also a few areas that need strengthening with greater numbers – and we need to get everyone working together better, using these tools and developing our abilities.""

Newey's focus will be on 2026 when new aerodynamic and power unit regulations will be introduced, with the designer believing it will open the door for innovation that could give a team an early advantage compared with others.

""My thoughts on the 2026 regulations are similar to what my thoughts were about the big regulation change for 2022: initially thinking the regulations were so prescriptive that there wasn't much left here [for a designer], but then you start to drill into the detail and realise there's more flexibility for innovation and different approaches than first meets the eye,"" he said.

""We saw that at the start of 2022, with teams taking really quite different directions. Now, of course, four seasons on, they've largely converged, but initially that wasn't the case. Variation between teams is great. It's all a bit boring if the cars look identical and the only way you can tell them apart is the livery.

""I think there's a high probability that in 2026 we'll see something similar to 2022. There's enough flexibility in the regulations, and I'm sure people will come up with different solutions. Some of those will be dropped over the first two or three years as teams start to converge.""

WEEKEND WARM-UP: Who are the favourites as the European season kicks off in Imola?

As Formula 1 begins the European leg of the 2025 season, the sport's alternative fuel strategy will be at the heart of the drive towards Net Zero by 2030.

Building on trials in recent years, this season, 37 biofueled trucks will deliver freight for the events, a renewable and centralised energy system will power the pit and paddock areas, and the F2 and F3 championships will continue to race on 100% advanced sustainable fuel ahead of Formula 1 moving to sustainably fuelled cars in 2026.

READ MORE: 5 crucial milestone moments in F1 safety technology

The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of the nine European races to use a low carbon energy system across the paddock area, delivering an approximate 90% reduction in associated carbon emissions.

Supplied by Formula 1 partner Aggreko, the rollout to all European events follows successful trials at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix, and the 2024 Austrian, Hungarian, and Italian Grands Prix, all of which yielded significant carbon reductions in the Paddock, Pit Lane, and Event Technical Centre.

The Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of the nine European races to use a low carbon energy system supplied by Aggreko

The paddock-wide solution will centralise energy supply into one compound powered by renewable sources, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and remove the requirement for Formula 1, the 10 F1 teams, and the FIA to use their own generators.

In addition to the carbon reduction through centralised, renewable energy generation, the reduction in on-site generators will also minimise associated transportation emissions.

The return of DHL's biofuel fleet trucks across the European stint provides Formula 1 with another way to operate more sustainably through the use of alternative fuels.

In 2023, the use of biofuel-powered trucks during the European leg of the season resulted in an average reduction of logistics-related emissions by 83% compared to traditional fuels. This year, DHL will once again use 37 of its trucks to transport freight across Europe.

READ MORE: The ‘important' lessons F1 is learning from the development of sustainable fuels in F2 and F3 ahead of 2026

At the beginning of the season, F2 and F3 cars successfully made the move to Aramco's 100% advanced sustainable fuel, following the use of 55% sustainable fuel last season. This move comes ahead of the Formula 1 cars adopting the fuels in 2026 in the new hybrid engines that will take to the circuit next year.

The move to 100% advanced sustainable fuels is an instrumental part of the sport's alternative fuel strategy, as well as having a wider impact in the automotive industry, as the fuel developed by Formula 1 will be a ‘drop-in' and can be used in road cars without modification, serving as a sustainable alternative of global benefit.

The combined investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel with DHL and Qatar Airways reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO2e

Formula 1's alternative fuel strategy is a pivotal part of how the sport continues to reduce carbon emissions today. Last year, Formula 1 made significant investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), delivering an estimated 80% reduction in associated carbon emissions per flight compared to the use of conventional aviation fuel.

The combined investment in SAF with Global Partners DHL and Qatar Airways reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), an approximate 19% reduction in related emissions compared to traditional aviation fuel across the flyaway events of the 2024 season.

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, said: “It is incredibly exciting to see our alternative fuel strategy deliver significant carbon reductions across the European season and beyond. We remain on track to be Net Zero by 2030, and it is new technologies and innovations such as this that will see us hit our goal.

""Working with our partners, as well as all of our teams and the FIA, the sport is proving that you can grow sustainably, with no compromise to our on-track product or fan experience.”

After 'Oppenheimer,' the big-screen company designed new cameras and production tech to allow Nolan to shoot in Imax, on film, end-to-end in his upcoming epic, and not just for select sequences. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


Christopher Nolan‘s The Odyssey, the Oppenheimer director's epic take on the classic Greek myth, will shoot entirely on Imax film cameras, a first for a commercial feature.


	Nolan is a fan of the big-screen format, which he's used on Dunkirk, Interstellar, the Dark Knight movies and Tenet, as well as extensively on Oppenheimer. But shooting an entire feature film on the famously big, loud and unwieldy Imax film cameras (unlike the lighter, quieter digital Imax cameras, used in recent films such as Thunderbolts* and the upcoming Superman) was unworkable.

	Until now.


	After the success of Oppenheimer, which earned more than $190 million on Imax screens, some 20 percent of its total gross, Nolan challenged the company to improve its cameras, to make them lighter and quieter, and to solve issues with scanning and processing the cameras' 70 mm film stock, to allow him to easily watch dailies as he shot.


	“Chris called me up and said If you can figure out how to solve the problems, will make [Odyssey] 100 percent in Imax. And that's what we're doing,” said Imax CEO Rich Gelfond, speaking at the company's annual press lunch in Cannes on Thursday. “He forced us to rethink that side of our business, our film recorders, our film cameras.”


	The new Imax cameras are reportedly 30 percent quieter — so those infamous muffled dialogue scenes in Nolan films could be a thing of the past — and substantially lighter. Gelfond said new film scanning and processing techniques will allow a faster turnaround for dailies.


	The new film cameras are reserved for Nolan for now, but after he wraps The Odyssey, Imax will begin renting them out to other directors.


	There should be plenty of demand. Gelfond talked up the “record number” of films releasing in 2025 that shot at least some scenes with Imax cameras or “filmed for Imax” using Imax-approved cameras, including Ryan Coogler's Sinners, Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning, which had its Imax debut in Cannes on Wednesday night, and Joseph Kosinski's upcoming racing movie Formula One, starring Brad Pitt.


Narnia, Greta Gerwig's upcoming fantasy film, will be shot for Imax, though Gelford said it was not yet clear in the Barbie director would be using Imax cameras for some of the scenes. Netflix has signed a global deal with Imax, giving them a 28-day exclusive theatrical window for Narnia before the film is released on the streamer.

	











	Gelfond also announced the production of Patrouille de France, the first-ever foreign-language Imax documentary. A co-production between Federation Studios and Imago Production, the feature doc chronicles a year in the life of the Patrouille de France, the legendary aerobatics team of the French Air and Space Force — from the selection process and intense training to its signature elite aerial displays. The project follows on Imax's success with The Blue Angels, Paul Crowder's documentary, produced with Amazon MGM Studios, on the Blue Angels pilots of the United States Navy's flight demonstration squad.

The Texan also was memorable in 'Junior Bonner' and 'Charley Varrick' and as two different characters — one good guy, one bad — in Bond films.


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Joe Don Baker, the broad-shouldered Texas tough guy who portrayed characters on both sides of the law, most notably Sheriff Buford Pusser in the unexpected box-office hit Walking Tall, died May 7, his family announced. He was 89. 


	Baker first attracted mainstream attention in 1972 when he starred as the younger, business-minded brother of an aging Arizona rodeo rider (Steve McQueen) in Sam Peckinpah's Junior Bonner (1972), then portrayed a sadistic mob hitman named Molly in Don Siegel's Charley Varrick (1973), starring Walter Matthau.

	In James Bond films, the 6-foot-3 Baker played a villain, the megalomaniacal arms dealer Brad Whitaker, in The Living Daylights (1987), starring Timothy Dalton as 007, then returned as a good guy, CIA agent Jack Wade, opposite Pierce Brosnan in the 1995 and '97 movies GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies, respectively.

	As former professional wrestler Pusser — based on a real-life sheriff who cleaned up crime in his Tennessee town — Baker survives a series of beatings; represents himself in court and wins; gets elected sheriff; sees his wife murdered; and wields clubs carved from oak trees to beat up vicious gamblers and moonshiners in Walking Tall (1973).


	“In those days in the early '70s, I think a lot of people wanted to take a stick to Nixon and all those Watergate guys,” Baker said in an interview from the mid-1990s. His movie “touched a vigilante nerve in everybody who would like to do in the bad guys but don't have the power and would get in trouble if [they] did. But Buford was able to pull it off.”


	An independent release from Bing Crosby Productions, Walking Tall was distributed by Cinerama Releasing Corp. and became a huge financial success, grossing an estimated $40 million ($622 million today) on a budget of about $500,000 ($3.6 million today).


Walking Tall director Phil Karlson, in a 1974 interview with The New York Times, said his ultra-violent movie did so well because it fulfilled “a deep hunger to have a man in a movie who is big, powerful and one people can look up to.” 


	The real Pusser agreed to star in a Walking Tall sequel but hours later was killed in a traffic accident in August 1974. Bo Svenson then took the lead in big-screen follow-ups released in 1975 and '77 (and later on an NBC show), while Baker and Karlson reteamed for another vigilante drama set in Tennessee, Framed (1975).

	











	The actor then portrayed a violent cop once again in Mitchell, also released in 1975.


	Baker was born on Feb. 12, 1936, in Groesbeck, Texas. His mother, Edna, died when he was 12, and he was raised by an aunt. A linebacker at Groesbeck High School, his hero was Doak Walker, who played halfback at Southern Methodist University and won the Heisman Trophy in 1948.


	Baker had his first experience as an actor as a senior at North Texas State College in Denton. After graduating with a business degree in 1958 and serving for two years in the U.S. Army, he moved to New York and was accepted into The Actors Studio.


	In 1963 and '64, Baker appeared on Broadway in Actors Studio productions of Marathon '33 opposite Julie Harris and Blues for Mister Charlie, written by James Baldwin and directed by Burgess Meredith.


	He came to Los Angeles and made it to the screen, finding work on Honey West, Bonanza and Gunsmoke and in the films Cool Hand Luke (1967) and Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969). 


	Baker and Tom Skerritt played sons of Karl Malden in Blake Edwards‘ Wild Rovers (1971) before he united with Robert Duvall and Karen Black to bust up a crime syndicate in The Outfit (1973).


	In 1985, Baker starred as crack CIA man Darius Jedburgh in the six-hour BBC miniseries Edge of Darkness, directed by Martin Campbell. “I could have done that all my life, I think, or at least for years and been happy,” he said. 

	











	He was nominated for a BAFTA award but lost out in the best actor race to his co-star, Englishman Ben Peck. A decade later, Campbell turned to Baker again for GoldenEye.


	The actor also starred as a Southern sheriff turned NYPD detective on the 1978-79 NBC series Eischied, played a crooked cop in Fletch (1985) and stepped in for Carroll O'Connor, then sidelined after heart surgery, as the chief of police on NBC's In the Heat of the Night in 1989.


	Baker wielded another big stick as a Babe Ruth-like swatter in The Natural (1984) and appeared in such other films as Leonard Part 6 (1987), Cape Fear (1991), Reality Bites (1994), The Grass Harp (1995), Mars Attacks! (1996), Joe Dirt (2001), The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) and Mud (2012).


	He was married to Maria Dolores Rivero-Torres from 1969 until their 1980 divorce and is survived by relatives in Groesbeck. A funeral service to honor his life will be held Tuesday in Mission Hills, California.

""It's not lost on me that Tony Gilroy has literally written me into Star Wars history,"" says the star, who formed a close bond with Stellan Skarsgård during production.  


							By

[This story contains spoilers for Andor season two.]


	When Andor creator Tony Gilroy cast Elizabeth Dulau in early 2021, he knew he was getting a talented actor who had just graduated London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). But he soon realized that he actually hired a budding star who was worthy of significantly more screen time in season two. “By the time we finished season one, everyone on our whole show was just in awe [of Elizabeth]. We don't have a moment of bad film on her,” Gilroy recently told The Hollywood Reporter.

	In season one, Dulau's character, Kleya Marki, was considered to be the “sorcerer's apprentice” to Stellan Skarsgård's Luthen Rael, who was a part-time antiquities dealer and a full-time shadowy leader of the emerging Rebellion. However, season two has now revealed their relationship's profoundly tragic origin story. Luthen was once an Imperial Sargeant, and during a genocidal raid on adolescent Kleya's homeplanet, he suffered a crisis of conscience mid-attack, before noticing that a young girl he would eventually name Kleya had stowed away on his ship. From there, they formed a duo, becoming the surrogate father and daughter of the Rebellion. 




			Popular on THR		







	In hindsight, Dulau can't help but laugh at the beginnings of her on-screen partnership with Skarsgård.


	“My agent said, ‘The only note [from your Andor callback] was you seemed a little bit nervous. So they want to see you again. Walk in that room with as much confidence as you can; walk in that room like you are the dog's bollocks,'” Dulau tells THR, quoting her rep's words. “Then she said, ‘Also, you'll be reading at Pinewood Studios opposite Stellan Skarsgård, but don't let that make you nervous.' I think I just burst out laughing because that's insane. It was just an unbelievable thing to hear.”


	Like many heavy hitters do, Skarsgård made a point to disarm Dulau before they first read together as Luthen and Kleya. So whatever anxiety she had about their differing statuses was moot by the time they actually started filming together. Fast forward to season two, Dulau had one particularly fateful scene in the back of her mind the entire production, and it's the seismic moment from writer Tom Bissell's tenth episode, “Make It Stop,” in which Kleya has to end Luthen's life. Denise Gough's Dedra Meero finally cracked the case involving Luthen and Kleya's Axis network, and while she was briefly distracted mid-arrest, Luthen attempted to end his life to protect the Rebellion's many remaining secrets from the Empire's information extraction apparatus.

	











	Knowing that Meero was able to keep Luthen on life support, Kleya sprung into action and infiltrated the hospital that admitted him. That's when Dulau essentially became the star of her own spy-action movie, as Kleya blew up a spaceport as a diversion and killed numerous Stormtroopers in a surgical manner. As soon as Kleya gained access to Luthen's hospital room, she immediately closed the window, sealing the room from any adjacent sunlight. This act was a nod to Luthen's season one monologue about how he's turned his mind into a “sunless space” and sacrificed everything for a “sunrise” he'll never see. Kleya then pulled the plug on her adoptive father's life, fulfilling Luthen's own prophecy in the process. 


	“[That monologue] has always been there in the background,” Dulau says. “I was super nervous because it felt like the entire filming process was leading up to that day. I always had it in the back of my mind, and I deliberately tried not to overthink it. When I looked at Stellan lying there on this hospital bed, I really felt heartbroken for what Kleya was about to do.”


	Prior to Luthen's capture, he was able to pass off key pieces of intelligence to Kleya in regard to the Empire's top-secret development of the Death Star. Kleya then delivered the intel to Cassian when he arrived to rescue her, post-hospital mission, and transport her to Yavin. It's a fitting end to their relationship considering Kleya once ordered Cassian's death due to his knowledge of Luthen. Overall, Kleya is now one of several dominos that led to Luke Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star in Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). 

	











	“It's not lost on me that Tony Gilroy has literally written me into Star Wars history that dates back to the ‘70s. My mom and dad queued up at midnight to watch A New Hope,” Dulau shares. “And knowing that they're going to see my small part in that chain of events that leads to those stories, I'm just so grateful that Tony would hand me that domino. I really didn't want to fuck it up. I really wanted to do justice to this opportunity that he's given me.”


	Below, during a recent spoiler conversation with THR, Dulau (pronounced d'low à la y'know) also discusses Kleya's off-screen future and why she doesn't mind being an “unsung hero” of the Rebellion.


	***


Andor creator Tony Gilroy made it sound like you went straight from RADA to the set of Andor season one. Was it actually that direct of a route?


	Well, I walked off stage at RADA straight into the pandemic. We were literally four performances into a production of The Importance of Being Earnest; I was playing Lady Bracknell. Our artistic director said, “Tonight will be the final performance.” So we all had a big old cry, and we did the show before we all disappeared. We thought we'd be back in three weeks, but of course, we weren't. The audition for Andor then came around in November of 2020, so I spent those six months [in between] not really sure what to do.


You then discover that you're going to be working almost exclusively with Stellan Skarsgård. How intimidated were you in those early days?












	I had my recall just before Christmas, the day before another lockdown. We then came back in January [2021], and my agent said, “The feedback from the recall was that they really liked you. They thought you were great. The only note was you seemed a little bit nervous. So they want to see you again, and they just want to make sure that you'll be able to handle yourself. So walk in that room with as much confidence as you can; walk in that room like you are the dog's bollocks.” Then she said, “Also, you'll be reading at Pinewood Studios opposite Stellan Skarsgård, but don't let that make you nervous.” (Laughs.) I think I just burst out laughing because that's insane. It was just an unbelievable thing to hear.


	But, because of Covid and all the restrictions, we had to wait for Stellan to be allowed to fly into the country. So there were still a few weeks in between to prep, and I prepped like hell. I learned all my lines upside down, back to front, sideways. I then met Stellan for ten minutes before that final audition, and we chatted over coffee. Stellan has this wonderful magic about him. You just forget that he's the legend Stellan Skarsgård. He really makes you feel at ease, and after just those ten minutes with him, I really felt like I was walking in the room with a friend, with someone who had my back and was there for me. And he was that way, continuously, throughout the next three years. I was intimidated by the scale of this production and how new it all felt, but I've never felt intimidated by Stellan. He always felt like my pal who's got my back.

	











When did you learn that you were in store for a huge promotion in season two?


	It was in the summer before season one came out in September 2022. It was just before it came out because we knew that we were going to start shooting that November [2022]. Tony called me that summer to tell me everything that happened for Kleya this season, and I was just completely speechless. The arc he's created for me this season is just mind-blowing, and I'm so grateful to him. I love it when I'm scared of a job. I love it when the challenge is so immense and it's like, “Oh my God, can I do that?” Deep down, I always know that I can, but it's still scary.


An argument could be made that Kleya is the main character of the final three-episode block. Even when she is off screen, she's the focal point of both the Rebellion and the Empire. Did your jaw hit the floor when you read 210 for the first time and you realized you were leading your own spy movie?


	Yeah, Tony first told me how that would end, and I was shocked. And reading it, I just felt enormously grateful to him for writing such an interesting role. I felt really supported by this giant, Tony Gilroy, in that moment. She's just such a compelling character, and at this point in my career, when I just graduated not too long ago, it means the world that he had that much faith in me to write an arc like this.


We finally learned her backstory as to how she met Luthen. He was a sergeant for the Empire, and while his unit was raiding Kleya's village, she stowed away on his ship amid his moral panic attack. How did that backstory compare to what you imagined throughout season one?












	I deliberately tried not to imagine anything, and it was really hard because that's the opposite of how I like to work. I come from a theater background where you have the whole play. So you can allow your imagination to run riot about their lives beforehand, and not being able to do that on season one felt very strange. So I just went with everything that Tony had [originally] told me. He told me that Kleya would die for Luthen, and that she is entirely and utterly committed to this man. So I just took that and ran with it, and I tried not to get too caught up in the why, because I was hoping it would be answered later down the line. And I'm really glad I did that, because if I had tried to imagine some kind of backstory for her, then I might have made choices in season one that would've made my life more difficult on season two. So I really left her backstory and my imagination totally blank during season one. I just waited for it to be given to me for season two, and what a treat it was. 


Younger Luthen and Kleya were a lot like the Joel and Ellie of Star Wars.


	(Laughs.) I see the comparison [to The Last of Us], but I think it's darker. That story obviously has its darkness as well, but Luthen and Kleya, my heart breaks when I think about them. The love that grows between them is incidental. Neither of them want to acknowledge the fact or admit to themselves that they've come to love one another because of that day 16 or 17 years ago. Luthen came to Kleya's people, and he had a hand in destroying them all. That day can never be erased. It can never be forgotten. They can't just forgive and forget that; it's too huge an event. So that darkness stays with them in a way that makes their story quite unique. I remember Tony referencing Paper Moon when talking about their relationship, but it's also different from Paper Moon. It's just so much darker. What Luthen did to her people all those years ago, or what he contributed to, is horrifying. So that can never go anywhere, but their love grows incidentally around it.

	











She has to Mission: Impossible her way through a hospital in order to put an end to comatose Luthen's life, and it's a very emotional moment involving the father and daughter of the Rebellion. What was your state of mind on the day?


	Well, I was super nervous because it felt like the entire filming process was leading up to that day. I always had it in the back of my mind, and I deliberately tried not to overthink it. I remember just doing a lot of deep breathing to try to stay calm. The thing with scenes that have the potential to be really emotional is you have to stay relaxed to allow them to come through. Nerves can really lock you up. So I did a lot of deep breathing, and I suppose I just tried to not put too much pressure on myself because I'm very good at that. I tried to just reassure myself that whatever work I do on this day is going to be good enough because it has to be. So I tried to just be super kind myself, which helped keep me relaxed. It helped me really commit to the imagined circumstances, and when I looked at Stellan lying there on this hospital bed, I really felt heartbroken for what Kleya was about to do.


As soon as she closed the window to his hospital room, I thought of Luthen's big season-one monologue about his “sunless” mind and the “sunrise” he'll never get to see due to all that he's sacrificed for the Rebellion. And so it's just so fittingly tragic that she has to pull the plug on him in a sterile room with artificial lighting. Did the script make reference to that famous speech? Or did everybody infer that callback on their own?












	The script didn't overtly pay reference to that monologue, but it has always been there in the background. When fans watched that monologue in season one, I feel like they knew that he's not going to make it. It's dramatic irony.


Or a self-fulfilling prophecy.


	Yeah, totally. The script was really beautiful, actually. There was very little on the page, and it gave a lot of space for me to fill in the blanks. The very last words were something like “a moment to pay our respects for this man,” and I think you feel that in the scene because he's this huge figure within the Rebellion. So the audience deserves that moment to say goodbye to him.


There's an amusing moment prior to all that. Kleya disguises herself as a nurse who's escorting an alien in a wheelchair, and the alien mumbles something in the elevator to which Kleya humorously responds, “What?” Was that scripted? 


	(Laughs.) That was [director] Alonso [Ruizpalacios] having fun. That was actually a really hard moment to shoot. There was a puppeteer underneath the alien on this wheelchair, and she couldn't see what she was doing because she was completely hidden. So Alonso would have to give her notes about what to do, and he was really getting into it. Bearing in mind, I'm going up this elevator to kill my best friend, so I have to look completely serious. But Alonso was off to the side, going, “Granny's looking around, granny's enjoying the elevator ride and granny's having a lovely time.” He was saying all that to get the right attitude from the alien, and I just burst out laughing. There weren't many times where I corpsed on that set, but that was one time. So I had to really get it together again, and that scene was just so at odds with how I was trying to feel in the moment.

	











Cassian eventually rescues Kleya from the safe house and takes her to Yavin. When he first arrives at the door, Kleya says, “It would be you, wouldn't it?” Is that a comment on the fact that she once ordered his death in 107? Or is it more connected to 209's conversation about Cassian wanting to quit after he extracts Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly)?


	I actually always imagined it as something slightly different. There's a moment in [209] when Luthen says to Cassian, “You [always] appeared when I needed you.” And he finds it to be a slightly strange thing. I wonder if Luthen is the kind of character who has a curiosity around things like the Force and those more fantasy elements that we see in Star Wars. So I always imagined that Luthen had said something like that to Kleya [off screen]: “There's something special about Cassian. He always really comes through for us in the end, even though he's reluctant.” So that's what I had in my mind when Kleya sees him at the door: “Oh, of course, it's Cassian that's here after Luthen has said all this to me about him. Of course, he's the one that pulls through in the end, again.”


The final shot of Kleya at sunrise alludes to this, but do you think she eventually found belonging at Yavin? 


	Is Kleya the kind of character that's ever able to do that? This is the question. I'd love for her to have that, but that would be an entirely new concept in and of itself for Kleya. She's never had a sense of home, belonging, safety and friendship. These would be very new concepts for her, and I'd be intrigued to see if that's something she's even able to do.

	











Beyond that, have you imagined what else Kleya might be up to during the events of Rogue One and Star Wars: A New Hope?


	I'm going to watch Rogue One after Andor is all aired. I've deliberately avoided it because it felt too soon, somehow. I really want to indulge in being able to watch the end of this series that's been such a huge part of my life and see how it all fits in. But imagining what Kleya is doing off screen during those Rogue One and A New Hope years, oh my gosh. It's a huge question, isn't it? So I don't know, and I certainly wouldn't want to come up with the answer to that. A brilliant writer would do a much better job.


It must be pretty surreal to know how much influence your character has on the future Star Wars stories, some of which have been around for four-plus decades. She was one of several dominos that led to Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star.


	Oh my God, it is completely mind-blowing. It's not lost on me. It's not lost on me that Tony Gilroy has literally written me into Star Wars history that dates back to the ‘70s. My mom and dad queued up at midnight to watch A New Hope. And knowing that they're going to see my small part — or, as you say, a domino — in that chain of events that leads to those stories, I'm just so grateful that Tony would hand me that domino. I felt like that when we were shooting it. I really didn't want to fuck it up. I really wanted to do justice to this opportunity that he's given me, and I didn't want to let him down. I didn't want to let Stellan down. I didn't want to let myself down. The history that Tony has written me into is huge, and I really wanted to honor that. I also didn't want to let the fans down. I know how much it means to them, and they've been so wonderful.

	











Each block of episodes in season two has an unseen year in between, and Diego Luna/Adria Arjona told me that they'd love to come back to tell the story between season one and season two where their characters fell back in love. Is there a particular unseen year that you'd love to come back and tell?


	The year between 209 and 210 is very interesting. Mon Mothma is now the official figurehead of the Rebellion on Yavin, and Luthen and Kleya feel left out in the cold. So I'd be really interested to see how that happened, and I think it would be really quite painful. There's a connection between Mon, Kleya and Luthen. They've known each other for years by this point, and they've come to trust each other. Mon is someone that Kleya has come to really respect. The speech she makes at the Senate and everything that she throws away to become the leader of the Rebel Alliance, I always played it as something that Kleya really respects. So, to then feel cast out by her and the other leaders on Yavin, that's a very painful thing that happened for her and Luthen. That would be interesting to explore.


Andor is ultimately about the unsung heroes of the Rebellion. Luthen and Kleya paved the way for the Rebel Alliance, and there are only a few characters who refuse to let their foundational work be forgotten. Granted, Luthen and Kleya hadn't been created yet at the time of these future yet preceding stories, but it can still be said that they didn't get the long-term recognition they deserved as the father and daughter of the Rebellion. 












	Yeah, it is sad, but they didn't get into this for credit. They operate in the shadows. That's who they are. That's another thing that Luthen's speech is all about. He and Kleya have completely come to terms with the fact that to achieve the “greater good,” they sometimes have to do things that are morally ambiguous. They're willing to stray into those moral gray areas in order to find the light again, and because they're willing to go to those places, I don't think they would even feel comfortable getting any credit. They're certainly not in it for that. God, if someone was to try to give Kleya a medal one day, I really don't know that she would accept it. It's not her vibe.


Many decades from now, when you're swaying back and forth in a rocking chair and your loved ones are gathered around you, what day on Andor will you tell them about first? 


	Oh God, I'm going to cry. The most fun I had on set was the shot when Kleya shoots these two Stormtroopers on the top floor of the hospital. They rigged pyrotechnics to come out the back of them. So I pulled the trigger on a blaster, and it actually had an effect. There were sparks flying everywhere. I could fully invest in this imagined reality that I'm shooting these bad guys. So I think I'd tell them about that and these three consecutive night shoots in Valencia [Spain]. These were the scenes at the party in 206 where Kleya is getting the bug out of the exhibit. There were hundreds of extras on that set, and everyone was dressed in space haute couture. Aliens were serving cocktails, and droids were zipping about. So that is a memory I'll never forget. Those scenes really made me feel like I was in Star Wars. It was completely magical to be in a galaxy far, far away

The ""What Was That"" singer also opened up about her eating disorder in a new interview.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	In the lead-up to her new album Virgin, Lorde has started to slowly open up about her broadening gender identity with the world. But before she was ready to do that, she confided in one of her new friends: Chappell Roan. 


	In a Rolling Stone cover story published Thursday (May 15), the New Zealand native revealed that she and the “Pink Pony Club” singer have gotten quite close over the past year, and that one of the things they've discussed is Lorde's changing relationship with gender. When asked how she identifies now, the “Royals” artist told the publication, “[Chappell Roan] asked me this … She was like, ‘So, are you nonbinary now?'”  

	











	“I was like, ‘I'm a woman except for the days when I'm a man,'” Lorde continued. “I know that's not a very satisfying answer, but there's a part of me that is really resistant to boxing it up.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The musician also explained that she still identifies as a cisgender woman who uses “she” and “her” pronouns. But the complexities of her newfound gender fluidity informed much of the June-slated Virgin, the opening track of which Rolling Stone reveals finds her declaring, “Some days I'm a woman/ Some days I'm a man.” 


	Even so, Lorde added that she doesn't think her gender expression is “radical” compared to what most transgender and nonbinary people face on a daily basis. In the United States in particular, the rights of LGBTQ people have been under constant threat for years, something Roan — a longtime advocate for the community and a queer-identifying artist herself — has spoken out about many times.  


	“I see these incredibly brave young people, and it's complicated,” Lorde said. “Making the expression privately is one thing, but I want to make very clear that I'm not trying to take any space from anyone who has more on the line than me. Because I'm, comparatively, in a very safe place as a wealthy, cis, white woman.” 


	The star's embrasure of her new gender expression is one of several personal transformations that has occurred since she last dropped an album, 2021's Solar Power, four years ago. In addition to breaking up with Universal Music executive Justin Warren after about eight years together — “It was so painful, as they are, but there was real dignity to it,” she told the publication of the split — Lorde also recovered from an eating disorder, something she's also been increasingly open about in the weeks ahead of Virgin‘s June 27 release. 

	











	“I felt so hungry and so weak,” she recalled of being obsessed with calories and protein intakes around the time Solar Power came out, specifically the day it dropped. “I was on TV [that] morning, and I didn't eat because I wanted my tummy to be small in the dress. It was just this sucking of a life force or something.”

Bell performed as a member of Oasis from 1999 until 2009, and has songwriting credits on each of the band's last three albums.

	Tyler Jenke



	As the questions surrounding Oasis‘ fast-approaching reunion tour continue to swirl, longtime bassist Andy Bell has confirmed his presence within the lineup.


	Bell's presence was confirmed in a recent conversation with Austrian outlet OE24, who spoke to Bell following a performance in the country by his band Ride. “Yes, I'm in and I'm really looking forward to it,” Bell noted. “We'll see each other on tour. Or rather, you'll see me, because I'll hardly be able to spot you in the audience!”

	News of Bell's involvement gained traction in March after NME reported that “sources working closely with the band and tour” had outlined who would be performing with the Gallaghers onstage this year.




			Trending on Billboard		







	At the time of their split in 2009, Oasis officially featured Gem Archer on guitar, with Bell taking on bass, guitar, and keyboards. A series of touring drummers had sat behind the kit since the 2004 departure of Alan “Whitey” White, with Chris Sharrock holding the beat at their final shows.


	According to the March report, the forthcoming version of the band would see the Gallaghers joined by Archer and Bell, along with Oasis co-founder Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs, and Joey Waronker, who has previously performed with R.E.M., Beck, Roger Waters, and more.


	“NME tell me who your source pots are that keep giving you info about OASIS and I'll give you an exclusive interview about up n coming OASIS tour,” Liam Gallagher wrote in response to the report. “You can have it all but how much do you want it.”


	Bell – who had performed in Oasis since 1999 and later joined Liam Gallagher, Archer and Sharrock as a member of Beady Eye – previously sparked speculation of a reunion from the group in April 2024 when he was asked by Virgin Radio U.K.'s Andy Goldstein whether the band could ever perform together again.


	“I'm going to say a qualified yeah, I think they will at the end of the day,” Bell said. “I don't think it looks likely right now, but I think life is long, isn't it?”


	Liam Gallagher responded to Bell's comments on social media, writing, “Andy bell from ride the shoe gazing phenomenon should really not be getting people's hopes up it's not big and and it's not clever.”


	When pressed by a fan who claimed Bell was simply noting what Gallagher himself had claimed in the past, the vocalist claimed, “I've never mentioned oasis reunion it's over we must all really move in for our own mental health.”

	











	To date, Oasis have lined up more than 40 dates for their Live '25 outing, which will hit stadiums in the U.K., North America, Asia, Australia and South America from July through November. So far, the only participants confirmed by the Gallaghers to appear are the brothers themselves — who have not shared a stage since August 2009.


	News of Bell's self-confirmation comes soon after Alec McKinlay, who heads the band's Ignition Management and Big Brother Recordings, Oasis' U.K. label, disputed claims from Liam Gallagher that the band had a new album in the works.


	“This is very much the last time around, as Noel's made clear in the press,” McKinlay said in an interview with Music Week published Tuesday (May 13). “It's a chance for fans who haven't seen the band to see them, or at least for some of them to. But no, there's no plan for any new music.”

Snoop's 21st studio album is here.

	Michael Saponara



Snoop Dogg's longevity, work ethic and versatility can't be matched by many — if any — in the hip-hop realm. The Death Row legend returned on Thursday (May 14) with his 21st studio album, Iz It a Crime?

	Snoop stopped by The Breakfast Club on Wednesday (May 14) where he detailed how he's still feeling inspired to drop music at a high level even over 30 years into his Hall-of-Fame career.

	“I'm an MC and I love to rap and I love to make music, and people love my voice and they love when I make great records,” Snoop said. “When I don't make great records, people let me know that as well.”


	The Long Beach native continued: “I hear all of that and it makes me say to myself, ‘I should treat myself like a musician and not like a rapper.' If you a musician, you can make music until you die, but when you're a rapper they try to put a cap on you.”


	Snoop Dogg also previewed an accompanying movie for Iz It a Crime? during a private screening in NYC on Tuesday (May 13), but it's unclear when exactly the film will arrive. 


	 It's been a busy six months for the 53-year-old mogul. He reunited with Dr. Dre for Missionary in December, as the joint album debuted at No. 20 on the Billboard 200. 


	The Death Row gospel label compilation, Altar Call, which arrived in April and was dedicated to Snoop's late mother, also saw contributions from The Doggfather.

""Sometimes when my videos go viral, I have an anxiety attack. I don't read comments anymore. It's liberating,"" Lizzo said.

	Jessica Lynch



	On the latest episode of Therapuss, Lizzo joined host Jake Shane for a deeply personal and often hilarious conversation about her upcoming album Love in Real Life, her complex relationship with fame, and the viral moment that launched her 2017 single “Truth Hurts” to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	“The sync changed my f—ing life,” Lizzo recalled of the track's inclusion in the 2019 Netflix rom-com Someone Great. “I dropped ‘Truth Hurts' in 2017. I think they put it in Someone Great in 2018 or 2019. I was like, ‘Okay, cool.' That s— went so crazy — it launched ‘Truth Hurts' to the No. 1 song. A song that had been out for three years. From that one sync.”

	The hit marked her first Billboard Hot 100 entry and eventually became the longest-running solo No. 1 by a female rapper.


	Elsewhere in the episode, Lizzo spoke about writing music from pain, particularly her song “Soulmate.” “I was crying in the studio when I wrote it,” she said. “When I sing this song in a year, this will be me. I will believe these words, but b—-, I did not believe these words when I was writing it.”


	As for her new project Love in Real Life, Lizzo described it as “a diary of October 2023 to November 2024.” She added, “There's not one album that wasn't directly impacting my personal life… This time I wrote a song that doesn't have a happy ending.”


	She also addressed the emotional toll of viral fame. “All viral aint good viral. The internet don't know that they think all viral is good viral. It's not.” Jake added, “It's like all press is good press, it's like no.” 


	Lizzo added, “Sometimes when my videos going viral, I have an anxiety attack… And I'll be like ‘oh f—, what did I do wrong. I did something wrong, because I don't read comments anymore.”


	Noting it had been “two years” since she had read social media comments, she continued, “I never scrolled through my comments because that's hell, but I saw TikTok comments got so mean. You know when I really stopped after the very backhanded compliments trend.”


	The Therapuss interview also touched on Lizzo's decision to stop using dating apps (“I got kicked off Hinge for impersonating a celebrity — it was me”) and the heartbreak of disappointing a fan during a meet-and-greet while exhausted on tour. “That was my first time realizing: Oh wow, there can be misconceptions and you're not in control of it.”

	











	Lizzo's Love in Real Life is expected later this year.

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	Coming away from the $100 million global success of Oppenheimer in Imax (in a total global haul of $975.8M), Christopher Nolan made a challenge to Imax boss Rich Gelfond.


	“A year before Chris started filming The Odyssey, he called me and said he wanted to make a whole film shot with Imax cameras,” said Gelfond, speaking during a Imax lunch and press conference Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival.


	“That couldn't be done for a lot of reasons,” he added. Some of the complications to shooting on Imax film included reloading stock, galley sounds and the timely re-watching of dailies.

	











	“There were lots of issues,” said Gelfond when it came to shooting an entire movie in Imax, but Nolan told him, “‘I'm going to give you a challenge. If you can figure out how to solve these problems, I'm going to make Odyssey 100% film with film with Imax cameras,' and we've solved his problems. So, this will be the first film ever, at least filmed 100%, with Imax cameras.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The movie that comes to the closest to being entirely shot in Imax was Nolan's seven-time Oscar winner Oppenheimer. 


The Odyssey is Nolan's second movie with Universal since his departure from Warner Bros after making 2020's Tenet. The pic based on Homer's epic follows Odysseus in his perilous journey home after the Trojan War, showcasing his encounters with Polyphemus, the Sirens, Circe, and finishing with his reunion with his wife Penelope. The pic opens July 17, 2026; that mid-July frame has been a good-luck charm for Nolan, where he's launched Dunkirk, The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises, Oppenheimer and Inception. 


	Matt Damon stars as Odysseus. The pic also stars Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Anne Hathaway, Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Mia Goth, Elliot Page, Lupita Nyong'o and John Leguizamo.


	Most recently, Ryan Coogler's Sinners repped the first release shot with Imax film cameras (not digital) since Oppenheimer, and the last until next year's The Odyssey. Sinners is getting rereleased in 70MM Imax this week, and we hear sales are incredible. The Imax global run is north of $31M on Sinners. Beamed Gelfond today: “Chris forced us to rethink how we operated our film side of our business in different ways, so we have a program now to train new projectionists, and we're putting more parts around the world, and we're working harder at developing spare parts, and we're looking at ancillary things like film recorders and film scanners. You know, it's not just a camera thing. It kind of was a challenge to look at our business in a different way. And I'm glad he gave us that challenge.”

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


	The 28-day theatrical window for Greta Gerwig‘s Netflix movie Narnia isn't expected to hurt its Imax ticket sales, according to the large-format exhibitor's CEO Rich Gelfond.


	Quite often distributors like to keep audiences in the dark on movie Premium VOD and streaming release dates in advance so that such intel doesn't impact a movie's potential box office.


	In what is arguably a first for Imax, Gerwig's feature take of C.S. Lewis' classic is getting an exclusive two-week global run in the format across 1,000 auditoriums in 90 countries beginning November 26, 2026, with a streaming debut to follow on Netflix on Christmas Day.

	











	“Imax is so differentiated from the streaming experience,” said Gelfond on Wednesday at a Cannes luncheon and press conference. “I don't think we're concerned that the streaming window is going to cannibalize.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're quite confident that won't matter,” he added regarding the big difference between Imax moviegoers' demands and those of Netflix subscribers. 


	“[Netflix is] in a different business and that is selling subscriptions. In structuring the deal, we tried to accommodate how to meet their needs and how to meet our needs,” said Gelfond.


	“PVOD at 17 days hasn't really hurt the Imax box office,” Gelfond added. “I don't think people think those are competitive things.”


	In regards to the box office prospects for a two-week Imax run of a movie that's primed to get a big studio awards push, it's anybody's guess. Netflix's limited release of Rian Johnson's Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery earned $15 million in its first week back in 2022, while Imax's global run of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer minted a massive $100M (that was further propped by a 2D campaign from Universal).


	While Imax is committed to a two-week run of Narnia, “we have the option to extend the run,” says Gelfond.


	He added today that Gerwig is still mulling whether to shoot Narnia with Imax cameras.

Bono laid bare his transformation from Dublin lad Paul Hewson into a global rock star and human rights crusader in his memoir Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story. Now, premiering at Cannes, comes the Andrew Dominik-directed documentary Bono: Stories of Surrender. Culled from the U2 frontman's 2023 one-man show at New York's Beacon Theater, Bono weaves performances of his best-known hit songs into a tale of a youngster suffering the shocking loss of his mother and trying in vain to get the needed acknowledgment from a grieving father who withdrew and never mentioned his dead wife in their Dublin home. The need to fill the void and to be seen and heard led to a miracle. In the span of a week, the 16-year-old Bono found the family that would sustain him. In short order, he fell in love with future wife Ali, and found his bandmates Dave Evans (The Edge), Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton.

	











	The band they formed, U2, would go on to become one of the biggest in history, selling 170 million albums worldwide and winning a record-breaking 22 Grammys.

	Bono's lifelong activism began early too. In 1983, U2 released the album War, and the polemically charged song “Sunday Bloody Sunday” about the futility of violence with occupying British forces in Ireland. Then, in 1985, they answered pal Bob Geldof's call to perform at Live Aid, which raised hundreds of millions to feed starving refugees in Ethiopia. Told that the $250 million raised was comparable to the interest payments starving third world countries were paying to superpower debtor nations, Bono and friends pushed those nations to wipe the debts. The same passion toward wiping out HIV in Africa prompted governments around the world to provide billions of dollars toward the cause.

Bono: Stories of Surrender begins with the singer recalling when a congenital heart condition very nearly killed him in 2016, then expands into an intimate and moving tale of father-son dynamics. Bono came to terms with his chilly relationship with his father through the performances at the Beacon, and the documentary's climax reveals a great gift Bono received from the prickly fellow he still calls The Da.

	The film is the latest move in a long and innovative alliance between Bono and Apple, first with Steve Jobs and later his CEO successor Tim Cook. It began with Bono convincing Jobs to issue an iPod pre-loaded with U2's music. The relationship took a controversial turn — with an apology from Bono — when the singer crashed the catalogs of Apple Music iTunes customers with free copies of the U2 album Songs of Innocence, whether they wanted it or not. And now, the relationship continues as the documentary not only will screen on Apple TV+ after Cannes in 2D but a spectacularly immersive version will be available for owners of the Apple Vision Pro. Viewing the film through that device reveals a uniquely close and personal experience, complete with Bono's own drawings that sprout up in the wide frame. Apple pulled out all the stops here, and the technology places the viewer right up there onstage alongside Bono, close enough to see the faint scar in his chest where the heart surgeon saved his life.


	Here, Bono discusses why he felt this was the right vehicle for telling his story and why, after U2 christened The Sphere in Las Vegas with sensory overload-level performances, it was important to him to help push the envelope on a more intimate technology that the Vision Pro promises. Mostly, though, this is a discussion about Irish families, and fathers and their sons.


DEADLINE: What does it mean to have this very personal documentary premiering in Cannes?


BONO: Apart from the reward that they offer us in terms of good weather if you're Irish, what I love about the French is their love of cinema. It's the highest art, in the French public's mind. The Cannes Film Festival became this phenomenon, formed because the Venice Film Festival had been taken over by Mussolini and his German mate with the funny Charlie Chaplin mustache. They were getting to choose who won the big prize in Venice. So the French said in 1939, “We're going to replace the film festival in Italy, which has been taken over by the fascists, and we are going to have a free film festival.” They didn't get to do it until after the war, but this was an amazing idea of freedom of expression.

	It's always a wonder to see this Oscars on the sea, the Palme d'Or. I remember Penelope Cruz winning the best actress. There was a whole bunch of people around in a busy restaurant. She walked in and as I was trying to get out of the table, she just stood up on the chair and stood up on the table and walked down it, sat down and said, “So what are you drinking?” And the whole of France is at her feet. … I'm very excited about Europe, at the moment. In America, you're going through some difficult times.


DEADLINE: What do you mean, specifically?


BONO: You're fighting with yourself, about the identity of America, and Europe feels somewhat abandoned. We have a land war on European territory, and it could spread. People are preparing for the thought that America might not be with us if this land war spreads, and Putin follows in the role of the Soviet Union and puts tanks in Czechoslovakia and just takes over. So this is a feeling for me, for Europe, that this is a time when Europe is going to draw together. At this festival, you're going to feel that. … I'm really proud this tiny little film about my little family and the early days of U2 is getting its outing in Europe. I want it to be embraced by America, and I think it will. I've had other incredibly encouraging words from friends and people like Sean Penn who were there giving advice. There's something poetic about it being in Cannes.


DEADLINE: There is a universality to the Hewson family story that comes through in the film.












BONO: I will say, even I've gotten sick of the protagonist. It's that old line you fear most: “Here's another great thing about me!” And no matter what you do, what you say about your flaws, your fault lines and all the blood and guts of the story, it can still come across as, “Here's another great thing about me.”


DEADLINE: How did you protect against that?


BONO: I had to dig quite deep and just go for a family story. All families are little operas, some bigger than others. There's always the soap opera, and there's suds here. There are tenors; there's the figure of my father, which kind of dominates. And the band. People wouldn't be turning up to hear my story if it wasn't for them. Overall, as excruciating as it's been — and I'm glad it's over — this is a great close to it.


	To come from The Sphere to the intimacy of the Beacon is quite a shift. And this Vision Pro brings it back to an immersive experience. But intimacy is at the heart, I would say, of all of those projects. I tell my friends, “Intimacy is the new punk rock.” If I'm going to do one of these memoirs, I'd better really go there. It shouldn't be the same approach others have taken. We performed in The Sphere, and that is what got me to Vision Pro. The core of this is, “Can we make this radical intimacy?” Does that sound pretentious? Probably.


DEADLINE: I understand challenging yourself to rise to the occasion, knowing you could and should fail. Add self-loathing that my own father left me with, and well, maybe this is in fact an Irish thing.


BONO: Well, there we go. Insecurity is your best security. I make this joke about Italians and Irish, and actually Jimmy Iovine told me it was true. He said, “I was [my father's] son. I couldn't put a foot wrong. Every idea I ever had was the greatest idea ever.” His father just loved him and convinced him everything's possible; in an Italian [household], these are clichés. In my home, and it sounds like yours too, that's not how it worked. I was competitive with my father. That must've been annoying for everyone around us, especially him. And that's the reason for my singing, at the end of the film, becoming him, me becoming the tenor. “You're a baritone who thinks he's a tenor,” my dad would say. And he was exactly right, it was an accurate description. So, becoming him at the end of the film, it was a big moment of release for me, my way of saying, “Thank you for the voice that you gave me.” When he passed, something freed up in me, for sure. And something changed in my voice. But the thing was that playing him night after night, just the turn of his head [depicting conversations with him in the one-man show] … I always loved my father, but I started to really like him. And I started to realize his put-downs were much funnier than I, the rebellious teenager, had credited him for. … Being him, I just started to really like him, and he started making me laugh. I wish I'd gotten the jokes when I was younger. Tell me about your father for a second.


DEADLINE: A good Irishman, grew up a drinker, stopped cold one day. Always fearful for his job, and any praise toward me was faint praise, not dissimilar to what you got. Cut to, I go see, in Mel Gibson's office, The Passion of the Christ and am so profoundly moved by Christ's suffering that I say to my parents, “See this movie, and let's go back to St. Patrick's Church in Bay Shore, Long Island.” Most Sundays for two years we did that. My son and I had a couple of years with my father that broke down barriers like you describe with your dad in this film. Then Hurricane Sandy hit Long Island, and when the power went out, he opened the screen door at the worst moment, hung onto the handle when a gust of wind blew it open. He cracks his head on the concrete landing. At 80 and on blood thinners, he died as abruptly as you watched your mother die when she collapsed at her dad's gravesite and died from an aneurysm. As a coping mechanism, I turned to stone so my kids could grieve around me. I lost my faith because I'd arranged for that stoop to be demolished that very day. It felt like a cruel joke. It wasn't until I saw the film Fruitvale Station and saw my dad in the dying young man Michael B. Jordan played, and I fell apart. This is supposed to be about you and your father, not mine, but you asked, and there you go. I miss him terribly, and every song you sang about your father after he died, I felt losing my father and I realize it is why I identify so strongly with the compelling father-son story you tell in this film. 


BONO: I've been writing about grief for a while. And we have a song on Songs of Innocence called “California,” and it goes something like, “There's no end to grief. That's how we know there's no end to love.” You know you will never get over it, by the way. I'm here to deliver you the good and the bad of that. What was an icy, chilling feeling eventually over time gets replaced by this warm ache that you would miss, were it not there. Now, when I think of my father, I have a really beautiful warm feeling, and the same with my mother. But the laughter is also important to find, because I bet you and your father had some funny. … He comes from that [Irish] point of view. There's some funny sh*t.

	











DEADLINE: There was a lot of that. He was always quick with a good joke.


BONO: Laughing about it is really important. And being there, as you say, for your own kids but not turning to stone. We start out that way, and then we have to dissolve and allow them to see the strength that comes from owning up to your vulnerabilities. That's what my father never got to. And now I can use words like stoicism, I can use words like heroic, and now I can feel guilty for being such a pain in the ass. But I think it would've been OK for him to say: “I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. I've got two kids. I have no mother for you. I can't replace her.” There are other complications, but I'm free and just so grateful for my origin story, and I hope it's of any use to anybody.


DEADLINE: In the film you admit your mom's memory was expunged to where you felt like you, your dad and brother essentially “disappeared” her. What toll did that take on you?


BONO: That was [dad's] way of dealing with it. I've no resentment, but I don't think it's a good strategy. Because when you talk about somebody when they're gone, they stay alive. Otherwise, you actually lose memories. There were a few reasons for writing the book, but one was largely to explain myself to myself, but also to my family, and [create] a record of what was going on whilst they were alive.


	We try to get things out in the open in our house. We actually have a feisty table, but it's also a lot of fun, a lot of laughs. But about the disappearing of Iris: I almost wrote the book to retrieve memories of her. We lost — my brother Norman and I — so much, just removing her name from the conversation. You've got to talk about these people. I mean, I think you can overdo it, too, but no, [silence] was not the right strategy. But I do not hold that against my father, Bob, the Da.


DEADLINE: How much of that unspoken hole in your life led you to form such early permanent bonds with your future wife, Ali, and your bandmates?


BONO: Well, look, it's psychology 101, but yes, I ran away with the circus. There wasn't a family anymore. And what a circus it turned out to be. I married what I thought was the tightrope walker, the girl on the pony. She turned out to be the ringmaster. That's Ali. I was probably the tightrope walker.


DEADLINE: In Bruce Springsteen's early concerts, he would talk about the battles he had with his father, who tortured and ridiculed a young man trying to find himself. Would we have Springsteen's album Darkness on the Edge of Town if he'd grown up with that unconditional love and support like Jimmy Iovine did? Without that edge, would he have worked in a garage all week and been a wedding singer on the weekends? And then in the film we hear you telling your opera-obsessed dad that Pavarotti asked you and The Edge to collaborate with him, and he asks if the world's most famous opera singer had knocked on the wrong door. How driven were you to seek your father's approval and how did that serve you?


BONO: I mean, Bruce gets married every night to his audience, so in that sense he is the greatest wedding singer ever, and they're the greatest wedding band. U2 are definitely weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs. Yeah, the wailing, this thing of singing. … We've a song called “The Showman.” The opening lyric is, “Baby's crying ‘cause it's born to sing/Singers cry about everything/Still in the playground falling off a swing.” When I started out with U2, I wouldn't have called it singing exactly, either. I would've called it shouting, but it is a kind of wail, and part of it is that primal thing that we've been talking about, but part of it is just not being ignored. But there's something about singing. I was learning about singing from my father. This is not scientific, but he, I feel, bequeaths me in his passing an extra tone to my voice, and as I let go of all that resentment and rage, I changed. I just loosened up, and the voice loosened up. Singing is not just for entertainment. The blues, that's another thing that came out of wailing, you know? The Irish word for grief, it's called keening. You'll hear it in Africa. It's bloodcurdling, [occurring during] the loss of life. In Ireland, in our history, we've all seen it in the present day in exceptional situations, but it was part of the ritual. There's something about, you sing yourself out of your situation. You breathe.

	











DEADLINE: That is quite a scene you create at the start of the movie, when you almost died on the operating table, unable to breathe because a blister on your heart had burst.


BONO: The opening of the film is about breathing, right, and the fear I felt when I was on the operating table, I was having heart surgery, and I hallucinated. It was this guy from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, but it turned out to be a very nice man called David Adams, a surgeon with a Texas accent, who saved my life. I think that I had no fear of the surgery or anything like that, but I remember the loss of air and feeling like my lungs were flooding or filling up. I'm a singer, so those lungs are really necessary, and that was the closest thing I came to losing my faith, as you were talking about earlier. It was the closest thing I'd had to panic, since I was a child. It wasn't about the heart surgery. I thought I was suffocating.


DEADLINE: When you told your father about Pavarotti, you were fishing for some validation. How did you take the slight when he joked it must be a mistake?


BONO: I think that's right at the root of this story, for sure. But we end the film at the Teatro di San Carlo, the oldest opera house in the world. It sounds like the most mad idea, “By the way, it's all set in the Beacon, but for one scene we just need to get to Naples, because this would blow my father's mind. I'm going to become him, and I'll be the opera singer that he had inside of him, but we have to do it here. The pub we met at all the time is called the Sorrento Lounge in Finnegan's, and we need to finish in the bay of Sorrento. It's all going to make sense.” Andrew Dominik, of course, gets it totally, but the people at Apple … you would expect a very serious, puzzled look on their faces. They said: “Yes. If this is that important to you, then we're doing this. We're in with you all the way.” It's preposterous, but finishing in Italy in one of the most sacred places of music, and the most beautiful thing happens.


DEADLINE: Was there ever a moment where you felt validated by your father?












BONO: That happened in Texas where U2 was playing in the '90s and I'd set up the spotlight to shine on him. This is his first time in the United States, in Texas, which is a whole other thing, more American than the Americans themselves. He comes and it's like the sound of 10 747s, the roar of the crowd in Texas. And in the bright point in the show, I go: “Listen, I've got a person here today that means a lot to me. It's his first time in America and it's his first time in the state of Texas, and it is my father. And he's right over there.” And everyone turns around, they see the spotlight and my da. He shakes his fist. But afterwards he comes back[stage], and I can see he's a bit shaken. He shakes my hand and he says, “You're very professional.” Probably the only compliment a former punk rock singer wants to hear, or the only compliment you don't want to hear, rather. But of course it's a whole other language, and it was beautiful. And the more we talk about this, I can see it touches you as it touches me for our personal reasons. The book was a love story to my missus in a way. But the film is a love story, to my mother, but it's different because I never fell out with my mother. She was taken away from me before I got to know her, or she me, but I fell in love with my father. Is that Italian or Irish enough for you?


DEADLINE: You've hovered around movies a long time, supplying songs for Martin Scorsese, Wim Wenders and many other directors. What's the closest you came to taking a leap into acting or directing, and what held you back?


BONO: I could never be an actor. The reason I wanted to work with Andrew Dominik was not just that he was a great painter of scenes and of story, but he was a great director of actors, and non-actors. His first film Chopper, that was Eric Bana, a comedian who had been on TV a bit. He takes that role and becomes the Eric Bana that we now know of. That film Chopper is the most like Andrew Dominik, meaning it's as serious and funny as he is, and the humor of it is bewitching. Andrew drove me mad, though some people say I was there already. Asking me to say goodbye to my father, five times in one day we did that scene … and I was like, “I couldn't do this.” I was in bits. “I do this five times?” And he goes, “Yeah, the lens is a lie detector, Bono.” And I'm saying, “Andrew, didn't Marlon Brando say he lied for a living?” “Not on this set.” He knows what you think, in the lens, and you'd better be all there. That's why I couldn't be an actor, though for certain scenes it is great fun.


	My daughter Eve [Hewson] is an unbelievable actor, but in a funny way, when you're in U2, you've got all the bells and whistles, the big productions and fireworks going off in your head and in your heart when you're singing.


DEADLINE: U2 has done such ambitious multimedia presentations in concerts and the Sphere residency. Here, you make do with a simple table and chairs.


BONO: It's the operating theater, the table, but it's also the dining table in our house on Cedarwood Road in Dublin. Also, the chairs are the members of the band, and one of them's Ali. These are props. We've been on tour with 250 trucks, and now I'm down to four chairs. You could fit all the props in a station wagon.


	When my father offers his last words to me, which indeed were an expletive … I don't think he was telling me to f*ck off. I'm not ruling it out, but [I think it was directed at] the monkey on his back. But it's that table. The table. Just no matter where you are, a nice little cottage or Cedarwood Road, there's something about that kitchen table. That's where it all comes out. The funny, funny sh*t, or those arguments. I mean, talking about faith, Christmas morning in our place, that's when it really went off and we'd be at each other's throats. So much for Prince of Peace, right? Even Santa Claus would've got a thump. Always politics and religion, the two things you're not supposed to talk about. That's all we were interested in talking about. And Irish people. There was one other thing we were really interested in talking about, except we don't, and that is sex.


DEADLINE: How does it feel to see Eve's emerging star, considering the way you followed your dad's tenor dreams?












BONO: Following her career is a kind of an adventure in itself because you just never know where she's going to go next. Single mother, comedian, femme fatale. She can be big, and then small. Even her family, honestly, we have no clue where she's going next. When she takes [on a role], boom! — she's gone in there. Our son [Elijah] who's out in public, he's a guitar player and singer [in the band Inhaler] and an inhaler of life. He's got the internal mental discipline to be a good songwriter. I'm certainly proud when I see [Eve on screen]. She does this thing where she puts the evolution of her character all over her apartment, the bathroom wall, to find the face she's thinking about. Maybe this is normal, I don't know. And I saw her at her table for one of her characters and there was a picture of my mother, and I said, “Oh, it's Iris.” She said, “Yeah, her look and her vibe. I need some of it. So I have her there when I'm getting my makeup on every day.” Isn't that wild?


DEADLINE: The first time I saw the film on Apple Vision Pro, I was the proverbial caveman looking at fire. I felt like I was onstage with you. What sparked you to put in that work here to help advance this technology, and where do you see it going in terms of disruptive storytelling?


BONO: Apple have this new sonic innovation commitment to fidelity of sound. Sounds are becoming really important in movies, in people's home cinemas. The Vision Pro, it's a commitment. You're getting into a world, and there are extraordinary things I've seen through the Vision Pro. … We had this idea of, well, the camera can be onstage and walking around you. We couldn't light it as easy as we thought, but we successfully got the viewer on stage. I took out my drawings from the stage show for the filming, and they're not in the 2D Apple TV+ version of Stories of Surrender, but they are in Vision Pro. Those childlike drawings — no one would like to be able to draw as badly as me — but it's like a signature, a fingerprint.


DEADLINE: How did it help to personalize an already personal story?


BONO: It made it really playful. I know Apple are dying to make the Vision Pro more affordable and more democratic, but they're committed to innovation, they're committed to experimenting. They know not everyone can afford this, but they're still going for it, believing that some way down the line, it'll make financial sense for them. But the fact that they may have to wait a while is not putting them off.


DEADLINE: What's your favorite movie, and what stars helped you shape what you wanted to look like onstage?


BONO: I think my favorite film is Wings of Desire by Wim Wenders. It just changed me, because it was this idea that angels would die to feel some of the ache and the pain of falling in love, because grief is the price we pay for love. The other one for me, growing up, was Peter Sellers and Being There, a genius meditation to me. Jim Sheridan is, to me, one of the great directors of all time. His first film was with Daniel Day-Lewis, My Left Foot. That blew my mind. He'd come from theater. I said to him: “How'd you do that? How did you know how to be on set with all these very technical things that were so very different than theater?” He said: “Eh. I just walked up to the DP and when he said to me, ‘How do I set this next shot up?' I said, ‘You tell me. I'm here to learn.' I did the same with Daniel, the same with everybody.” He said, “It's amazing, if you ask people what they think, they sometimes tell you.” Yeah, he's a psychological genius. His understanding of people, his understanding of great stories, deep structure in Shakespeare, Greek tragedy, he's a very big brain. He'd give you hope that you could come from one discipline into another. Sam Mendes is also incredible; he moved from theater into cinema.


	Well, I thank you for taking the time out, but also for giving me a glimpse into your origin story. That made a big difference to me, I felt I could be sitting in a coffee shop or a bar, and we'd have had very close to the same conversation. But I'd like to think I'd have asked you more questions and listened more, and asked you more about your father.

	











DEADLINE: And if we had more time, I might've spent it giving you a proper apology for all the years that I have been mangling your beautiful songs, singing along in the car.


BONO: Turn up the volume, I say. I promise you this, we're working on something quite extraordinary at the moment, Edge, Adam, Larry and myself, so we're not going to let you down.


DEADLINE: Any final observations on you and your father, or fathers in general?


BONO: Steven Spielberg just flashed into my mind. Because Eve is working with him now, and I'm fed up hearing about Steven this, Steven that, and that Steven Spielberg is now the adult in the room in our house. And I would have to say the morality of his films was and is a North Star, not just for Eve, but for our family. As I say, I'm annoyed, I'm a little hurt that I come second as a sort of male figure or authority figure. Not that I was ever an authority figure for Eve, but the only person she'd probably listen to now, is him.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


Cannes Film Festival Delegate General Thierry Fremaux has banned an actor due to walk the red carpet Thursday with Palme d'Or contender Dossier 137 after it emerged that he has been accused of sexual assault by three women.


	Théo Navarro-Mussy was set to join the cast and crew this evening for the Competition screening of Dominik Moll's drama Dossier 137, about a police officer assigned to a case about a young man alleging police violence.  


	According to French film and TV magazine Télérama, which broke the story, Frémaux made the decision after being informed by actors' association ADA of official complaints against the actor for rape as well as physical and psychological violence by three women.

	











	The accusations relate to events in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The complaint was dismissed by the courts in April 2025, but the plaintiffs have said they are planning to lodge an appeal as civil parties.

	Cannes has never announced an official protocol around how it will deal with participants accused of sexual violence, but Frémaux appears to have taken his cue from the rules set out by the French César Academy.


	The César Academy protocol states that cinema professionals under investigation for any violent acts are not welcome at the ceremony and can't receive any type of award, publicly or behind closed doors, until the case is ruled on.


	Frémaux was quoted as saying in the Télérama article: “Because there is an appeal and therefore a continuation of the investigation, the case is not suspended. Once it's ruled on definitively in the courts, it will be different.”


	Cannes has bolstered its response to participants accused of sexual violence in recent years, after coming under under fire in the past amid the rise of the #MeToo movement, with a number of actresses publicly accusing the festival of turning a blind eye to sexually inappropriate behavior by some of its guests.

	In 2023, French actress Adèle Haenel wrote an open letter in which she suggested that Cannes was part of an ecosystem that allowed a “general complacency” towards sexual predators.

	











	Frémaux responded in his pre-opening press conference that year that her comments were “false” and “erroneous.”


	Actress and filmmaker Judith Godrèche, who sparked a #MeToo revival in France last year after she spoke up about sexual abuse at the hands of director Benoît Jacquot, was among multiple actresses to have recounted inappropriate behavior from Harvey Weinstein during Cannes.


	Earlier this year, a French parliamentary inquiry spearheaded by Godrèche said in its conclusions that sexual abuse, as well as physical and psychological violence, was endemic in the French film industry, and called on Cannes to be part of the solution in stamping it out.


	A festival spokesperson has confirmed that the Tèlérama report is correct.

After weeks of reports that Kelly Clarkson wants to leave her daily talk show in the dust, NBC has announced the Grammy winner and former coach on “The Voice” will host a new primetime series, due to premiere in August 2025. 

On May 14, Variety reported that NBC greenlit the new show starring Clarkson, which will turn a popular feature on her talk show called “Songs & Stories” into a limited series. In each of the four episodes, Clarkson will interview different music superstars: Teddy Swims, Lizzo, the Jonas Brothers, and Gloria Estefan. 

Clarkson will not only host but executive produce her “Songs & Stories” show, according to Variety. The weekly episodes will air on August 19, August 26, September 2, and September 9 at 10 p.m. Eastern time. 

When Clarkson has hosted “Songs & Stories” themed episodes of “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” which airs on over 200 stations across the U.S., she's had in-depth discussions about music with R&B singer Babyface, country stars Miranda Lambert and Garth Brooks, 90s icon Alanis Morisssette, and pop superstar Pink. Clarkson also performed duets with some of them. 

The “Breakaway” singer's primetime show will follow a similar format, according to Variety. The outlet reported that NBC's logline for the “Songs & Stories” series says each episode is “a front-row pass for Kelly Clarkson to engage with some of her favorite celebrities and examine both their music and personal lives. The specials are a forum where iconic voices meet heartfelt storytelling through unfiltered conversation and sung in an intimate, unplugged setting.”

It's not clear if NBC and Clarkson hope to continue “Songs & Stories” after its initial four-episode run. 

Clarkson's limited primetime series is an interesting development amid questions about her future on  “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” 

In early April, Page Six reported that Clarkson wanted to leave the NBC show, which moved from Los Angeles to New York in 2023. The singer was eager for a fresh start for herself and her kids — daughter River and son Remy — following her drawn-out divorce from their dad, Brandon Blackstock, per People. 

But after multiple unexplained absences from her daily talk show in March, with a rotation of celebrities filling in, an insider told Page Six that the single mom was finding her work schedule “grueling” and keeping her away from quality time with her kids. 

On May 9, while performing in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Clarkson lamented to the audience that her concerts were few and far between because of her taping schedule, the outlet reported. 

“We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job,” she told the crowd. 

In December, Deadline reported that “The Kelly Clarkson Show” had been renewed for a seventh season, “to take her up to the end of 2026.” 

Meanwhile, Clarkson will return to her old stomping grounds at “The Voice” for the May 20 season finale, to perform her new single, “Where Have U Been?” She was a coach on the show from seasons 14 through 21, and returned for season 23.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","“Yellowstone” Spinoff Dutton Ranch Gets a Release Window","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/yellowstone-spinoff-dutton-ranch-major-update/","Thu, 15 May 2025 16:12:26 GMT","

Paramount has officially confirmed that “Dutton Ranch,” the long-anticipated “Yellowstone” spinoff starring Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser, is arriving in Q4 of this year. The update came directly from Chris McCarthy, co-CEO of Paramount Global, during the company's Q1 2025 earnings call held Friday, May 9.

While McCarthy didn't name a specific month, the timing of the announcement and typical network rollout windows suggest a likely November premiere. The series will debut first on Paramount Network, before streaming on Paramount+, following the same release strategy used for “Yellowstone.”

“Dutton Ranch” is expected to pick up where “Yellowstone” left off after its season 5 finale aired in December. That episode wrapped with Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler leaving the original ranch and settling near Dillon, Montana. Although they have distanced themselves from John Dutton's property, they haven't moved far, geographically or narratively.

No additional cast members have been confirmed for the sequel, and it remains unclear whether Beth and Rip will reconnect with characters from the original “Yellowstone” run. However, given the popularity of the duo, the spinoff will likely focus on their evolving life together post-Dutton Ranch chaos.

Cole Hauser hinted to People that fans hadn't seen the last of the couple. “Hopefully, we can continue to get in people's living rooms and entertain them the way we have over the last seven years,” he said, adding, “America has spoken—they still love ‘Yellowstone'.”

With Hauser and Reilly leading the charge, “Dutton Ranch” seems poised to carry the franchise's emotional weight and gritty Western appeal into a new chapter.

“Dutton Ranch” is just one part of what Taylor Sheridan and Paramount are calling a “massive expansion” of the “Yellowstone” universe. According to Bloomberg, Sheridan has at least four new projects in development, including prequels, sequels, and a handful of standalone spinoffs.

The upcoming prequel “1944” will continue the Dutton family timeline, following the critical success of earlier entries “1883” and “1923.” Meanwhile, a separate CBS-ordered spinoff will feature Luke Grimes reprising his role as Kayce Dutton. That project, aimed at broadcast audiences, is expected to premiere in 2026.

Another new title, “The Madison,” will be set in the “Yellowstone” universe but shift focus to a new family—the Clyburns. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Fox, the series is being positioned as a high-end drama for Paramount+.

Sheridan has admitted that “Yellowstone” ended earlier than he planned, largely due to scheduling and creative tensions with Kevin Costner. As a result, “Dutton Ranch” offers him a chance to continue the legacy while exploring fresh territory.

For now, fans will need to stay tuned for an official trailer and a confirmed premiere date. But one thing is certain—”Dutton Ranch” is coming, and it's bringing two of “Yellowstone's” most iconic characters with it.

Tell us! Which one of Taylor Sheridan's “Yellowstone” spinoffs are you looking forward to the most? Let us know in the comments below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Max Reboot Everybody Was Asking For","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/max-name-reboot-warner-bros-streaming/","Thu, 15 May 2025 15:48:01 GMT","

It appears as though Warner Bros. Discovery joined every other fan of their shows and movies in asking “Who is Max?”

After removing hundreds of hours of Sesame Street, licensing its popular shows and movies to the likes of free streamers Tubi and Roku, and generally trying to be Netflix-lite, the streamer is looking to recapture the heyday of streaming with a name change.

Although, the next name viewers see on the service will look mightily familiar.

A post shared by Max (@streamonmax)

Two years after dropping the HBO from the title, Max is finally getting back to its original namesake as HBO Max. The news was announced at Warner Bros. Discovery's upfront on May 14.

The move comes just two months after the Max logo was changed to resemble the HBO logo.

On the decision to revert back to HBO Max, Warner Bros. Discovery indicates that consumer familiarity is the goal. 

In a press release, they state: “This evolution has also been influenced by changing consumer needs, and the fact that no consumer today is saying they want more content, but most consumers are saying they want better content. With other services filling the more basic needs with volume, WBD has clearly distinguished itself through its quality and distinct stories, and no brand has done that better and more consistently over 50+ years than HBO.”

In the same press release, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery David Zaslav reiterated the company's focus on excellence the HBO brand instilled decades ago. 

“The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming,” he said. “Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.”

President and CEO of Streaming JB Perrette added “We will continue to focus on what makes us unique – not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families. It's really not subjective, not even controversial – our programming just hits different.”

Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, expresses the continued focus on quality over quantity.

“With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition. And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.” 

There's no word on the exact date of the name change. However, the timeline is set for this summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kate Middleton Debuts Hairstyle ‘of the Summer'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kate-middleton-hair/","Thu, 15 May 2025 09:36:00 GMT","

The former Kate Middleton is changing up her look, and it's getting rave reviews.

According to Hello!, the Princess of Wales showed off lighter locks when she “stepped out for an engagement in Scotland” in May 2025.

The shade “was immediately crowned the colour of the summer,” the publication reported. The good news for Kate fans is that the princess appears to be on the rebound in her battle against cancer.

Although the Princess of Wales has played around with different shades and colors during her time in the public eye, her hair has often been a darker chocolate brown.

Now Hello! is dubbing the Princess's blonde highlights a new color called “bronde.”

Stuart Marsh, a creative colour director, told Hello! that the “bronde” color is “a mini masterclass in how to refresh your look without a drastic change.”

In some photos, her highlights look more auburn in tone than blonde. Over the years, Kate has also experimented with different hair lengths and has at times had her hair more layered.

Marsh explained to Hello! how people can get Kate's look.

“For darker hair tones, bronde can be tweaked with tone and depth to match eye colour and skin complexion. The possibilities are endless!,” he told the publication. 

“If you are a natural brunette, lifting the hair two or three shades adds dimension and gives a subtle, sun-kissed effect. Ask for two tones in the hair lifting process to make sure there are multiple tones running through seamlessly,” Marsh added to Hello!.

Photos on Getty Images show that the former Kate Middleton has been holding a variety of public appearances lately.

For example, she appeared at the British Fashion Council at 180 Studios in central London on May 14, 2025, according to Getty Images photos. 

On May 8, photos show her attending a concert to” mark the 80th Anniversary of VE Day at Horse Guards Parade.” Those Getty Images photos show that Kate debuted another style trend there, wearing her hair pulled back with a black velvet bow.

She was photographed in a plum jacket and hat to “mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day on May 05, 2025,” a Getty caption says. Her hair looked darker in those photos.

Sydney Sweeney and Paul Walter Hauser are an unlikely Bonnie and Clyde for crime thriller “Americana.” 

The ensemble film, which premiered at SXSW, is set in South Dakota, where small-town diner waitress Penny Jo Poplin (Sweeney) dreams of becoming the next Dolly Parton — she just has to get to Nashville first, though. Enter fellow local outcast, rancher Lefty Ledbetter (Hauser), who just might have the funds to get out of town…if the theft of a coveted Indigenous Lakota ghost shirt goes through. 

The official synopsis reads: “A gallery of dynamic characters clash over the possession of a rare Native American artifact in this wildly entertaining modern-day western. After the artifact falls onto the black market, a shy waitress with big dreams (Sweeney) teams up with a lovelorn military veteran (Hauser) to gain possession of it, putting them in the crosshairs of a ruthless criminal (Eric Dane) working on behalf of a Western antiquities dealer (Simon Rex). Bloodshed ensues when others join the battle, including the leader of an indigenous group (Zahn McClarnon) and a desperate woman fleeing her mysterious past (Halsey).”

It was inevitable. On Wednesday at Cannes at the packed grand théâtre Lumière, Christopher McQuarrie, wearing a pale peach suit, measuredly answered questions from French journalist Didier Allouch about his writing and directing career, from “The Usual Suspects” (social media would give away the twisty ending today) and “The Way of the Gun” with Benicio del Toro, to collaborating with Tom Cruise on 11 movies. Then his star popped in, sporting a short-sleeved maroon ensemble, to hijack the conversation.

While Cruise and McQuarrie say the right things about respecting each other, it's clear how much power Cruise has over the “Mission” franchise, now in its eighth iteration. While “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” is billed as the finale (Paramount is bidding to increase box office over the last disappointing installment, which was creamed by “Barbenheimer”), a special IMAX screening later that evening played rousingly and offered an open-ended conclusion. (The $400 million film was shot in IMAX.) After a London premiere and buzzy Cannes launch, the movie hits global screens on May 23. The box office will tell whether there's an appetite for more.

“I'm a diehard believer in the big-screen experience,” said McQuarrie. “What makes film special is however many hundreds of strangers all come together to sit in the room and watch something together and experience something together. Streaming is in danger of driving that into extinction. How do I define cinema? It's a place where people come to watch movies, which some people in the industry view as an anachronism, and I don't. More and more over the 30 years I've been doing it, a wedge has been driven through the center of cinema. Are you going to be an artist? Are you going to be an entertainer and an artist? What defines cinema for me ss one that merges the two. What you see in these ‘Mission: Impossible' movies: I'm trying to find, through that vessel, a way to say things, a way to imbue meaning and to make commentary. And the movie is constantly fighting those things back. That is the struggle. And that's where I choose to exist.”

Ever since they met on “Valkyrie” (2009), McQuarrie and Cruise have been joined at the hip. And they agree that Hollywood needs to thrive by not trying to crush each other's opening weekend, but to support others' success. 

 










“We should not be competing with one another,” said McQuarrie. “We should all be serving one another. We should be working for this. We should be working to serve the mechanism…I look at things in terms of deposits and withdrawals. ‘Top Gun: Maverick' is a deposit. That is something where we are doing what we can to bring as many people into the theater and to keep that mechanism thriving, so that a film like ‘Anora' can come and be in theaters and take the time to grow.”

The secret of their bond as auteur and producer-star? “It's not complicated,” said Cruise. “We love movies. We love telling stories.” The “Mission” movies are “meticulously worked out. The material assets of the film are figured out long in advance. What isn't in stone is the heart of the story, which is character.” 

Added to the established “Mission” crew (Ving Rhames, Pom Klementieff, Hayley Atwell, and Simon Pegg) in the new movie are Hannah Waddington as the commander of a destroyer and Angela Bassett as the president of the United States, which is on the brink of the apocalypse as cyber foe Entity is taking over nuclear arsenals around the world. The only man who can stop the Entity? Cruise's Ethan Hunt, of course. 

In order to retrieve the original source code of the Entity and destroy it, Hunt has to risk life and limb and dive into icy arctic waters to a sunken Soviet submarine teetering 500 feet underwater. Filming that sequence in rotating tanks was a masterful technical and artistic achievement. “You have to understand how to put these pieces together,” said Cruise. “It is a Swiss watch of keeping the audience's attention, investment in the characters.”

 










In order to achieve these ambitious set pieces, McQuarrie has learned over time what he has to do. “When you design something that ambitious, you come up with a plan, you prepare meticulously, you pat yourself on the back, and then physics hits you square in the face,” he said. “What Tom and I do is take everything we learned from the last film and apply it to this one. The submarine is its own ecosystem. Remember that when you're watching Tom inside this semi-submerged rotating room inside the submarine that is housed inside a 60-foot diameter, 1000-ton, 360-degree rotating, fully submersible steel drum in an 8.5 million liter tank. And he's inside it. What you're watching is us testing it, because there is no way to test that thing. There's no model. We built a model and we put a little plastic figure and a bunch of torpedoes in it, and rotated it once, and they smashed the little plastic figure. When you set a camera, then you turn the set on, and the set is rotating, the camera won't be where you put it when Tom gets there. It was a talented group of people who had to anticipate where to put the camera, so that it was always collecting Tom. That in and of itself is a level of engineering that you can't imagine.”

Even more impressive is what Cruise had to do during the biplane aerial sequence, “the craziest stunt in this movie,” McQuarrie said. “Now put Tom on the wing of the biplane with that camera in between the wings of the biplane. When we started designing the sequence, we went to Wingwalkers who do this professionally, and they said, ‘What do you want to do?' And Tom said, ‘I want to be zero G in between the wings of the plane.' And these people, who do this for a living and are part of a decades-long tradition, said, ‘No, you're not going to do that,' and Tom said, ‘Thank you for your time.' And we went on to some other people.”

 










Added Cruise: “But also it's finding the camera positions and all of the engineering. It represents thousands of hours of work of many people, craftsmen, pilots, engineers, decades of work to be able to develop these things, which is studying these aerial sequences. I fly jets, I fly aerobatic airplanes, helicopters. And then how do we apply an understanding of those physics? I will be pulling this in or parachuting, and I say, ‘OK, I understand enough about this. I really do believe we can do it.'”

The airplane stunt was the result of McQuarrie “foolishly showing Tom a TikTok video, thinking he'd simply be amused by it,” McQuarrie said. “And he said, ‘I could do that.' And I said, ‘No, you can't.' And then we went about developing that process to do it.”

When Cruise is in the biplane, he is completely alone. “He's at the controls, and his biplane suffers some damage,” said McQuarrie. “There's tension. There's a moment where the camera is in profile, and Tom Cruise looks over at the damaged strut of his biplane. The camera throws focus, and it's this beautiful backlit-shot sun. You see this vibrating strut, and Tom turns back, and the camera racks focus to Tom.”

There's no crew with Cruise in an airplane at 10,000 feet above Africa. “Tom is lighting the shot by how he's positioning the plane in its relationship to the sun, and he's operating focus just off-camera. He is the crew in every single shot you see. I'm talking to Tom on a radio where he can barely hear me, and he's flying in an open cockpit.”

 










When Cruise was on the wing of the plane, the only way to communicate with him was through hand signals. “He has no radio, which means I have to fly up next to Tom in my helicopter,” said McQuarrie, “and Tom can't see me unless I open the door and step out onto the seat with my first A.D. Mary Boulding reminding me to keep my seat belt. When you leave the cockpit of the plane, it's like stepping onto the surface of another planet. The wind is hitting you in excess of 140 miles an hour, coming off the propeller. The molecules of the air are so dispersed that you're breathing, but only physically. You're not actually getting oxygen, and Mary Boulding is sitting next to me, and she's got a stopwatch. And when Tom climbs out of the cockpit, I'll say, ‘Start the clock.' And every minute, Mary Boulding says, ‘One minute on the waiting.' Tom is going through his performance. ‘Two minutes on the waiting.' Tom has 12 minutes.”

McQuarrie continued, “We know this from experimentation that, at about 12 minutes, the fatigue of being blasted by this wind is breaking his entire body down to the point where it's literally like two hours in the gym. And Tom being the perfectionist that he is, would get to about 12 minutes, and I would lean out the door of the helicopter, and Tom would go, '13 minutes.' There [was] more than one moment where Tom had pushed himself to the point that he was so physically exhausted he couldn't get back up off the wing. He was laying on the wing of the plane, arms hanging over the front of the wing. We could not tell if he was conscious or not, so we're waiting to see if there's any indication if Tom is OK. We're waiting to see this sign, and Tom is laying on the wing of the plane.”

 










Another issue: in order to do aerobatics, the plane was light on fuel. “This was a typical day shooting in Africa,” said McQuarrie, “and watching Tom, at the point of physical exhaustion, get himself up because the plane can't land if Tom's on the wing. He's got three minutes to get up, but he's been on that wing for 20 minutes, and we watched as he pulled himself up and stuck his head in the cockpit so that he could replenish the oxygen in his body and then climb up into the cockpit and bring the plane safely down the land. No one on Earth can do that.”

McQuarrie deals with these stressful, dangerous stunts by eliminating one risk factor: his fear. “Fear is a wasted emotion. Stress is a wasted emotion. Anger is a wasted emotion, and in situations like this, they can get somebody killed. After you've done it, and you go home, you can be all stressed out all you want. Tom and I are often sitting in the editing room watching what we've done, and say, ‘Did they actually let us do this?' And then we become numb.”

Mark Ruffalo is getting his “Mare of Easttown” moment. Four years after creator Brad Ingelsby wowed with Emmy-winning series “Mare of Easttown,” the showrunner is back at HBO with another crime drama series: “Task,” led by Ruffalo. 

The official synopsis reads: “Set in the working class suburbs of Philadelphia, an FBI agent (Ruffalo) heads a Task Force to put an end to a string of violent robberies led by an unsuspecting family man (Tom Pelphrey).” The ensemble includes Emilia Jones, Jamie McShane, Sam Keeley, Thuso Mbedu, Fabien Frankel, Alison Oliver, Raúl Castillo, Silvia Dionicio, Phoebe Fox, and Martha Plimpton. 

 










“Task” will debut its seven episodes weekly. Ingelsby is the creator, writer, showrunner, and executive producer, with Ruffalo also executive producing along with Mark Roybal and Paul Lee for wiip, David Crockett, and Ron Schmidt. The co-executive producers are Nicole Jordan-Webber and Jeremy Yaches for Public Record. Jeremiah Zagar and Salli Richardson-Whitfield both direct and executive produce.

As for a return to “Mare of Easttown,” Ingelsby teased to IndieWire in 2021 that he and lead star Kate Winslet were in talks with HBO at the time. “We are all interested in trying it,” he said of a possible sequel, “but we are aware of how hard it is. […] The question is, ‘What's a deserving second chapter?'” 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Winslet later said that she was hesitant to reprise the “frighteningly hard” role again due to its emotional toll offscreen as well. “It was all so good and it was way more success and prominent as a piece of television than I think any of us could have anticipated or hoped for, and we all feel enormously proud of what we were able to do. I feel so proud of all of the actors,” she said in 2022. “My god, it was really tough. So the question is, do you quit while you're ahead? Do you hold your head high and say, ‘Look at what we did, I'm so proud of that' and just walk away? Or do we go for it again?” 

“Task” will premiere on HBO Max this September. Check out the teaser below.

This is a film about questions. It's about the official business of asking them, the new ones that instantly supplant answered ones and the squashed ones that poison all chances of social equality. An answer that German-French director Dominik Moll is happy to supply, however, is in response to Inspector Stéphanie Bertrand (Léa Drucker) as she talks to her teenage son. “Why does everyone hate the police?,” she asks as he looks at her from bed, ashamed of her profession.

“Dossier 137” is a dramatization of a specific case of police brutality that took place in Paris in 2018, during what is known as the Yellow Vests protests. Although it takes some time to show its hand, by the end “ACAB” would work as its tagline — well, “MCAB” with its leading lady as the reason to change the word “all” to “most.”

Stéphanie Bertrand works in Paris for the IGPN (L'inspection générale de la police nationale). As internal affairs, she — as an antagonistic rival says — “investigates colleagues rather than criminals.” This makes her about as popular as a water cannon at a paddling pool party. Nonetheless, the film sides with her. Her arc is to emerge as the good apple, the exception to the rule, even as her own integrity is called into question for daring to see humanity in those outside of her profession.

The film lifts its inciting event wholesale from a real event on December 1, 2018 in which the yellow vests — a grassroots collective from across the political spectrum — came out to protest a hike in fuel tax by then French President, Emmanuel Macron. That night saw riots, fires, mass injuries, and arrests. Moll uses mixed media to add texture to a story that would otherwise unfold exclusively in rooms full of folders, whiteboards and tables. Accounts of the night itself are told through the rectangular records of an iPhone with footage of the fictional characters mixed with real archival material. 

This does not feel like a gimmick so much as a way of having direct access to characters that we would otherwise only see after they have been beaten down by state violence. To see them heading to protest — young, bright and optimistic — is Moll's way of showing solidarity. Other sources of visual data are used to put us inside the digital spaces that Stéphanie inhabits. CCTV camera footage and Google Maps are tools that help her and her two IGPN colleagues to put together what happened at a specific incident.

 










We meet Stéphanie in 2019 as she is working a caseload arising from December 1. There's a lot to get through as many of her colleagues used the charged atmosphere as an opportunity to vent their violent urges. “After 15 years clean, I snapped,” says one policeman who threw a rock at protestors. Unlike those who come later, he is honest and contrite. It's a relatively simple business for Stéphanie to refer the case on to the prosecutor for judgement.

Next up is a distraught woman named Joëlle (Sandra Columbo) whose son Guillaume is in hospital with a fractured skull as the result of being shot in the head with a riot gun. She wants to know who did this to him. Joëlle hails from St. Dizier, the suburb where Stéphanie grew up and where her parents still live. This recognition unlocks a previously untapped personal motivation.

The great Léa Drucker (last seen in Cannes having an affair with a 17-year-old in Catherine Breillat's “Last Summer”) is — this year — proving that she can play restrained and responsible adults. In Laura Wandel's Critic's Week opener, “Adam's Sake” she is a pediatric nurse dealing with a case of possible parental abuse. As Stéphanie, she convinces as a focused and intelligent professional with an easy charm that papers over the script's disinterest in her inner life.

 










We are afforded access to her domestic spaces, bearing witness to loosely sketched relational dynamics with both her parents and her son. Despite a consuming job, she has time for everyone. There is a ludicrously charming scene featuring the rescue of a dirty kitten that Stéphanie washes clean in the sink guided by an online tutorial. The symbolism is obvious. She cares for the vulnerable. There are few edges to her character. Save for a final monologue that spells out a point-of-view already evident in her performance, she is poise itself, saying and doing exactly what is needed.

There is an edge allowed in one of a handful of stand-out scenes. While hunting for a video recording of Guillaume's shooting, Stéphanie interviews a maid that she suspects is holding something back. Like many a maverick cop before her, the usually by-the-book, Stéphanie follows the maid — through the metro, on a dark path through a park — until she can have the conversation that she seeks. The maid, Alicia, is played by the great Guslagie Malanda, star of Alice Diop's courtroom drama/cri du coeur on ambivalent motherhood “Saint Omer.” Her simmering screen presence, filled with raw mistrust reveals — by contrast — the thin atmosphere in the majority of the scenes.

The screenplay, by Moll and Gilles Marchand, prioritizes verbalizing the step-by-step realization of who shot Guillaume and leans on expositional dialogue to move things along. This makes sense in a line of work where exposition is the name of the game and there is a dogged thoroughness and a precision with terminology that suits the subject matter. 

 










Still, the moments when Moll lets the images reveal as much as the dialogue are the ones that linger. The contrast between two slight female IGPN officers and one large brawny male officer makes menacingly real the power play underlying an interview. Indeed the relative smallness of the IGPN's stature tees up one final question, asked of Stéphanie by someone brutally denied an answer: “You did your job very well, but what use is your job?”

“Dossier 137” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Cinetic Marketing founder Ryan Werner is the newest addition at Neon, now joining the 2025 Best Picture-winning studio as the President of Global Cinema.

In that newly created position, Werner will focus full-time on theatrical distribution and work closely with Neon's senior leadership to bolster marketing campaigns and release strategies.

Meanwhile, Courtney Ott has now been appointed head of Cinetic Marketing, having served at the company since 2016, most recently as Senior Vice President. Before Cinetic, Ott had been Director of PR and Marketing at the Film Society of Lincoln Center for six years.

 










“Ryan's taste, passion, and instincts for cinema are boundless,” Neon CEO/Founder Tom Quinn said. “Together, combined with Ryan's extensive knowledge, wealth of relationships and envious track record, we look forward to continue growing Neon as a premiere home for groundbreaking cinema.  To say we're thrilled about working with Ryan would be the understatement of the year.”

Werner said of the announcement, “I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity to collaborate with Tom and the exceptional team at Neon. I deeply admire everything they have accomplished. This is a very special opportunity to create something with some of the most talented people working in film. I am honestly thrilled by the prospect of it.“

Werner added, speaking of his time at Cinetic and his replacement, Ott: “I have felt like the luckiest person in the world getting to create Cinetic Marketing with an incredible team of film lovers. We have been together for the vast majority of my time here.  We created this to support filmmakers and in the process have been surrounded by some of the most creative and brilliant people on both sides of the camera.  It's bittersweet to leave the team and the work we did behind, but they will be in the extremely capable hands of my long-term collaborator and friend Courtney Ott.  There's nothing she can't do and I am excited to see what comes next.”

Werner founded Cinetic in 2014. Since its inception, Cinetic has worked on a slew of Oscar-winning projects, including five Best Pictures, 10 Best Documentaries, seven Best International Features, and three Best Animated Features. Much like Neon, Cinetic has also been a staple at Cannes, and has represented the last 10 Palme d'Or winners, collaborating with the studio on the most recent five.

 










“Ryan has been an incredible leader, collaborator, and friend over the years, and I am so proud of the work we have done together. I have no doubt that we will continue to find ways to collaborate in the future,” said Ott. “I am honored to be continuing to work alongside an incredible team at Cinetic Marketing, and to keep building on what Ryan started many years ago. The passion and inspiration for supporting filmmakers will continue to be our priority.”

Outside of Cinetic, Werner co-created Sideshow with Jonathan Sehring and the team at Janus Films to release features such as “Drive My Car,” “Flow,” “EO,” “All That Breathes,” and “All We Imagine As Light.” 

Neon most recently swept the Academy Awards with Sean Baker's “Anora.” The studio's upcoming releases include Osgood Perkins' “Keeper” (the studio now has a first look deal with auteur Perkins), and Cannes 2025 titles such as Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value,” Julia Ducournau's “Alpha,” Raoul Peck's “Orwell: 2+2=5,” and Michael Angelo Covino's “Splitsville.” The distributor also announced the acquisition of Cristian Mungiu's English-language film debut “Fjord” starring Sebastian Stan and Renate Reinsve. “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days” director Mungiu already has one Palme d'Or to his name, joining the ranks of Neon's growing list of auteurs.

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Columbia

Reviewed:

May 15, 2025

No verdict in the court of public opinion could be harsher than the one Arcade Fire have rendered upon themselves: They've created their own prison with Pink Elephant, a vow of penance that spends 42 minutes equivocating and demurring, against their every impulse to do the opposite. Win Butler is barely audible for the first half of lead single “Year of the Snake.” The album rollout has not inspired any credulous Hollywood Reporter profiles, interactive music videos, or fake websites. It lasted a month and has been accompanied by a near-total media blackout, save for a promotional tour of “intimate venues” and a frankly astonishing sixth appearance on Saturday Night Live. But the overall message has been clear: Arcade Fire would change their name if they hadn't tried that already.

Of all the things Arcade Fire have learned from U2, nothing has taken hold like the goal of “reapplying” to be the best band in the world. But while Bono only said that once, Arcade Fire have spent the past 15 years since The Suburbs adjusting the cover letter and padding the résumé, desperate to figure out what the best band in the world is supposed to be. The irony and piety of 2017's Everything Now and 2022's WE cancelled each other out, attached to works of great effort and little conviction that made Arcade Fire seem equally unpersuasive as satirists or saviors. That was only accelerated by the accusations of sexual misconduct leveled against Win Butler in 2022. To whatever degree Arcade Fire were cancelled, the tours and SNL 50 appearances were not. You could argue that bigger monsters are thriving in relative peace, or that Butler is being punished less for his actions than for how they conflict with his reputation. So it is in a culture that's more forgiving of creeps than hypocrites.

I might have avoided discussing this subject entirely if it weren't the subtext and, sometimes, the text itself of Pink Elephant, casting a shadow far darker and longer than the still-imposing legacy of Funeral or The Suburbs. Arcade Fire spend Pink Elephant cowering in that shadow, offering ambiguous sloganeering, non-apology apologies, and arena rock that gets moved to the 1,500-cap venue due to sluggish ticket sales. The opening three-minute, lunar-roving drone of “Open Your Heart or Die Trying” promises a spiritual reboot, but also promises the same cinematic grandeur of other Arcade Fire albums. They repeat this trick twice more, which ends up having the opposite effect, exposing a threadbare motif that sticks Pink Elephant together like Scotch tape on a last-minute Christmas gift.

It's still a way of flaunting their receipts, as Pink Elephant pulls yet another page from the U2 playbook by bringing in Daniel Lanois on production. A partnership that would have been sensational circa The Suburbs now feels sadly symbolic and transactional. Pink Elephant gets mentioned in the same breath as Time Out of Mind and Achtung Baby, while Lanois gets to update the CV; aside from U2 and Neil Young, Lanois' mainstream rock production credits from the past 20 years are lesser-loved entries in the Dashboard Confessional and Killers catalogs. Was it really his idea to add the distorted microphones and insectoid buzzing into the overstuffed “Alien Nation” or the lopsided drum panning on “Stuck in my Head”?

Aside from those curiously tacky outliers, Lanois' tasteful ambience dampens the band's everlasting, pulsating indie rock; the blasé delivery of “I Love Her Shadow” might have worked within Reflektor's icy cool disco, but a chorus of “breaking into heaven tonight” is supposed to re-spark their unforgettable fire. The core quintet appears together on only three songs, and while the resulting, leaner sound could be called “streamlined,” “spare,” or another euphemism, there's a lack of soul and spirit more apparent than the missing string or synth overdubs. That weariness becomes its own kind of asset on Pink Elephant, a coherent mesh of sound and sentiment from a band that aspires to “moody” without ever figuring out what mood they're trying to set.

On the title track, Butler sneers, “Take your mind off me,” a potential act of defiance as the album's first chorus. But by “me,” he also means the pink elephant of ironic process theory. “Year of the Snake” makes intriguing use of Régine Chassagne on lead vocals, but saddles her with vague allusions to change and truth before Butler bursts out of the background to announce: “I'm a real boy/My heart's full of love/It's not made out of wood.” Much like his continuing grudge against smartphones or his heretofore unexplored love of Def Jam Vendetta-era rap (“Open Your Heart or Die Trying,” “Ride or Die”), Butler's clunky rhymes can be charmingly anachronistic, or at the very least, the only things that can jolt Pink Elephant out of its torpor.

As album cuts, “Pink Elephant” and “Year of the Snake” would be considered “restrained.” As singles, Arcade Fire just sound repressed, in constant surveillance of their own instincts while never committing to their darker undertones or proprietary cathartic codas. Which is why “Ride or Die,” the most spare song on Pink Elephant, is the most affecting and effective. Butler coos, “I could work an office job/You could be a waitress” over barely-there guitars. (Even those who haven't completely written off Arcade Fire may find this insufferable or, worse, self-serving.) He also claims, “I could be a movie star/You could be an actress,” a less romantic plea that nonetheless injects a real sense of personal stakes. Arcade Fire has been the dream of Win and Régine from the start and anyone following them now is still invested; “Ride or Die” acknowledges the crack in the fourth wall.

But that's just prelude to the galactic self-pity of “Stuck in my Head,” which comes close to redeeming the entire project. At first, Butler continues to speak in platitudes about the pervasive mess in his life, in his head, in his car, in his bed. And then, a legitimately shocking line: “And if you leave, then I'll start again/I could shave my head, turn my daughters against me/Erase my name, cut my credit card.” For a moment, that old-time religion of Arcade Fire is back, and Butler yells, “I quit this job! I quit this job!” It's petulant, it's ugly, and most importantly, it feels real and urgent, like something Butler had to say rather than something to fill up the margins. But Arcade Fire pull up again at the last minute, presenting “clean up your heart” as the song's moral lesson and trying to get the listener to see themselves in its wildly unrelatable backstory.

It's disappointing, but it also recognizes that the single most essential quality of Arcade Fire is mutual trust. Funeral, Neon Bible, and The Suburbs unlocked awesome, primal emotions that fans spent their adult lives trying to suppress and, more importantly, convinced them that Arcade Fire felt these emotions just as strongly; the result was some of the most powerful indie rock music ever created. For that, they were seen as not just interpreters of the divine, but divinity itself. But what's a god to a non-believer? Whether it's the dress code, or the galling lyrics of “Creature Comfort,” or Butler's alleged behavior, that trust has been broken, and it isn't something that can be repaired with one album. If Arcade Fire have another classic in them—ignoring all previous evidence to the contrary—is the public even ready to receive it? Though clearly a sacrificial lamb, Pink Elephant achieves what Reflektor and WE couldn't, finding the connector, the confirmation that we're all in this together: If you don't believe in Arcade Fire right now, they don't believe in themselves yet either.

Laufey has announced a new album, A Matter of Time. The Icelandic Chinese singer and composer's follow-up to 2023's Bewitched arrives August 22 (via Vingolf/AWAL). Aaron Dessner produced the LP alongside Spencer Stewart. “Tough Luck,” which leads the album, is “a fiery song about love gone wrong,” Laufey said in press materials. “I wanted to reveal an angrier side of myself—a side that this unfortunate relationship brought out in me.” Listen to that below.

Of the album, Laufey added, “People expect a pretty facade of girly clothes, fantastical stories, and romantic music.

After teasing celebrations around the fifth anniversary of How I'm Feeling Now, Charli XCX has delivered a belated video for “Party 4 U” from the record. The video, directed by Mitch Ryan from an idea by Charli XCX, depicts her embarking on a chaotic day out in the aftermath of a house party, culminating in her setting a Charli XCX billboard ablaze. Check it out below.

In making the 2020 album, Charli XCX wrote in a note yesterday, “I felt like I rediscovered myself, my sanity + my sense of connection with the world, at a time where we were all so alone. To create with all of you helped me feel OK.”

She continued, “It was all of us at our most raw, our most stripped, our most vulnerable. I will never forget it, and I really can't believe that 5 years later one of the Angel favorites is having its own special moment.” She has also released a limited-edition, clear glitter vinyl of How I'm Feeling Now

The video is Charli XCX's first release not to be tethered to Brat since the blockbuster album's release last June. She has, however, been active in various other pursuits, including a handful of film endeavors and a Saturday Night Live appearance. Read about her Coachella show in Paul A.

Seen from afar, coverage of Madrid's trebly, chrome-coated experimental pop scene appears dominated by Rusia-IDK, the five-member boys' club formed in 2019 that counts Ralphie Choo and Rusowsky among its marquee names. AMORE, aka Murcia's 25-year-old María Moreno Martinez, has been active for almost as long; her body of work is a similarly genre-omnivorous playground where flamenco, hip-hop, glitchcore, and Latin folk are all fair game. In a short film accompanying her new Top Hits, Ballads, etc…, a dozen women participate in a strange silent disco on a smoke-filled soundstage. This video, like the record, takes place at the intersection of high concept and limited resources; listening to Top Hits, one pictures the neon lines of gaffer's tape on the floor. If Choo is the mad scientist, AMORE is the performance artist offering an X-ray view into her process.

From title onward, Top Hits, Ballads, etc… registers more like a compilation than a proper debut. “Last Maria on Earth” and “Querió,” each more than a year old, mark the album's two furthest musical poles. “Last Maria” is strummy indie rock graced by a fluttering flute and Martínez's ethereal vocals, while the castanets and syncopated jota rhythms of “Querió” situate it in a lineage of contemporary takes on traditional Spanish folk. The entirety of Top Hits hovers well above 70 Hz—nothing here truly throbs or wobbles. “I Gotta Feeling” wants to be nothing short of your next Black Eyed Peas-sized bar mitzvah banger, but lands on Neptunes-lite as Martínez and producer Dinamarca muster up a pixelated elysium of finger-snaps, flutes, and taffy-pulled basslines with plenty of room to breathe.

Much of Top Hits ostensibly chronicles a queer breakup; as the guitar balladry of “Amiga” glitches in and out of focus, Martínez recalls “una amiga/Y aunque no la cuidé como debía/Se convirtió en mi dulce compañía” (“a friend/And even though I didn't care for her like I should have/She became my sweet company”). In the last minute, “Amiga” flips into its own self-contained remix, slicing her voice into silky ribbons over a muted kick drum. Amid the hypnotic ghungroos bells of “Peléame!!!,” an angelic host of AMOREs command a lover to “fight me, light it up”; a few tracks later she's hitting bottom again. The playful groove of “Delirio”—a baby Pokémon evolution on from the skeletal reggaeton experiments of Rosalía's MOTOMAMI—belies Martínez's lyrics, which compare her love to “una prisión” (a prison), “un castigo” (a punishment), “[una] maldición” (a curse). And like any good telenovela, there's only one way this story can end: with a gunshot.

This might suggest that Top Hits is all high drama, but Martínez is incapable of total self-seriousness. “Juvenil” ends on a scattering of canned applause; “Amore I,” a collaboration with Toronto-based producer Loukeman, is circled by chiptune cherubs; interlude “dont mess with mr in-between” draws on synth presets straight out of C418's Minecraft soundtrack. The field's wide open and certain songs still feel unformed; “Evangelion” begins as a dreamy Julee Cruise waltz but proceeds as though someone forgot to toggle off the loop button. Though closer to a collection of demos, Top Hits, Ballads, etc… is a delightfully half-baked proof of concept. The ellipsis says it all: not a best-of, just a best-so-far.

							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



Walmart, the largest retailer in the nation, has announced it is raising prices because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.


	The retail giant said on Thursday that it may absorb some of the import taxes, but it is still raising prices to offset increased costs resulting from Trump's ill-advised trade war.


	“The tariffs will result in higher prices,” CEO Doug McMillon said bluntly on an earnings call.


	“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” McMillon said.


	The announcement comes days after the Trump administration announced that it would be lowering its tariff rate against China from 145 percent to 30 percent — an improvement no doubt but still a major tax on common consumer goods. China — and, because of retaliatory tariffs, the United States — has been hit the hardest by Trump's trade war, and the president still has tariffs in place on several other nations, despite pausing the initial far-steeper import taxes he announced in early April. Trump has simultaneously warned that Americans might have to cut back on certain goods as prices rise, while claiming the tariffs will make everyone richer than they could ever imagine.

	











	“The magnitude and speed at which these prices are coming to us is somewhat unprecedented in history,” Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told The Wall Street Journal. “It's a dynamic and fluid environment.” 


	Walmart is not the only retailer warning that prices may increase despite Trump's decision to deescalate with China. Effective tariff rates remain a cost burden for companies importing goods, and shipping into the United States has slowed significantly since April. Last month, companies like Black & Decker, Adidas, and Procter & Gamble warned that price hikes were coming. Online retailers like Temu — who ship much of their stock directly from China, slapped buyers with “import charges” on purchases.

	The president is unlikely to be enthused by Walmart's announcement. In April, the White House attacked Amazon following a report that the company would display tariff-based price increases on product listings. The White House accused Amazon of engaging in a “hostile and political act” and Trump reportedly called Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos directly to demand the policy be stopped.

	The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it plans to eliminate and postpone rules aimed at reducing “forever chemicals” contaminating drinking water across the country. 


	According to the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A), exposure to PFAS — a class of highly toxic, long-lasting compounds also known as “forever chemicals” — has been linked to cancer, decreased fertility in women, developmental effects in children, immune system issues, interference with the body's natural hormones, and more. At least 45 percent of America's tap water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS.


	Last year, former President Joe Biden set first-ever limits on PFAS, requiring water utilities to begin bringing down contamination levels of six types of PFAS chemicals — while setting a strict limit of four parts per trillion for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Despite the plethora of research warning against the dangers of forever chemicals in water, the E.P.A. said that while it will uphold the limits for those two types of PFAS, it will extend a deadline requiring water utilities to meet those limits to 2031. The E.P.A. also said it plans to eliminate and reconsider the limits for the other four chemicals — PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS — listed.“We are on a path to uphold the agency's nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants.”

	











	President Donald Trump and his allies have escalated attacks on clean water protections. Through E.P.A. deregulations and cuts, Supreme Court rulings, executive orders, and bills in Congress, Trump and conservatives are systematically eroding rules aimed at providing Americans with clean, healthy water. 


	In March, Zeldin said he would look to significantly reduce a significant portion of the waterways, such as wetlands, rivers, and streams, that are protected under the Clean Water Act, a 1972 law that regulates the discharge of pollutants in water.

	Trump's Office of Management and Budget separately withdrew a proposed EPA rule in January to set limits on the discharge of forever chemicals in wastewater. The president's administration did so based on Trump's executive order on Day One freezing all regulations in progress pending review.

	











	“This agenda to deregulate, this agenda to gut the federal government, to dismantle the federal government, eliminate core functions of our government, remove these protections, it's just an ideology,” Mary Grant, Public Water for All Campaign Director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch, previously told Rolling Stone. “And they're acting on it without without care for how it impacts people, for how it impacts our access to safe water.”

	At an orientation meeting on his first day of college, Benny is told, “You can be whoever you want to be here!” This is exactly what Benny wants — if only he can figure out who he wants to be. In high school, he was the star of the football team and the golden boy of his small Idaho town. But he was also deep in the closet — so deep that even in college, he can't fully admit to himself that he's gay. 


	This is the central tension of Overcompensating, the appealing new Prime Video comedy, created by and starring Benito Skinner as Benny. The eight-episode first season chronicles Benny's first semester at the fictional Yates College, where he tries everything possible to convince the world — and himself — that he's straight. He attempts to sleep with lonely fellow freshman Carmen (Wally Baram). He pledges a secret campus society led by Peter (Adam DiMarco), the narcissistic boyfriend of his older sister Grace (Mary Beth Barone), where it seems like half the initiation rituals are simultaneously penis-related and involve the phrase “No homo!” He goes out of his way to avoid Miles (Rish Shah), a cute boy on whom he develops an instant crush. 

	











	But he's bad at all of this. He can't get an erection with Carmen. His attempt at straight-guy braggadocio — ”I'm definitely gonna fuck some vagina tonight!” — is as stilted as it is gross. He can't resist joining a film class just to be around Miles. And he's convinced that every openly queer student — particularly George (Owen Thiele), who mans the counter at the campus store — can easily see the truth about him that he doesn't want to acknowledge. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Like a lot of first-year comedies, Overcompensating starts out loud and broad. One of the first scenes has Benny's father (Kyle MacLachlan) getting hit in the crotch by a frisbee while he and Benny's mom (Connie Britton) are moving their son into his dorm. But like the good first-year comedies, it gets better as soon as it starts to relax and get to know the characters, as well as understanding the strengths of the actors playing them. By the time we get to a later episode where Benny and Carmen are simultaneously vomiting and suffering from explosive diarrhea, respectively, the gross-out humor actually feels earned because of how well Skinner and the other writers have established the two as complicated, likable people.

	In fact, the series, co-produced by A24, is often at its best when it leans into its most sincere, even soapy side, and looks at how Benny isn't the only one at school trying to act like someone he's not. Carmen is still grieving the loss of her old brother. Grace struggles to realize her entire life has become subordinate to Peter, and that he's an obnoxious loser who doesn't remotely deserve her. And even Peter turns out to have more depth than it seems at first. 


Charli XCX oversees the music, and also plays herself in an episode. Other notable guests include James VanDerBeek as basically the Wooderson of the secret society, Las Culturistas hosts Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang as a gay couple Benny meets when he begins experimenting with apps, and Megan Fox as herself. Or more specifically, Fox plays a fantasy version of herself on the poster Benny keeps on his dorm room wall as part of his hetero cosplay, who periodically comes to life to help him talk through his problems. 


	All the big names are fun, though the show's best and most consistent source of laughs is Carmen's roommate Hailee (played by the actor and comedian Holmes), a larger-than-life blonde who would seem like a vapid caricature if she didn't have periodic moments of extreme insight, and if her more superficial moments weren't so strange. (In one episode, she tries to go viral by smearing yellow paint on her mouth and inviting Blake Lively to do the “Speak Up Bitch Challenge,” but has no idea what cause it's for, other than spreading awareness about “silence.”)

	Most of the cast is in their late twenties or early thirties (Skinner is 31), and there's no real effort to make them look younger. But there's also a long tradition of college and high school shows starring grown-ass adults, and the actors are charming enough to make it not really matter. (You just have to ignore that the pop-culture references tend to be much more millennial than Gen Z.) Baram is a writer (Shrinking, What We Do in the Shadows) with no real acting experience, but she and Skinner have excellent chemistry, and the show is smart about not letting Carmen be Benny's unwitting beard for too long.

	Skinner based the show on his own life. He has a huge audience on TikTok and Instagram, where he came to fame during the pandemic as Benny Drama, and where more than a million followers apiece now watch the comic sketches he writes and performs. The track record of social media stars translating their success to television isn't great — sometimes because their material just doesn't work at greater length, sometimes because their audience doesn't care much about traditional television, while TV viewers don't know who they are. Overcompensating is good enough to have a shot at bucking that trend — I'd never heard of Skinner before this, and wound up enjoying it a lot after a few episodes — and certainly has plenty of backing from more mainstream stars. (Jonah Hill is another producer, though he doesn't appear onscreen.) With any luck, it will stick around long enough for Benny to tell the world who he really is. 

	











All eight episodes of Overcompensating begin streaming May 15 on Prime Video. I've seen the whole season.

	Four months into Donald Trump's presidency, his and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to “Make America Healthy Again” appears to be taking shape: It consists of throwing millions of Americans off their health insurance plans, making Americans pay more for health care in various ways, and slashing health spending and research — all to help fund a tax bill that will yet again disproportionately benefit the rich. 


	Don't worry, though: Dr. AI will see you now. He's ready to stand in for experienced and licensed doctors, nurses, emergency room workers, and the world's best scientists — and to fill the void that may be left by your previous insurance plan.


	“The AI revolution has arrived,” Kennedy, who's leading Trump's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), proclaimed on Wednesday in congressional budget hearings. 


Artificial intelligence is all the rage in the second-term edition of Trump's America. Powerful companies have invested a lot of money in it, hoping to achieve technological breakthroughs, cut costs, or maybe just pay fewer workers. Republicans want to protect AI from state and local regulation. Perhaps you, yourself, have started using AI to write your emails or essays. Maybe you've encountered AI when using Google — the place where you used to search for relevant information, and now you get weird approximations of an answer. Is your AI obsession ruining your life? 

	











	Or perhaps you've read about AI in the health care context, where the insurer UnitedHealth Group is accused of using an algorithm with a “90-percent error rate” to systematically deny claims for very ill patients in order to move them out of nursing homes early.  


	Speaking to House lawmakers on Wednesday, Kennedy touted the Food and Drug Administration's plan to use AI for Phase 3 drug testing — designed to demonstrate whether products benefit specific populations — to limit expenses and avoid testing on animals, in order to get biotechnology products to market faster.

	When a Republican congresswoman from Louisiana asked Kennedy about his plan to improve rural health access in her district, one with many “medical deserts” and residents in poor health, he pledged to “dramatically revolutionize the availability of telehealth and AI so that people can avoid emergency rooms by getting treated at home.”

	











	“I looked at a technology yesterday that can accurately diagnose strep throat by telephone, using your telephone camera, [by] taking one picture of the inside of your throat, and the accuracy of that test is greater than a strep swab,” said Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who separately admitted Wednesday, “I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.”


	Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee have proposed a measure in their reconciliation legislation — Trump's “one, big, beautiful bill” to reauthorize his 2017 tax cuts for the rich — that would direct HHS to use AI tools to reduce and recover improper payments made to health care providers under the traditional Medicare program. 


	“This provision provides $25 million for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with artificial intelligence contractors and data scientists to examine Medicare improper payments and recoup overpayments,” says Republicans' bill summary. “Additionally, the Secretary is required to report to Congress on progress on decreasing the number of Medicare improper payments.”


	Health care experts are skeptical.


	“The track record of using AI or algorithms in Medicare Advantage prior authorization and coverage decisions does not inspire confidence that such technology is ready to apply to assessing the propriety of payments in other parts of Medicare,” says David Lipschutz, a co-director at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.

	“A good deal of improper payment in Medicare is due to incomplete paperwork,” he says, referencing a KFF report that notes the most common reason for improper payments is insufficient or lack of documentation from providers. “What would be the opportunities or mechanisms to correct erroneous decisions from AI? Would beneficiaries be held harmless if an AI tool determines that services they already received were improper? Oftentimes, whether a given item or service is proper or medically necessary is a nuanced analysis that can include clinical judgment and application of complex coverage criteria, and should be an individualized assessment for a specific individual. It would be dangerous to leave this important analysis to an algorithm.”


	Alex Lawson, executive director at Social Security Works, says of the proposal: “Like many things AI, this is obviously a get-rich-quick gimmick for some tech bro bandit with access to Republican politicians.” He adds that “this is all part of a bill that rips health care away from 14 million people to give trillions in tax handouts to billionaires,” pointing to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

	











	The efforts to expand the use of AI in health care comes as Trump, Kennedy, and Republicans push to slash spending on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans and the disabled. 


	Republicans have rallied behind the idea of imposing work requirements on all able-bodied adults under the age of 65, demanding they work at least 80 hours a week. That's in order to qualify for a program that strictly limits how much income people can make, and effectively demands they be poor. (Medicaid recipients will also be expected to share more costs.)


	Under the terms of Republicans' reconciliation package, more than 10 million Americans are expected to lose their Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program coverage — losses that will help fund tax cuts for the rich. 


	Kennedy endorsed the proposed Medicaid work requirements in a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday. 


	Slashing Medicaid enrollment will likely cause hospitals to eat the expenses associated with caring for sicker, uninsured patients. The reconciliation bill would also limit the use of so-called provider taxes, which states use to give supplemental payments to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers to help cover their Medicaid patients — a change that providers warn could force many rural hospitals to close. 


	Republicans' legislation would separately allow for the expiration of expanded premium subsidies helping millions of Americans pay for individual health insurance plans purchased on state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The bill would also impose steep penalties on low-income people who purchase their insurance using advance premium tax credits if they end up earning more money than they initially estimate to the IRS.

	Taken together, the Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace changes in Republicans' reconciliation bill are expected to cost nearly 14 million Americans their health insurance coverage. Slashing Medicaid funding and using AI to review and recoup Medicare payments could put significant strain on doctors and hospitals.

	Eight movies. Five directors. Three dozen character actors. Two dozen exotic locales, each one of them the perfect background for globetrotting espionage. A dozen action set pieces. A half dozen peeled-off masks. One best-of-show brawl set in a public bathroom. Numerous car chases, motorcycle chases, helicopter chases, explosions, collateral-damage relationships, and falls and near-falls from both modest and great heights. Too many running scenes to count. So, so many running scenes.


	For nearly 30 years, the Mission: Impossible franchise has managed to take the bare-bone elements of spy thrillers, summer blockbusters and the classic screen trifecta of thrills, spills and chills, and supersize them for maximum adrenaline fixes. And despite all the number-crunching above, it really boils down to a single man. Tom Cruise took on the role of Ethan Hunt — Impossible Mission Force (IMF) MVP, rogue agent, master of disguise, savior of the geopolitical status quo, ill-advised air traveler — back in 1996 as just another gig in between playing literary bloodsuckers and “show me the money” sad sacks. In 2025, he exits the film series having claimed the title of the last superhuman movie star alive, an industry unto himself. Cruise used these M:I movies to prove he was willing to risk life and limb in the name of entertaining you. Take him out of the equation, and all you'd have are expensive looking Bond-lite flicks based on an old TV show.

	











	All good things must come to an end, and while the guy with the need for speed isn't going gently into the night just yet — coming soon: Tom Cruise in Literal Outer Space — he's ready to retire the brand on a high note. Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning wears its swan-song vibe on its sleeve, right down to the title. But it's not going out without a victory lap. Or two. Or 22. 


	Kicking off with the first of several montages devoted to the series' highlights, villains, femme fatales, former girlfriends, shoot-outs, showdowns, past cast members, potential extinction-event MacGuffins and the kinds of stunts that have made Cruise an insurance-liability nightmare, this capstone is as much about honoring the past as it is ensuring a world under constant threat has a future. You may be tempted to rewatch the septet of entries that preceded this long goodbye (with the emphasis on long; despite clocking in at a shade under three hours, it often feels like its running time exceeds the combined length of all the previous M:I films). Don't worry. The movie itself provides refresher supercuts before the opening credits' signature fuse starts burning, all the better to catch you up so it can cut to the actual chases.

	Specifically, Final Reckoning wants to remind you about everything that happened when we last saw Hunt keeping things from descending into chaos, i.e. 2023's Dead Reckoning — Part One. (That one was also directed by Christoper McQuarrie, who's settled into become the franchise's resident shot caller.) So there's this sentient AI program called “The Entity.” It wants out to wipe out humanity, has inspired a death cult willing to do its bidding, pumps out nonstop misinformation, and “wants us scared and divided” so it can render good people helpless. In other words, the Entity has a bright future in politics and is likely the No. 1 contender for becoming the GOP's Presidential candidate in 2028. 


	Per fictional screen POTUS Angela Bassett's introductory monologue, the deus ex machina sunk the Russian sub that it called home and infiltrated cyberspace. Now the program is determined to seize all of the major nuclear arsenals of the world and bid Homo sapiens farewell. The key to preventing that is, well, a key. Luckily, Ethan has the key. What he doesn't have is drive containing the Entity's source code, which is still on that sub at the bottom of the Bering Sea. Nor does he have “the poison pill” that will end this digital reign of terror. That belongs to Gabriel (Esai Morales), the film's flesh-and-blood nemesis named after the biblical angel heralding a new age. Hunt's mission: Find the source code, find Gabriel, keep it from the U.S. government — because no one should have that much power at their beck and call — and try to avoid situations that will get him killed in the process. That last order will naturally be the toughest one to follow.

	The usual suspects, in the form of old IMF comrades Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), are around to help. So is master pickpocket/major love interest Grace (Haley Atwell) and ex-henchperson-turned-ally Paris (Pom Klementieff). Pain-in-the-ass federal agents Briggs (Shea Whigham) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) also show up, as does a host of other recurring and recognizable mugs: Henry Czerny, Hannah Waddingham, Nick Offerman, Janet McTeer, Holt McCallany. A deep-cut character from the original M:I becomes a huge mover and shaker in the back half here. Easter eggs are everywhere. This is a series that loves making famous faces scowl while delivering long reams of Exposition: Inevitable dialogue almost as much as it loves indulging Cruise's death wishes, and Final Reckoning falls in line with that overall operative. You should never underestimate the power of Angela Bassett being allowed to go full sound-and-fury on pages of dialogue. As for the new faces, the movie does double duty in proving that Tramell Tillman's smooth-operator act from Severance can translate beautifully from TV to motion pictures, and that the off-the-charts screen presence Katy O'Brian displayed in Love Lies Bleeding was no one-off fluke.

	











	But who are we kidding here? They're all bit players supporting the name above the title. This is nothing if not the Tom Cruise Daredevil Show, blown up to staggering IMAX levels of grandeur. You're paying to see the 62-year-old star go to ridiculous lengths to demonstrate what he'll do to still make 21st century blockbusters feel like events. Ethan Hunt must save the world. Cruise has a higher purpose: He wants to save the movies. And if that means jumping out of planes, holding his breath underwater for dangerous amounts of time, climbing the sides of cliffs and/or careening off mountains on motorcycles, Mr. A-List will do it. Most of the set pieces are callbacks to the series' history of putting Cruise in peril and demonstrating his ability to stay in extraordinary fighting shape. The lung-bursting plunge into deep sea waters is reminiscent of the dive in 2015's Rogue Nation. A torture sequence brings to mind Mission: Impossible III (2006), which morphs into an Atwell-aided melée similar to two-by-two fights involving Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson in previous entries.

	All of these are mere amuse-bouches in preparation for the main course, in which Hunt manages to stowaway on a biplane, commandeer it, then jump onto a second biplane and hang on to the wing while swooping up to 8000 feet. Cruise, naturally, performed the stunt himself. Unlike the previous Mission: Impossible‘s various, vertigo-inducing showstoppers, this one is left for the last act, and it's worth the wait. Not even the endless crowing about this daredevil feat in the marketing campaign leading up to the Cannes Film Festival premiere (and the movie's release on May 23rd) can suck the exhilaration and sense of awe of watching this extended jaunt through the wild blue yonder. For all of the bleeding-edge tech paranoia and state-of-the-art thrillmongering on display in three decades worth of M:I thrillers, it takes an aerial dogfight that might have graced a movie 100 years ago to leave you breathless. That's entertainment! Somewhere, stunt pilot Dick Grace is slow-clapping Cruise right now.


	“It's all been leading up to this,” characters keep repeating ad nauseam, and you get the feeling that, having now delivered one big try-to-top-that gesture, Cruise can let Hunt rest and bask in the glory of a mission well-accomplished. He's in his sixties now, and though the gent is in incredible shape by any standard — see: a fight scene that plays out with Cruise wearing nothing but athletic briefs — not even Xenu can stop him from aging. He's determined to keep the franchise from self-destructing. Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning feels like a conclusion to 30 years worth of proving that yes, you still can conjure up a certain vintage strain of Hollywood magic. It also feels like the end of an era. We will still get “Tom Cruise movies.” Just not like this, not from a movie star of his magnitude, assuming they can even manufacture another singular figure like him in the age of perpetual, cut-rate content. But hey, anything's possible.

An Army veteran and former border patrol agent has revealed shocking and unexplained sightings taking place at the US southern border.

Bob Thompson, who spent 14 years with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is now showing the world a never-before-seen UFO spotted near Arizona.

The unidentified object, called 'The Cigar,' was recorded by a CBP reconnaissance plane in early 2020, capturing the mysterious craft flying at a high rate of speed.

Thompson told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart that the UFO had a short, cylindrical body with no visible wings or propellers. Moreover, CBP cameras didn't even see a visible heat trail from an engine, so its method of propulsion is still a mystery.

Thompson said he has spoken to more than 100 CBP agents who have witnessed strange and unidentified objects flying along the US border.

While coordinating the airspace along the southern border, Thompson added that he's also seen all sorts of different UFO designs invading US territory.

'I've seen orbs that were off in the distance. I've seen crafts that were cigar-shaped, I've seen triangles,' the whistleblower said.

Although many of these accounts are being dismissed as drones, likely flown by drug cartels trying to sneak into the US, Thompson claimed that there's more going on that just illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

'No one likes to talk about it freely. I think it's just still a taboo subject,' Thompson said on Reality Check with Ross Coulthart.

The never-before-seen video was taken just months after another UFO sighting involving a strange craft that had the shape of a rubber duck.

That November 2019 sighting took place as CBP was following a group who crossed the US border illegally in Arizona's Buenos Aires National Wildlife Area.

Similar to the cigar UFO, which had no visible heat trail, the rubber duck UFO's thermal signature did not match any known planes or drones.

The cigar video was taken near the same wildlife preserve and Thompson admitted that the US border patrol still has no idea what the object was.

The whistleblower added that the cigar-shaped object could have been a new missile being tested, but there's simply no way to know for sure without a full investigation.

Despite the Office of the Director of National Intelligence mandating that incidents like this be collected and investigated, Coulthart noted that there's been 'a deafening silence' about recent UFO cases.

Thompson noted that unexplained aircraft aren't the only thing being seen along the border. CBP agents have also spotted terrifying 'portals' opening into the sky.

'I got told that they witnessed a portal opening up in the sky and there were pictures of it on a camera that I was able to see,' Thompson revealed.

The veteran CBP officer added that agents knew these weren't glowing orbs or some other type of UFO and actually witnessed the portals as they were opening up out of thin air.

Thompson's claims are just the latest unexplained accounts coming out of Arizona, where Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents show several Air Force pilots have encountered 'swarms' of UFOs in recent years.

On January 19, 2025, an unidentified object actually struck an F-16 Viper fighter jet, damaging the canopy and forcing the $63 million aircraft to land.

So far, the FAA hasn't found any conclusive evidence that the object was extraterrestrial. 

Luis Elizondo, a former government intelligence officer who became a UFO whistleblower, recently led a congressional hearing on UFO sightings and government disclosure. He told NewsNation that Arizona has become a UFO hotspot.

'A lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border,' Elizondo disclosed.

Aside from Thompson's report of portals opening up over Arizona, government authorities have been quick to dismiss the UFO claims as drone sightings.

Trump Administration border czar Tom Homan has said that many of these sightings are likely high-tech drones carrying drugs over the US border or spying on US military bases in the area.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Australia, NZ and worldwide Jewish news that matters

United Australia Party Senator Ralph Babet says he plans to quit politics in 2028 at the end of his first term, but not before launching a tirade that has drawn national condemnation for glorifying neo-Nazis and endorsing Kanye West's antisemitic track ‘Heil Hitler'.



“I have no desire to become a career politician,” Babet told The Australian. “I don't want to become one of those swamp creatures, one of those swamp dwellers. I want to do my one term, and I want to go.” Babet is the only federal senator representing the United Australia Party (UAP).

The announcement followed an expletive-laden video posted on Instagram, where Babet called ‘Heil Hitler' his “favourite song of the week” and declared he would “rather hang out with neo-Nazis than mentally ill leftists.”

The track, released by West (now known as Ye), includes Nazi imagery and samples of Adolf Hitler's speeches. Although removed from Spotify and Apple Music, it remains widely available on social media platforms and has already been viewed more than 8.5 million times.

In his video, Babet said, “All I said was it was a good song, right? I like Kanye West. He's a great artist … If someone else doesn't like what he puts out, don't buy it. Don't listen to it. But don't you f..king dare tell me what I can and can't listen to.”

Rejecting accusations of antisemitism, he said, “If they're going to try and associate me with being a Nazi, a brown immigrant from Africa, that's f..king bullshit. You know it. I know it.”

Asked later what he would say to Jewish Australians offended by his post, Babet again refused to apologise, saying, “I can listen to whatever music I like. If they want to be offended because Kanye West released a song, don't download the song … But don't tell me as a grown man what I can and can't listen to.” He added, “I think it's a good song and I'm going to be buying his album. Does that make me a Nazi? No, I'm not a Nazi. I just like his music.”

Babet intensified the controversy in a separate Instagram post in which he said he would “rather hang out with members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Network than with the baby-killing, murdering, leftists.”

When questioned by The Australian, he insisted the comment was “tongue in cheek” but added, “There's also truth to that.” He then acknowledged that “they want to f..king deport me … because I'm brown,” concluding, “I wouldn't hang out with them, and they wouldn't hang out with me, either.”

He also described progressive Australians as “Greens voters that are mentally ill” and accused them of wanting to “tear down the family,” “do gender mutilating surgery on children,” and “put kids on puberty blockers.”

From Babet's Instagram

 

Babet's recent remarks are consistent with a long pattern of inflammatory conduct. In November 2024, he was formally censured by the Senate after using racist, homophobic and ableist slurs in a tweet, including the N-word and the words “phaggot” and “retarded.”

Earlier that year, he was criticised for posting a misleading video clip from a Senate estimates hearing, which gave the false impression that government officials could not answer questions about excess mortality. The video prompted threats against public servants, and a Senate committee found that Babet had breached broadcast standards.

In February 2024, Babet was photographed alongside known neo-Nazi Nathan Bull, who was performing a Nazi salute while Babet gave a thumbs-up. The image was posted to social media by Bull with the caption “Heil Ralph Babet, Heil our people.” Babet later claimed he did not know the man or notice the gesture. He has also been accused of spreading disinformation, including the false claim that children were 51 times more likely to die from COVID-19 vaccines than the virus itself.

The senator's remarks have triggered furious condemnation from Australian Jewish leaders, who accused him of glorifying Hitler and antisemitism. Jeremy Leibler, President of the Zionist Federation of Australia, described Babet's “unhinged comments” as “offensive and un-Australian,” stating, “There is absolutely nothing ‘tongue in cheek' about a sitting MP endorsing neo-Nazis, glorifying anti-Semitism, and using slurs to attack minorities; it's a dog whistle.”

Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said Babet was “trying to position himself as a martyr for free speech merely standing up for the right to listen to the music of his choice. No one denied this right. No one sought to edit his playlist. Perhaps the better question is who was he trying to impress in making these observations about his taste in music. These sorts of stunts might get clicks and maybe votes in the US, but our politics and politicians should be better than that.”

Dr Dvir Abramovich, Chair of the Anti-Defamation Commission, called the incident a “public meltdown of moral responsibility,” and said, “When a federal parliamentarian publicly declares that a track titled ‘Heil Hitler' is his favourite of the week, alarm bells shouldn't be ringing, they should be deafening.

Hitler is not a meme or a punchline. His name stands for genocide, mass murder, gas chambers. It is carved into the bones of six million Jews and millions more victims. And now, a senator is casually promoting that name like it's just another track in a playlist.”

                    A representative image of droplet of solidified molten tin. 2D tin is expected to be an exotic material called a topological insulator, which conducts electric currents only along its edges, not anywhere else.

A quantum dot is a type of semiconductor that's only a few nanometres wide. It has a wide range of applications, including in LED lighting, medical diagnostics, printing, semiconductor fabrication, and solar panels. They're very small but they've had a big impact on our world as we know it. This is why the people who found a quick, reliable way to make quantum dots were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2023.

Quantum dots get their curious but powerful abilities from a phenomenon called quantum confinement. When you throw a switch, a bulb comes on. This is because electrons flow from a power source to the bulb through copper wires. Because the wires are fairly thick (from an electron's perspective) and very long, the electrons aren't tightly packed in and move freely. But in a quantum dot, there isn't much space and the electrons are relatively more close to each other. So even though they're free to move around the entire quantum dot, and not be confined to their atoms, their movement is still restricted.

In this situation, the amount of energy each electron can have changes. In a copper wire in your house's circuit, if an electron gains some extra energy in some way, it can simply move around faster. But in a quantum dot there's nowhere to go, so the electrons can't simply acquire more energy even if, say, you increase the voltage on the dot. Instead, the electrons can have only specific amounts of energy each. This is exactly how electrons in an atom behave: they have limited energy levels. It's like they're in a movie hall. The copper-wire electrons are free to fill any seats they like. But in an atom, some rows are closed off and in the other rows, only specific seats are available. Because all the electrons in a quantum dot behave in this way, the dot itself behaves like a giant atom.

The restrictions the electrons feel because they're so packed in is said to be due to quantum confinement. A material is described as 1D or 2D depending on how much it confines its electrons. A quantum dot is considered to be a zero-dimensional material: while its electrons can technically move in three dimensions, the volume available is so small that it might as well be a point in space.

Likewise, graphene is a famous 2D material: it consists of a single sheet of carbon atoms bonded to each other in a hexagonal pattern. The electrons in this sheet can only move around in two dimensions, thus 2D. As a result they behave as if they don't have mass, for example, giving rise to properties not seen in other materials.

The unusual material properties quantum confinement gives rise to are clearly of great real-world value. This is why scientists have also been trying to create 2D metals — but they've been running into a thorny problem.

If one graphene sheet is placed above another, the two sheets will develop weak links between them called a van der Waals interaction. They're very weak bonds: they can keep the sheets from drifting apart but if you tug even one sheet just a little, the interaction will break and allow the sheets to be separated.

The scientists who discovered graphene also found that by attaching some cellophane tape on graphite, then pulling it in one smooth motion, they could get a few layers of graphene to come off with the tape.

This wouldn't have been possible if carbon had been a metal. The problem with a metal atom is that it likes to bond with all the same atoms around itself. Put differently, the atom readily forms bonds in 3D. Forcing it to form bonds only in 2D is very difficult. This is why materials scientists have been trying for a decade to create 2D metals using different techniques, to no avail. They've tried carefully depositing metal atoms on a substrate, sandwiching metal slices between a 2D material and a substrate, even hammering metal pieces down.

They've only been able to manage metal sheets a few nanometres thick. This isn't good enough: atomically thin sheets are 10-times thinner, at best a few angstroms (Å) deep. Scientists have also found the surface of these materials to be uneven and that often the metal atoms interact with oxygen in the atmosphere to form oxide compounds.

Yet they've been motivated to keep going because 2D metals are expected to have highly unique properties that can be exploited for next-generation technologies, including super-sensitive sensors with applications ranging from medicine to the military. 2D bismuth and tin in particular are expected to be exotic materials called topological insulators, conducting electric currents only along their edges, not anywhere else. In such a state, the material can become magnetised in small islands — a phenomenon physicists have said can be exploited to make faster computers of the future.

Now, if a study published recently in Nature is to be believed, there may finally be light at the end of the 2D tunnel. A team of scientists from the Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics and Institute of Physics, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (both in Beijing), and Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory (Dongguan) has reported a way to produce 2D sheets of bismuth, gallium, indium, tin, and lead. The team's technique isn't complicated either — although that's partly because the necessary technologies have taken a long time to get to their current advanced state.

It goes roughly like this: (i) Create a pure powder of a metal, say bismuth. (ii) Lay it on a plate made of sapphire on top of which a single layer of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has been deposited. This is the bottom anvil. (iii) As the bottom anvil is heated, the metal powder on top of it will melt and spread out. (iv) The droplet is overlaid with the top anvil, which also consists of a single MoS2 layer pasted on a sapphire substrate. At this point the droplet is sandwiched between two layers of MoS2, which in turn are sandwiched between two layers of sapphire. (v) The top anvil is twisted by a small angle and then the two anvils are pressed together. The pressure is kept up until the anvils have cooled to room temperature, then removed. (vi) The smooshed sheet of metal is peeled off.

According to the team, the bismuth sheet was just 6.3 Å thick — a depth of roughly two atoms and sufficient for electrons in the metal to be confined in 2D.

The use of MoS2 and sapphire wasn't accidental. MoS2 has a Young's modulus — the amount of force required to deform it — of 430 billion pascal (Pa) and sapphire, of 300 billion Pa. That's more than a million-times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. The squeeze the scientists applied to make 2D bismuth was ‘just' 200 million Pa. Both MoS2 and sapphire also have smooth surfaces, which means their atoms don't try to bond with the bismuth atoms near them.

The researchers also found the bismuth sheet thus produced exhibit a strong field effect and a nonlinear Hall effect. A field effect means how well the sheet conducts electricity can be changed by applying an external electric field. The nonlinear Hall effect was more peculiar: when an electric field was applied, the bismuth sheet acquired a voltage in the perpendicular direction. Both the strong field effect and the nonlinear Hall effect occur in 2D metals, not in 3D metals.

The new effort is “not the first to grow thin crystals between layers of van der Waals materials. In the past year, there have been reports of single-atom-thick graphene nano-ribbons grown between layers of hexagonal boron nitride, and of gold nanocrystals just a few nanometres thick grown between flakes of MoS2,” University of California, Irvine, condensed-matter physics researcher Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi wrote in a commentary accompanying the paper. “My own group has also produced ultra-thin crystals of bismuth by squeezing the metal between layers of hexagonal boron nitride, although the minimum thickness of our crystals was 5 nanometres.”

“A key difference between our method and that of Zhao and colleagues is that they used large (centimetre-scale) sapphires covered with MoS2, which might be crucial for making atomically thin metals,” he added.

Sanchez-Yamagishi also wrote that the new technique represents a “substantial improvement over what can be made using more expensive and complex techniques”. Since it's a first attempt, more opportunities as well as new challenges await. For example, researchers can look for ways to use the technique to make 2D sheets composed of multiple metal species, not just one.

For another, the geometric arrangement of bismuth atoms in the 2D sheet the team made allows it to become a topological insulator only in particular conditions. Future research can improve the technique to make room-temperature topological insulators in a more reliable way — just the way the 2023 chemistry Nobel Prize laureates changed the world when they discovered a simple, reliable way to make quantum dots. Yet another opportunity is to refit the procedure to make 2D metals of larger area.

Ultimately, scientists stand to learn more about 2D metals themselves, especially hitherto unknown properties. “Even less is known about the electronic properties of the other 2D metals prepared in the study,” Sanchez-Yamagishi wrote. “The stability and large sizes of these materials open up many possibilities for integrating them with other materials and for making new electrical or photonic devices.”

Celebrity psychic medium Tyler Henry has revealed he has successfully undergone brain surgery.

The reality star, 29, had most of a 'colloid tumor' removed from his brain and will now be on bedrest for a month.

The star announced the operation on Wednesday with a photo of him in his hospital bed, which appeared to have been taken after the surgery.

A bandage was on his head as he snuggled into his pillow with a smile.

'Brain surgery was a success! Great prognosis, incredible staff, and I feel so thankful to be surrounded by my family. I'll be on bedrest for a month and look forward to getting back to doing readings.

'For those of you who connect with me virtually, not much should change as far as private reading giveaways and group readings, right now I'm just on the mend. For those curious, I had a colloid tumor near the center of my brain and thankfully most of it has been removed! (The tumor, not my brain… that is.)

'This isn't my first rodeo with this and I have so much to be thankful for - I'll see ya'll very soon with lots of thought-provoking subjects and of course, readings. Thank you all so much for your support.'

Tyler previously underwent an emergency brain surgery at age 18 following the discovery of a congenital cyst.

The cyst, which is benign, needs to be regularly drained when it grows too large as it would be too risky to remove completely, according to The Cut.

'I have wondered if it relates to my ability at all,' he told the publication last year. 

The Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry star also endured a collapsed lung in 2019 and has congenital blebs on his lungs that he needs to keep an eye on. 

He suspects his health has been impacted by his work as a psychic medium. 

'It's the biggest question I have: Why, if this is something of a gift, does it come at a cost?' he told the outlet.  

Opening up about the brain cyst on Instagram, Tyler posted a photo of him giving a reading as a teenager just before the health scare came to light. 

'This photo was taken a month after my 18th birthday in the backyard of my childhood home,' he wrote on Instagram in 2023. 'I was doing readings on camera in my small town of Hanford, CA. Only a week later an MRI revealed a congenital brain cyst that lead to emergency surgery after weeks of headaches. A mass I was born with was only now causing a life-threatening situation as my adult life was just beginning.

'Despite all that, this project allowed for one of my most exciting moments as an early medium - reading an entire diner full of strangers, as well as delivering messages in my teenage haunts of China Alley (later featured on @lifeafterdeathnetflix).

'This experience taught me early on the importance of timing and trust. Without the inevitable brain surgery that ensued, I don't think I would of had such a firsthand awareness of the fragility of life. It was an intimate reminder for me of the fine line dividing this realm and the next.'

The surgery revelation comes just a week after Tyler - who worked with the Kardashians in 2015 - tied the knot with his longtime beau Clint Godwin.  

The lovebirds appeared to go about tying the knot the simple way, opting to head to their local Beverly Hills courthouse.

Henry shared a single photo of their pair with his 1.2 million followers and wrote, 'Today, we are married! Life with you is an endless sleepover with my best friend and life's just getting started.'

He added in the heartfelt note: 'I knew when we met nearly a decade ago that you would be the one, and that conviction only grew stronger with every day. Best premonition ever!'

An engagement was never announced, but Henry told E! News in 2019 that he'd likely be the one to propose.

The newlyweds' love story began in 2016, when Tyler gave Clint a reading.

'He had seen me on [Keeping Up With the Kardashians]. He messaged me and said that he'd be interested in a reading,' the star opened up to GLAAD in 2022.

The E! personality added, 'I knew the second I saw him that I had something that I needed to share with him regarding his grandfather, who had died.'

He explained, 'His grandfather had recently taken his own life. As I connected with him, I relayed exactly why that decision was made. Immediately, I found myself a part of his family, being immersed in what they were going through.'

Tyler shares bits of his life with his now-husband on social media regularly.

On Valentine's Day he posted a photo of the two in wet suits at the beach, adding a thoughtful message.

A homicide victim who remained unknown for more than four decades has been identified as a 30-year-old Vietnam veteran whose death may be linked to the so-called serial Scorecard Killer, convicted of committing a string of California murders in the 1970s and 1980s.

Oregon State Police said DNA samples led to the identification of the unknown victim as Larry Eugene Parks, whose body was found in July 1980 along Oregon's Interstate 5. His body was found a day after the remains of Michael O'Fallon were found along Interstate 5 in Talbot, about 34 miles to the south, the department said.

Investigators suspected the two killings were related but ran out of leads and the cases went cold.

Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes poor feeding in infancy but later triggers insatiable hunger.

Disease name: Prader-Willi syndrome

Affected populations: This genetic, multisystem disorder affects an estimated 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 10,000 people worldwide. Most cases of the syndrome occur sporadically, meaning the genetic changes behind the condition appear randomly in early development rather than being passed down through generations. Only in rare cases is the genetic trigger inherited.

The syndrome affects males and females at equal rates, as well as people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people in the United States have Prader-Willi syndrome.

Causes: The syndrome occurs when specific genes on chromosome 15 lose their function, either because they are missing or because they've been turned off. The portion of chromosome 15 that's affected in Prader-Willi syndrome is called 15q11.2-q13, and it's also known as the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) region.

Human cells typically carry 46 chromosomes, including 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes, numbered 1 through 22, and one pair of sex chromosomes. Each parent contributes one-half of each pair of non-sex chromosomes — so one copy of chromosome 15 comes from the mother and another comes from the father, for example. Because cells carry two copies, every gene on each chromosome does not need to be active. Through a process called ""genetic imprinting,"" certain genes on either the mother's or the father's copy get switched off.

Prader-Willi syndrome affects the paternal copy of chromosome 15, and in most cases — around 60% or 70% — the PWS/AS region is randomly deleted during development. Meanwhile, the maternal PWS/AS region is switched off in everyone. Thus, the deletion leaves people without a working set of those genes.

For about 30% to 40% of people with the syndrome, they inherit two copies of the maternal chromosome 15, so they're missing the paternal copy altogether.

More rarely, a person carries the paternal chromosome 15 but the relevant genes do not work properly. This happens due to either a small genetic mutation — a ""microdeletion"" — or changes in epigenetics, which are modifications to DNA that don't change its code but can turn a gene on or off. Even more rarely, the syndrome may be triggered by translocation, in which a portion of chromosome 15 breaks off and then reattaches to a different chromosome.

Symptoms: Prader-Willi syndrome affects many parts of the body, and its symptoms can vary from person to person. Many of the genetic changes that underlie the syndrome are thought to affect the hypothalamus, a key hormone-making region of the brain that helps control many basic bodily functions, including body temperature, hunger and sleep.

Hypotonia, or low muscle tone, is seen in nearly all infants with the syndrome, making them feel ""floppy"" when held. There can be signs of this symptom before birth, in that the fetus will not move as much as expected or will end up in unusual positions. After birth, hypotonia can contribute to the baby having a poor sucking reflex, which hinders feeding and weight gain in early life. Developmental delays are also common.

Infants can also have distinctive features, such as almond-shaped eyes; a thin upper lip; a downturned mouth; and a long, narrow head. Many patients have short stature, in part due to growth hormone deficiency. A percentage of people with the syndrome lose a gene called OCA2, which is involved in making pigment in the skin and hair. These individuals have very fair skin and light-colored hair.

Later in childhood, around age 2 to 8, children's appetite often increases dramatically, and these individuals tend to not feel full after meals. This can subsequently lead to hyperphagia, or excessive eating, which can result in obesity and related complications, such as type 2 diabetes, heart issues and gastrointestinal problems. It's thought that this voracious drive to eat is triggered by issues with the hormones that normally regulate appetite, as well as by differences in brain areas involved with processing rewarding stimuli (like food).

Additional symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to moderate; genital underdevelopment; sleep problems; nearsightedness; and underactive thyroid.

With adequate treatment and support, people with Prader-Willi syndrome can live into their 70s. But complications such as diabetes and heart failure can limit their lifespan if these conditions are not adequately controlled, and they can cause death by a person's 40s.

Treatments: There is no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome. Treatments vary depending which symptoms a person has, when those symptoms began and how severe they are.

To help patients feed in infancy, doctors may recommend high-calorie formula and special feeding methods, including tube feeding. Replacing missing hormones — with testosterone, estrogen or growth hormone, for example — can help offset symptoms related to low hormone levels. Growth hormone therapy was approved as a Prader-Willi syndrome treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and it's been shown to help boost muscle tone and growth while lowering body fat.

Physical, behavioral, occupational and speech therapies can help with motor skills, intellectual disabilities, and speech and language development. Medications might be recommended to help with sleep issues or psychiatric disorders that can be associated with the syndrome, such as psychosis.

The FDA also approved the first-ever treatment for hyperphagia in Prader-Willi syndrome in 2025. It's approved for patients ages 4 and older. The exact mechanism of this drug is unknown, but it's thought to help decrease the production of certain hunger-triggering signals from the hypothalamus.

Especially in childhood, patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be kept on carefully controlled diets and eating schedules, the Mayo Clinic advises. Dietitians can help advise patients and their families on what to include in a healthy diet and whether supplemental vitamins or minerals might be necessary.

Scientists say that hiding secret messages using AI chatbots could lead to a world of iron-clad encryption.

Scientists have found a way to turn ChatGPT and other AI chatbots into carriers of encrypted messages that are invisible to cybersecurity systems.

The new technique — which seamlessly places ciphers inside human-like fake messages — offers an alternative method for secure communication “in scenarios where conventional encryption mechanisms are easily detected or restricted,” according to a statement from the researchers who devised it.

The breakthrough functions as a digital version of invisible ink, with the true message only visible to those who have a password or a private key. It was designed to address the proliferation of hacks and backdoors into encrypted communications systems.

But as the researchers highlight, the new encryption framework has as much power to do bad as it does good. They published their findings April 11 to the preprint database arXiv, so it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

""This research is very exciting but like every technical framework, the ethics come into the picture about the (mis)use of the system which we need to check where the framework can be applied,"" study coauthor Mayank Raikwar, a researcher of networks and distributed systems at the University of Oslo in Norway, told Live Science in an email.

Related: Quantum computers will be a dream come true for hackers, risking everything from military secrets to bank information. Can we stop them?

To build their new encryption technique, the researchers created a system called EmbedderLLM, which uses an algorithm to insert secret messages into specific areas of AI-generated text, like treasure laid along a path. The system makes the AI-generated text appear to be created by a human and the researchers say it's undetectable by existing decryption methods. The recipient of the message then uses another algorithm that acts as a treasure map to reveal where the letters are hidden, revealing the message.

Users can send messages made by EmbedderLLM through any texting platform — from video game chat platforms to WhatsApp and everything in between.

​""The idea of using LLMs for cryptography is technically feasible, but it depends heavily on the type of cryptography,"" Yumin Xia, chief technology officer at Galxe, a blockchain company that uses established cryptography methods, told Live Science in an email. ""While much will depend on the details, this is certainly very possible based on the types of cryptography currently available.""

The method's biggest security fault comes at the beginning of a message: the exchange of a secure password to encode and decode future messages. The system can work using symmetric LLM cryptography (requiring the sender and receiver to have a unique secret code) and public-key LLM cryptography (where only the receiver has a private key).

Once this key is exchanged, EmbedderLLM uses cryptography that is secure from any pre- or post-quantum decryption, making the encryption method long-lasting and resilient against future advances in quantum computing and powerful decryption systems, the researchers wrote in the study.

​The researchers envision journalists and citizens using this technology to circumvent the speech restrictions imposed by repressive regimes.

—Scientists create world's 1st chip that can protect data in the age of quantum computing attacks

—Scientists discover simpler way to achieve Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance' thanks to AI breakthrough — bringing quantum internet closer to reality

""We need to find the important applications of the framework,"" Raikwar said. ""For citizens under oppression it provides a safer way to communicate critical information without detection.""

It will also enable journalists and activists to communicate discreetly in regions with aggressive surveillance of the press, he added.

Yet despite the impressive advance, experts say that implementation of LLM cryptography in the wild remains a way off.​

""While some countries have implemented certain restrictions, the framework's long-term relevance will ultimately depend on real-world demand and adoption,"" Xia said. ""Right now, the paper is an interesting experiment for a hypothetical use case.""

A well-respected family in the UK was recently awarded compensation of $100,000 by a restaurant that had publicly accused them of leaving without settling the bill.

In July of last year, Peter and Ann McGirr, along with their children Peter Jr and Carol, visited The Horse & Jockey Inn in the Peak District, England. It was a pretty uneventful affair; the family ordered ribeye and gammon steaks and washed them down with ales and lagers before leaving for their home in Omagh, Northern Ireland. Only shortly after their departure, The Horse & Jockey Facebook page posted a video of the McGirrs' allegedly leaving the establishment without paying the £150 ($200) bill. The family was soon making national headlines for allegedly dining and dashing, which negatively impacted their otherwise great reputation, so they found themselves with no choice but to sue the inn to clear their name.

 As it turns out, The Horse & Jockey Inn had jumped the gun when it posted CCTV footage of the McGirrs on their Facebook page and accused them of skipping the bill. The family had actually paid by card, but one or more members of the staff had forgotten to put it through the till. Despite the inn's attempts to apologize for their mistake and convince the family to drop their lawsuit, they were in for much more than they had bargained for. The owner's attempts to appease the McGirrs with an apology, free meals, and a complimentary stay at the inn fell on deaf ears.

“A lot of ordinary people might have accepted this. But given the McGirrs' wealth and excellent reputation, that was never going to happen with them,” a source told Daily Mail. “Their reputation received such a battering they were left with little choice other than to take legal action to restore their name.”

“They are very well known and respected in the Omagh area and are one of the wealthiest families around here,” the source added. “Everybody was very shocked when these allegations were first made because the McGirrs are not short of a pound or two. It was a very difficult time for the family because they knew all along that they were innocent.”

 ﻿

The family turned out to be the owners of McGirr Engineering, an internationally known company specializing in the manufacturing of construction block machines worth £2 million with cash reserves estimated at £1.3 million. They weren't the type of people to skip a £150 bill for a meal, but the serious and defamatory accusations made by The Horse & Jockey Inn caused significant damage to the reputation of the family. As a result, they had to sue.

In the end, The Horse & Jockey Inn ended up settling for £75,000 ($100,000) before any evidence could be presented in court, and also apologized for the distress they called the McGirrs. In hindsight, maybe they should have just taken the £150 loss.

Gene-editing breakthrough has potential to treat array of devastating genetic diseases soon after birth, scientists say

Doctors in the US have become the first to treat a baby with a customised gene-editing therapy after diagnosing the child with a severe genetic disorder that kills about half of those affected in early infancy.

International researchers have hailed the feat as a medical milestone, saying it demonstrates the potential for treating an array of devastating genetic diseases by rewriting faulty DNA soon after affected children are born.

Specialists at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania started work as soon as the boy was diagnosed and completed the complex design, manufacture and safety testing of the personalised therapy within six months.

The baby, known as KJ, had the first dose of the bespoke treatment via an infusion in February and two more doses in March and April. Doctors said he was thriving, but would need careful monitoring for life.

Dr Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a senior physician on the team, said the breakthrough was made possible by “years and years of progress” in gene editing. “While KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit,” she said.

KJ was born with severe CPS1 deficiency, a condition that affects only one in 1.3 million people. Those affected lack a liver enzyme that converts ammonia, from the natural breakdown of proteins in the body, into urea so it can be excreted in urine. This causes a build-up of ammonia that can damage the liver and other organs, such as the brain.

While some patients receive liver transplants for CPS1 deficiency, babies with severe disease can have suffered damage by the time they are big enough to operate on.

Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, the doctors described the painstaking process of identifying the specific mutations behind KJ's disorder, designing a gene-editing therapy to correct them, and testing the treatment and fatty nanoparticles needed to carry it into the liver. The therapy uses a powerful procedure called base editing which can rewrite the DNA code one letter at a time.

KJ spent his first few months of life in hospital on a restrictive diet, but since his treatment doctors have been able to increase the amount of protein in his food and use less medication to remove nitrogen from his body. Details were presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy annual meeting in New Orleans.

The medical team said longer follow-up was needed to see how well the therapy worked, but early signs were encouraging.

“The promise of gene therapy that we've heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it's going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine,” said Prof Kiran Musunuru at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr Miguel Ángel Moreno-Mateos, a geneticist at Pablo de Olavide University in Seville, said: “Although this has been a very specific approach, partly motivated by the devastating nature of the disease, it represents a milestone that demonstrates these therapies are now a reality. As the article reports, the patient will be monitored for a long time to ensure his wellbeing and determine whether additional doses are needed to further improve the symptoms of the disease.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
