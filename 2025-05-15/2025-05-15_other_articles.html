                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Detroit Lions are eager to get Aidan Hutchinson back into action after he was limited to just five games last season. What was shaping up to be an elite season for the defender ended abruptly when he suffered a season-ending leg injury in the Lions' fifth game of the season. Even though the team has yet to put on the pads and is focused on drill work, Hutchinson is already making a statement with his performance. "He's out there and he's the most energetic guy on the field," said defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard. Hutchinson and Sheppard have built a strong relationship in working together for the last three season, and the new defensive coordinator is excited to work even closer with him throughout the 2025 campaign. "The relationship me and Hutch have is unbelieveable," Sheppard explained. The way he works, his attention to detail in meetings, the way he helps people, the way he wants to be pushed and coached hard. He's a guy that's all in and I'm elated to have him with us out there on the grass." He has been photographed out on the field as part of team workouts, and new Lions defensive line coach Kacy Rodgers has been impressed with what he's seen to this point. Sitting here, just imagining what this guy went through, what he worked on to get back in case they made it to the end last year," Rodgers said. "And then to see where he is right now, this guy's a trooper." It remains uncertain how active Hutchinson will be during OTAs, and the team won't have a mandatory minicamp. However, it appears as though he's growing closer to full-speed. Hutchinson logged 7.5 sacks last season in his five games, including four against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. If he can return to peak form following the injury, he will be among the game's best at his position and a dominant weapon for the Lions. Detroit will likely take some precautions in his workload to ensure full health for Week 1, but it appears as though the team is confident in his ability to return to form in 2025. "The thing is, once we know for sure where he is and everything, that will dictate itself," Rogers explained. "Our thing is, we will do everything to make sure he's ready to go Week 1."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The reality star, 29, had most of a 'colloid tumor' removed from his brain and will now be on bedrest for a month. Great prognosis, incredible staff, and I feel so thankful to be surrounded by my family. 'For those of you who connect with me virtually, not much should change as far as private reading giveaways and group readings, right now I'm just on the mend. For those curious, I had a colloid tumor near the center of my brain and thankfully most of it has been removed! 'This isn't my first rodeo with this and I have so much to be thankful for - I'll see ya'll very soon with lots of thought-provoking subjects and of course, readings. Thank you all so much for your support.' Tyler previously underwent an emergency brain surgery at age 18 following the discovery of a congenital cyst. The cyst, which is benign, needs to be regularly drained when it grows too large as it would be too risky to remove completely, according to The Cut. 'I have wondered if it relates to my ability at all,' he told the publication last year. The Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry star also endured a collapsed lung in 2019 and has congenital blebs on his lungs that he needs to keep an eye on. 'It's the biggest question I have: Why, if this is something of a gift, does it come at a cost?' 'This photo was taken a month after my 18th birthday in the backyard of my childhood home,' he wrote on Instagram in 2023. 'I was doing readings on camera in my small town of Hanford, CA. Only a week later an MRI revealed a congenital brain cyst that lead to emergency surgery after weeks of headaches. 'Despite all that, this project allowed for one of my most exciting moments as an early medium - reading an entire diner full of strangers, as well as delivering messages in my teenage haunts of China Alley (later featured on @lifeafterdeathnetflix). 'This experience taught me early on the importance of timing and trust. Henry shared a single photo of their pair with his 1.2 million followers and wrote, 'Today, we are married! He added in the heartfelt note: 'I knew when we met nearly a decade ago that you would be the one, and that conviction only grew stronger with every day. An engagement was never announced, but Henry told E! News in 2019 that he'd likely be the one to propose. The newlyweds' love story began in 2016, when Tyler gave Clint a reading. 'He had seen me on [Keeping Up With the Kardashians]. He messaged me and said that he'd be interested in a reading,' the star opened up to GLAAD in 2022. He explained, 'His grandfather had recently taken his own life. Immediately, I found myself a part of his family, being immersed in what they were going through.' On Valentine's Day he posted a photo of the two in wet suits at the beach, adding a thoughtful message. 'We've grown up together and there's no one else I'd rather grow through time with. Whether I'm 29 or 92, this love will always be my guiding force, a reprieve from all of life's heaviness. That's what @clintxgodwin is for me,' he said. And in March he uploaded another picture of the pair, adding, 'It's @clintxgodwin's birthday! Hurtling toward 30 isn't so bad with coconut cake and good company.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists say that hiding secret messages using AI chatbots could lead to a world of iron-clad encryption. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists have found a way to turn ChatGPT and other AI chatbots into carriers of encrypted messages that are invisible to cybersecurity systems. The new technique — which seamlessly places ciphers inside human-like fake messages — offers an alternative method for secure communication “in scenarios where conventional encryption mechanisms are easily detected or restricted,” according to a statement from the researchers who devised it. It was designed to address the proliferation of hacks and backdoors into encrypted communications systems. They published their findings April 11 to the preprint database arXiv, so it has not yet been peer-reviewed. Related: Quantum computers will be a dream come true for hackers, risking everything from military secrets to bank information. To build their new encryption technique, the researchers created a system called EmbedderLLM, which uses an algorithm to insert secret messages into specific areas of AI-generated text, like treasure laid along a path. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Users can send messages made by EmbedderLLM through any texting platform — from video game chat platforms to WhatsApp and everything in between. ​"The idea of using LLMs for cryptography is technically feasible, but it depends heavily on the type of cryptography," Yumin Xia, chief technology officer at Galxe, a blockchain company that uses established cryptography methods, told Live Science in an email. Once this key is exchanged, EmbedderLLM uses cryptography that is secure from any pre- or post-quantum decryption, making the encryption method long-lasting and resilient against future advances in quantum computing and powerful decryption systems, the researchers wrote in the study. ​The researchers envision journalists and citizens using this technology to circumvent the speech restrictions imposed by repressive regimes. —Future quantum computers will be no match for 'space encryption' that uses light to beam data around — with the 1st satellite launching in 2025 —Scientists create world's 1st chip that can protect data in the age of quantum computing attacks "For citizens under oppression it provides a safer way to communicate critical information without detection." It will also enable journalists and activists to communicate discreetly in regions with aggressive surveillance of the press, he added. "While some countries have implemented certain restrictions, the framework's long-term relevance will ultimately depend on real-world demand and adoption," Xia said. "Right now, the paper is an interesting experiment for a hypothetical use case." Live Science is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

The controversy began after President Prabowo Subianto said that Bill Gates was developing a tuberculosis vaccine to be tested in Indonesia

“[Indonesia] received a grant of 2.5 trillion rupiah (US$151 million) and Indonesia will be the testing ground for Bill Gates' TB vaccine. There's no such thing as a free lunch,” said one social media user.

“Why does Bill Gates want to test the TB vaccine in our homeland, why doesn't he test it in his homeland?” asked another. “Why don't other countries want their people to be used as guinea pigs? Only poor countries are targeted?” asked a third.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes poor feeding in infancy but later triggers insatiable hunger. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Only in rare cases is the genetic trigger inherited. Approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people in the United States have Prader-Willi syndrome. Causes: The syndrome occurs when specific genes on chromosome 15 lose their function, either because they are missing or because they've been turned off. The portion of chromosome 15 that's affected in Prader-Willi syndrome is called 15q11.2-q13, and it's also known as the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) region. Because cells carry two copies, every gene on each chromosome does not need to be active. Prader-Willi syndrome affects the paternal copy of chromosome 15, and in most cases — around 60% or 70% — the PWS/AS region is randomly deleted during development. Meanwhile, the maternal PWS/AS region is switched off in everyone. Thus, the deletion leaves people without a working set of those genes. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This happens due to either a small genetic mutation — a "microdeletion" — or changes in epigenetics, which are modifications to DNA that don't change its code but can turn a gene on or off. Even more rarely, the syndrome may be triggered by translocation, in which a portion of chromosome 15 breaks off and then reattaches to a different chromosome. Hypotonia, or low muscle tone, is seen in nearly all infants with the syndrome, making them feel "floppy" when held. There can be signs of this symptom before birth, in that the fetus will not move as much as expected or will end up in unusual positions. After birth, hypotonia can contribute to the baby having a poor sucking reflex, which hinders feeding and weight gain in early life. Many patients have short stature, in part due to growth hormone deficiency. A percentage of people with the syndrome lose a gene called OCA2, which is involved in making pigment in the skin and hair. These individuals have very fair skin and light-colored hair. Later in childhood, around age 2 to 8, children's appetite often increases dramatically, and these individuals tend to not feel full after meals. This can subsequently lead to hyperphagia, or excessive eating, which can result in obesity and related complications, such as type 2 diabetes, heart issues and gastrointestinal problems. It's thought that this voracious drive to eat is triggered by issues with the hormones that normally regulate appetite, as well as by differences in brain areas involved with processing rewarding stimuli (like food). Additional symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include cognitive impairment, ranging from mild to moderate; genital underdevelopment; sleep problems; nearsightedness; and underactive thyroid. But complications such as diabetes and heart failure can limit their lifespan if these conditions are not adequately controlled, and they can cause death by a person's 40s. Replacing missing hormones — with testosterone, estrogen or growth hormone, for example — can help offset symptoms related to low hormone levels. Growth hormone therapy was approved as a Prader-Willi syndrome treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, and it's been shown to help boost muscle tone and growth while lowering body fat. —This rare disease causes people to move uncontrollably and unintentionally self-harm The rare but deadly respiratory illness spread by rodents —This rare bacterial infection triggers pus-filled sores in the lungs and brain Medications might be recommended to help with sleep issues or psychiatric disorders that can be associated with the syndrome, such as psychosis. Especially in childhood, patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be kept on carefully controlled diets and eating schedules, the Mayo Clinic advises. Dietitians can help advise patients and their families on what to include in a healthy diet and whether supplemental vitamins or minerals might be necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A well-respected family in the UK was recently awarded compensation of $100,000 by a restaurant that had publicly accused them of leaving without settling the bill. In July of last year, Peter and Ann McGirr, along with their children Peter Jr and Carol, visited The Horse & Jockey Inn in the Peak District, England. It was a pretty uneventful affair; the family ordered ribeye and gammon steaks and washed them down with ales and lagers before leaving for their home in Omagh, Northern Ireland. The family was soon making national headlines for allegedly dining and dashing, which negatively impacted their otherwise great reputation, so they found themselves with no choice but to sue the inn to clear their name. Despite the inn's attempts to apologize for their mistake and convince the family to drop their lawsuit, they were in for much more than they had bargained for. “A lot of ordinary people might have accepted this. But given the McGirrs' wealth and excellent reputation, that was never going to happen with them,” a source told Daily Mail. “Their reputation received such a battering they were left with little choice other than to take legal action to restore their name.” “Everybody was very shocked when these allegations were first made because the McGirrs are not short of a pound or two. The family turned out to be the owners of McGirr Engineering, an internationally known company specializing in the manufacturing of construction block machines worth £2 million with cash reserves estimated at £1.3 million. In hindsight, maybe they should have just taken the £150 loss.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bob Thompson, who spent 14 years with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), is now showing the world a never-before-seen UFO spotted near Arizona. The unidentified object, called 'The Cigar,' was recorded by a CBP reconnaissance plane in early 2020, capturing the mysterious craft flying at a high rate of speed. Thompson told NewsNation's Ross Coulthart that the UFO had a short, cylindrical body with no visible wings or propellers. Thompson said he has spoken to more than 100 CBP agents who have witnessed strange and unidentified objects flying along the US border. Although many of these accounts are being dismissed as drones, likely flown by drug cartels trying to sneak into the US, Thompson claimed that there's more going on that just illegal immigration and drug trafficking. I think it's just still a taboo subject,' Thompson said on Reality Check with Ross Coulthart. The never-before-seen video was taken just months after another UFO sighting involving a strange craft that had the shape of a rubber duck. That November 2019 sighting took place as CBP was following a group who crossed the US border illegally in Arizona's Buenos Aires National Wildlife Area. Similar to the cigar UFO, which had no visible heat trail, the rubber duck UFO's thermal signature did not match any known planes or drones. The whistleblower added that the cigar-shaped object could have been a new missile being tested, but there's simply no way to know for sure without a full investigation. Despite the Office of the Director of National Intelligence mandating that incidents like this be collected and investigated, Coulthart noted that there's been 'a deafening silence' about recent UFO cases. CBP agents have also spotted terrifying 'portals' opening into the sky. 'I got told that they witnessed a portal opening up in the sky and there were pictures of it on a camera that I was able to see,' Thompson revealed. The veteran CBP officer added that agents knew these weren't glowing orbs or some other type of UFO and actually witnessed the portals as they were opening up out of thin air. Thompson's claims are just the latest unexplained accounts coming out of Arizona, where Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents show several Air Force pilots have encountered 'swarms' of UFOs in recent years. He told NewsNation that Arizona has become a UFO hotspot. Aside from Thompson's report of portals opening up over Arizona, government authorities have been quick to dismiss the UFO claims as drone sightings. Trump Administration border czar Tom Homan has said that many of these sightings are likely high-tech drones carrying drugs over the US border or spying on US military bases in the area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United Australia Party Senator Ralph Babet says he plans to quit politics in 2028 at the end of his first term, but not before launching a tirade that has drawn national condemnation for glorifying neo-Nazis and endorsing Kanye West's antisemitic track ‘Heil Hitler'. “I have no desire to become a career politician,” Babet told The Australian. I want to do my one term, and I want to go.” Babet is the only federal senator representing the United Australia Party (UAP). The announcement followed an expletive-laden video posted on Instagram, where Babet called ‘Heil Hitler' his “favourite song of the week” and declared he would “rather hang out with neo-Nazis than mentally ill leftists.” The track, released by West (now known as Ye), includes Nazi imagery and samples of Adolf Hitler's speeches. Although removed from Spotify and Apple Music, it remains widely available on social media platforms and has already been viewed more than 8.5 million times. Rejecting accusations of antisemitism, he said, “If they're going to try and associate me with being a Nazi, a brown immigrant from Africa, that's f..king bullshit. If they want to be offended because Kanye West released a song, don't download the song … But don't tell me as a grown man what I can and can't listen to.” He added, “I think it's a good song and I'm going to be buying his album. When questioned by The Australian, he insisted the comment was “tongue in cheek” but added, “There's also truth to that.” He then acknowledged that “they want to f..king deport me … because I'm brown,” concluding, “I wouldn't hang out with them, and they wouldn't hang out with me, either.” He also described progressive Australians as “Greens voters that are mentally ill” and accused them of wanting to “tear down the family,” “do gender mutilating surgery on children,” and “put kids on puberty blockers.” Babet's recent remarks are consistent with a long pattern of inflammatory conduct. Earlier that year, he was criticised for posting a misleading video clip from a Senate estimates hearing, which gave the false impression that government officials could not answer questions about excess mortality. The video prompted threats against public servants, and a Senate committee found that Babet had breached broadcast standards. He has also been accused of spreading disinformation, including the false claim that children were 51 times more likely to die from COVID-19 vaccines than the virus itself. The senator's remarks have triggered furious condemnation from Australian Jewish leaders, who accused him of glorifying Hitler and antisemitism. Jeremy Leibler, President of the Zionist Federation of Australia, described Babet's “unhinged comments” as “offensive and un-Australian,” stating, “There is absolutely nothing ‘tongue in cheek' about a sitting MP endorsing neo-Nazis, glorifying anti-Semitism, and using slurs to attack minorities; it's a dog whistle.” Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said Babet was “trying to position himself as a martyr for free speech merely standing up for the right to listen to the music of his choice. These sorts of stunts might get clicks and maybe votes in the US, but our politics and politicians should be better than that.” Dr Dvir Abramovich, Chair of the Anti-Defamation Commission, called the incident a “public meltdown of moral responsibility,” and said, “When a federal parliamentarian publicly declares that a track titled ‘Heil Hitler' is his favourite of the week, alarm bells shouldn't be ringing, they should be deafening. It is carved into the bones of six million Jews and millions more victims. Comments received without a full name will not be consideredEmail addresses are NEVER published!
