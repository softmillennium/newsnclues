                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase on Thursday confirmed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating whether the crypto exchange has misstated its user numbers. The stock was last lower by 6%. "This is a hold-over investigation from the prior administration about a metric we stopped reporting two and a half years ago, which was fully disclosed to the public," Coinbase's chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in a statement shared with CNBC. "We explained that the verified users metric includes anyone who verified their email address or phone number with us, so it may overstate the number of unique customers." "While we strongly believe this investigation should not continue, we remain committed to working with the SEC to bring this matter to a close," he added. Grewal also noted that the company disclosed the "more relevant metric of monthly transacting users," or the number of people who use the Coinbase platform in a given month, and continues to do so. Coinbase shares were already under pressure after the company said earlier Thursday that hackers stole customer information and were demanding a $20 million ransom. The incident may cost Coinbase up to $400 million to fix, the company estimated. In the past week, it announced an acquisition that is expected to help it expand its global reach and gained entry to the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which will take effect next week. On the earnings call last week, CEO Brian Armstrong discussed his ambition to make Coinbase "the No. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. It shouldn't come as a surprise, though, because for a growing cohort of global investors focused on India, such border crises, while serious, are viewed as just one variable in a far more complex equation — for now. While Indian stock markets initially dipped after it became apparent that India and Pakistan were headed toward armed conflict, Kieron Kader, an associate fund manager on Alquity's Indian Subcontinent fund, told CNBC that the episode was "not going to change the overall return profile dramatically." He bought shares of NYSE-listed MakeMyTrip, Lemon Tree Hotels and Samhi Hotels after they tumbled, only to see them rise strongly since. He isn't the only one with that view. Anand Gupta, lead portfolio manager for Allianz India Equity fund, pointed out that the Indian equity market displayed "remarkable resilience" during the crisis peak, with the MSCI India index seeing only a "modest correction" of around 1.5% despite a spike in the India VIX, or "fear gauge." He attributed this to "investor confidence supported by India's strong economic fundamentals" and a "historical pattern of limited market disruption during geopolitical flare-ups of this nature." Indeed, the risks from recent military flare-ups appear to have been offset by the fact that India is considered by many to be an attractive investment destination. Research from Barclays's credit team also noted that the "macro impact is limited for both India and Pakistan" from the recent conflict. However, while the hostilities may not have spooked investors, over the longer term, rising geopolitical tensions could pose risks. And there have been some surprises in the conflict this time around. For decades, most conflicts between the two remained largely on land. "Geopolitically India is not in a great situation," said Venugopal Garre, head of India research at Bernstein, in a note to clients on May 7. These countries are now occupied with war closer to home. Garre added that China's support of Pakistan doesn't help either. India has a precarious relationship with China — its largest neighbor — exhibiting certain qualities that are similar to its relationship with Pakistan. China and India share a long border with many points of disagreement that have remained unsettled for decades. The two countries also went to war in 1962 over a border dispute. While an actual military conflict between the two Asian giants is deemed "very, very unlikely" by Alquity's Kader, he admits that such an eventuality would be a "very scary situation" potentially requiring "global intervention" and significantly elevating India's risk premium. Bernstein noted: "India needs China to help build its low-end assembly franchise while China may consider India as potential market (it runs a large trade surplus with India which it may not want to risk losing)." Yet, recent events show that when violence erupts, it can be difficult to predict how far each side will go. Investors might want to take note of the risks. Trump doesn't want Apple building products in India. The U.S. President said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he doesn't want the tech giant to build its products in India, taking shots at the company's moves to diversify production away from China and urging him to pivot stateside. It was the sixth straight month that price increases moderated. Food inflation, which is a key inflation metric in the country, dipped to 1.78% in April, from March's figure of 2.69%. In April, wholesale inflation, which serves as a proxy for producer prices, rose 0.85% on an annual basis, much lower than the 2.05% increase the previous month and marking the slowest increase in more than a year. India raised the idea of retaliatory tariffs on America. The ceasefire between India and Pakistan is brittle but intact. Both countries reached an agreement to stop military action on May 10, but have accused one another of violating it. That said, armed conflict has largely abated from the height of hostilities beginning May 6, which India said was a response to a militant attack last month in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed. The Nifty 50 index closed above 25,000 points for the first time since October, as it heads for a 4.4% gain this week. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield declined to 6.23%, down by about 10 basis points from last week. On CNBC TV this week, Shilpak Ambule, India's high commissioner to Singapore, said India will not distinguish between "terrorists and government sponsors of terrorist," and further discussed India's perspective of its conflict with Pakistan that broke out earlier this month. Ambule stressed that India is still forging trade ties with countries such as the U.S., the European Union and New Zealand amid its hostilities with Pakistan. Meanwhile, Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Investments, said India is the "most exciting place" now because it will replace China in many areas. For instance, Apple has already shifted some of its manufacturing and export operations to India. Mobius also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing a good job of cutting through the Indian bureaucracy, streamlining the country's infrastructure and economy. India's balance of trade figures, out Friday, will receive more scrutiny than usual, given U.S. President Donald Trump's emphasis on trade imbalances between America and its partners. Meanwhile, Integrity Infrabuild, a construction company, lists Tuesday, followed by Accretion Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Apple may have only one way out of the rock and a hard place it finds itself in during President Donald Trump's second administration, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Grok chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI startup said Wednesday that it "appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa," according to responses viewed by CNBC. CNBC was able to duplicate the artificial intelligence chatbot's responses via multiple user accounts on X, including by asking in one prompt, "Did someone program Grok to discuss 'white genocide' specifically?" Users noticed the chatbot was generating bizarre answers about the controversial topic on Wednesday afternoon in response to unrelated queries. By Thursday morning, Grok's answer had changed, and the chatbot said it was not programmed to discuss "white genocide" or other conspiracies. "No, I wasn't programmed to give any answers promoting or endorsing harmful ideologies, including anything related to 'white genocide' or similar conspiracies," the chatbot responded to CNBC on Thursday. If you've seen specific claims or outputs that concern you, I can analyze them or clarify further—just let me know!" Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Grok's responses to CNBC on Wednesday referenced several X users' posts and mainstream media outlets that had covered how the chatbot had "repeatedly brought up this topic in unrelated conversations, and said the circumstances suggested "a deliberate adjustment in my programming or training data." Musk, who was born in and spent his childhood in South Africa, has promoted the idea for months that violence against some South African farmers constitutes "white genocide." Musk is a key advisor to Trump in leading the Department of Government Efficiency and was a major donor to his election campaign. On Monday, the U.S. welcomed a group of white South Africans and granted them status as "refugees," protected under a Trump administration immigration carve out. Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, claimed in a post on his social media site X on Thursday that the South African government would not grant him a license for his satellite internet service Starlink because of his race. "Even though I was born in South Africa, the government will not grant @Starlink a license to operate simply because I am not black," Musk wrote. "This is a shameful disgrace to the legacy of the great Nelson Mandela who sought to have all races treated equally in South Africa." OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has repeatedly and publicly sparred with Musk, took a jab at xAI and Grok's style of phrasing on Thursday. "There are many ways this could have happened. I'm sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon," Altman wrote in a post on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of UnitedHealth Group plunged more than 13% on Thursday following a report that the Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the health-care giant over possible Medicare fraud. In a statement, UnitedHealth Group said the Justice Department has not notified it about the reported probe and called the newspaper's reporting "deeply irresponsible." It marks the second time this year that the insurer's Medicare Advantage business has come under federal scrutiny. The Journal reported in February that the DOJ is conducting a civil investigation into whether the company inflated diagnoses to trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans. UnitedHealthcare's Medicare and retirement segment, which includes the Medicare Advantage business, is UnitedHealth Group's largest revenue driver, raking in $139 billion in sales last year. The reported investigation also follows the surprise exit of UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty, who will be replaced by the company's former longtime chief executive, Stephen Hemsley. Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down roughly 49% this year following a string of setbacks for the company. UnitedHealth Group has lost over $300 billion of its $600 billion market cap in just one month, Jared Holz, Mizuho health-care equity strategist, said in an email Thursday. He said there is some risk that the company will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average "at some point unless there is greater evidence of greater consistency." UnitedHealth Group also had a tumultuous 2024, grappling with a historic cyberattack, higher-than-expected medical costs and the torrent of public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson.

Return to Office:

JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Jamie Dimon swiftly went viral earlier this year following some heated remarks about the perils of working from home. On Thursday, he acknowledged his emotions ran a little high but affirmed the case for bringing employees back to the office.

“I emoted a little bit,” Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview, when asked about the comments he made in February at a townhall discussion in Columbus, Ohio. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase said scammers bribed company insiders to steal sensitive data, and the hack could cost the cryptocurrency exchange as much as $400 million. The firm said it was recently infiltrated by "criminals" who used cash rewards to get Coinbase customer support agents outside the US to send them customer data. The scammers intended to use the data to pose as Coinbase itself and trick users into sending over their crypto funds. "Now, unfortunately, they were able to find a few bad apples," Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a video response posted on X. The figures were based on Coinbase's preliminary estimates of remediation costs, customer reimbursements, and other related expenses. We'll keep owning issues when they arise and investing in world-class defenses," the firm said in a statement. The exchange said the breach affected less than 1% of users, who may have had their names, account data, the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information exposed. It's also implementing a $20 million reward fund for information that could help with the arrest of the scammers. Coinbase fired the customer support agents who provided insider information to the group, and said it would press criminal charges against those individuals. "For these would-be extortionists or anyone seeking to harm Coinbase customers, know that we will prosecute you and bring you to justice. And now you have my answer," Armstrong said in his video. Losses stemming from crypto investment fraud ballooned to $3.96 billion in 2023, up 335% over a two-year period, according to data from the FBI.

President Donald Trump's flurry of artificial intelligence deals during his tour of the Middle East is opening a rift within his own administration as China hawks grow increasingly concerned the projects are putting US national security and economic interests at risk.

The Trump team has worked out agreements for parties in Saudi Arabia to acquire tens of thousands of semiconductors from Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., while shipments to the United Arab Emirates could top a million accelerators — mostly for projects involving or owned by US companies. Such chips are used to develop and train models that can mimic human intelligence, and they're the most coveted technology of the AI age. </p>

The Coinbase website.

Coinbase Global Inc. said hackers bribed contractors or employees outside the US to steal sensitive customer data and demanded a $20 million ransom, in one of the most high-profile security breaches of a crypto trading platform.

The largest US crypto exchange said it won't pay the ransom and estimated the incident could cost the San Francisco-based firm up to $400 million to remedy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The advertisers and trade group targeted by an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk's X have hit back against its claims that they colluded to form an illegal boycott of the platform. X is suing several major brands, including Mars, Lego, Nestlé, and Shell, alleging their participation in an ad industry initiative called the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, GARM, was tantamount to a conspiracy to "collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising" from X after Musk's takeover of the company, then known as Twitter. X had claimed the alleged boycott resulted in it becoming "a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform." The categories ranged from obviously harmful content like child sex-abuse imagery, to content like violence, which different sorts of advertisers have varying risk appetites toward. GARM discontinued operations after X filed its initial lawsuit last summer, saying the two-person operation lacked the resources to fight it. In Wednesday's filing, the WFA and the group of brands rejected the accusations of a conspiracy and said that advertisers — including non-GARM members —made their own individual decisions about pulling ad spend from X. It noted that X's own lawsuit said just 18 of GARM's more than 100 members stopped advertising on the platform. X's advertising revenue had plummeted after Musk took control of Twitter in 2022. Under his leadership, the company fired reams of staff who had been responsible for areas like brand and platform safety, loosened content moderation rules, and brought back controversial banned accounts. Some of X's original legal argument was built on a prior probe from the House Judiciary Committee, led by its Republican chairman Jim Jordan. The committee published an investigation last summer that alleged GARM and its members colluded to boycott platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other conservative-leaning media content they disfavored. The WFA, CVS Health, and Nestlé declined to comment. X and the advertiser defendants — Mars, Ørsted, Abbott Laboratories, Colgate-Palmoliver, Lego, Pinterest, Tyson Foods, and Shell — didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. This month, X dropped its claims against the video platform Twitch, which was also previously a defendant in the case. X's court filing didn't state a reason, but the dismissal was brought "without prejudice," which means X could potentially sue Twitch again over the ad-boycott dispute. Unilever was also initially named as a defendant in the original lawsuit, but reached an unspecified agreement with X and was dropped from the case in October.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You may think that coding languages are static, just a string of letters and numbers for humans to communicate with machines and software. But Herb Sutter, a tech leader at Citadel Securities, says otherwise. "That's why we see C++, Rust, C, and Python continuing to evolve. Our landscape is always changing, and it's important to stay abreast of those developments." The company is focused on mastering C++, because speed and execution are everything. It's considered a more specialized coding language that is often used at high-frequency trading firms and exchanges. Sutter joined in 2024 from Microsoft to spearhead its training initiatives on C++, which is used extensively throughout Citadel Securities' technology. But even less experienced coders have something to gain by familiarizing themselves with the fresh features that come with new versions of C++; one edge is standing out in the interview process to nab a job at Citadel Securities, which can fetch up to $350,000 for jobs requiring C++ experience. In this Q&A, Sutter discusses how the firm is embracing a new version of C++ that isn't even set to be fully released until next year, and two pieces of advice that can help engineers stand out from the crowd. It has been edited for length and clarity. I've been at Citadel Securities for about six months. I've been drinking from a firehose because there's lots of exciting work to do and new things I'm being exposed to. One of the things I'm especially excited about is C++'s async framework that's coming in the next standard that will ship about a year from now. Async use of C++ is a big deal because we are all increasingly needing to do things concurrently and in parallel. [Editor's note: "async" is shorthand for asynchronous — code that can run in the background without freezing your app. It's a new framework that helps developers write faster, smoother programs by handling tasks like downloading files or crunching numbers without making users wait.] I didn't realize until I joined Citadel Securities just how much that framework is already used at the firm, including for our US equities trading. Working at Citadel Securities is almost like living in the future in that we're already diving deep into technologies that will eventually be widely used. What exactly is an async framework, and why is it becoming increasingly important to have things work concurrently and in parallel? Concurrency is the idea of doing more than one thing at a time, which we're always trying to do in a network-cloud world, whether that's waiting for cloud capacity or AI tokens. What impresses me most about C++26's async framework is that it can handle both of those elements — the one that involves hiding and waiting, and the other that's doing many different things. Doing them both well in one framework is pretty amazing. Just think of what a trading system has to do. Execution is extremely important, and that's why we're investing in the async framework. What are some of the advantages that you're seeing being an early adopter or a first mover in this new C++ standard? At Citadel Securities, using the things today that everyone else is going to be using months or years from now builds muscle and familiarity — especially for something as core as an async framework. Because we're using the new standard in production and at scale, we're able to play a role in evolving the language, which has been great. How would a prospective hire show off their C++ skills? What's your advice to young engineers interested in joining Citadel Securities? I went to the University of Waterloo in Canada, which has a well-known co-op program that served me incredibly well, but there are many others out there. The key is to get some work experience so that by the time you graduate, you have spent a significant amount of time using your skills in a real-world environment. Ultimately, knowing data structures, languages, and the like are important tools in the toolkit, but what will really set you apart is your ability to solve business problems.</p>
