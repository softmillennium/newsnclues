                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court heard arguments on a case that stems from the executive order President Donald Trump issued on his first day in office that would deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. “They came here on temporary visas so I derive my citizenship through birthright.” (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) A woman from CASA Maryland holds her 9-month-old baby as she joins others in support of birthright citizenship, Thursday, May 15, 2025, outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.

Judges have issued 40 nationwide injunctions since Trump began his second term in January, Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court at the start of more than two hours of arguments. Birthright citizenship is among several issues, many related to immigration, that the administration has asked the court to address on an emergency basis. The justices also are considering the Trump administration's pleas to end humanitarian parole for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and to strip other temporary legal protections from another 350,000 Venezuelans. The administration remains locked in legal battles over its efforts to swiftly deport people accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term that would deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The order conflicts with a Supreme Court decision from 1898 that held that the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment made citizens of all children born on U.S. soil, with narrow exceptions that are not at issue in this case. States, immigrants and rights group sued almost immediately, and lower courts quickly barred enforcement of the order while the lawsuits proceed. A woman from CASA Maryland holds her 9-month-old baby as she joins others in support of birthright citizenship, Thursday, May 15, 2025, outside of the Supreme Court in Washington. “Every court has ruled against you,” she told Sauer. If the government wins on today's arguments, it could still enforce the order against people who haven't sued, Kagan said. “All of those individuals are going to win. Several conservative justices who might be open to limiting nationwide injunctions also wanted to know the practical effects of such a decision as well as how quickly the court could reach a final decision on the Trump executive order. Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Sauer with a series of questions about how the federal government might enforce Trump's order. Sauer said they wouldn't necessarily do anything different, but the government might figure out ways to reject documentation with “the wrong designation of citizenship.” Kavanaugh continued to push for clearer answers, pointing out that the executive order gave the government only about 30 days to develop a policy. “You think they can get it together in time?” he said. Picking up on that theme, Justice Samuel Alito said he meant no disrespect to the nation's district judges when he opined that they sometimes suffer from an “occupational disease which is the disease of thinking that ‘I am right and I can do whatever I want. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor was among several justices who raised the confusing patchwork of rules that would result if the court orders were narrowed and new restrictions on citizenship could temporarily take effect in more than half the country. Some children might be “stateless,” Sotomayor said, because they'd be denied citizenship in the U.S. as well as the countries their parents fled to avoid persecution. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum, representing 22 states that sued, said citizenship could “turn on and off” for children crossing the Delaware River between Camden, New Jersey, where affected children would be citizens, and Philadelphia, where they wouldn't be.

Supreme Court arguments over emergency appeals are rare. A decision is expected by the end of June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dick's Sporting Goods is buying the struggling footwear chain Foot Locker for about $2.4 billion, the second buyout of a major footwear company in as many weeks as business leaders struggle with uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos. “Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,” Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement. Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Retail Round Up Conference last month, Dillon said that Foot Locker is working closely with Nike, specifically in categories including basketball, sneaker culture and kids. Earlier this month Skechers announced that it was being taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion. The retail industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Foot Locker's stock has plunged 41% this year. It is also facing pressure elsewhere, with major athletic companies like Nike and Adidas shifting their sales strategies. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs. Foot Locker, based in New York City, offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas. Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year. Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said that about 33% of Foot Locker's sales come from outside the United States. He anticipates that the combined company would generate approximately 12% of sales internationally on a pro forma basis. The deal also broadens Dick's customer base, with sneaker collectors anxiously anticipating new drops from Foot Locker. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in an emailed statement that Foot Locker, which has a 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would give an immediate boost to Dick's. “It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space,” he added. Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders. Dick's stock dropped more than 10% before the market open, while shares of Foot Locker surged more than 82%.</p>

Wes Moore speaks at a news conference on Thursday, May 15, 2025 in Annapolis, Md., Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown is standing right. In this image from video, Dr. David Fowler, a retired forensic pathologist and former chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland testifies as Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presides, on April 14, 2021, in the trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minn. Chauvin is charged in the May 25, 2020 death of George Floyd. Wes Moore speaks at a news conference on Thursday, May 15, 2025 in Annapolis, Md. (AP) — An audit of Maryland autopsies has uncovered at least 36 deaths in police custody that should have been considered homicides, state officials announced Thursday following a comprehensive review of such cases spurred by widespread concerns about the former state medical examiner's testimony in the death of George Floyd. Medical examiners under Dr. David Fowler displayed racial and pro-police bias, according to the review. “These findings have profound implications across our justice system,” Brown said. The auditors reviewed 87 in-custody death cases after medical experts called Fowler's work into question because he testified that police weren't responsible for Floyd's death. The Maryland team focused on cases in which people died suddenly after being restrained, often by police, officials said. Three-person panels evaluated each autopsy and, in 36 cases, they unanimously concluded that the deaths should have been classified as homicides but were not. In five more cases, two of the three reviewers came to that conclusion. Fowler didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Wes Moore said he has signed an executive order directing Brown to review the 41 cases and determine if any should be reopened for investigation. Moore acknowledged the families whose loved ones have died in police custody, some of whom have been “screaming for this type of analysis — and have been met with silence.” He also acknowledged the many members of law enforcement who do their jobs honorably and protect the public. Moore said he has also created a statewide task force to study the deaths of people restrained in law enforcement custody. He said the state won't shy away from rooting out misconduct and working to create a more equitable justice system. In a national investigation published last year, The Associated Press and its reporting partners found that medical examiners and coroners, whose rulings have huge consequences in the courts, can face pressure from law enforcement to exonerate officers. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of 443 cases that were ruled accidental, just two resulted in criminal charges. While the audit findings are troubling, Maryland officials said they don't suggest intentional or malicious conduct. They emphasized that a homicide classification simply means someone died because of another person's action, not necessarily that the officers involved should be prosecuted. Fowler, who testified for the defense at the 2021 murder trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, attributed Floyd's death to a sudden heart rhythm disturbance as a result of his heart disease — a widely rejected theory that did little to persuade the jury. After his conviction, 400 medical experts signed a letter to the Maryland attorney general asserting that Fowler's testimony deviated way outside the bounds of accepted forensic practice. In addition to citing heart problems, he classified the manner of death as “undetermined” rather than “homicide.” The letter called for an investigation to determine whether the office's in-custody death determinations under Fowler's leadership exhibited certain bias, among other potential issues. Officials said Thursday that their audit found a troubling systemic pattern. Nearly half of the reviewed cases cited “excited delirium” as a cause of death, a diagnosis that has been debunked by medical experts in recent years. Critics say it was often used to justify excessive force by police. His death was captured on video, which showed police in rural Greensboro holding the unarmed teenager down for more than six minutes. Fowler ruled that Black died because of a sudden cardiac event while struggling with police — not because they pinned him in a prone position. Fowler similarly ruled that Tyrone West died of natural causes after struggling with Baltimore police following a traffic stop in 2013. His manner of death was undetermined, according to the autopsy. Both Black and West are now included on the list of cases that should have been ruled homicides. Tawanda Jones, West's sister who has held weekly rallies for 616 weeks to highlight his case, said she feels something positive will come from the investigation. Fowler's tenure also included the death of Freddie Gray 10 years ago. The autopsy concluded Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a Baltimore police van. It also classified his death as a homicide because officers repeatedly failed to seek medical attention while he was in distress. Prosecutors filed charges against six officers, but none were convicted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ron DeSantis delivers remarks during a news conference in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Feb. 22, 2024. Ron DeSantis signed a measure Thursday prohibiting local governments from adding fluoride to their water systems, making it the second state in the country after Utah to implement a statewide ban on the mineral. DeSantis signed the bill at a public event in Dade City, Florida, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates. “Yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that's fine, but forcing it in the water supply is basically forced medication on people,” DeSantis said Thursday. “They don't have a choice, you're taking that away from them.” Utah was the first state to ban fluoride in late March, and its prohibition went into effect last week, while Florida's provision is effective July 1. Some local governments in Florida have already voted to remove fluoride from their water, ahead of the statewide ban. Earlier this month, Miami-Dade County commissioners voted to override a veto by Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and move forward with plans to remove fluoride from the county's drinking water. “Water fluoridation is a safe, effective, and efficient way to maintain dental health in our county – and halting it could have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families,” Levine Cava said in a statement defending her veto. Some Republican-led states have sought to impose bans following a push by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stop fluoridating water. Earlier this month, DeSantis pledged to sign the bill and was flanked by the state's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who has attracted national scrutiny over his opposition to policies embraced by public health experts, including COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Fluoride is a mineral that has been added to drinking water for generations to strengthen teeth and reduce cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Excess fluoride intake has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the Pentagon's warning about a drone risk on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX: Dozens of drones that traipsed over Langley Air Force base in late 2023 revealed an astonishing oversight: Military officials did not believe they had the authority to shoot down the unmanned vehicles over the U.S. homeland. A new bipartisan bill, known as the COUNTER Act, seeks to rectify that, offering more bases the opportunity to become a "covered facility," or one that has the authority to shoot down drones that encroach on their airspace. The new bill has broad bipartisan and bicameral support, giving it a greater chance of becoming law. It's led by Armed Services Committee members Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate, and companion legislation is being introduced by August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., in the House. The legislation expands the narrow definition of a covered facility under current statute to allow all military facilities that have a well-defined perimeter to apply for approval that allows them to engage with drones. Legislation led by Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., in the Senate would expand domestic military base authority to shoot drones down. The legislation also stipulates that the secretary of defense delegate authority to combatant commanders to engage drone attacks, cutting down on time to get approval through the chain of command in emergency situations. "Leaving American military facilities vulnerable to drone incursions puts our service members, the general public and our national security at risk," Cotton said. For more than two weeks in December 2023, a swarm of mystery drones flew into restricted airspace over Langley, home to key national security facilities and the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. Lack of a standard protocol for such incursions left Langley officials unsure of what to do, other than allow the 20-foot-long drones to hover near their classified facilities. Whether it knows where the drones came from or what they were doing is unclear. "As commercial drones become more commonplace, we must ensure that they are not being used to share sensitive information with our adversaries, to conduct attacks against our service members, or otherwise pose a threat to our national security," Gillibrand said.

Gen. Gregory Guillot, chief of Northern Command (NORCOM) and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said in February that there were over 350 unauthorized drone detections over military bases last year. "The primary threat I see for them in the way they've been operating is detection and perhaps surveillance of sensitive capabilities on our installations," he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Guillot said that regulations on UAV countermeasures created "significant vulnerabilities that have been exploited by known and unknown actors." He advocated for what the new legislation would do: expand Section 130i of Title 10, which pertains to the protection of  "certain facilities and assets from unmanned aircraft." "I would propose and advocate for expansion of 130i [authorities] to include all military installations, not just covered installations," Guillot said during the hearing. And under the current authorities, we can't address that." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Quotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump in Abu Dhabi: President Donald Trump is in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop of his Middle East trip after he visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Ahead of his trip, Trump said he plans to accept a plane from Qatar to be used as Air Force One — raising legal, ethical and security concerns. “Let me have one month of fixing up the Oval Office, in other words, getting things ready. Trump appeared to be referring to the UAE's announcement in March that they would invest $1.4 trillion over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing, and energy. The UAE's existing US investments already total $1 trillion, according to its embassy in Washington. Catch up below on key moments from Trump's Thursday in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates: Roundtable with business leaders: Trump participated in a business roundtable with Qatari leaders, where he praised Syria's interim leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa, floated the idea of a Gaza “freedom zone” and appeared to indicate that the US has reached a trade deal with India. It's very hard to sell into India, and they've offered us a deal where, basically, they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said during the roundtable in Doha. Visit to US military installation in Qatar: Trump thanked US troops for political support and said his priority is to end wars, but won't hesitate to “wield American power if it's required,” during a campaign rally-style visit to the largest US military installation in the Middle East, the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. “My priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners, and this is one of our great partners right here,” he said. Trip to Abu Dhabi: Trump traveled aboard Air Force One from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop on his tour of the Middle East. He was feted with drums, chanting, and a military honor guard lining a hallway as he arrived at the presidential flight terminal in Abu Dhabi. What's expected on Friday: Trump plans to wrap up his trip to the Middle East by participating in a US & UAE business family photo and roundtable before touring the Abrahamic Family House. CNN's Betsy Klein and Shania Shelton contributed reporting to this post. While President Donald Trump is in the United Arab Emirates, back in the US House Speaker Mike Johnson is meeting today with competing House GOP factions — House Freedom Caucus members and New York Republicans — as he attempts to strike a deal on the state and local tax deduction cap in Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. New York Republicans who arrived for the meeting, including Reps. Elise Stefanik, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota, have been advocating for the SALT cap to be raised higher than $30,000. LaLota reiterated that the $30,000 cap is “not a fix for us” and “I don't think it's a fix for the president.” “Members of Congress who represent these districts throughout the country are through a deliberative process right now, haggling over in maybe an Apprentice-like style over what will be in the beautiful bill,” Lalota told reporters. “It 1) increases debt by $20T (to over $56T in a decade), 2) backloads savings (typical swamp), 3) locks in place Obamacare's failing Medicaid expansion subsidizing able-bodied over vulnerable & likely pressuring no-expansion states to expand, 4) delays work requirements til AFTER Trump & includes massive waiver, 5) delays IRA subsidy repeal until after Trump, 6) many other issues,” he posted on X. Very proud of my friends, this is an incredible culture, that I can say,” Trump said in brief remarks inside the Al Noor Foyer. Better than an honor that's given to the country, but it's a great tribute, thank you.” He asked the press if they were “having a good time.” He then strode along the mosque's long, outdoor marble walkway with intricate floral columns. He observed a carved, gilded wall with his guides, and later stood atop the center of the rug and posed for a photo. President Donald Trump's remarks ahead of his visit to the United Arab Emirates show that the relationship between Washington and Gulf Arab states is “beyond transactional,” UAE Minister of Education Sarah Al Amiri said. “This is a beneficial relationship to both nations, and this is a relationship that will create deep-rooted ties,” Al Amiri told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday, adding that “this is what we're looking for here in the UAE.” The UAE is looking to diversify its economy, Al Amiri said, especially in fields of artificial intelligence and technology. “We are in the perfect stage today to take on this paradigm shift that artificial intelligence is going to take on, and that's why we've invested in it so early,” she said. Perhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns – and it has money to back it up. President Donald Trump was feted with drums, chanting, and a military honor guard lining a hallway as he arrived at the presidential flight terminal in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on Thursday. Trump processed through the arrival ceremony, warmly greeting UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other Emirati officials as children waved American and Emirati flags. A line of women in white robes danced and tossed their long, dark hair back and forth as part of the ceremony, a traditional Gulf dance. After a private greeting with the Emirati president, Trump is on the move to Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, a major landmark in Abu Dhabi. President Donald Trump was met with drums, chanting, and a military honor guard lining a hallway as he arrived at the presidential flight terminal in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates on Thursday. President Donald Trump told reporters that when it comes to peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, “nothing is going to happen until” he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Nothing's gonna happen until Putin and I get together, ok? But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he landed in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. We just took in $4 trillion, and you're disappointed about a delegation? More on the talks: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he won't meet with any Russian representatives in Turkey besides Putin. He called the delegation who showed up Thursday “phony.” Trump indicated earlier Thursday that a trip to Turkey could still be on the table, keeping the option open even after top officials said there were no plans to do so. President Donald Trump is traveling aboard Air Force One from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the third and final stop on his tour of the Middle East. In Qatar, the president highlighted key investments in Boeing, but also made news on Iran nuclear negotiations, Russia-Ukraine talks, a potential India tariff deal, and the possibility of a Gaza “freedom zone.” He addressed thousands of US troops at Al Udeid Air Base, marking his largest crowd of the trip and an effort to highlight US-Qatari security ties. Trump was also greeted with much fanfare by the country's emir and treated to a state dinner. The president is expected to tour Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and attend a state dinner in Abu Dhabi upon his arrival. President Donald Trump on Thursday thanked US troops for political support during a campaign rally-style visit to a US installation in Qatar, telling troops stationed at Al Udeid Air Base that “nobody's been stronger than the military in terms of backing us.” So, I just want to thank you all very much. Trump, who is on the second of three stops in the Middle East, also repeated baseless claims of 2020 election fraud while on foreign soil, noting calls to seek a fourth term. President Donald Trump said his priority is to end wars, but he won't hesitate to “wield American power if it's required,” while addressing US troops in Qatar on Thursday. Trump visited the Al Udeid Air Base, which houses 10,000 American troops and plays a critical role in US foreign policy, on his first major international presidential visit of his second term. “My priority is to end conflicts, not start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners, and this is one of our great partners right here,” he said. President Donald Trump on Thursday morning appeared to indicate that the US has reached a trade deal with India, in which, India is “willing to literally charge us no tariff.” It's very hard to sell into India, and they've offered us a deal where, basically, they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,” Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha. He continued, “So we go from the highest tariff – you couldn't do business in India. We're not even a top 30 (importer) in India because the tariff is so high, to a point where they have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent), you were working on that also, that there will be no tariff, right? The US has a $45.6 billion trading deficit with India. Thank you guys for having me,” said Theo Von, an American comedian-turned-podcaster, who took the stage to booming applause. Today, he offered a few jokes at the president's expense. Some background: Trump is making his first visit to Al Udeid Air base, which houses more than 10,000 troops and has played a pivotal role in US foreign policy over the last two decades. It served as a critical launching pad for airstrikes and intelligence missions over Afghanistan and was the main CENTCOM base following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Let some good things happen, put people in homes where they can be safe and Hamas is going to have to be dealt with,” Trump said at a business roundtable in Doha with top Qatari officials. And you know, I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good: make it a freedom zone, let the United States get involved and make it just a freedom zone, have a real freedom zone,” Trump said. He continued, “They've never solved the Gaza problem and if you look at it, I have aerial shots, I mean there's practically no building standing, there's no building. People are living under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, which is not acceptable, it's tremendous death. And I want to see that be a freedom zone.” On the ground: Almost 70 people were killed overnight in Gaza as a week of intense Israeli strikes continues. Israeli strikes killed 57 people in Khan Younis, according to a list from the Nasser Hospital mortuary. Videos supplied by local journalists show young children among those killed and bodies filling the mortuary at the hospital, with staff saying it was “packed with bodies.” Donald Trump's perceived domestic political enemies appeared to remain top of mind during his Middle Eastern sojourn. Former Transportation Secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg reemerged on the national stage this week for a town hall in Iowa amid speculation about a 2028 presidential bid – and Trump took time to mock him in Doha. As he praised his Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for “working right now on the airports and getting a system,” Trump slammed the Biden administration and Buttigieg's bicycling commute. “Biden didn't do a thing for four years, and Pete Buttigieg was the head. He's running the biggest air system in the world, and he takes a bicycle to work,” Trump said, surrounded by Qatari leaders. “And they say he's going to run for president. Trump has largely ignored the long-held presidential norms of avoiding criticism domestic political opponents while traveling abroad, personally attacking his predecessor for the second day in a row. “Biden was so bad, worst president we've ever had by far. This man was grossly incompetent, and now that's been proven, but people were able to see how bad it is, and it gave me a mandate.” I watched some of the people talking about it, and even what I would perceive as enemies of ours, people that are not fair from the press, are saying it's been amazing,” he said, later referencing an outlet he described as an “enemy paper.” We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.” He reiterated that Iran “can't have a nuclear weapon” and suggested that negotiators are “getting very close to maybe doing a deal.” His top foreign envoy Steve Witkoff held a fourth round of talks with Iranian counterparts on Sunday, with discussions expected to continue in the coming days. Trump offered two options: “There's a very, very nice step, and there's a violent step, the violence like people haven't seen before, and I don't – I hope we're not going to have to do this. Global oil prices fell after Trump's comments that the talks had made progress. A potential US-Iran nuclear deal raises the prospect of more of Tehran's oil becoming available on the global market, boosting overall supply. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered less optimistic language on Wednesday, lambasting remarks made by Trump earlier in his Middle East tour. Seated at a business roundtable with Qatari leaders, Trump vowed that the US would “protect” Iran's neighbor. Other countries are much further away, so probably it's not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country, this very special place with a special royal family.” President Donald Trump said Thursday he was not disappointed by news that Vladimir Putin will not attend Ukraine war talks in Turkey, saying he didn't expect Putin to attend the talks that the Russian leader himself suggested. On Thursday, Trump told reporters in Qatar he “didn't anticipate” Putin's participation when asked if he was disappointed by the Russian president's absence at the talks. And that turned out to be right,” Trump said. “I was thinking about going,” Trump said Thursday in what could be an attempt to save face, but once more kept the option open: CNN's Ivana Kottasova and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. Donald Trump again praised Syria's interim leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa on Thursday, characterizing the former jihadist-turned-president as someone with a “strong past.” “I met the new leader of the country, and he's got a, you know, strong past… I think he'll be a great representative, and we'll see,” Trump said at a roundtable with business leaders in Qatar ostensibly aimed at highlighting new investment in Boeing. Trump's comments underscore his frequent efforts to publicly praise and admire strongmen leaders. If you're a weak person, we would just be wasting time. But we're going to give him a fighting chance by taking off the sanctions.” Trump announced Tuesday that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria following last year's fall of the Assad regime. Some background: Until recently, al-Sharaa had a $10 million US bounty on his head. Once known by his militant nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, he was placed on the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist list in 2013 for heading al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected remarks made by Donald Trump during his Middle East tour, saying the US president is “naive” for thinking Iran will give in. Trump “is naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands. Trump's comments come amid nuclear talks between the US and Iran. “If Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure,” Trump said. Trump repeated his threats on Wednesday, saying he doesn't want nuclear talks in Iran to take a “violent course.” I don't want that, but they have to get moving.” Pezeshkian said “Iran will continue its progress with or without a deal.” President Donald Trump is “open to virtually any mechanism to get us to a just, enduring and lasting peace” in Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday at an informal meeting of foreign ministers in Antalya, Turkey. Rubio also repeated the Trump administration's position that there is “no military solution” to the war started by Russia's invasion of its neighbor in 2022. He had repeatedly hinted that he might upend his Middle East trip to join negotiations after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be “grateful” for his presence and Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin would “like me to be there.” The US and Saudi Arabia inked a $142 billion defense partnership on Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf countries such as Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are among the top 15 largest importers of weapons globally. A large proportion of their imports comes from the US. American companies, led by Lockheed Martin, are the largest producers of arms worldwide. Kathy Warden, CEO of Northrop Grumman, and Kelly Ortberg, CEO of Boeing, joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, alongside other American business leaders, at a lunch in Riyadh's Saudi Royal Court on Tuesday— according to a list provided by the White House. President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday after the US leader said that he planned to lift sanctions on Syria. CNN's Becky Anderson explains why the meeting was so significant: In a historic meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, President Trump met with Syrian jihadist-turned-president Ahmed al-Sharaa and announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria. CNN's Becky Anderson breaks down who the Syrian leader is and why this meeting was so significant. An opulent welcome: Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani greeted US President Donald Trump atop a red carpet. Then Trump's motorcade was escorted through the streets of Doha by a cavalry of red Tesla Cybertrucks, a nod to the president's senior adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Seated in plush, gilded chairs at a tea ceremony, the emir lavished praise on his guest, saying Trump was “the first American president to officially to visit Qatar.” A Boeing deal: Economic deals totalling more than $243 billion between the US and Qatar were announced, including an agreement for Doha to purchase jets from US manufacturer Boeing for Qatar Airways. A White House fact sheet said it was a $96 billion agreement to acquire up to 210 American-made Boeing planes, contradicting Trump, who said the deal was worth $200 billion and included 160 jets. Boeing could use the help; it has faced a string of safety incidents and financial troubles in recent years. The deal was inked days after Trump said he planned to accept a Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to be used initially as Air Force One — raising legal, ethical and security concerns and drawing widespread criticism. Other agreements signed in Qatar: Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth signed defense agreements, including a statement of intent on cooperation between the countries. And Trump signed a joint declaration of cooperation between the two countries.</p>

In a move that adds to an ever-growing stack of court interventions that have stymied the president's second-term agenda, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from targeting foreign service workers' collective bargaining rights amid an ongoing challenge against an executive order. The American Foreign Service Association, a labor union for foreign service workers, lodged a legal challenge after President Donald Trump issued an executive order earlier this year that, according to a White House fact sheet, aimed to "end collective bargaining with Federal unions in" various government entities "with national security missions." "Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda," the release asserted. "Protecting America's national security is a core constitutional duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests." The order signed by Friedman states, in part, that Trump's executive order "is unlawful as applied to the Defendants who are heads of agencies with employees represented by the Plaintiff." "The effect of the Executive Order was substantial: it removed collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce," Friedman's opinion declared, echoing verbatim a sentence included in an opinion Friedman issued last month in a similar case. In that case, which was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, Friedman also targeted Trump's executive order and granted a motion for a preliminary injunction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A busy stretch of severe thunderstorms is underway due to record heat and now the threats are ramping up, putting major metro areas from Chicago to Nashville under threat as the country hits the peak of tornado season. It's already been an incredibly busy year for tornadoes in the United States, but May is typically the busiest month of them all. This year is the third most active to date, only trailing the record-breaking 2011 season and last year's hyperactive season. More than 20 million people from Minnesota to Michigan and Indiana – including Minneapolis, Milwaukee and Chicago – are under a level 3-of-5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A tornado watch was issued for millions of people in Minnesota and Wisconsin as thunderstorms rumbled to life Thursday afternoon. These storms could become very strong, very quickly, with the SPC warning of supercells – powerful, long-lived thunderstorms able to produce strong tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds. Storms will continue to expand south and push farther east overnight, eventually reaching much of the Midwest and butting into the Ohio Valley. Record-breaking, July-like heat has baked these locales this week, allowing the atmosphere to stock up plenty of fuel for explosive storms. Damaging winds are likely in any storm from the afternoon on, but parts of Michigan and Indiana could feel gusts up to 75 mph late in the evening. A vast area from Minnesota and Wisconsin to parts of Missouri and Kentucky could receive hail larger than hen eggs. Storms with damaging wind gusts, hail and possibly a tornado are most likely in central Viriginia, but a few stronger storms might hit parts of North Carolina and Maryland, too. A few strong thunderstorms may linger in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys early Friday, but a much more widespread severe threat could reignite in the afternoon. A level 3-of-5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from Missouri and Arkansas into parts of Ohio and West Virginia, according to the SPC. “All severe weather hazards are on the table, including damaging winds, large hail, tornadoes, and torrential rainfall,” the National Weather Service in Louisville, Kentucky, warned. “A few strong tornadoes and instances of very large hail are possible.” Forecasters were initially concerned morning storms would lessen the chance of severe weather later in the day, but that scenario is seeming less likely. Eventually, a line of thunderstorms is expected to come together and slam parts of Missouri, southern Illinois, western Kentucky and southern Indiana with wind gusts stronger than 80 mph. Dangerous storms could continue after dark, particularly in parts of Kentucky and areas east. Severe thunderstorms are possible in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Saturday as the same storm driving Thursday and Friday's threats pushes east. Damaging wind gusts and hail are the greatest threats for now, but a tornado can't be ruled out. New storms could bring damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes to parts of the southern Plains starting Saturday afternoon. The Plains will remain the main focus of severe weather on Sunday and Monday as well, with damaging storms possible in much of Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>

UnitedHealth Group said a recent media report that the Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into the embattled company is false. 

The Wall Street Journal report, citing unnamed sources, alleged that the DOJ is investigating UnitedHealth Group, the country's largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, for possible criminal Medicare fraud. After the outlet published the claims, UnitedHealth Group's stock fell by 17% early Thursday, to its lowest level in five years. 

The group slammed the outlet's report on Wednesday, saying in a statement that it is unaware of any DOJ investigation at the company.

“The WSJ's reporting is deeply irresponsible, as even it admits that the ‘exact nature of the potential criminal allegations is unclear,'” UnitedHealth Group said.

“We have not been notified by the Department of Justice of the supposed criminal investigation reported, without official attribution, in the Wall Street Journal today,” the statement continued. “We stand by the integrity of our Medicare Advantage program.”

The company's latest downturn came after it had a tough year. In December, UnitedHealth Group was plunged into turmoil after the CEO of its insurance division was shot and killed in New York City by a suspect who accused the group of “parasitic” corporate greed. Since then, the group has experienced fallout over cascading claims that it wields corporate power to rip off clients.

MAN ARRESTED NEAR UNITEDHEALTHCARE HEADQUARTERS MONTHS AFTER CEO ASSASSINATED

Earlier this week, UnitedHealth Group unexpectedly announced that a new CEO would be taking the reins at the company after former CEO Andrew Witty surprisingly stepped down for “personal reasons.” 

The change came after UnitedHealthcare pulled its 2025 financial outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs.</p>

Solicitor General John Sauer on the practicalities of ending universal injunctions on Thursday, a major sticking point in a highly watched case centered on birthright citizenship and the power of lower courts to rule against the executive branch. Kagan pressed Sauer Thursday on the practicalities of ending universal injunctions and how the higher court should then be tasked with managing the flow of lower court challenges. She also noted that the Trump administration has been "losing uniformly" in lower court cases on the "substantive question" in dealing with birthright citizenship.

After he attempted to answer, she responded that "This is not a hypothetical – this is happening out there." John Sauer, then-nominee to be solicitor general, testifies during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in the Dirksen Building on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Justices on the High Court agreed in April to hear the case, which centers on three lower courts that issued national injunctions earlier this year blocking President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship.

Trump's action remains on hold nationwide pending Supreme Court intervention. A Supreme Court decision here could have sweeping national implications, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 federal lawsuits that have challenged White House actions since Trump's second presidency began on Jan. 20, 2025, according to a Fox News data analysis.

'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Matt Towery and Ari Fleischer discuss President Donald Trump's latest poll numbers. A new national poll released this week is one of the first to indicate a bump up in President Donald Trump's approval ratings after a steady edging down in the president's numbers since he returned to office in January. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters after announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom in the Oval Office of the White House on Thursday, May 8, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The new poll indicates 39% of adults nationwide give Trump a thumbs up on how he is handling the economy, up three points from last month. Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, left, and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent take part in a press conference after two days of closed-door discussions on trade between the United States and China, in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday, May 12, 2025. However, as Trump has partially reversed course in recent weeks by easing back on his sharpest trade moves, public concerns about recession have also slightly eased, while still remaining at heightened levels. Sixty-nine percent questioned in the new poll said they were worried about a recession, down from 76% a month ago. Additionally, concerns about the stock market dropped seven points, to 60%. Veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News that the president has "been very clear-eyed about the fact that you are going to have to break some eggs to make an omelet and his voters will give him the latitude to do so. "We're still less than 150 days in, he's got some time to make the hard calls that have to be made and still give the economic plane runway to take off ahead of the midterms, which is when all of these early decisions will be graded," Reed added. Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president's poll position when he started his second tour of duty in the White House nearly four months ago. Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recent Fox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21. An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around four points, but that is a slight improvement from late last month. The economy, and inflation in particular, were pressing issues that kept former President Joe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency, and which greatly contributed to Trump's White House victory last November. They were behind Trump's slide in the polls so far this year. "Trump's return to office did not begin as he and his supporters had hoped. Campaign promises about inflation and interest rates appeared deferred while the daily news coverage focused on the many distractions plaguing the White House," longtime political scientist and analyst Wayne Lesperance noted. Possible trade deals with Britain, China, and India are providing hope that some good may come from his tariff strategy. Add to that a rebounding stock market and lower gas prices at the start of summer vacation season and the president may see some calming of public nervousness."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans in New York have expressed anger over a state budget proposal that could give state employees funds to cover themselves if President Donald Trump‘s Department of Justice pursues litigation against them. The budget plan does not mention New York Attorney General Letitia James by name, but the budget sets aside $10 million to cover private defense costs for state employees who may be subject to federal investigation. The budget states that the funds are only made available so long as the investigation is “reasonably likely to have been commenced” because of that employee's work. Republicans in the state are asking New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli not to sign off on the $10 million. It undermines public trust in government and sends a troubling message that elected officials and state employees are entitled to a publicly-funded legal defense, even for matters entirely disconnected from their public responsibilities,” state Senate Republicans wrote to DiNapoli in a letter obtained by the New York Post. The letter was signed by state Senate Minority Leader Republican Robert Ortt and 21 other Republican state senators. The notion in New York's budget comes after Trump's DOJ launched a “working group” designed to investigate James and other legal officials who have investigated Trump over the years. The Justice Department recently launched a criminal investigation into allegations that James engaged in mortgage fraud when purchasing homes in New York and Virginia. James's lawyer told CBS News that the investigation “appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The administration's attack on nature, explained by a dancing chicken. The bird above is not your typical charismatic species. It's not even the greater prairie-chicken, another, related avian species, that's a bit larger. Today, however, this bird is very much worth paying attention to. In 2023, lesser prairie-chickens — which are actually fascinating birds, not least for their ridiculous mating rituals — were granted protection under the Endangered Species Act, the country's strongest wildlife law. Scientists say this protection is justified: The population of lesser prairie-chickens has crashed since the last century from hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of birds to roughly 30,000 today. Now the Trump administration is trying to axe those extinction-thwarting protections. In a motion filed earlier this month in a Texas court, the administration argued that federal officials made an error when listing prairie-chickens under the Endangered Species Act. Prairie-chickens overlap in some areas with oil and gas drilling. And President Donald Trump has signaled that he will prioritize drilling over environmental safeguards. Yet it reveals that his administration will take extreme steps to undo wildlife protections if they stand in the way of his agenda. If his administration is successful in delisting the bird, it will signal that no endangered species is safe — especially those, like these chickens, that happen to live where fossil fuels are buried. You can also find him on Signal at @benji.90. Each spring, they come together in breeding grounds called leks to dance for females, hoping to attract them as mates. Then they stomp their feet and start booming, producing a noise that sounds like sped-up yodeling. (These are not to be confused with the greater sage-grouse, a bird in the same family that has a similarly spectacular display.) The Great Plains were once filled with these unusual dancing birds, which play important roles in grassland ecosystems: They provide food for raptors, spread seeds, and control insects. But in the last few centuries, prairie-chickens lost most of their habitat — largely to the expansion of oil and gas, commercial farming, housing developments, and, more recently, wind energy. Facing extinction as a result of powerful industries, the prairie-chicken has been caught up in a game of political ping pong. The government first granted them federal protection in 2014. That brings us to the present day, when these forsaken birds could once again lose protection. It comes down to a somewhat wonky technicality. Briefly, the Endangered Species Act allows the government to grant formal protection to a species or to a population of a species — if those populations are important on their own, and at risk. That's what the Biden administration did: It determined that there were two distinct populations of lesser-prairie chickens and it granted each of them slightly different protections. Under the Trump administration, Interior claims that it didn't provide enough information to show that the two bird populations are distinct. Avian experts, meanwhile, say the reasoning behind the original listing — which was the result of months of work and more than 30,000 public comments — is sound, and these birds are very clearly in trouble. The move to delist prairie-chickens appears to be an effort by the Trump administration to skirt wildlife regulations that some perceive to stand in the way of the oil industry, said Jonathan Hayes, executive director of Audubon Southwest, a regional office of the National Audubon Society, a large environmental nonprofit. “Whether it's true or not, this chicken symbolizes a challenge, or an impediment, to oil and gas development for industry,” Hayes told Vox. “We would expect this administration to push back on regulations that may or may not impact oil and gas. That's what it feels like is happening here.” In a statement to Vox, the Interior Department said it has an “unwavering commitment to conserving and managing the nation's natural and cultural resources…and overseeing public lands and waters for the benefit of all Americans, while prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people.” “Whether somebody wants to engage in debate on technicalities is up to them, but simply and fundamentally lesser prairie-chickens are threatened with extinction,” Koch said. There's no guarantee that prairie-chickens will lose protection. (Interior's spokesperson told Vox they will not comment on ongoing litigation.) It's possible that the judge overseeing this case could agree to remove protections, said Jason Rylander, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. What's key here is that the decision to list lesser prairie-chickens involved a formal rulemaking process with public input. It's not clear that the government can simply reverse its decision and yank federal protections without going through that process again. “The government can't act in a capricious way,” Hayes of Audubon said. I'm not sure how they will legally defend their complete 180.” But no matter how this plays out, this effort to delist lesser prairie-chickens puts other threatened species in an even more precarious spot, especially those that live in regions with oil and gas. One example is the endangered dunes sagebrush lizard. That case is still pending, though environmental advocates fear that the Trump administration could side with Texas and claim it made a mistake when listing the lizard. “As the Trump administration is in power, we can expect that endangered species protections are going to be under attack,” Rylander said. “I think there's a chance we can stop this in court,” he said of efforts to delist the prairie-chicken, “but I think if we don't, we will see more efforts to remand and vacate listings that they [the Trump administration] don't want to have in place anymore.” It's important to remember that wildlife protections benefit people, Koch said. Those lands — those working grassland ecosystems — are under threat from energy development and other industries that are more profitable. And saving those lands benefits the ranchers that live on them, he said. “People depend on grassland ecosystems, and so do lesser prairie-chickens. We need to save grasslands for both of us.” What most of us get wrong about animal instincts. The next big cicada eruption is upon us. The aggressive push to privatize public lands, explained. A federal program killed nearly 2 million wild animals last year. California researchers grapple with losing a landscape they love in real time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are leaning into a corruption argument against President Donald Trump, pointing to his crypto meme coin and plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar as evidence that the president is potentially violating ethical norms and the US Constitution. In floor speeches and interviews, on social media and in the skies above Trump's Florida resort, Democrats have warned that Trump is seeking to enrich himself – even as Republicans advance legislation that could cut programs such as Medicaid and the Department of Government Efficiency scales back the size of the US government. “The first 114 days of this administration have been one bad deal after another for American families,” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said during a floor speech Wednesday highlighting Trump's alleged conflicts of interest. “But if your last name is Trump, these 114 days have been just about the greatest deal of all time.” It's a familiar strategy for Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who criticized Trump during his first term as foreign officials sought to curry favor with the president by staying at his hotels. Tiffany Muller, president of the Democratic-aligned group End Citizens United, said that how Democrats message their anti-corruption arguments will be critical. “Voters don't know who to trust on this issue, and whoever wins that trust battle will win the election,” Muller said in an interview with CNN. Muller and Molly Murphy, president of Impact Research, which conducted focus groups with swing voters last month, recently briefed congressional Democrats and staff on their findings relating to corruption. Voters in those groups expressed concern about corruption but also were cynical about lawmakers in Washington fixing the issue, Muller noted, adding that Democrats should talk about tangible actions they can take to fight corruption, including a congressional stock trading ban. But she argued voters would have “buyer's remorse” as additional ethically questionable episodes arise. Faiz Shakir, an adviser to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, argued Democrats should combine pushback on corruption with a “proactive positive agenda,” similar to tactics used by Democrats in the 2006 midterms when they took control of both chambers of Congress. “In addition to opposing Donald Trump and telling you he's corrupt, we need an agenda that speaks to the things we'll do,” Shakir said. While some Republicans have expressed concerns about Trump's potential conflicts of interest, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the president's actions. “I can just tell you that President Trump has had nothing to hide,” Johnson said Wednesday. There are people who watch all the ethics of that.” Republican strategist Matt Gorman said the talk of corruption is another “shiny object” for Democrats and highlights the party's lack of consistent messaging. “It doesn't affect anyone, any actual, real people,” said Gorman. CNN reported Sunday that the Department of Defense plans to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family that would be used temporarily as Air Force One, then later donated to Trump's presidential library. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. “Any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. The plane controversy comes as Trump has been accused of selling access to himself through his cryptocurrency. “You didn't have anything like, for instance, the cryptocurrency that his family has launched that basically anyone who wants to ingratiate themselves with the president, or thinks that might work, can just pay directly into this platform,” Weiner said. This isn't the first time Democrats have sought to message on corruption. Exit polls that year showed corruption and ethics were among the most important issues for voters. Democrats have faced questions about corruption in recent years as well. Former Sen. Bob Menendez resigned his seat last year after he was found guilty of 16 counts — including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent — for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme. Congressional Republicans seized on Hunter Biden's position with a Ukrainian natural gas company to fuel corruption allegations against his father former President Joe Biden, though there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the elder Biden's part. “Donald Trump is using the presidency to personally enrich himself while he bankrupts working families,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement. Congressional Democrats are also making a push this week to highlight the administration's potential conflicts of interest. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer placed a blanket hold on confirming Justice Department political appointees in response to the Qatari plane gift, calling it “naked corruption” and a “grave national security threat.” Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, filed a resolution Wednesday blasting Trump for attempting to accept the plane without congressional approval. Democrats have also introduced legislation to block presidents and members of Congress from issuing meme coins. Murphy argued during a Tuesday appearance on CNN's “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins that the president was using his trip this week to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates “to profit off of US foreign policy.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is in for a rude awakening if it passes the House, as Senate Republicans are already threatening to tear apart the progress made during difficult negotiations. The legislation, which sweeps together Trump's tax, border, and defense priorities, has torn apart the Republican conference ahead of a House vote planned for next week. Republicans cannot agree on a slate of issues, from Medicaid reform to the state and local tax deduction demanded by blue-state lawmakers. But Senate Republicans are also making clear they won't be content with the House bill as it stands, complicating the delicate balance leadership must strike with narrow majorities in both chambers. Fiscal hawks are unhappy with the relatively modest changes to Medicaid, including the delayed enactment of work requirements, while centrists are reluctant to meet the $1.5 trillion in spending offsets Republicans are targeting. “That's why I've always thought I'd like to decouple the ‘big beautiful bill' into three separates, and I'm still recommending that,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), one of the fiscal hawks demanding further spending reductions. Portions of the package were debated and advanced this week through key House committees, but negotiations continue outside of that process with holdouts who can almost singularly tank the bill. Any changes made in the Senate would then have to be reconciled between the two chambers before a final series of votes. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) described the House's version as a “good first step” but previewed more spending cuts in the Senate, a feat that will undoubtedly prove difficult to achieve given their three-vote GOP majority. “I think we should cut as much unnecessary spending as humanly possible, and I am hopeful that we will see the Senate prove to be even more fiscally conservative than the House,” Cruz said. “There is a whole lot of negotiation between today and the final finished product.” In a bid to stay on the same page, Senate leadership and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) have been in regular contact with their House counterparts to avoid last-minute conflicts. “We've been working very closely together to get our work product as close together as we can,” Crapo said. “I think you'll see a significant amount of overlap, but there will be differences.” The spending reductions are meant to pay for the tax cuts, as are reforms to Medicaid that include more frequent eligibility checks and new fees for patients. The bill is projected to reduce Medicaid spending by $715 billion over 10 years and lead 8.6 million people to lose health coverage from a mix of policy changes and work eligibility requirements. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the Senate's loudest Republican defender of Medicaid, has made benefit cuts to the government-run health program a red line. “We ought to be looking at the Green New Deal subsidies, for instance. A lot of those are still on the House's bill. Why would we cut Medicaid but not the Green New Deal?” Even wonky, less contentious pay-fors are facing heightened scrutiny from senators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days of speculation that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky could meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Turkey have ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on the idea, confirming that the Russian leader had decided not to show up for talks he himself suggested. The possibility of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was not entirely off the table as of Thursday morning, however, with lower-level delegations from both countries known to be in Turkey. A direct meeting would be a major development – the two sides are not known to have met directly since soon after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Adding to the general uncertainty over how a day of high-stakes diplomacy might unfold, Zelensky is sitting down with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in southern Turkey for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers. The talks were first proposed by Putin in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraine's European allies on Saturday, when the leaders of Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom demanded that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face a new round of “massive” sanctions. Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead “direct talks” between Russia and Ukraine. This was likely a delaying tactic by Putin  – something he has successfully deployed several times in the past. The Europeans and Ukraine initially said there could be no talks before a ceasefire is agreed, but that quickly changed when Trump got involved. In a post on social media, he publicly urged Zelensky to “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!! Related article Analysis: Putin has outmanoeuvred a host of US presidents. Putin wasn't suggesting a one-on-one with his loathed Ukrainian counterpart. But Zelensky raised the stakes by announcing he would travel to Turkey himself and calling on Putin to do the same. The Ukrainian leader made it clear that he would not meet with any other Russian official, arguing that “everything in Russia depends on Putin.” Trump, currently on a Middle East tour, added to the pressure by suggesting he might go as well, “if it's helpful.” That idea was endorsed by Zelensky, who said Ukraine would be “grateful” for Trump's presence. Trump also told CNN on Wednesday that Putin would “like me to be there.” If Putin had decided to show up, he would have undermined his own narrative that Zelensky and his government are illegitimate. But by staying at home, Putin gave Zelensky an opportunity to point out, once again, that Russia is not serious about peace. Kyiv and its European allies have long said they don't believe Putin is seriously interested in negotiating peace. Trump has previously repeatedly expressed his belief in the opposite, although he began expressing his doubts in recent weeks, questioning whether Putin wants peace after speaking to Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral in the Vatican last month. Highlighting this is likely the key reason why Zelensky suggested a personal meeting with Putin, who, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence services, had previously ordered his assassination. Putin, meanwhile, said that while Russia does not rule out that “during these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,” the talks will aim to eliminate the “root causes” of the conflict. The last known direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Turkey and Belarus in the spring of 2022 – when it became clear that Putin's initial plan to take over the whole of Ukraine and install a new puppet government in Kyiv within a few days had gone catastrophically wrong. This left Russia scrambling, trying to achieve its goals through negotiations. Once Ukrainian forces began liberating parts of northern Ukraine, finding clear evidence of massacres and other atrocities as they advanced, the talks started to collapse. The Kremlin late Wednesday said Vladimir Medinsky, Putin's senior aide and member of the country's Supreme Council bureau, would lead a delegation of Kremlin insiders. The aide previously headed Russia's delegation in 2022 when Kyiv and Moscow had their last known direct talks. The stakes are higher this time though, as both Trump and Ukraine's European allies have said they will impose more sanctions on Moscow if it doesn't agree to the ceasefire. It's not yet clear whether Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul to meet with the Russian negotiators and who might be part of it. The Turkish government said earlier this week that it was prepared to provide “all kinds of support, including mediation and hosting negotiations, to achieve peace” in Ukraine. As a NATO member, Turkey is invested in the conflict, but it is also seen as more amenable to Russia, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously hailing his “special relationship” with Putin. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and his foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul this week, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, a statement confirmed by another source familiar with the plans. Rubio, Kellogg and Witkoff all took part in some of the previous rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia, in which they acted as intermediaries, meeting separately with the Russian delegation and then, a few days later, with the Ukrainians. This time, the possibility that the two delegations might meet face to face is significant – even if their goal is more about satisfying Trump than reaching an actual deal.
