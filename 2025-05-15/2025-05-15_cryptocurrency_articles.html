                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, May 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the XRP price breaks past $2.50 and momentum surges across the XRP Ledger ecosystem, attention is turning towards Ripple's initial public offering. Crypto observers closely watch how market participants react to Ripple's going public amid the emergence of a new alternative: Remittix. Since making its grand entrance in the global payment sector, Remittix inflows have toppled records, surging above $15 million within weeks. The XRP price has surged over 55% since its April low of $1.61, buoyed by a broader crypto market resurgence. This upswing is fueled by a temporary U.S.-China tariff deal and April's unexpectedly low inflation data, which indicated a 2.3% year-over-year increase, its slowest pace since February 2021. Amid this price performance, the XRP news of its initial public offering is bringing attention to Ripple. While no official date has been announced, speculations by year-end are highly entertained, given the slow momentum towards this project. Meanwhile, the block data indicates that the XRP ETF has recorded inflows for five consecutive weeks, bringing its total assets to more than $99.1 million. The momentum and positive developments had analysts double down on their bullish XRP price prediction. Raising $15 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) is no small accomplishment. The new crypto's distinctive focus on transforming international remittances has resonated with its target audience. This impressive performance shows that Remittix has the potential to be a ground-breaking project even for Ripple investors. Remittix simplifies international money transfers at a lower cost than conventional systems. Remittix's innovation has spread its popularity beyond niche investors, especially as normal people adopt digital assets without experiencing technical issues. While the latest XRP price prediction is not far-fetched, especially with its institutional growth, Remittix's focus on user accessibility and transparent fee structures for businesses positions it as a compelling alternative. Early adopters have earned four-digit percentage returns, and analysts believe Remittix can do much more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, this marriage seemed like a distant promise. Colin Cunningham, head of tokenization at Chainlink Labs, explains: He adds that this milestone marks the future of financial transactions, where real assets will freely circulate between private and public chains. This achievement confirms the growing ability of traditional finance to incorporate crypto innovations. This interoperability eliminates the usual frictions encountered in crypto transactions across different networks. Ondo Finance facilitates the tokenization of traditional assets, such as Treasury bonds, in a decentralized environment. The OUSG token, used in this transaction, is a tokenized money market fund. These innovations enable institutions to operate within open ecosystems, where liquidity and transparency are enhanced. This project is evolving towards a solution capable of settling transactions 24/7, reducing costs and accelerating cross-border payments. The tokenization of real assets is gaining ground, with over $12 billion in value locked on more than 80 DeFi platforms, according to DeFi Llama. BlackRock ranks among the largest investors, with nearly $3 billion in tokenized cash funds. JPMorgan's transaction fits into a rapidly growing market, especially among traditional players eager to enter the crypto community. JPMorgan takes a major step by directly connecting its payment system to public blockchains. Blockchain now finds its place in multiple sectors: finance, healthcare, aviation… However, it still struggles to convince some tech giants like Nvidia. These companies remain cautious, sometimes slowing the growth of a disruptive technology. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest draft of the U.S. Senate's stablecoin legislation includes enough changes that Democratic senators may now have an easier time getting back on board, though consumer advocates say it still falls short. The bill to set oversight and standards for stablecoin issuers sailed through the Senate Banking Committee with wide bipartisan support in March, but it hit a wall on the Senate floor last week as many Democrats raised objections. Chief among them were the conflicts that may be presented by President Donald Trump's own crypto interests and the possibility that big technology firms like Meta and social-media site X may be able to issue such tokens. "As the result of hard-fought negotiations, Democrats won major victories on a range of critical issues," proponents noted in a summary circulated with the draft bill. The question remaining is: Will it be enough to get back to a so-called cloture vote that will advance the bill to a floor debate that would mark its final major stage before the Senate takes a vote. But on the concerns over tech giants sprouting with a field of new dollar-based tokens, the bill dealt with it in part: "A public company that is not predominantly engaged in one or more financial activities, and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries or affiliates, may not issue a payment stablecoin unless the public company obtains a unanimous vote of the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee," according to the latest draft. There are major loopholes in that, according to Mark Hays, who focuses on crypto and financial-technology issues for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. "There's already a way that large tech firms that aren't public could become issuers without adhering to these new standards," he said. Also, he added, "it's quite possible under this bill that a public company could secure an interest in a non-public company, and that's another way around it." He argued that this overall draft gave toothless answers to the concern of consumer advocates. "Pushing this through on an arbitrary deadline because the crypto industry is breathing down your neck is not a good way to make policy," Hays said. He said that Trump "can't be bought." "But I remain steadfast in my optimism that we're going to achieve — the president's desire is to do it — both stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess."

That April 14 base has now turned into a springboard, launching LINK into a multi-week climb that has caught the attention of traders and investors looking for strong altcoin plays. The weekly chart shows price trading into a significant supply zone between $17.60 and $19.848 — a region where LINK was previously rejected earlier this year. This resistance isn't just technical — it also represents a psychological hurdle where many traders may choose to de-risk after a strong run. The real test will come if LINK pulls back. If buyers step in during the next retracement and create a higher low, it could be a pivotal signal that the broader trend is shifting from bearish to bullish. Such a development would set LINK apart from many altcoins, which have struggled to maintain bullish structure or establish higher timeframe reversals after months of decline.

LINK is still down approximately 66% from its 2021 all-time highs, underscoring how much room remains for long-term recovery. This perspective is crucial for managing expectations and navigating volatility. On the daily chart, a swing low has been established at $16.020. If price breaks below that level, however, it could signal deeper retracement — possibly testing older breakout zones or previous demand areas. As long as LINK continues to form higher lows and maintain bullish market structure on the daily chart, the case for a bullish bias remains valid. Traders should remain patient and focused, especially with broader altcoin strength appearing across the market. If LINK can break above the $19.848 resistance zone with conviction, the next upside targets could open up — including psychological round numbers and former support zones turned resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A widely followed analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for an explosive move to the upside. In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 786,500 followers on the social media platform X that ETH may first dip to the $2,233 support level on the daily chart before increasing more than 56% of its current value. Sub $2,400 is a massive opportunity to get yourself [in] before this runs above $4,000.” The analyst also says that ETH is likely in an uptrend against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) on the weekly chart after printing a similar 2019 bottoming pattern. “A gentle reminder that the previous bottom for ETH was in September 2019. After that, a bull market of 826 days took place. ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02480 BTC ($2,558) at time of writing, down 1.16% in the last 24 hours. “If this happens on ETH, that would signal a lot of potential upside to come for the entire altcoin market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has surged from approximately $1,385 in April to a peak of over $2,730, a rally driven by the Pectra upgrade and easing US-China trade tensions. These gains have propelled ETH above the average cost basis of many holders. Historical patterns suggest that such rapid ascents often precede pullbacks, potentially revisiting previous support levels. When the market price rises above this average, many investors find themselves in profit. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that the average cost basis for ETH holders varies by wallet size: These average cost levels often act as psychological support zones. However, if the price falls below these levels, it may signal a shift in market sentiment, leading to further declines. ETH/USD briefly surged above the EMA, only to face a selloff. Additional downside pressure came from the symmetrical triangle's lower trendline. He provides in-depth market analysis, technical chart patterns, and insights on global economic impacts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. by Thierry Warin, Nathalie de Marcellis-Warin, Robert Normand,                                                                                 The Conversation Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are experiencing spectacular growth thanks to the new opportunities they offer for interaction and monetization to fans, clubs and athletes in the sports industry. Platforms such as NBA Top Shot, which allows users to own key moments in basketball as NFTs, generated nearly $500 million in sales and had over 800,000 registered accounts a few years ago. The initial enthusiasm for NFTs quickly faded after scandals over speculation and fraud shook user confidence. For this sector to reach full maturity, there must be stricter regulation and enhanced security practices. If the sector wants to have sustainable growth, it must answer a crucial question: how can the healthy and secure development of these rapidly expanding assets be ensured? In 2021, another dunk by Lebron James sold for US$210,000 (C$292,000). For example, NBA Top Shot completed more than three million transactions in 2021, the majority of which were microtransactions ranging from $10 to $50, while only 1% of transactions exceeded $1,500. Football clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid and FC Barcelona have launched their own fan tokens, which allow fans to buy a symbolic "share" in the club. These tokens also allow fans to participate in smaller decisions, such as choosing the team's uniform or selecting the songs played during match breaks. NBA Top Shot, meanwhile, has enabled NFTs representing sporting moments to be sold at astronomical prices, thereby capturing the interest of collectors and investors. These inequalities serve as a reminder that, despite their apparent accessibility, NFTs can exacerbate market dynamics that already exist in the world of art and physical collections. The spectacular success of NFTs in sports nevertheless has a downside. Cases of fraud, counterfeiting and market manipulation are on the rise. A recent example is the Eternal Beings collection, promoted by American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. Shortly after encouraging his millions of followers to invest, he deleted his posts, causing the value of the tokens to plummet. The phenomenon of wash trading, a practice that involves making artificial transactions to manipulate prices, is also a major problem. In 2021, a report by Chainalysis revealed that 110 wash traders made nearly $8.9 million in profits by manipulating the prices of their own NFTs. Although they are documented, these fraudulent practices operate in a regulatory gray area. In October 2023, the SREN law authorized the testing of games with monetizable digital items, including NFTs, for a period of three years. Impact Theory, a podcast studio, was fined for raising $30 million through unregistered NFT sales. In the European Union, regulators are also beginning to explore how to integrate these new assets into their financial oversight frameworks. In May 2023, the European Union adopted regulations on markets in crypto-assets (MiCA), establishing a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset issuers and related service providers. Although MiCA doesn't specifically target non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the regulation stipulates that issuing crypto-assets in large series or collections may be considered an indicator of fungibility, thereby making these assets subject to the provisions of MiCA. This approach aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure appropriate oversight of emerging NFT markets. NFTs in the sports industry undeniably represent a new frontier for clubs, fans and investors. However, increased regulation and enhanced security practices are necessary for this sector to reach its full maturity. At a time when speculation and fraud threaten user confidence, regulators must ensure that the promises of NFTs are fulfilled without giving in to abuses. By balancing innovation and stakeholder protection, NFTs in sports have the potential to generate substantial economic opportunities while transforming the sports ecosystem to make it more inclusive and interactive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Depot Shares Pop as ATM Operator Posts 19% Q1 Revenue Increase The jump reflected a shift to fair value accounting. Although Bitcoin Depot has kiosks in 48 U.S. states, the firm is trying to obtain a license to operate in the Empire State this year, CEO Brandon Mintz said on an earnings call. The state's population could support up to 3,000 kiosks over time, a shareholder presentation stated. “New York state remains one of the largest untapped markets for Bitcoin ECMs,” he said. The company that promises users can “get Bitcoin in a minute” supplies software for its machines that are purchased from another company. Since its establishment in 2016, the company says it has facilitated around $3 billion worth of transaction volume, through machines located in gas stations, convenience stores, and other brick-and-mortar settings. Based on current prices, the firm has a market capitalization of $44 million. Bitcoin Depot's first-quarter performance represents a bounceback from the previous quarter, in which the firm posted a year-over-year drop in revenue. Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $103,000, a 0.4% decrease over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) is among lawmakers that have called for Bitcoin ATM operators to “curb fraud against elderly Americans,” citing recent FBI statistics. In February, he unveiled a bill that would impose $2,000 daily transaction limits on new customers and require full refunds for transactions reported as fraudulent within 30 days. Criminals often impersonate tech support workers or government employees, the FBI found. Earlier this month, Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX), proposed putting them in federal buildings across the U.S. He wrote in a letter that “installations can serve as an educational resource for those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OG collector Pranksy is one of the most prolific figures in the NFT space, yet remains one of crypto's greatest mysteries, with his true identity still unknown.Starting with just $600 worth of ETH in 2017 (incredibly he's never had to buy any more ETH with fiat) Pranksy cut his teeth with the explosion of CryptoKitties and quickly built up a stack of ETH which he relentlessly poured back into the ecosystem, being dubbed the “King of the Mint” by the time NFT mania truly hit in 2020-21.A key figure in popularizing Bored Ape Yacht Club, some of his trades have become legendary.On September 4, 2021, he purchased a Zombie CryptoPunk #6275 for 1,000 ETH ($3.89M) and sold it later that same day for 1,320 ETH ($5.12mil) — a casual $1.23 million profit in 24 hours. But while few names in NFTs carry as much weight as his, ask him who Pranksy  really is and the answer might surprise you. “Pranksy now represents a wonderfully diverse team of people; however, ‘Pranksy' is still an individual voice, who runs his own social media, he just has help running NFTBoxes and our new shiny thing, the House of Pranksy.” Similar to the trajectory of other OG NFT collectors such as j1mmy.eth and Nate Alex, Pranksy first stumbled upon NFTs through CryptoKitties around the end of 2017. He had never even bought ETH at the time. “A friend told me via Slack that people were paying ridiculous amounts of money for pictures of cats on the internet, and you could breed those cats, the rest is history,” Pranksy says. Long before 2021-22 NFT mania, Pranksy was stacking NFTs and making a name for himself among a tight-knit group of collectors, artists and project founders through 2017-2020. I wanted to rebrand when minting my first piece of terrible artwork,” he says. One of Pranksy's most notable moments in his career as a top NFT whale started like any other mint. On 1 May 2021, he minted 1,250 Bored Apes in a few batches. His initial mint of 250 was followed with a tweet, “No horrible FOMO pricing strategy, each Ape is .08 ETH, + they look great.” Within a few more hours, Pranksy ran his total up to 1,250 total Apes. “It wasn't very different to many other mints, it was at a time when NFT projects didn't sell out in seconds with a huge waitlist for minting. He recalls interacting with his running mate, j1mmy.eth and BAYC, “Passed the profile picture test.” A single Ape could eventually net a holder close to $1mil from a mint cost of 0.08 ETH (~$220), if they held their original BAYC and sold their airdrops: BAKC (June '21), MAYC (Sep '21), ApeCoin (Mar '22), and Otherside Land (May '22). The eye-watering run-up of value for Bored Apes didn't happen immediately. For the first month, Apes were still sitting below a 1 ETH floor price, and Pranksy was still sending large quantities of his collection to friends. By the back half of 2021, Apes were becoming a cultural phenomenon and they were everywhere: Steph Curry, Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon, Madonna, Justin Bieber and many more. Pranksy ended up doing deals with some of the world's most famous people and sports stars, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Tinie Tempah to NBA star Josh Hart, who's currently playing in the NBA playoffs. “At the time, BAYC was just another NFT project. Tinie Tempah was also fun, we were looking at some creative collaboration options at one point, he is still repping his Ape today.” And any regrets about parting with so many Apes?“No ‘ragrets',” he says. While the magic of the early days of NBA Top Shot has fizzled out for many, Pranksy believes the platform and sports NFTs may still have their best days ahead of them yet. “During its alpha launch, I repeatedly stated publicly that NBA Top Shot would define NFTs, and its failure or success would drive the future of tokenized collectibles. Sorare, a fantasy football game that uses NFTs as digital trading cards, also captured his attention, and Pranksy is now a promotional partner for the project. Sorare couldn't be better placed to fit my interests. I don't believe another NFT project has found a better balance between utility and collectibles.” In 2021, Pranksy launched NFTBoxes, a curated experience designed to spotlight artists and make art collecting fun. It was inspired by the success of his previous NFT Advent Calendar. “The idea simply was to put quality NFT pieces together in a single monthly box from talented artists within the space. Art can be so exciting, but the art world can be closed and talent often gets pushed out of the spotlight. Now he's teasing House of Pranksy, a new project with different ambitions. “Unlike traditional NFT clubs that revolve around speculative value, House of Pranksy is being built around cultural permanence, knowledge, community and legacy.” Project updates will be on his personal X account. Unlocking Cultural Markets with Blockchain: Web3 Brands and the Decentralized Renaissance Story Protocol helps IP creators survive AI onslaught… and get paid in crypto I bought around $600 of ETH to buy and mint CryptoKitties. Before Pranksy it was Pranked, I wanted to rebrand when minting my first piece of terrible artwork. If you could only keep 3 NFTs forever, which ones would they be? What's your favorite 1 of 1 art piece that you own? What's an under-appreciated NFT project right now in your opinion? Whose NFT portfolio do you think has an awesome collection outside of yours? There are many individuals, I think anyone who has stuck around since 2017 deserves a mention. Where's your head currently at with the NFT space? A large majority of the “NFT space” have moved to memecoins, AI, or whatever else is on trend.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are experiencing spectacular growth thanks to the new opportunities they offer for interaction and monetization to fans, clubs and athletes in the sports industry. Platforms such as NBA Top Shot, which allows users to own key moments in basketball as NFTs, generated nearly $500 million in sales and had over 800,000 registered accounts a few years ago. The initial enthusiasm for NFTs quickly faded after scandals over speculation and fraud shook user confidence. For this sector to reach full maturity, there must be stricter regulation and enhanced security practices. If the sector wants to have sustainable growth, it must answer a crucial question: how can the healthy and secure development of these rapidly expanding assets be ensured? In 2021, another dunk by Lebron James sold for US$210,000 (C$292,000). For example, NBA Top Shot completed more than three million transactions in 2021, the majority of which were microtransactions ranging from $10 to $50, while only one per cent of transactions exceeded $1,500. Football clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid and FC Barcelona have launched their own fan tokens, which allow fans to buy a symbolic “share” in the club. These tokens also allow fans to participate in smaller decisions, such as choosing the team's uniform or selecting the songs played during match breaks. NBA Top Shot, meanwhile, has enabled NFTs representing sporting moments to be sold at astronomical prices, thereby capturing the interest of collectors and investors. These inequalities serve as a reminder that, despite their apparent accessibility, NFTs can exacerbate market dynamics that already exist in the world of art and physical collections. The spectacular success of NFTs in sports nevertheless has a downside. Cases of fraud, counterfeiting and market manipulation are on the rise. A recent example is the Eternal Beings collection, promoted by American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. Shortly after encouraging his millions of followers to invest, he deleted his posts, causing the value of the tokens to plummet. In 2021, a report by Chainalysis revealed that 110 wash traders made nearly $8.9 million in profits by manipulating the prices of their own NFTs. Although they are documented, these fraudulent practices operate in a regulatory grey area. In October 2023, the SREN law authorized the testing of games with monetizable digital items, including NFTs, for a period of three years. Impact Theory, a podcast studio, was fined for raising $30 million through unregistered NFT sales. In May 2023, the European Union adopted regulations on markets in crypto-assets (MiCA), establishing a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-asset issuers and related service providers. Although MiCA doesn't specifically target non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the regulation stipulates that issuing crypto-assets in large series or collections may be considered an indicator of fungibility, thereby making these assets subject to the provisions of MiCA. This approach aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure appropriate oversight of emerging NFT markets. NFTs in the sports industry undeniably represent a new frontier for clubs, fans and investors. However, increased regulation and enhanced security practices are necessary for this sector to reach its full maturity.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Crypto company Coinbase reported that some contractors and employees based outside the U.S. stole the data of some of its customers, including names, addresses, and emails, for hackers who used them to trick its customers into moving their funds to accounts linked to the attackers. Customers who lost money also need not worry, as the company said it will reimburse them. The company received an email from the threat actor last May, saying that they had information on customer accounts and internal documents, and were asking for a $20 million ransom. “Instead of funding criminal activity, we have investigated the incident, reinforced our controls, and will reimburse customers impacted by this incident,” Coinbase said. If you receive this call, hang up the phone. It also reiterated that “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed, and Coinbase Prime accounts are untouched.” The $400 million loss is also relatively small compared to the $328 billion worth of assets it holds and its more than $67 billion market capitalization. Despite not being widely used for day-to-day transactions, losses from blockchain hacks have reached over $2.2 billion in 2024. Earlier this year, ByBit, another cryptocurrency exchange platform, fell victim to a $1.5 billion hack — the largest crypto heist in recorded history — which the FBI suspects was the work of North Korean hackers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins aren't far from becoming mainstream, per Deutsche Bank. The most prominent stablecoin is Tether, with an overall market capitalization of around $150 billion, per CoinMarketCap, but dozens of others also exist. Deutsche Bank said the sector has a market capitalization of $246 billion. The difference between stablecoins and regular cryptocurrencies is that stablecoins are pegged to other assets, often commonly used and relatively secure ones, including safe havens like the US dollar or gold. Senate Democrats have rallied against the GENIUS Act over concerns about President Donald Trump and his family's links to the industry. Both Trump and his wife Melania have cryptocurrencies bearing their names, which launched soon after he became president. The market capitalization of stablecoins has soared from $20 billion in 2020 to its current level, a more than 1200% surge. "They now power over two-thirds of crypto-trading," the analysts said. Deutsche Bank said $99 billion in US Treasury bills are held in Tether, making it one of the top stores of US government debt worldwide. Deutsche Bank's analysts predict that mainstream adoption of stablecoins will lead to overall increased demand for US Treasurys. "US regulation will bring clarity, enabling mainstream use cases and deeper financial integration."

Altcoins slump over 5% as crypto market cools following last week's macro-driven rally. Bitcoin whales accumulate 83K BTC amid profit-taking, while traders eye Coinbase's S&P 500 inclusion for the next catalyst. Major altcoins like Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana have dropped over 5% in the past 24 hours as investors chose to lock in recent gains. The broader sentiment remains cautious as traders await fresh catalysts. The latest dip in prices comes after a macro-driven rally last week that pushed Bitcoin to nearly $104,000 and Ethereum to $2,700. But both hit resistance at key levels, prompting traders to step back. Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin saw notable declines, following the lead of large-cap assets as momentum slowed. According to FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, Bitcoin is struggling to break past its December-January highs, while Ethereum is showing signs of a possible correction toward $2,400 after gaining 55% in just a week. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 71 from 74, a level that typically signals excessive bullishness and potential overbought conditions. Analysts suggest the market may need to cool down before making the next move, especially after last week's bullish run was largely driven by external events. The rally had been sparked by a combination of lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data, strong earnings from China's tech sector, and a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade relations. While those factors gave markets a boost, crypto prices have now begun to stabilize as traders reassess risk. Meanwhile, the smallest retail holders (holding <0.1 BTC) have dumped 387 BTC in the same time period.For both tiers, these are significant movements relative to… pic.twitter.com/Xg5FmF57GQ Despite the pullback, Bitcoin whales and sharks are still accumulating. According to Santiment, Bitcoin's largest holders, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have accumulated over 83,000 BTC in the past month, signaling strong confidence in further upside. In contrast, small retail investors holding less than 0.1 BTC have offloaded 387 BTC, likely locking in profits amid fears of a market top. Analysts at QCP Capital believe the move could act as a short-term catalyst for the crypto sector, potentially attracting over $9 billion in passive fund flows. For now, though, the market is catching its breath. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Yes, whales added 83K BTC in a month, showing strong confidence despite recent market pullback.</p>

US crypto investors contributed millions of dollars to Trump's election victory and did not conceal lingering contempt for Biden at Consensus

“Across the board, it's been a very encouraging three months,” said Lewis Cohen, a lawyer specialising in digital assets with the New York firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

Cohen was speaking at Consensus, the world's longest-running crypto conference, hosted this year in Canada's largest city, Toronto.

Trump's son Eric, who is promoting his own crypto business, is expected to address the conference on Thursday amid increasing questions about potential conflict of interest with his father in the White House.

Eric Trump is deeply involved in the crypto industry through direct business ventures, notably as a co-founder and executive at American Bitcoin, as well as through family-backed projects like World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP meme coin.

The digital currency saw a spike in value when it announced that its top holders would be invited to a dinner with the president, set to take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club near Washington.</p>
