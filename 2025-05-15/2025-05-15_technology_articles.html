                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coders were hit hardest among Microsoft's 2,000-person layoff in its home state of Washington, Bloomberg reports. To be fair, coders are a big chunk of Microsoft's workforce, although it doesn't disclose the exact proportion. The cuts are part of recent layoffs at Microsoft affecting about 6,000 people. Still, these cuts come after CEO Satya Nadella said last month that up to 30% of the company's code was now written by AI. Microsoft has said the layoffs are aimed at reducing management layers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The baby who was treated, Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr., suffers from a rare metabolic condition caused by a particularly unusual gene misspelling. Researchers say their attempt to correct the error demonstrates the high level of precision new types of gene editors offer. “I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is the future of medicine,” says Kiran Musunuru, an expert in gene editing at the University of Pennsylvania whose team designed the drug. “My hope is that someday no rare disease patients will die prematurely from misspellings in their genes, because we'll be able to correct them.” The project also highlights what some experts are calling a growing crisis in gene-editing technology. That's because even though the technology could cure thousands of genetic conditions, most are so rare that companies could never recoup the costs of developing a treatment for them. “In reality, this drug will probably never be used again,” says Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a physician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who treats metabolic diseases in children and who led the overall effort to treat the child. Musunuru says he cannot estimate how much it had cost in time and effort. Eventually, he says, the cost of custom gene-editing treatments might be similar to that of liver transplants, which is around $800,000, not including lifelong medical care and drugs. In KJ's case, gene sequencing showed that the cause was a misspelled letter in the gene CPS1 that stopped it from making a vital enzyme. The researchers approached KJ's parents, Nicole and Kyle Muldoon, with the idea of using gene editing to try to correct their baby's DNA. After they agreed, a race ensued to design the editing drug, test it in animals, and get permission from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat KJ in a one-off experiment. They can't yet determine exactly how well the gene editor worked because they don't want to take a liver biopsy, which would be needed to check if KJ's genes have really been corrected. But Ahrens-Nicklas says that because the child is “growing and thriving,” she thinks the editing has been at least partly successful and that he may now have “a milder form of this horrific disease.” Currently, this would only work for liver diseases, for which it's easier to deliver gene-editing instructions, but eventually it might also become a possible approach for treating brain diseases and conditions like muscular dystrophy. So far, biotechnology companies testing gene editing are working only on fairly common gene conditions, like sickle cell disease, leaving hundreds of ultra-rare conditions aside. One-off treatments, like the one helping KJ, are too expensive to create and get approved without some way to recoup the costs. The apparent success in treating KJ, however, is making it even more urgent to figure out a way forward. Researchers acknowledge that they don't yet know how to scale up personalized treatment, although Musunuru says initial steps to standardize the process are underway at his university and in Europe. Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Francisco-based Cognichip is working to build a physics-informed foundational AI model that can be used by semiconductor companies to speed up the development process of new chips. The company is calling this approach “artificial chip intelligence” and hopes it can help speed up chip production times by 50% and reduce the associated costs as well. Aalaei told TechCrunch that his company's origin story begins back in 2015. At the time, Aalaei was a member of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which would often meet to talk about what was ailing their industry. “I essentially warned the other CEOs that this cannot be good for us,” Aalaei said. “It cannot be good for the semiconductor industry in America, and that what we needed to do is to fundamentally change things about it. If that trend continues, then we're going to lose our competitiveness. Cognichip has been operating in stealth ever since and has amassed a team of AI experts from places like Stanford, Google, and MIT to start building. “When we get to that point, this artificial chip intelligence, we will be building a system that can actually act like an expert engineer,” Aalaei said. “Once we achieve that vision, then you can actually get the same work done with a fraction of the people and in much, much shorter time.” Cognichip is now emerging from stealth with $33 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Lux Capital and Mayfield with participation from FPV and Candou Ventures. Aalaei said that he hopes Cognichip will also be able to help democratize access to building chips so that more semiconductor companies can get started and land investment. All of this will depend on when, or if, the company can reach artificial chip intelligence. “What we're doing is not some incremental change,” Aalaei said. We're trying to set a new goal for our industry and bring some major change.” Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292.

In addition, you can now get descriptions and ask questions about your whole phone screen. Google also announced today that it's updating Expressive Captions, Android's real-time captions feature that uses AI to capture what someone says, and how they say it. Google says it's aware that one of the ways people express themselves is by dragging out the sound of their words, which is why it has developed a new duration feature on Expressive Captions. Now, you'll know if a sports announcer is calling out an “amaaazing shot” or when someone isn't simply saying “no” but “nooooo.” You'll also start to see new labels for sounds, such as when a person is whistling or clearing their throat. Google is also making it easier to access PDFs on Chrome. Now, Chrome automatically recognizes these types of PDFs, allowing you to highlight, copy, and search for text like any other page and use your screen reader to read them.

TechPowerUp also said that the screen features an ARGB backglow, which softly illuminates the rest of your motherboard to showcase each and every component. The Vortex View is compatible with both AMD and Intel processors, although Antec did not say which generations are supported. The company said that it will also be compatible with upcoming product releases, so we anticipate an Antec ecosystem of cases, power supplies, coolers, and more in the near future. “The Vortex View is a natural evolution of what performance cooling should be,” said Antec CEO Frank Lee. “With a 360-degree free-rotational five-inch IPS display powered via USB 3.0, it delivers real-time system insight with total flexibility, without compromising on thermal efficiency. It's also the first AIO to launch with our revamped iUnity platform, enabling deeper customization and seamless future integration across Antec products. This cooler stays true to our core principle: prioritizing performance first, then layering in meaningful functionality.” Antec put a high-efficiency PWM pump on the Vortex View, allowing it to vary the pump speed as needed, based on your computer's power load and temperature. It also reduced noise levels, and when paired with Antec's ARGB fans that prioritize airflow and silence, you don't have to worry about your gaming PC sounding like a drone taking off. The company also used premium braided tubing, ensuring that it will last longer and prevent any leaks that could damage your computer. Hopefully, Antec will give PC builders those options, especially as the Vortex and Vortex Lum AIO coolers are available in those sizes. The company will show off its latest AIO cooler at the upcoming Computex 2025 in Taiwan, where we expect to see its other products. Hopefully, we can get a chance to test out the Vortex View to see how it stacks up against the best AIO coolers of 2025. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Right now, AMD's Instinct MI300-series accelerators are aimed at both AI and HPC, which makes them universal but lowers maximum performance for both types of workloads. Starting from its next-generation Instinct MI400-series, AMD will offer distinct processors for AI and supercomputers in a bid to maximize performance for each workload, according to SemiAnalysis. However, there might be a problem with the scalability of these compute GPUs. Both processors will rely on subsets of the CDNA Next architecture, but will be tailored for low-precision AI compute (FP4, FP8, BF16) or high-precision HPC compute (FP32, FP64). In addition to workload optimizations, AMD's Instinct MI400-series accelerators will also feature not only Infinity Fabric but also UALink interconnections, which will make them some of the first AI and HPC GPUs to feature UALink, a technology designed to challenge NVLink. Support for UALink will be limited in 2026 due to the absence of switching silicon from external vendors, including Astera Labs, Auradine, Enfabrica, and XConn. As a result, the Instinct MI430X will only be usable in small configurations in topologies like mesh or torus, as there will be no UALink switches next year. AMD does not develop its own UALink switches and therefore relies entirely on partners, which may not be ready in the second half of next year. According to SemiAnalysis, chipmakers like Broadcom view the market for such switches as too small and are not assigning enough engineering resources to accelerate timelines. By contrast, networking initiatives under the Ultra Ethernet Consortium are advancing more quickly and already have compatible hardware available commercially. In a bid to compete against Nvidia with its own rack-scale solutions, AMD intends to offer systems called Instinct MI450X IF64 and MI450X IF128 that will rely on the Infinity Fabric technology, possibly over Ethernet. SemiAnalysis believes that such solutions could be competitive with Nvidia's VR200 NVL144 platforms in the second half of 2026, though it remains to be seen how these systems will stack up.

Swedish PC hardware mainstay Fractal makes some great cases – in fact, you'll find three of them currently on our Best PC Cases list. Other interesting features and design choices include robust cable routing with dual-channel removable plastic cable brackets, and RGB fans (on some models) that plug into an included magnetic hub via a single cable. I was, though, able to take several photos, and the cases definitely have some interesting features. Some of those choices, though, lead to the frame feeling a little flimsy. The 3 XL also has mounting points for a side-mounted radiator or three more fans (behind a cover in the image above). From the back, you can see the extensive cable routing options, with three removable plastic cable brackets to keep a plethora of wires in check. Also shown here is the Adjust Pro Hub, which has what looks like four USB-C ports (two occupied out of the box), along with its PWM and USB connector. It's a PWM and RGB hub that works with Fractal's Momentum RGB fans, which combine both PRM signals and lighting controls in a single cable that terminates in a plug that's physically identical to USB-C (but is not actually USB-C). Combining multiple cables into one is nice for simplified building and wire hiding, but of course, this locks you into using Fractal's newer fans if you want to use the hub.Fractal is touting the ability to change lighting and fan speed settings through a web app, with all the settings actually stored in the hub itself. This is an interesting move similar to what we've seen on keyboards that support VIA or Keychron's Launcher. You just have to hope Fractal keeps hostingits app for as long as you keep using your case – I don't see that as a huge concern (Fractal has been around since 2007), but some might prefer software you can download and run. Both cases feature a scooped-out area behind the bottom intake fan that is designed to angle airflow up toward the graphics card. This is similar to designs we've seen from NZXT and others. But where it's typically a flat, angled slope, Fractal has used molded plastic to round out the shape in a way that, if nothing else, feels more in line with Scandinavian design. The cases also feature some interesting elements designed to make component installation easier. Likewise, the entire front fan mount section (and fans, if installed) can swing out on hinges. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While these are nice enough features, making these structural parts easy to remove results in the steel frame not feeling as rigid as I'd expect from Fractal (or any company making a case in this price range). I don't think it is a major drawback for most people. Just know this case does have some noticeable flex. Top port selection is pretty typical, with two USB-A ports, a USB-C (20 Gbps if your board has the appropriate header), power button, and a headphone / mic combo jack. Fractal will offer the Meshify 3 and 3 XL in white or black, and there doesn't seem to be a price premium for the lighter shade. There are, though, plenty of options for both cases: You can choose a glass side or metal (again, for the same price) on the non-RGB models. Still, I try to never knock a company for giving us options. And at $169 sans RGB, the Meshify 3XL in particular looks like a nice airflow-focused option for big builds. It feels like this case is big enough to handle more than two 3.5-inch hard drives. Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Although the Corsair Vengeance a7500 is priced out of the mainstream realm, its premium hardware and high-flying gaming performance make it a real standout. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. When it comes to the best gaming PCs available for consumers, there's an embarrassment of riches covering a wide variety of price points. Today, we have the Corsair Vengeance a7500, which includes plenty of high-end hardware to satisfy demanding gamers. The system is loaded to the gills with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, 32GB of DDR5 memory, a 1TB PCIE 5.0 SSD, a Corsair Nautilus 240mm water cooling unit, and an attractive Corsair 3500X mid-tower case. And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that the Vengeance a7500 is rocking a Blackwell-based GPU, in this case, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. 5 Gbps Ethernet (Realtek 8126VB), Wi-Fi 7 (Qualcomm FastConnect 7800), Bluetooth 5.4 The side panels, in particular, are worth mentioning, as they feature a tool-less design. It's simple, effective, and highly preferable to dealing with Phillips or thumb screws. The top panel is also fully ventilated and occupied by two additional 120mm ARGB cooling fans. The top, bottom, and right side panels have removable mesh dust filters installed. But the RGB light show doesn't end there: the two DDR5-6400 modules also incorporate RGB into their heat spreaders, the AIO liquid cooler features an RGB element, and the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC 16G graphics card has an RGB-lit Gigabyte logo. Once you get past the visual treats, you'll notice that the top of the chassis contains a power button, reset button, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a 3.5 mm headphone/mic combo jack. Corsair fitted our Vengeance a7500 with an MSI Pro X870-P Wi-Fi motherboard, which supports AM5 chips from AMD's Ryzen 7000, 8000, and 9000 series (our review unit had a Ryzen 7 9800X3D installed). There is also a 5 GbE LAN port, three audio connectors, two ports for connecting the included antenna for the onboard Wi-Fi 7 adapter, along with clear CMOS and flash BIOS buttons. The Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming OC graphics card has three DisplayPort 2.1b ports and one HDMI 2.1b port. There are three onboard M.2 slots, with M.2_1 supporting up to PCIe 5.0 x4 (our review unit's M.2_1 slot was populated by a Corsair MP700 Elite 1TB PCIe 5.0 SSD. There are four DDR5 memory slots on the MSI Pro X870-P Wi-Fi motherboard, two of which were filled with 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6400 modules on our review unit. If you need to add internal storage beyond what the three M.2 slots can offer, a removable drive plate can accommodate up to two HDDs and two additional SSDs simultaneously. The Vengeance a7500 packs some pretty impressive hardware, starting with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which ranks as one of our best CPUs for gaming. That processor is backed by 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory, and is paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card. We don't have a full assortment of Blackwell-equipped gaming desktops in our test database yet, but we do have the Alienware Area-51 (Core Ultra 9 285K, RTX 5090, and a far more expensive $5,759.99) for comparison. We also used the Vengeance i7600 (Core Ultra 7 265K, RTX 4070 Super) to compare Blackwell against a previous-generation GPU. With a sticker price well north of $2,000, I expected great performance from the Vengeance a7500 and wasn't disappointed. I've been spending a lot of time recently playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and I played the game on my 240 Hz DQHD (5120 x 1440) gaming monitor. With all of the detail settings cranked up, I saw performance of around 100 to 120 frames per second (FPS). Switching gears to our usual battery of gaming tests, I started with the Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest setting). Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings) is a CPU-intensive game, and the Vengeance a7500 showed its gaming prowess over the two Intel-based competitors assembled. Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings) has been a thorn in the side for many of the Blackwell-equipped gaming systems we've tested, especially at 1080p. Our final gaming benchmark is Borderlands 3 (Badass setting), another CPU-heavy game. Metro Exodus remains our go-to for stress testing, and through a 15-loop marathon, the Vengeance a7500 averaged 145.96 FPS. As for the RTX 5070 Ti, its maximum GPU clock was 2,735 MHz at an average temperature of 57.75 C. The Vengeance a7500 is a speedy performer in the productivity department, thanks to its Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, 32GB of DDR5 memory, and a speedy 1TB PCIe 5.0 SSD. Thanks to its PCIe 5.0 SSD, the Vengeance a7500 led its competitors significantly on our file transfer test (which involves transferring 25GB of mixed media files). We transcode a 4K video file to 1080p during this test, and the Vengeance a7500 completed the task in just over three minutes. However, the Vengeance i7600 and Area-51 finished in under two minutes. The app, as its name implies, allows you to view system information, run stress tests, and perform checkup utilities on your desktop. The company's oft-maligned iCUE app is not installed from the factory, although I chose to install it on my own. Once installed, iCUE gives you handy readouts of critical temperatures for your CPU and GPU. The Vengeance a7500 comes with a two-year manufacturer's warranty. That's longer than the one year you get on many prebuilt machines. The Vengeance a7500 is available in several configurations, direct from Corsair. If you want to branch out with a Radeon RX 9700XT processor instead of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Best Buy offers the Vengeance a7500 for $3,199.99. Best Buy also offers a Call of Duty Warzone Edition of the Vengeance a7500 with a Radeon 9070 XT GPU, and 2TB SSD for $3,399.99. In addition, there's another Call of Duty Warzone Edition with a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and 2TB SSD for $3,399.99. Just for comparison, if you were to purchase all the components separately for the a7500 and put it together yourself, it would cost $2,533.89. Corsair continues to build high-quality, high-performance gaming desktops. The Vengeance a7500 is not only a great-looking rig with its generous use of tempered glass and copious amounts of RGB fans, but it also has plenty of ventilation to keep the internals cool under load. Corsair's use of a Ryzen 7 9800X3D proved to be the perfect match for the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards. Given that this is a Corsair rig, it's no surprise that the company tossed in some of its excellent hardware as well, including its branded 850W 80+ Gold PSU, Vengeance DDR5 memory, a super quick PCIe 5.0 SSD, a Nautilus liquid cooling system, and a two-year factory warranty. When you add it all up, you have a highly capable, albeit slightly pricey, gaming desktop that can handle your current and future gaming needs. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. You could even throw in a signature for an extra dose of personalization. That kind of playful nature remains elusive in the smartphone world, but there are glimpses thanks to companies like Nothing and Motorola. Motorola could have taken the Samsung approach and kept the ordinary glass-slab design we're used to for its folding phones, but no. The Razr Ultra lets you choose between Alcantara, wood, leather-inspired, and satin-inspired designs. The base Razr comes in bright, punchy colors, with acetate, nylon, or leather-inspired finishes. I have the Pantone Spring Bud Razr, a leather-inspired mint green color—my wife's eyes lit up when she saw it (and asked if she could take a bite, naturally). Even my hard-to-impress dad stoically said, “It's a nice color.” I love the FSC-certified Pantone Mountain Trail on the Razr Ultra even more, which is a real wood back that exudes class. The original Moto X had a wood back, too. They might not be customizable, but these Razrs look great, feel great, and there's nothing that looks like 'em. The Razr 2025 lineup is not wholly different from last year's models. Its specs are identical, which is likely why Motorola didn't bother sending a review unit. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Adding a third entry into the Razr lineup adds unnecessary complexity, so I'm adding a spec table here to help you make sense of these devices. It also has better cameras and is the only one that offers Dolby Vision video recording for richer colors in your footage. Performance is excellent, though this is more meaningful on the base Razr model, which has given me some choppy performance in prior models. You might still see some stutters here and there on the $700 phone, but it's sparse, and overall, I've been quite happy with it. They get plenty bright, and the high refresh rates make everything appear fluid. The battery capacities between the Razr Ultra and Razr aren't too different, and my results were unsurprisingly similar. These phones lasted me a full day with 25 to 30 percent remaining by bedtime with average use. If your screen time extends past five or six hours, you'll more than likely need to recharge the phone in the middle of the day (wired or wirelessly). All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. One improvement I'd like to see in future versions (which I have mentioned before) revolves around opening the phone. It might just be my short fingernails and thick thumbs, but it's a small struggle to wedge a finger into the gap one-handed and unfold the Razr. Thankfully, you can make the external displays even more functional without constantly opening the phone, with new widget panels for glanceable information. There's less of a crease on the interior display, though it's still noticeable when viewed at an angle, and you can feel it when your finger glides over, but I've never had a problem with it. It bears repeating, but the number one benefit of a folding flip phone is that it's a fantastically tiny phone. I love that I can grip the whole thing with my palm and still interact with it, and then get the benefits of a full-size smartphone screen when I need it. I'll take this over an ultra-thin and ultra-light smartphone any day. You'll see richer details, better exposure, and nicer skin tones on the Ultra, whereas the Razr often has more noise and generally looks a smidge more processed. Low-light photos still require you to be very still, even on the Ultra, but they deliver solid photos that are sharp and colorful. What's most bizarre is the camera app itself. Motorola still hasn't figured out a way to enable Night mode automatically when it detects you're shooting in low light, a staple feature on most phones. Most people aren't going to do that. (It also still doesn't support Night mode for selfies, though it relies on flashing the screen to compensate.) All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Even stranger is that the new Group Shot feature on the Ultra, which selects the best frame so that no one is blinking in group photos, is a dedicated mode hidden in the same “More” tab. Google has a similar feature called Best Take on its Pixel phones, but it's a post-capture feature, so you can fix a photo quickly if you notice someone blinked. If you film videos a lot with your phone, the Ultra offers a big jump in video quality over the Razr. The Ultra has Dolby Vision video capture, though you need to manually enable it (again, why?). The Ultra's footage was sharper, smoother, more color-accurate, and didn't blow out in high-contrast scenes, whereas the Razr had super-grainy clips, especially in low light. Motorola spent a lot of time talking up the AI features in its phones during the launch. None made a meaningful difference in my life, except for Pay Attention—once enabled, it kickstarts a recording session with real-time transcription, and offers a summary after the recording is over. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Motorola's Catch Me Up AI notification summaries proved useless when half of my notifications are just people sending me Instagram Reels to watch. When you do have normal notifications, it does a decent job of summarizing everything, though I don't see how the summary is that much faster than reading the source directly. Then there's Remember This, which feels a little clunky. This feature requires a little re-wiring of how you use your phone, because asking an AI assistant to remember something is not something I've done before. Having just reviewed the Minimal Phone, I took two pictures of it sitting on my desk with the Razr Ultra, and asked Moto AI to remember each. With the first shot, I didn't add any supplementary information, and with the second, I wrote in that it was the “Minimal Phone.” Later, when I asked Moto AI what phone I took a picture of, it said I took a picture of the Unihertz Jelly Titan (which I do not own), and then it said it didn't know what model the phone in the second picture was, even though I provided a name. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. You'll see a lot of marketing for these AI features, but they're not the reasons to buy the Razr or Razr Ultra. Buy them if you want a small and gorgeous phone—a device with real character that's not just another glass slab. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years after it was first announced, and following two missed launch promises, with no comment from Apple on when it would actually show up, CarPlay 2 will finally be available in a matter of weeks. Aston Martin has announced it will be the first car manufacturer to actually deliver Apple's long-awaited next-gen in-car experience, with any of its vehicles ordered in the US or Canada from today shipping with CarPlay Ultra installed as standard. Current cars that meet this criteria include the Aston Martin DBX SUV, alongside its core sports car models—Vanquish, Vantage, and DB12. This update will also be for US and Canadian owners only for now, but a full market rollout is expected over the next 12 months. Drivers can finally have their iPhone nav directions appear in front of them as the new CarPlay interface stretches across multiple screens. Things like tire pressure monitors and air-con controls will also at last be able to sit within the CarPlay interface. Siri will again be on hand when you prefer to bark commands at a voice assistant. However, how next-generation Siri will precisely work in CarPlay Ultra, as Apple's AI tech develops, remains unclear—but from launch, essentially, the tech mirrors the phone experience. That means if you have ChatGPT-powered Apple Intelligence enabled on your iPhone, the in-car UI will ask for a voice command to shunt a query to Open AI's model or stick with on-device Siri. Conversely, in what could be seen as unfortunate timing for Apple, Google beat the news of CarPlay Ultra to the punch with the announcement of Gemini for cars just a few days ago—and we've already got more detail on how Gemini will enhance the driving experience than we have on Siri at this point. This includes helping you craft text messages on the go, find good restaurants en route, and even brainstorm on the way to a meeting. Gemini will roll out to Android Auto cars over the next few months, likely appearing in myriad car brands well before CarPlay Ultra. As for CarPlay Ultra, it had been confirmed a while ago that Aston Martin would be one of the first manufacturers to feature Apple's next-gen experience, with Porsche expected to follow. Mercedes-Benz, however, has remarked that handing over control of its cockpit head unit to someone else “was a no.” Big Story: The worm that no computer scientist can crack Yuval Noah Harari: “Prepare to share the planet with AI superintelligence” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

As air pollution increases in metropolitan areas and suburbs, having the ability to breathe clean air within the home has never been more crucial. Invisible pollutants, allergens, and dust can affect your health and possibly causing a myriad of health problems long term. One of the simplest and most effective things you can do to protect yourself and your family is to purchase a good air purifier. The EcoSelf air purifier is available on Amazon at an all-time low price of just $54, which is a staggering 73% lower than its original price of $199. Because of its 360° airflow technology, it can efficiently purify an area up to 1,076 square feet which makes it ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, offices, and even open spaces. The device circulates and refreshes the air five times per hour in a typical 215 square foot room so that you're always breathing air that's as clean as possible. What's very important when you're comparing air purifiers is the presence of a HEPA filtration system: This advanced three-stage filter can capture 99.97% of particles in the air down to 0.3 microns such as dust, pet dander, pollen, smoke, and other common household pollutants. For allergy sufferers or those who are concerned about indoor air quality, this level of filtration can be a significant difference in comfort and health on a daily basis. Performance is supplemented by the unit's brushless motor and larger filter which together improve purification performance by 50% compared to standard models. The other features, such as adjustable fan speed, timer functions, child lock feature, and filter replacement notification. If you're looking to improve the environment in your home and maintain your health, make sure you get such an air purifier. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Often considered a precursor to blockbuster products like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, liraglutide is becoming the new darling of online clinics offering prescription weight loss and diabetes meds—despite its relative old age. But it doesn't have the same name recognition or popularity as the newer GLP-1 drugs for a very simple reason: It doesn't work as well, can cause more severe side effects, and patients have to inject it daily rather than weekly. The FDA determined earlier this year that patented medications like Zepound and Ozempic were no longer in shortage, ending provisions that allowed online clinics to sell off-brand, compounded versions of the drugs. Leading telehealth company Hims added generic liraglutide to its lineup last month, joining over a dozen competitors already offering the product in compounded, generic, or name-brand forms. Large compounding pharmacies, like Florida-based Olympia Pharmaceuticals, are already pivoting to producing the medication, expecting that demand will rise. “We've signed some pretty large contracts for liraglutide,” says chief financial officer Joshua Fritzler. Fritzler says Olympia plans to begin ramping up production this summer. Compounding pharmacies and telehealth startups flourished selling these alternative GLP-1 products online, attracting millions of customers who couldn't afford or were unwilling to pay higher prices for the name-brand medications, which are frequently not covered by insurance. The FDA's grace period for manufacturers to stop producing and selling compounded tirzepatide is over, and the cut-off date for semaglutide is May 22. Liraglutide, though, has been in shortage since April 2023, so the compounders are free to keep making it. Some telehealth companies are continuing to offer compounded medications they say aren't technically direct copies of patented drugs because they come in customized doses or with added vitamins. Eli Lilly has already sued some of them, alleging that these versions are illegal. Other telehealth firms and compounders are playing it safe, ceasing sales altogether. Liraglutide is especially appealing for these companies, since it's the closest thing they can safely produce and sell that still qualifies as a kind of Ozempic dupe. Some are even marketing it as a substitute for other drugs. Doctors tell WIRED that prospective patients should carefully assess whether liraglutide is really an appropriate alternative for them. While many people will likely respond positively to the medication, data suggests that tirzepatide and semaglutide are superior drugs for most patients. In clinical trials and other studies, those drugs outperform liraglutide, producing substantially more weight loss while causing fewer side effects. “It is better than nothing, but expectations should be held in check,” says Justin Ryder, a pediatric obesity expert at Northwestern University and vice chair of research in the surgery department at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. “People should do the math,” suggests obesity medicine specialist Angela Fitch. While the liraglutide sold by online clinics may initially appear to be cheaper than newer generations of drugs, the savings might not be so clear-cut in reality. The fact that liraglutide is prescribed to be taken daily rather than weekly means larger doses may be required to trigger comparable weight loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meet Mosura fentoni—a three-eyed, clawed, and flappy-limbed predator about the size of your finger, recently identified from Canada's famed Burgess Shale. Like its cousins, Mosura had a similar feeding disk and paddle-like limbs for swimming. “As much as we learn about radiodonts, there always seems to be something new and surprising about this group around the corner,” said study lead author Joe Moysiuk, curator at the Manitoba Museum, in an email to Gizmodo. “The ‘abdomen' in Mosura is different in that its segments are small and they have only tiny flaps that would have been basically useless for propulsion.” The researchers aren't totally sure why Mosura needed this extra breathing real estate, but it could be related to how or where it lived—maybe hanging out in low-oxygen environments in the lively Cambrian seas, or leading an especially active lifestyle. But despite its nickname, Mosura is only distantly related to moths. Mosura is part of a much more ancient lineage of arthropods—and though the radiodonts are long-gone, their remarkable preservation in the Burgess Shale is routinely yielding new species to science. Beyond its sci-fi looks, Mosura is also offering rare glimpses of internal anatomy from half a billion years ago. Some of the 61 fossils of the creature studied show preserved nerve tissue, eye structures, a digestive tract, and even reflective patches representing an open circulatory system—essentially a heart pumping blood into internal cavities called lacunae. Moysiuk has recently unearthed a couple of other creatures from the Cambrian Explosion, including Titanokorys gainesi in 2021 and Cambroraster falcatus, named for the Millennium Falcon, in 2019. “So many science fiction creatures have been inspired by living organisms,” Moysiuk said. “It seems only natural that scientists should take some inspiration in return.” “There are loads of other possible inspirations for species names, but I do think there's a lot of potential with the ‘Tremors' franchise,” Moysiuk added. “The giant worms in that series are supposed to be relicts of the Precambrian, and although that makes no sense scientifically, it could make for a fun reference.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. Fossilized footprints from Australia are forcing paleontologists to rethink the tetrapod family tree. CT scans, UV light, and careful prep work uncovered feathers that may have given the ancient dinosaur liftoff. More than half of the world's scientifically useful T. rexes are in the hands of private or commercial owners, and not accessible to scientists, according to research.
