                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox is returning to acting with a major guest-starring role on the upcoming third season of Apple TV+'s hit comedy series Shrinking, toplined by Jason Segel and Harrison Ford. Details around the role are being kept under wraps but it may be connected to the character arc of Ford's therapist Paul Rhoades. It was revealed at the end of Season 1 that Paul has Parkinson's, a disease Fox has been battling for three and a half decades. This marks a reunion for Fox and Shrinking co-creator/executive producer Bill Lawrence. Fox headlined Lawrence's first series as a creator, Spin City, for four seasons before leaving when his symptoms became more serious. The ABC comedy landed Fox his fifth Emmy award; he had won four for Family Ties.

Maika Monroe is replacing Margaret Qualley in an adaptation of the novel thriller “Victorian Psycho.” Qualley parted ways with “Victorian Psycho” mere weeks before filming was set to start in February. A24, which also boarded the project in its early days of development, has also quietly exited the feature and hasn't been attached for a while, a source confirmed to IndieWire. With Monroe attached, “Victorian Psycho” will again be shopped at the Cannes market. Related Stories Mel Gibson's ‘Passion of the Christ' Follow-Up Lands at Lionsgate Logging Trucks, Swimming Pools, and Bathtubs, Oh My! “Victorian Psycho” is set in 1858 and story centers on Winifred Notty, a governess hiding her psychopathic tendencies as she works at a remote gothic manor. Sébastien Raybaud is producing in association with Anonymous Content. Nick Shumaker, Bard Dorros, and Virginia Feito will executive produce. “Maika's intense screen presence has resonated with me over and over again throughout her history of complex performances,” director Wigon said in a press statement. Qualley told IndieWire in late January 2025 that she was undergoing extensive prep work to play a governess who is taking care of children in a remote gothic manor while hiding her psychopathic tendencies. “I've never done a British accent before, so that's terrifying,” Qualley said at the time. I read this book on the Victorian life and it was really interesting. It's just kind of amazing how much we've evolved in such a short time period.” She added, “And I've been wearing a corset around the house to get comfortable with that. As for the scheduling conflict, it is unclear which project made Qualley drop out of “Victorian Psycho.” Qualley has a full slate of films in the works including Ethan Coen's “Honey Don't!” She also recently appeared in Richard Linklater's Lorenz Hart biopic “Blue Moon,” which debuted at Berlin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longlegs and It Follows star Maika Monroe has replaced Margaret Qualley in psychological horror-thriller, Victorian Psycho, we can reveal, with Anton continuing to sell at the Cannes market. Her responsibilities include teaching the children table manners and educating them about their family's history, all whilst hiding her psychopathic tendencies. As Winifred assimilates into life at Ensor House, staff members begin to inexplicably disappear, and the owners of the estate begin to wonder if there is something amiss about their new governess. Buyer Aura Entertainment Makes Dave Bautista Action Movie 'Trap House' First Release, Plans Theatrical Launch In November -- Cannes Market Cannes Film Festival 2025: Read All Of Deadline's Movie Reviews As previously announced, Thomasin McKenzie (Last Night in Soho) is also cast. Zachary Wigon (Sanctuary) directs from a script by author Virginia Feito (Mrs. March), based on her novel of the same name. Production is being lined up to begin in August of this year. As we revealed late last year, A24 had boarded the project for domestic. However, we can reveal today that the company exited soon after Qualley left some months ago and before Monroe came aboard. No reason was given to us for the departures. We understand Anton has been in talks with other domestic buyers and has already pre-sold the film to multiple international markets. These are the slings and arrows of independent finance and this is a buzzy project that has already withstood the exit of Qualley not long before the intended March shoot and is now pushing forward with another in-demand lead actress and with another domestic buyer likely aboard soon. Pic is produced by Dan Kagan (Longlegs) under his Traffic. Nick Shumaker, Bard Dorros and Virginia Feito will executive produce. U.S. rights are co-represented by Anton, UTA Independent Film Group and CAA Media Finance. Director Wigon said: “Maika's intense screen presence has resonated with me over and over again throughout her history of complex performances. Monroe most recently starred opposite Nicolas Cage in last year's psychological horror hit Longlegs. She is due to start production in the lead role in Reminders of Him, Universal's adaptation of the best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover. Monroe is repped by Entertainment 360, WME, and Felker Toczek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After her breakthrough on TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras at the age of five, Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson dealt with cameras following her and her family for the next decade. The fiesty pageant princess became the focus of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, and then multiple spin-offs followed, which focused on her mother, Mama June's, drastic weight loss and addiction. Now, at 19, Thompson is following her own path and studying to become a nurse. As her Lifetime biopic, I Was Honey Boo Boo, is about to be released, Thompson is looking back at the ups and downs of her life, including her sister's death. She's also taking an honest look at her mom's extreme weight loss when she was a young girl, and how that damaged her self-esteem. A post shared by alana thompson 🫶🏽 (@honeybooboo) That was a dramatic change, and I didn't know how to even think of my mom. “As a young girl, I think that, like, took a big toll on body image for me,” she went on. “Just because my mama was a bigger girl, and her having to get surgery and shrink down to this one size. It definitely did take a toll on my self-image, for sure.” “I have a new mom,” Thompson told ABC News then. There were also signs that it was negatively affecting how she felt about her own body. In an interview with ET in 2022, she admitted that she was considering getting a suture-sculpt endoscopic sleeve to reduce her weight from 275 pounds to 150 pounds. And I just wanna make sure it's something I actually wanna do before I go and do it.” The teenager admitted that she knew diet and exercise could get her results, but felt that “the surgery would be, like, probably the easiest way to just, like, lose it fast.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "What Was That" singer also opened up about her eating disorder in a new interview. In the lead-up to her new album Virgin, Lorde has started to slowly open up about her broadening gender identity with the world. When asked how she identifies now, the “Royals” artist told the publication, “[Chappell Roan] asked me this … She was like, ‘So, are you nonbinary now? Even so, Lorde added that she doesn't think her gender expression is “radical” compared to what most transgender and nonbinary people face on a daily basis. In the United States in particular, the rights of LGBTQ people have been under constant threat for years, something Roan — a longtime advocate for the community and a queer-identifying artist herself — has spoken out about many times. “I see these incredibly brave young people, and it's complicated,” Lorde said. “Making the expression privately is one thing, but I want to make very clear that I'm not trying to take any space from anyone who has more on the line than me. The star's embrasure of her new gender expression is one of several personal transformations that has occurred since she last dropped an album, 2021's Solar Power, four years ago. In addition to breaking up with Universal Music executive Justin Warren after about eight years together — “It was so painful, as they are, but there was real dignity to it,” she told the publication of the split — Lorde also recovered from an eating disorder, something she's also been increasingly open about in the weeks ahead of Virgin‘s June 27 release. “I felt so hungry and so weak,” she recalled of being obsessed with calories and protein intakes around the time Solar Power came out, specifically the day it dropped. It was just this sucking of a life force or something.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 'Oppenheimer,' the big-screen company designed new cameras and production tech to allow Nolan to shoot in Imax, on film, end-to-end in his upcoming epic, and not just for select sequences. Nolan is a fan of the big-screen format, which he's used on Dunkirk, Interstellar, the Dark Knight movies and Tenet, as well as extensively on Oppenheimer. Ryan Werner, Veteran Awards and Marketing Guru, Joins Neon as President of Global Cinema “Chris called me up and said If you can figure out how to solve the problems, will make [Odyssey] 100 percent in Imax. And that's what we're doing,” said Imax CEO Rich Gelfond, speaking at the company's annual press lunch in Cannes on Thursday. The new Imax cameras are reportedly 30 percent quieter — so those infamous muffled dialogue scenes in Nolan films could be a thing of the past — and substantially lighter. Gelfond said new film scanning and processing techniques will allow a faster turnaround for dailies. The new film cameras are reserved for Nolan for now, but after he wraps The Odyssey, Imax will begin renting them out to other directors. Gelfond talked up the “record number” of films releasing in 2025 that shot at least some scenes with Imax cameras or “filmed for Imax” using Imax-approved cameras, including Ryan Coogler's Sinners, Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible – the Final Reckoning, which had its Imax debut in Cannes on Wednesday night, and Joseph Kosinski's upcoming racing movie Formula One, starring Brad Pitt. Narnia, Greta Gerwig's upcoming fantasy film, will be shot for Imax, though Gelford said it was not yet clear in the Barbie director would be using Imax cameras for some of the scenes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sheridan, who has been building a massive television empire for Paramount since the late 2010s, is back in the movie business thanks for a unique deal being finalized now. It may have taken the slow route of almost a decade, but Taylor Sheridan's action thriller F.A.S.T. In a deal involving high-level talks between Warner Bros. Streaming Ratings: 'The Pitt' Hits High Mark With Season Finale Dwayne Johnson, Joe Ballarini Get 'Ripped' for 20th Century Studios (Exclusive) David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford of Heyday Films will produce the project with Sheridan and Jenny Wood of Bosque Ranch Productions in negotiations to join them. And it also exposes the tricky nature of navigating inter-studio relations. concerns a former special forces commando, down on his luck after he returns Stateside, who is tapped by the DEA to lead a black op strike team against CIA-protected drug dealers in his town. Sheridan wrote the script in the mid-2010s, when he was an established feature scribe with movies such as Sicario and Hell or High Water Under his belt. Warners, then owned by Time Warner, picked it up in 2018, with Sheridan initially signaling he wanted to direct and Chris Pratt circling to star. Gavin O'Connor later came on board as director in 2019, but by then, the studio was owned by AT&T, which didn't see a financial upside of releasing a movie with the budget in the $60 million to $70 million range theatrically. It was also, however, thought as too expensive to make as a streaming movie for its then-launching streaming service HBO Max. This was against a backdrop of a pandemic that was savaging the moviegoing experience and a streaming war that had gripped studios with the hallucinatory idea that streaming was the only future coming. into turnaround (only to have Amazon briefly flirt with it). But studios and movie releasing aren't the only things that have changed. Sheridan's lot in Hollywood has changed plenty as well. He created modern western Yellowstone for the Paramount Network in 2018, and it quickly became the most watched series on cable — a title it hasn't relinquished. Soon, Yellowstone spinoffs such as 1883 and 1923 sprouted on Paramount+, becoming a major draw for the service. Sheridan grew to one of the biggest showrunners in Hollywood, scorching his brand on Paramount+ with shows Tulsa King, Lioness, and Landman, among others. The showrunner also has a strict exclusive deal with Paramount, which initially made moving forward on F.A.S.T. Sources say that dealmaking is still being finalized to give Sheridan a carve out from his Paramount pact to render screenwriting and producorial duties. That wrinkle is making the setting of a budget for F.A.S.T. It will likely be considerably less than the $65 million or so from over a decade ago, when it was initially judged to be too high for a theatrical release. Sheridan is repped by CAA, LBI Entertainment, and Meyer & Downs. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On May 14, Variety reported that NBC greenlit the new show starring Clarkson, which will turn a popular feature on her talk show called “Songs & Stories” into a limited series. Clarkson will not only host but executive produce her “Songs & Stories” show, according to Variety. When Clarkson has hosted “Songs & Stories” themed episodes of “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” which airs on over 200 stations across the U.S., she's had in-depth discussions about music with R&B singer Babyface, country stars Miranda Lambert and Garth Brooks, 90s icon Alanis Morisssette, and pop superstar Pink. The “Breakaway” singer's primetime show will follow a similar format, according to Variety. The outlet reported that NBC's logline for the “Songs & Stories” series says each episode is “a front-row pass for Kelly Clarkson to engage with some of her favorite celebrities and examine both their music and personal lives. The specials are a forum where iconic voices meet heartfelt storytelling through unfiltered conversation and sung in an intimate, unplugged setting.” It's not clear if NBC and Clarkson hope to continue “Songs & Stories” after its initial four-episode run. The singer was eager for a fresh start for herself and her kids — daughter River and son Remy — following her drawn-out divorce from their dad, Brandon Blackstock, per People. On May 9, while performing in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Clarkson lamented to the audience that her concerts were few and far between because of her taping schedule, the outlet reported. It's like a whole other job,” she told the crowd. Meanwhile, Clarkson will return to her old stomping grounds at “The Voice” for the May 20 season finale, to perform her new single, “Where Have U Been?” She was a coach on the show from seasons 14 through 21, and returned for season 23.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joe Don Baker, the prolific character actor who appeared in Seventies classics like Walking Tall and Junior Bonner and a trio of James Bond movies, has died at the age of 89. The actor's May 7 death was revealed in a Legacy.com obituary (via the Hollywood Reporter) that was posted by his “small but very close circle of friends who will miss him eternally.” No cause of death was provided. Often playing tough-talking lawmen or villains, the following decade saw Baker appear in films like 1984's The Natural, 1985's Fletch, and 1988's Criminal Law.

Baker retired from acting following that role, his Legacy obituary noted. “As we say goodbye to Joe Don, we hold onto the memories and the love he shared with us,” his friends wrote. “Though he may no longer be with us in body, his spirit will always remain, a guiding light in the lives he touched.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At an orientation meeting on his first day of college, Benny is told, “You can be whoever you want to be here!” This is exactly what Benny wants — if only he can figure out who he wants to be. He attempts to sleep with lonely fellow freshman Carmen (Wally Baram). He pledges a secret campus society led by Peter (Adam DiMarco), the narcissistic boyfriend of his older sister Grace (Mary Beth Barone), where it seems like half the initiation rituals are simultaneously penis-related and involve the phrase “No homo!” He goes out of his way to avoid Miles (Rish Shah), a cute boy on whom he develops an instant crush. He can't resist joining a film class just to be around Miles. Like a lot of first-year comedies, Overcompensating starts out loud and broad. One of the first scenes has Benny's father (Kyle MacLachlan) getting hit in the crotch by a frisbee while he and Benny's mom (Connie Britton) are moving their son into his dorm. In fact, the series, co-produced by A24, is often at its best when it leans into its most sincere, even soapy side, and looks at how Benny isn't the only one at school trying to act like someone he's not. Carmen is still grieving the loss of her old brother. Grace struggles to realize her entire life has become subordinate to Peter, and that he's an obnoxious loser who doesn't remotely deserve her. And even Peter turns out to have more depth than it seems at first. Charli XCX oversees the music, and also plays herself in an episode. All the big names are fun, though the show's best and most consistent source of laughs is Carmen's roommate Hailee (played by the actor and comedian Holmes), a larger-than-life blonde who would seem like a vapid caricature if she didn't have periodic moments of extreme insight, and if her more superficial moments weren't so strange. (In one episode, she tries to go viral by smearing yellow paint on her mouth and inviting Blake Lively to do the “Speak Up Bitch Challenge,” but has no idea what cause it's for, other than spreading awareness about “silence.”) Charli XCX Releasing ‘Party 4 U' Video to Celebrate Fifth Anniversary of ‘How I'm Feeling Now' Watch Rosé Take on Charli XCX's Apple Dance at Brooklyn Show Lorde Explains How Charli XCX's 'Brat' Gave Her 'a Kick' to Finish New Album 'Virgin' But there's also a long tradition of college and high school shows starring grown-ass adults, and the actors are charming enough to make it not really matter. Baram is a writer (Shrinking, What We Do in the Shadows) with no real acting experience, but she and Skinner have excellent chemistry, and the show is smart about not letting Carmen be Benny's unwitting beard for too long. Scarlett Johansson: ‘Life Has Humbled' Bill Murray Since 2022 Misconduct Allegation Billie Eilish Says Met Gala Images of Her Are Fake: ‘That's AI' Bruce Springsteen Calls Donald Trump ‘Incompetent and Treasonous' at 2025 Tour Kickoff Overcompensating is good enough to have a shot at bucking that trend — I'd never heard of Skinner before this, and wound up enjoying it a lot after a few episodes — and certainly has plenty of backing from more mainstream stars. (Jonah Hill is another producer, though he doesn't appear onscreen.) With any luck, it will stick around long enough for Benny to tell the world who he really is. All eight episodes of Overcompensating begin streaming May 15 on Prime Video.</p>

Back in March, during a stop at the O2 Arena in London, she once again looked around for a guest that was “too hot” in order to slap some fuzzy pink handcuffs on them. On March 9, she nabbed Salma Hayek Pinault, greeting the House of Gucci star by saying, “Oh my goodness. On Wednesday night (May 14) Hayek dropped by the Tonight Show to talk about her first Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover, and, of course, her pop citizen's arrest. “My first arrest, not too bad,” Hayek added after host Jimmy Fallon held up an image of the actress and Carpenter leaning their heads together while each holding a furry handcuff, both women decked out in Short n' Sweet tour gear. “Except that afterwards my daughter put it on and we couldn't get them off! [She] had to go to school and we couldn't get them off.” Panicked, Hayek said she “started smacking” the pretend cuffs to break them open, eventually liberating her daughter from the prop. Hayek also participated in a bit in which she and Fallon got face-to-face with some scary-looking bugs and talked about posing for the SI cover while showing Fallon some inside modeling secrets.

Aaron Dessner produced the LP alongside Spencer Stewart. “Tough Luck,” which leads the album, is “a fiery song about love gone wrong,” Laufey said in press materials. “I wanted to reveal an angrier side of myself—a side that this unfortunate relationship brought out in me.” Listen to that below. This time, I was interested in seeing how I could draw out the most flawed parts of myself and look at them directly in the mirror.” Check out her tour dates with various orchestras below.
