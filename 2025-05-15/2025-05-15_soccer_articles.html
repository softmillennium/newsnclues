Recently, US Soccer announced that the USMNT will face South Korea and Japan in a pair of friendlies during the September international window. These matchups will serve as valuable tests for Pochettino's team as it gears up to host the World Cup.

However, the fixture has yet to be officially confirmed. These fixtures would provide crucial tests for Pochettino and his squad as they fine-tune their form with just a year to go before the World Cup. In 2025, the USMNT will have several international windows, along with the traditional January training camp—an essential period for fine-tuning preparations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of leading lawyers has submitted an official complaint to Fifa, alleging the governing body has failed to follow its own human rights rules in relation to the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The 30-page complaint has been filed via Fifa's official grievance mechanism and calls for immediate action in five areas. The complaint argues that the bidding process “failed to ensure that human rights standards were met” and says: “Fifa's decision to approve Saudi Arabia as the next host country now places Fifa, in accordance with its own policy, under an obligation to ensure that internationally recognised human rights are upheld in Saudi Arabia. “To date there is no evidence that such steps have been initiated, let alone that Fifa has any intention of doing so. This complaint highlights these failings so that they can be rectified without delay.” “This plan must incorporate minimum requirements … ensure their immediate implementation and establish robust mechanisms for ongoing monitoring. To date, no such steps have been initiated by Fifa.” This week Fifa faced criticism and demands for action over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. In response to Human Rights Watch, Fifa wrote a letter stating: “Fifa seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of Fifa World Cup sites. This work involves a close collaboration with its Saudi counterparts and engagements with relevant international labour organisations … we are convinced that measures implemented … can set a new standard for worker protection.”</p>

The captain sat out Argentina's matches against Brazil and Uruguay but is now fit and ready to rejoin his teammates. Even without Messi, Argentina showed no signs of slowing down. The team demonstrated both strength and maturity, proving the national program is in capable hands with its blend of World Cup veterans and rising stars. Scaloni's squad continues to dominate with a balance of experience and youthful energy—arguably making it the most complete national team in the world today. Argentina will face Chile on June 5 in an away fixture at the Estadio Julio Martínez Prádanos. In their second match of the window, Argentina will host Colombia on June 10 at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires. That match is set to begin at 5:00 PM ET. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni picks between Messi and Maradona, names the world's 3 best players without including Leo With the FIFA Club World Cup approaching and some players facing suspensions in other competitions, Scaloni opted to include all expected participants. Ten players from overseas—Nahuel Molina, Nicolás Otamendi, Rodrigo De Paul, Enzo Fernández, Messi, Julián Álvarez, Lautaro Martínez, Giovani Lo Celso, Nico González, and Ángel Correa—were all named in the soccer squad. Although this is technically a preliminary list, Scaloni took the opportunity to bring back several players who had been left out in recent windows due to injuries or form. However, his current form with Strasbourg in France's Ligue 1 has earned him another look. Despite the presence of veteran Nicolás Tagliafico at left back, Barco is back in  Argentina national team to contend for minutes. Despite heavy competition at striker—namely Lautaro Martínez and Julián Álvarez—Castellanos may still find opportunities to contribute against Colombia or Chile.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa are failing to follow their own human rights rules by holding the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia, a group of leading lawyers have alleged. The group, which includes Fifa's former anti-corruption adviser Mark Pieth, have filed a 30-page complaint via Fifa's official grievance portal and called for action in five key areas. It is also argued that the bidding process in which Saudi Arabia emerged victorious from “failed to ensure that human rights standards were met”. “Fifa's decision to approve Saudi Arabia as the next host country now places Fifa, in accordance with its own policy, under an obligation to ensure that internationally recognised human rights are upheld in Saudi Arabia,” the complaint read. “To date there is no evidence that such steps have been initiated, let alone that Fifa has any intention of doing so. This complaint highlights these failings so that they can be rectified without delay.” Saudi Arabia has emerged as the globe's leading sportswashing machine in the last decade, utilising major sporting events to launder a reputation tarnished by human rights abuses. While there is a belief that awarding sporting showcases to nations like Saudi Arabia will spark social development, it's often the case that the opposite is true as they have no incentive to stray from their way of operating. “To date, no such steps have been initiated by Fifa.” States of Play by Miguel Delaney delves into how sportswashing took over football - the book can be ordered here</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To make sure you never miss out on your favourite NEW stories, we're happy to send you some reminders FIFA have announced their decision on potentially banning a country from the 2026 World Cup in an official statement. In just over a year, the 2026 World Cup will get underway across Canada, Mexico and the United States, with 48 countries from across six confederations set to compete for the biggest trophy in football. Only seven countries have qualified for the tournament so far, with all three host nations, New Zealand, Japan, Iran and Argentina, all confirmed participants. Because of this, Congo's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Tanzania and Zambia, which were scheduled to be held in March, were postponed. But FIFA are now satisfied that several conditions required to lift the suspension have been met and released an official statement confirming the decision. It is yet to be announced when Congo's postponed fixtures will be played, but with them currently sitting bottom of their qualifying group for the World Cup, it remains unlikely that they will feature in next year's competition. The final four games of their group campaign are scheduled to take place in September and October, with African play-offs then due to be played in November.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We get the impression that, for multiple and largely sound reasons, nobody has really been paying much attention to the fact there's a Club World Cup straight after this season ends and that it doesn't look anything like previous attempts at Club World Cups. Mention of a tournament so transparently designed as a FIFA cashgrab and scheduled so inconveniently is generally greeted with sighs and eyerolls and grumbles about the clowns being clowns again before a renewed focus on the actual proper football that is happening now. There's also undeniably something in the fact that England's representatives are Chelsea and Man City. These are huge clubs, obviously, but they still don't and probably never will attract the attention, column inches and bandwidth occupied by Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal. We're pretty sure if two of those latter three were involved we'd all be hearing a lot more about the Club World Cup. As it is, Liverpool are still just about the only way the tournament has gained any kind of wider cut-through in this country thanks to Real Madrid's attempts to get turncoat traitor Trent Alexander-Arnold to sign before the tournament. But there's another reason to think the Club World Cup is still a hugely significant event for Arsenal and Liverpool. Because it is one that surely hands them a massive advantage in next season's title race. Where previous Club World Cups – even the infamous 2000 event that forced Man United to duck out of the FA Cup – have been fairly brief mid-season affairs with just a handful of games between a handful of continental champions in which the European champions face at most one meaningfully challenging match, this is a full-scale, full-size major summer tournament. They've even given it the format the actual World Cup should have, just to rub all our noses in it. But this makes it a nightmare for Pep Guardiola. We all kind of slept on it at the time, but with the tournament just round the corner it seems obvious now that a big part of City's decision to go big and go early on their regeneration in January was at least as much to do with this World Cup being on the horizon as it was writing off a lost season. Those January deals they got over the line should certainly help, because City are going to have precious little time this summer to integrate new players they bring in now. A potential seven-game post-season leaves their pre-season almost non-existent. Guardiola himself gets no rest, for one thing, having looked for large parts of this season like he could really do with it, while unlike a Euros or World Cup, this is a huge summer tournament that doesn't affect the preparation of any of City's major rivals. Guardiola does at least retain control of his players for this tournament, but that benefit is surely significantly outweighed by the fact  Arsenal and Liverpool don't have to worry about it at all. Even on City's own website, in a puff piece unconvincingly proclaiming the club's delight and excitement about the upcoming summer adventure in the USA, Guardiola is, well, guarded. City's word-salad assessment that ‘from the manager's perspective the opportunity to view and experience first-hand varied football philosophies and cultures serves as the very essence of what football can bring to the world' doesn't quite ring true with his own words. Literally the first quote from the great man – in a puff piece about how great this all is, remember – is this: Not quite getting into the spirit there, Pep, old boy. It is the very essence of what football can bring to the world, i.e. money to Manchester City and FIFA and other huge clubs with no concern at all about player welfare because they're not really important, are they? It's only a month away and nobody cares. Once it's actually happening, and with around a third of the games – including half the knockout matches – live on Channel 5, people are going to tune in and take at least half an interest because what else are you going to do in June and July? But the true impact of the tournament may only truly be known deep into next season when a summer of effort that has not been required of City's rivals could take its toll. The same is also true of Chelsea, but they'll probably just buy 20 new players on eight-year contracts next week to get them through the tournament before sending 17 of them back out on loan.</p>

Former United starlet Alvaro Fernandez could be on the move again this summer. Now, United in Focus has spoken with transfer expert Graeme Bailey to learn that Fernandez is now the subject of Real Madrid's interest as they look to hand Xabi Alonso a strong team. “We understand that Real Madrid have opened talks with Benfica over a deal for Alvaro Fernandez. “Alvaro has enjoyed a sensational season for Benfica, and analytically speaking, he ranks as one of the best in Europe. “Real are now talking terms with Benfica, but we know there is only so much they can ask for. United included a buy-back in the deal of around £15 million, and if they asked for too much more, Real would just do a deal with United. “We are informed that Alvaro is hugely excited about the prospect of joining Real. This would see Fernandez re-join his boyhood club, from where he departed in 2020, instead joining United, where he envisioned his breakthrough, only to not get the chance. In Spain, Marca has also discussed this interest, admitting Madrid's main concern is United, but if Fernandez has no intention of returning to Old Trafford, this means very little. However, with his chance unlikely to ever come under Ten Hag, selling was the right move, and now it might pay off. Due to United including a 50% profit sell-on clause for Fernandez, this could be a transfer that helps ease the PSR concerns at Carrington, without Ineos having to do any work. If Alvaro leaves for at least £30m, United will pocket around £12.5m of this amount, which would be a huge help for the financial problems currently impacting the club. So the decision would have greatly paid off for Ineos, and it would surely tempt them to do more deals like this in the coming transfer window.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the news became official that LAFC would face Club America on May 31 in a playoff for Club Leon's vacated 2025 Club World Cup berth, the easy comparison to draw was to England's EFL Championship Playoff Final, dubbed the richest game in soccer because of the financial benefit that comes simply from qualifying for the Premier League. Both involve teams that didn't win their competitions outright. And both could have an enormous financial benefit. But only one of them has come since the end of World War II, when Sunderland won the 1972-73 FA Cup. But both teams clearly have the potential to become valuable commodities again if they could survive and become stable in the Premier League. Sheffield United was fourth with an average just north of 28,000. In terms of profile, it's hard to do better than this fixture when it comes to clubs in the Concacaf region. Club America is arguably the most historic club anywhere in North America, the all-time winningest side in Liga MX and also the most valuable club in Mexico according to a recent analysis from Sportico. The Black-and-Gold of LAFC are far newer, having joined MLS only in 2018, but have also won three major domestic titles since 2022 and currently Sportico's most valuable club on the continent. A large share of that sum comes from the exponnentially increased TV revenue they'll receive to from the Premier League's new domestic TV contract, which is worth about $2.2 billion annually for the next four seasons. Every participating club in the Club World Cup from Concacaf will be given a $9.5 million appearance fee, with the potential to win significantly more money if they advance deep in the tournament. As far as international soccer venues go, it doesn't get much bigger, although the location will be a bit of a hike for Sunderland supporters' in particular traveling from England's Northeast. Even so, with nearly two weeks to sell tickets after the semifinals were completed, there's every reason to believe the crowd will approach the 85,000 capacity that is often reached for this occasion. It might seem strange to play this match at the home ground of one of the two competing sides. LAFC is very well supported in Los Angeles, regularly selling out its venue of more than 20,000 seats for league games. And Club America is at worst the second-most popular Liga MX team, including in LA where there is an enormous Mexican expat population.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea might be tempted to sell Djordje Petrovic before the Club World Cup with the goalkeeper attracting a lot of interest according to reports. The Blues are once again gearing up for another busy summer and could fund their business by selling as many as seven or eight players. Chelsea face a critical summer with the club looking to sign a striker, centre back and right footed attacker to strengthen Enzo Maresca's squad. Fans would love to see a new goalkeeper signed with Robert Sanchez not popular amongst supporters, and no keeper has made more errors leading to goals in the Premier League than the Spaniard this season. Filip Jorgensen hasn't had a lot of chances to show what he can do, but in the opportunities he's had it's arguable the Dane hasn't made the most of them. However, Petrovic is expected to challenge for the number one shirt after excelling on loan at Strasbourg, with the Ligue 1 outfit on course to qualify for European football. Liam Rosenior has labelled the Serb world class, but his performances haven't gone unnoticed and Petrovic has recently been linked with a shock move to Leeds. It's been reported the Blues aren't currently considering signing a new keeper and the club are set to conduct a summer review of the position before taking a final decision. Despite that Chelsea have still been linked with keepers, most notably Borussia Dortmund's Gregor Kobel, who the Blues have reportedly held conversations with. Dortmund are believed to want up to €60m, whilst Chelsea have also ben linked with the likes of Mike Maignan and Aaron Ramsdale.</p>
