                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Sebastian Baez upset Taylor Fritz to pull Argentina level, Coco Gauff led the United States to a 2–1 win by defeating Solana Sierra in singles and then partnering Christian Harrison to secure the decisive mixed-doubles point. 3 Coco Gauff went straight to business in her 2026 season debut at the United Cup, helping the defending champion United States earn a 2-1 win over Argentina in Group A on Saturday. 6 Taylor Fritz 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 to open the night session and give Argentina a 1-0 lead. 66 Solana Sierra 6-1, 6-1 in 57 minutes to level the tie at 1-1. That result sent the tie to a deciding mixed-doubles match. Gauff then teamed with Christian Harrison to close out the match, earning a 6-4, 6-1 win over Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi. The U.S. is now 1-0 in Group A and will next face Spain. "It was fun, I've watched Coco play so much and I'm such a big fan," said Harrison, who said he was playing for his country for the first time. Argentina's quarterfinal fate will be determined by its showdown against Spain. Gauff is scheduled to face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro on Jan. 5. It was the first encounter between Gauff and Sierra on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, and Sierra's first career Top 10 matchup. “I feel like I can play even better, too, which is even more exciting,” Gauff said on court after the match. Gauff raced to a 5-0 lead behind a pair of breaks and three strong service holds, saving two break points along the way. Gauff, who went undefeated in singles at last year's United Cup, closed out another 6-1 set to complete the win. "I definitely think there's things I can do better from being hyper critical, but it's a straightforward win," Gauff said to reporters. "I am so happy right now," Baez said on court. "We have been searching for this feeling for many years, and I am happy to give this point to Argentina. Baez had defeated Spain's Jaume Munar in his opening match Friday. Argentina defeated Spain 3-0 in its first Group A tie. After Sebastian Baez upset Taylor Fritz to pull Argentina level, Coco Gauff led the United States to a 2–1 win by defeating Solana Sierra in singles and then partnering Christian Harrison to secure the decisive mixed-doubles point.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia and Norway were tied 1-1 after the singles matches in their opening United Cup tie in Sydney on Saturday, with Storm Hunter and Casper Ruud each earning straight-sets victories for their countries. But the Aussie duo of John-Patrick Smith and Hunter rallied past Norway's Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 4-6, 6-1, [10-4] in a deciding mixed doubles to secure Australia's 2-1 triumph against Norway. She had really good control on all her shots. It's never easy playing against a good team." Hunter, 31, returned to competition last season after missing nearly a year between March 2024 and March 2025 because of an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery. In the women's singles, she stepped in as a last-minute replacement on Saturday for Australia No. 1 Maya Joint, who was sidelined because of illness. Hunter broke serve twice in the opening set to take it 6-2. 532 and seeking her first WTA Tour-level victory, raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set before Hunter — a former world No. "This is pretty emotional for me," Hunter said during her postmatch interview. "It's been a tough two years, rupturing my Achilles and finding my way back, relearning everything. Such a shame she couldn't come out tonight. I know she's so excited to come and play in front of everyone. Hopefully she gets an opportunity on Tuesday. In the second singles match, Ruud produced a solid performance to defeat home favorite Alex de Minaur 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour, 34 minutes, leveling the tie at 1-1. “I'm happy to get a great start," Ruud told ATP No. 1 Club member Jim Courier in his on-court interview. "To beat Alex here in Australia is one of the toughest challenges we have in tennis, so I'm super happy to have that on my resume now.” Ruud played aggressively and decisively, preventing De Minaur from finding any rhythm. 2 saved all five break points he faced and consistently put pressure on the Australian's serve, earning 10 break chances and converting three. "I think we've all seen Alex in better shape than he was today. He was doing a few unforced errors that typically he doesn't, so I got some free points here and there. You saw in the beginning he was struggling with his serve, so I got a free break and just built from there."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years is a long time in tennis, as Flavio Cobolli can testify. Cobolli did just that at Melbourne Park, before defeating Nicolas Jarry in a five-set epic to earn his maiden main draw Grand Slam triumph. “When I have time, I watch that match,” Cobolli told ATPTour.com in Perth, where he is preparing to compete on Australian soil once again, this time as the World No. 22 and a two-time ATP Tour champion at the United Cup. So I'm trying to keep this feeling in the ‘new' part of my career also.” The ‘new' part of his career that Cobolli refers to has seen him emerge as a consistent Top 30 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian even broke the Top 20 for a three-week stint last July and August after reaching his maiden major quarter-final at Wimbledon. “It was only two years ago, but I feel I am now on the Tour like I wanted,” said Cobolli, comparing the video of him taking on Jarry in Melbourne to his current feeling. In 2025, Cobolli racked up a 34-27 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and lifted his first two ATP Tour crowns (both on clay) in Bucharest and Hamburg, respectively. That return represented a significant turnaround for the Italian, who won his first two matches of the year at the United Cup but by late March was 2-8 at tour-level as he struggled for form and fitness. “I know that 2025 was a great year, but it didn't start how I wanted because [after the United Cup] I didn't win a match until the first title in Bucharest,” said Cobolli, who this year will spearhead Team Italy's group-stage bid alongside WTA No. “The goal for this year is to be ready to start the season like I want, because last year I was injured also. I think we can have a great competition here.” Proof that Flavio's brother is Team Italy's designated hype man 🇮🇹 pic.twitter.com/L0fkpUlbIF— United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) December 29, 2025 Cobolli and his team focused on several areas of his game in the offseason in the hope he can push past his career high of World No. “We worked a lot on the return, because we haven't worked a lot on it as my return has always been very good,” explained the 23-year-old. “But with this level, with these guys that serve as they do, it's a thing you have to improve a lot. These are the three things that I worked on a lot. My volley is not the best shot that I have. With improved results at the majors and the ATP Masters 1000s, he believes he can make it to his next rankings goal. “The goal for this year is to improve and to play a little bit less than last year for sure,” he said ahead of his opening singles match against Stan Wawrinka in Perth. The dream is to be Top 10, but it's tough and I know there are many players that are working for that also. So it's going to be tough, but when I think about myself and my team, we will see what happens. For sure it's going to be a great year.” Proof that Flavio's brother is Team Italy's designated hype man 🇮🇹 pic.twitter.com/L0fkpUlbIF— United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) December 29, 2025 Cobolli and his team focused on several areas of his game in the offseason in the hope he can push past his career high of World No. “We worked a lot on the return, because we haven't worked a lot on it as my return has always been very good,” explained the 23-year-old. “But with this level, with these guys that serve as they do, it's a thing you have to improve a lot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stan Wawrinka made a winning start to his final year on the ATP Tour in dramatic circumstances on Saturday in Perth. With his 5-7, 7-6(5), 7-6(5) victory against Arthur Rinderknech, Wawrinka sealed victory for Switzerland in its United Cup opener with France. Belinda Benic had earlier eased past Leolia Jeanjean 6-2, 6-4 to give her team the perfect start to the Group C encounter, and she later returned for a mixed doubles win alongside Jakub Paul to complete a 3-0 clean sweep for the Swiss. "It's amazing to start the year like this for me," said Wawrinka, who announced in December that 2026 would be his final season as a pro, after his three-hour, 18-minute triumph at RAC Arena. More than three hours, so doesn't help, but super happy with the fight, with the performance, and to help the Swiss team to get to 2-0 up." Rinderknech and Wawrinka's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting was hard-fought throughout. Rinderknech held serve from 0/40 at 4-4 before going on to clinch the opening set with a break in the 12th game, before Wawrinka stayed ice cool to take the second in a tie-break. After an early exchange of breaks in the third set, Wawrinka claimed his first win against a Top 50 opponent on hard courts since 2024 by edging Rinderknech in a deciding tie-break. 29 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rinderknech is aiming to build on a career-best 2025 season. 3 Wawrinka, who has now recorded an ATP Tour win in 23 different seasons (2003, 2005-25). Prior to Wawrinka's win, Switzerland couldn't have asked for a much better start to its United Cup campaign than the one Bencic delivered. The 28-year-old dropped the opening game against France's Leolia Jeanjean, but never trailed again, rolling to a 6-2, 6-4 win at RAC Arena in 1 hour and 31 minutes. She won 78 per cent of her first-serve points to stifle most of the pressure Jeanjean managed to generate, and sealed the victory with a backhand winner down the line. “I think this is really one of the only places — to play in Australia — where you get into this situation. So I'm gonna find some solutions next time.” Bencic is coming off a resurgent 2025 season in which she was named WTA Comeback Player of the Year, climbing from World No. “Last year, we didn't expect it to go so well,” Bencic said. “Of course, I don't think the work is done yet. Bencic returned to court after Wawrinka's epic triumph to team with Paul for a 6-2, 5-7, 10-2 mixed doubles triumph against Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah and Edouard Roger-Vasselin. Switzerland will aim to back up its 3-0 opening win by downing Italy on Sunday in Perth. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Zhang Zhizhen survived a thrilling singles match against Zizou Bergs, Zhang partnered Zhu Lin past Bergs and Elise Mertens 5-7, 7-6(5), 10-6 in the deciding mixed doubles inside Ken Rosewall Arena. "We just really [used] the first set to try to play more and to try more things in the service games and then to be prepared for the second set and hopefully the third set." Zhang dominated play in many of the key moments, but in the critical 5/5 point, Zhu showed great defensive volleys to avoid giving Belgium match point. They then surged to the lead in the Match Tie-break and were able to close out the clash after captain Wu Di called timeout at 9/6 before Zhang's final serve. "It was the first time we've played mixed doubles together and thank you to Triple Z, I got a good partner today," Lin said. "He just played a three-hour match and then continued to play mixed doubles with me. It was a great performance today and thank you for all the crowd and for the support, it really means a lot to us." Zhang battled past Bergs 6-7(2), 7-6(3), 7-5 in two hours and 53 minutes to level the tie and keep his country's hopes alive. “I think he was serving really well and then I didn't have a chance,” Zhang said in his on-court interview. “Second serves he was making 180 kilometres [an hour], which I couldn't react to that fast. I didn't give up and kept the same patience. We were both playing a really good match today.” There was not a service break in the match until 5-5 in the deciding set, when Bergs missed an inside-out forehand to allow Zhang to serve out the match. The Chinese star, who missed six months last season due to a shoulder injury, hit 12 aces and did not face a break point to survive Bergs' 18-ace barrage. Mertens got Belgium off to a strong start on the first day of play in Sydney by beating China's Zhu 6-2, 6-2 in Group B action. The top-ranked player from her country on the WTA Tour, Mertens kicked off her 12th WTA tour-level season in style with a one-hour, 18-minute victory — her fourth in five career meetings with former World No. The 31-year-old from China had a resurgent second half of 2025 after seeing her position in the PIF WTA Rankings plummet due to an elbow injury. 493 in August, she reached the fourth round of the WTA 1000 event in Montreal, and begins 2026 ranked No. She broke serve six times in victory, won five of the first six games, and four straight from 1-1 in the second set, even though she landed less than than 50 per cent of first serves in set two.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Iga Swiatek's personal mindset to high praise for 2025 breakout star Victoria Mboko and Barbora Krejcikova's pride to represent Czechia, here is all the latest news from the second Media Day at the United Cup in Sydney. Iga Swiatek made it clear she isn't going to add any additional pressure on herself ahead of the 2026 season. 2 in the PIF WTA Rankings, behind World No. With four Roland Garros titles and one at both Wimbledon and the US Open, she just needs a win at the Australian Open to complete the career Slam. "I'm just focusing on my own process," Swiatek said. On a Grand Slam you have to really play great for two weeks, not have any bad days, be consistent. 1 also is tough, especially when Aryna has been playing great for last years. I'll just focus on myself honestly, because that's the only way to go. I don't need to choose which one is more important, which one is a priority. I have plenty of time to do different things and achieve different goals in my career." It totally didn't make sense. "Now I'm really thinking about it as last year, as in 2024, just thinking about one swing, only tournaments in Australia. It's a tournament she prefers nowadays as her tuneup into the Australian Open given the unique format, opposed to tournaments like Brisbane and Adelaide. A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) "Playing United Cup, I will always want to because the atmosphere is so much different. We get so many, like, normal tournaments on tour that honestly it gets boring sometimes," said Swiatek, who will face Germany's Eva Lys and Netherlands' Suzan Lamens in Group F. "Playing a team event and having the different energy, being able to have a team and talk to different people than we do on tour, I think it's great. I will always choose [the] United Cup." Canada's Victoria Mboko will make her United Cup debut, and is in charge of women's singles responsibilities in her Group B matches against Belgium's Elise Mertens and China's Zhu Lin. The pinnacle of her season came in her own country, when she defeated Naomi Osaka at the National Bank Open final for her first WTA 1000 title. She received high praise from her male counterpart, Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is ranked fifth in world in the ATP PIF Rankings. It was so much fun to watch," Auger-Aliassime said. "I think myself and teammates and all of Canada was really proud of her. "It would be our first time being on the same team, playing together mixed. Furthermore, she has enjoyed competing Canada's Billie Jean King Cup team previously, which helped her decision to play at the United Cup. "This is just a different format that I'm not really used to," Mboko said. "It's a great way to start the year playing round-robin matches and then maybe eventually advancing to the final group stages. The whole format of everything was drawing me to play this tournament. Barbora Krejcikova is one of many players making their debut at the tournament, but to the Czechia native, the United Cup was an event she couldn't refuse. 65, is ranked lower than compatriots such as Karolina Muchova and Marketa Vondrousova, but they elected to begin their years in Brisbane, paving the way for the two-time Grand Slam champion to represent her country. "When I got this opportunity to be part of the team, to play this competition finally after a couple of years, I was really excited right away," Krejcikova said. A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) Krejcikova is currently scheduled to face Australia's Maya Joint and Norway's Malene Helgo in Group D, though Joint has been battling an illness in recent days. After returning from injury in the middle of the 2025 season, Krejcikova said she's feeling healthy heading into this season, and improved her ranking with a quarterfinal finish at the US Open. She's also an easy choice for mixed doubles, too, given her seven Grand Slam doubles titles. "I always enjoyed it very much." From Iga Swiatek's personal mindset to high praise for 2025 breakout star Victoria Mboko and Barbora Krejcikova's pride to represent Czechia, here is all the latest news from the second Media Day at the United Cup in Sydney.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese history maker is back at the United Cup. But this edition is different for the 29-year-old righty. 410 in the world after an injury-mired 2025 season during which he struggled with a shoulder injury, which dates back to when he was 15. “I do believe sometimes during the years, a few days, I felt the shoulder was painful, but I thought the problem was gone,” Zhang told ATPTour.com. “It seemed like that last year, I felt maybe in two weeks the problem will be gone. But it was still there and we did an MRI with an injection to see the problem.” It began to subside and then became a bigger issue the following month when he traveled to the United States for the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. He would not play a competitive match for more than six months. The next two months, Zhang did not play tennis at all. Instead, the Chinese standout did fitness every day, played on his computer and spent time with family. “But most of the time I was running,” Zhang said with a smile. “In those moments sometimes I was missing a bit to play tennis. Zhang began playing tennis lightly in July and did not feel too comfortable on the court when he began. But to play rallies was a little bit different.” “This forehand, I wanted to change already. It was even a better moment to change completely,” Zhang said. “Without this shoulder injury, I think we wouldn't change that and make such a big difference. Zhang, who returned for three tournaments in China in September, will try to show the progress he has made at the United Cup. China takes on Belgium Saturday in Sydney.
