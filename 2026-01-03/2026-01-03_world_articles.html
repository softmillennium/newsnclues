Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), said that “Congress should vote immediately on a War Powers Resolution to stop” President Donald Trump, whose administration has for months unlawfully bombed boats in international waters and threatened a direct military assault on Venezuela without lawmakers' approval. “My entire life, politicians have been sending other people's kids to die in reckless regime change wars. “The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.” Establishment Democrats, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California and others, also called for urgent congressional action in the face of Trump's latest unlawful bombing campaign. “Without congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,” Schiff said in a statement. We must speak for the American people who profoundly reject being dragged into new wars.” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he will force a Senate vote next week on a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to block additional U.S. military action in Venezuela. “Where will this go next?” Kaine asked in a statement. “Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.” “It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy, and trade,” Kaine added. “My bipartisan resolution stipulating that we should not be at war with Venezuela absent a clear congressional authorization will come up for a vote next week.” The lawmakers' push for legislative action came as Trump clearly indicated that his administration isn't done intervening in Venezuela's internal politics — and plans to exploit the country's vast oil reserves. During a press conference on Saturday, Trump said that the U.S. “is going to run” Venezuela, signaling the possibility of a troop deployment. Ahead of Saturday's assault, the Republican-controlled Congress rejected War Powers Resolutions aimed at preventing Trump from launching a war on Venezuela without lawmakers' approval. One Republican lawmaker who had raised constitutional concerns about Saturday's actions, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, appeared to drop them after a phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) noted in a statement that both Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “looked every senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change.” “I didn't trust them then, and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” said Kim. “Trump rejected our constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.” As Trump attempts to silence dissenting voices and oppositional nonprofits, reader support is our best defense against the right-wing agenda.

North Carolina voters have chosen Democrats in three straight elections for governor; the state's Republican-led legislature has countered by siphoning off some of the powers that traditionally came with the job. These power grabs have had a profound effect on both democracy in the state and on the everyday lives of North Carolina residents, Democrats argue. The changes are “weakening environmental protections, raising energy costs, and politicizing election administration,” Josh Stein, North Carolina's governor, said in a text message responding to questions from ProPublica. Republican leaders in the General Assembly did not respond to requests for comment or emailed questions about the power shifts. Former state Sen. Bob Rucho, a Republican picked to sit on the state elections board after lawmakers shifted control from Stein to the Republican state auditor, said the changes would fix problems created by Democrats. “Republicans are very proud of what's been accomplished,” Rucho said. Shifting authority over the elections board, he argued, would “reestablish a level of confidence in the electoral process” that Democrats had lost. Below, we examine how other power transfers driven by North Carolina's Republican legislature are reshaping everything from the regulations that protect residents' drinking water to the rates they pay for electricity to the culture of their state university system. What it is: The Environmental Management Commission adopts rules that protect the state's air and water, such as those that regulate industries discharging potentially carcinogenic chemicals in rivers. What's happened since: The new Republican-led commission has stymied several efforts by the state's Department of Environmental Quality to regulate a potentially harmful chemical, 1,4-dioxane, in drinking water. Advocates for businesses, including the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, had criticized some regulations and urged the commission to intervene. “Clean water is worth the cost, but regulators should not arbitrarily establish a level that is low for the sake of being low,” the chamber said in a press release. The commission also oversees movers, brokers, ferryboats and wastewater. Power transfer: In June 2025, a trial court sided with the General Assembly in allowing a law passed in 2024 to take effect, removing the governor's power to appoint a majority of the commission's members and transferring that power to legislative leaders and the state treasurer, who is a Republican. What's happened since: The state's primary utility, Duke Energy, has backed off from some plans to rely more on clean energy and retire coal-fired power plants. In response to a new resource plan the company filed in October, the executive director of NC WARN, a climate and environmental justice nonprofit, said in a statement that Duke's actions would cause “power bills to double or triple over time” and increase carbon emissions. Garrett Poorman, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said that the company is “focused on keeping costs as low as possible while meeting growing energy needs across our footprint” and that the company had recently lowered its forecasted costs. What it is: The University of North Carolina System encompasses 17 institutions and more than 250,000 students, including at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, considered one of best in the nation. The governor had previously chosen some board members and trustees. Roy Cooper, have criticized the board changes as partisan meddling. “These actions will ultimately hurt our state's economy and reputation,” Cooper said in a 2023 press release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Venezuela attack: President Donald Trump said the US will indefinitely “run the country” of Venezuela after capturing President Nicolás Maduro in a large-scale military operation today. Trump claimed the US would do so until a “proper and judicious transition” occurs, but he did not provide further details. The US embargo on Venezuelan oil will remain in place, Trump said. The Venezuelan authoritarian leader is expected to arrive today in New York, where he will face drugs and weapons charges. • About the operation: Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were dragged from their bedroom by elite US forces during the raid, sources told CNN. • What happens next: Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has called for the country's opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia to be installed, while Venezuela's foreign minister insists Maduro remains the country's leader. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was given “multiple very, very, very generous offers” to leave power, but “chose instead to act like a wild man” and “play around.” Speaking to the press Saturday after a US military operation that apprehended Maduro, Rubio said the Venezuelan leader had “multiple opportunities to find his way somewhere else.” “Instead, he wanted to play big boy,” Rubio said. President Donald Trump told Fox News Saturday that Maduro “wanted to negotiate at the end” and was “trying hard to make a deal.” US President Donald Trump said he did not talk about Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during a recent phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. “We never spoke about Maduro,” Trump told reporters at a news conference today. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued the US military mission that saw strikes in Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro was “not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on.” We watched and monitored that for number of days. So it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,'” Rubio told reporters in Florida on Saturday. He also said it was “largely a law enforcement function.” President Donald Trump added that “Congress has a tendency to leak.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in a previous interview that US strikes inside Venezuela would require congressional approval. During the operation in Venezuela early Saturday morning, “a handful of troops sustained bullet and shrapnel wounds, but none are life-threatening,” a source briefed on the matter told CNN. President Donald Trump told Fox News on Saturday that “a couple of guys were hit. President Donald Trump said Saturday the United States military could have killed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro during its overnight operation if necessary. “He was trying to get into a safe place. You know, the safe place's all steel, and he wasn't able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.” Trump reiterated how the US military “went through the opposition so fast,” while also noting that “there was a lot of opposition.” “People were wondering, do we get them by surprise? Sort of surprised, but they were waiting for something. Maduro is aboard the USS Iwo Jima ship, and Trump posted an image of him in US custody shortly before the news conference began. President Donald Trump offered some more details on who is in charge in Venezuela after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, saying that top US officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would work with a “team” to help run the country. “It's largely going to be, for a period of time, the people that are standing right behind me. We're going to be bringing it back,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago club. He later clarified that Rubio and Hegseth would be a “team that's working with the people of Venezuela to make sure that we have Venezuela right,” raising the possibility of a power vacuum in the US' absence. Trump did not rule out the possibility of US military involvement, saying, “We're not afraid of boots in the ground.” Trump did not provide a specific timeline but suggested the US would remain on site until the country is “put back on track.” Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine on Saturday described the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as an extensive meticulously planned operation that took months to prepare for and hours to carry out on the ground. Speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Caine described the mission as a collaboration involving all branches of the military and intelligence agencies that requires months of preparation. CNN previously reported that the CIA had installed a small team inside Venezeula over the summer to keep close watch on Maduro's activities. Among them were helicopters carrying an extraction force that began their flight into Venezuela at just 100 feet above the water. The effort to capture Maduro and his wife required multiple “self defense engagements” as the forces came under fire, Caine said, before flying out of Venezuela around 3:29 ET. “Failure of one component of this well-oiled machine would have endangered the entire mission, and failure is never an option for America's joint force,” Caine said. “Our air and ground intelligence teams provided real-time updates to the ground force, ensuring those forces could safely navigate the complex environment without unnecessary risk.” He added that US forces encountered resistance as they exited the country. “There were multiple self-defense engagements as the force began to withdraw out of Venezuela,” Caine said. “As we stand here this morning, our forces remain in the region at a high state of readiness, prepared to project power, defend themselves and our interests in the region,” he said at a news conference at President Donald Trump's Florida estate. Caine called the US operation a “testament to the dedication and unwavering commitment to justice and our resolve to hold accountable those who threaten peace and stability,” thanking those who carried out the mission. “For decades, other administrations have neglected or even contributed to these growing security threats in the Western Hemisphere. Trump also offered justification for the United States intervening, stating that Venezuela was “increasingly hosting foreign adversaries in our region and acquiring menacing offensive weapons that could threaten US interests and lives.” He added that Venezuela used those weapons last night. The people of this country do not want another war! Demonstrations are planned for Chicago, New York's Times Square, outside the White House in Washington, DC, along with city halls and statehouses across the country this afternoon. President Donald Trump said Saturday that the US embargo on Venezuelan oil remains in place following the capture of Nicolás Maduro, while delivering a sharp warning to other political and military figures tied to the regime. Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that the United States is maintaining economic and military pressure on Venezuela as it assesses next steps. “Very importantly, the embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect. Trump also issued a direct warning to leaders associated with Maduro. Trump said Maduro's removal marked a turning point for the country. “The dictator and terrorist, Maduro, is finally gone in Venezuela. It's been a long time for them, but they're free,” he said. Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, who is aboard the USS Iwo Jima headed to New York, is expected to briefly stop at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, before being transferred to New York, two sources familiar with the plans tell CNN. The overnight mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Saturday. President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States was prepared to mount a second attack on Venezuela if need be — though he suggested it was no longer necessary after military personnel were able to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid. “We were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so — we actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,” Trump said in remarks from Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday as he recounted the operation. “The first wave, if you'd like to call it that, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second, but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave, actually,” he continued. And he added that subsequent military operations in Venezuela were in the planning phase but that the administration “probably won't have to do” them. President Donald Trump on Saturday praised the US operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, calling it a success and emphasizing that no American service members were killed and no US military equipment was lost. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Trump described the operation as highly effective and said it involved extensive US military assets. I'm not sure that you'll ever get to see it, but it was an incredible thing to see not a single American service member was killed and not a single piece of American equipment was lost,” he said. “No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday, or frankly, in just a short period of time, all Venezuelan military capacities were rendered powerless as the men and women of our military, working with us, law enforcement, successfully captured Maduro in the dead of night. It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,” Trump said in a news conference moments ago. “We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said during a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. But he offered no timeline for how long such a transition of power was expected to take. “We're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place,” he said. Trump also said he planned to authorize US oil companies to take over Venezuela's energy infrastructure, asserting that the corporations would “spend billions of dollars” on the project. The Hostage Rescue Team, often referred to as HRT, is a specialized unit that deploys in a range of situations, including “high-risk arrests, undercover operations, and surveillance operations,” according to the FBI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has said the US will be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela's oil industry after launching a military attack that swept the country's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, from power. Asked about the future of Venezuela's oil industry, Trump replied: “We're gonna be very strongly involved in it. At around 2am on Saturday, explosions rocked Caracas with blasts, aircraft and black smoke seen for about 90 minutes. Trump took a victory lap in his Fox News interview, remarking: “I've never seen anything like this. The raid had been planned for several days earlier but repeatedly delayed because of weather, Trump said. Some US forces were injured but he believes “we had nobody killed”. Trump said Maduro and his wife had been whisked by helicopters to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship in the Caribbean, ahead of their transfer to New York. Describing his discussions with Maduro in recent weeks, Trump recalled: “I said, ‘You have to give up. Asked what is next for the Venezuelan people, Trump replied: “We're making that decision now. We can't take a chance on letting somebody else run it and just take over where he left off … We'll be involved in it very much. Maduro was indicted in US federal court in 2020 on narco-terrorism and other charges for running what prosecutors called a scheme to send tonnes of cocaine to the US through an alleged Cartel de los Soles. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, wrote on X about Maduro and his wife. Venezuela's ruling “Chavismo” movement, named for Maduro's revered predecessor Hugo Chávez, said civilians and military personnel died in Saturday's strikes but did not give figures. The opposition, headed by recent Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, had no immediate comment but has said for 18 months that it won the 2024 election and has a democratic right to take power. Venezuelan allies Russia, Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes as a violation of sovereignty. Argentina's president, Javier Milei, lauded Venezuela's new “freedom”, while Mexico condemned the intervention and Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said it crossed “an unacceptable line”. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says. Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.” Republican Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said: “Today's military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives.” But Democrats roundly condemned the intervention for illegally bypassing Congress. “What stops Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republicans cheer capture of Venezuelan leader, but Democrats say it ‘risks pulling our nation into another war' Reaction to the capture of Nicolás Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, by US forces on Saturday has been starkly polarized along political lines, with administration officials and Republicans celebrating the enforcement of a 2020 US narco-trafficking indictment against Maduro and Democrats decrying what they see as a violation of Venezuela's right to self-determination. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.” Many specialists are skeptical of the narco-terror description when it comes to Cartel de los Soles. Venezuela has a distinctly different landscape from Mexico when it comes to cartels. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says. Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.” Reaction from Democrats criticized the administration for transforming what had been an anti-narcotics trafficking operation in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, which included strikes against alleged drug boats, into a regime-change action. What stops Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Hochul wrote on X that the strikes were “a flagrant abuse of power by acting without congressional approval”. “New York is home to a vibrant Venezuelan community, and I stand with families here and abroad in their hopes for a better, more stable future,” Hochul added. “And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. The New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democratic member of the Senate foreign relations committee, said Maduro was “a tyrant who repressed Venezuelans and aligned with our adversaries” but “today's drastic military operation by President Trump on Venezuelan soil is entirely inconsistent with what [Trump's] cabinet repeatedly briefed to Congress and goes against the expressed wishes of the American people”. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is retiring from Congress next week, said on X she was “100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America” but “if US military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn't the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels?” Greene pointed to the Trump-issued pardon of former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez as an example of a contradiction of the US president's policies, adding: “Americans' disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.” New Jersey senator Andy Kim posted on X that Rubio and the US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, “looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress.” Kim accused Trump of rejecting a “constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war”. What will we say now if [Chinese president] Xi Jinping wants to capture [President] Lai [Ching-te] of Taiwan or Putin tries to capture Zelensky in Ukraine?” He called “for a movement of the American people to stand against bloated defense budgets and warmongering.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of its leader Nicolas Maduro has generally caused condemnation from the international community. In the statements of the leaders and foreign ministries of several countries, Washington's action is characterized as aggression and an attempt to change power in the country, which are fraught with unpredictable consequences for the whole world. The situation in Venezuela has shown that "any state needs to strengthen its armed forces as much as possible, not allowing various rich scoundrels to easily change the constitutional system in search of oil or something else," Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, told reporters. Medvedev referred to "a tough military operation in an independent country that did not threaten the United States in any way" and "the capture of a legally elected president and his wife by special forces." Ideologized hostility prevailed over business pragmatism, willingness to build relationships of trust and predictability." "Such actions, if they actually took place, constitute an unacceptable encroachment on the sovereignty of an independent state, respect for which is a key principle of international law." The US strikes on Venezuela are "direct military aggression with an attempted coup with external interference," said Leonid Slutsky, head of the State Duma's International Affairs Committee and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. Leader of Just Russia Sergey Mironov also condemned the US strikes on Venezuela and called them "treacherous aggression." Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticized the US strikes, calling the events crossing a "red line" and "an extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community." Chilean President Gabriel Boric said his country condemns the US strikes and called for a "peaceful solution to the serious crisis engulfing the country." Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel demanded an urgent response from the international community in response to the "criminal attack" by the United States on Venezuela, calling it "state terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against our America." Spokesperson of the President of Belarus Natalia Eismont said that the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko categorically condemns the act of American aggression against Venezuela. Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov supported the government of the Latin American country talking to his Venezuelan counterpart Ivan Gill Pinto over the phone. The South Ossetian Foreign Ministry called the attacks on civilian and military facilities in Venezuela a gross violation of the UN Charter, calling on international organizations to take steps to prevent escalation and resolve the situation diplomatically as soon as possible. The European Union calls for restraint in the situation around Venezuela and believes that Maduro "did not have sufficient legitimacy," head of the European Diplomacy Kaja Kallas said on X after a conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen joined the support for a "peaceful transfer of power in Venezuela" allegedly on the basis of international norms after Maduro's abduction. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for de-escalation and responsible behavior.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro speaks during a ceremony to swear in new community-based organizations on Dec. 1, 2025.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters Maduro, a salsa aficionado with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians “fascist demons” and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of “yes peace, not war” remixed into an electronica song. He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham. After Trump announced last October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted “those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil.” Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption. A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious ‍human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents. Maduro long ‌denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple ⁠Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil. He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an “economic war” designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood ​up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro. Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration to his second term in 2019. Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants. He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor. After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America. Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast. President Nicolas Maduro addresses supporters during a rally marking the anniversary of the Battle of Santa Ines, which took place during Venezuela's 19th-century Federal War, in Caracas, Dec. 10, 2025.Ariana Cubillos/The Associated Press In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other ⁠developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs. Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the run-up to a nationwide election for mayors. In 2018, militants attempted to assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events. Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by ‌his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse. Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An act of armed aggression by the United States against Venezuela prompts deep concern and condemnation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "Earlier today, the United States carried out an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This has prompted deep concern and condemnation," the ministry said. "The pretexts cited to justify such actions are untenable. Ideologized hostility has prevailed over pragmatic considerations, as well as over a willingness to build relations based on trust and predictability," the statement said. "We proceed from the assumption that all partners who may have claims against one another should seek ways to resolve their problems through dialogue-based solutions. We are ready to support them in this," the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own fate without any destructive external interference, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. "Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it proclaimed itself in 2014. Venezuela, in turn, must be guaranteed the right to independently determine its own fate, free from any destructive — let alone military — interference from outside," the Foreign Ministry emphasized. On January 3, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the United States had attacked civilian and military facilities in Caracas, describing Washington's actions as military aggression. A state of emergency has been imposed in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump confirmed that the United States had carried out large-scale strikes on Venezuela.</p>

The meetings come as Kyiv and its partners continue work on a draft peace plan aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine. On Dec. 28, Zelensky met with U.S. President Donald Trump at his residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. The original U.S.-proposed 28-point plan had effectively pressured Kyiv to capitulate, reinforcing Russia's maximalist demands. During a joint press conference with Zelensky on Dec. 28, Trump said the peace talks were in their "final stages," without providing further details. Trump, in turn, also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. "The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country," Donald Trump said on Truth Social. "A busy working day lies ahead: security and economic issues, work on framework documents, coordination of further steps with partners," National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov said. Russia launched 95 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said. The bodies of a 3-year-old boy and a woman, likely his mother, were found in the rubble of an apartment building following Russian strikes. Search and rescue operations are still active at 3 a.m. local time, according to governor Syniehubov. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko will soon give the president a list of possible candidates to replace Serhii Deineko as head of Ukraine's State Border Guard Service.

The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell and Olena Zashko embedded with Ukraine's forces in Kherson Oblast, following FPV drone and night bomber teams tasked with defending river islands. The poll also revealed that 69% of Ukrainians support a peace plan that would freeze the war with security guarantees, as long as Ukraine is not forced to officially recognize Russian-occupied territories as part of Russia, Kyiv International Institute of Sociology said. Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service warned on Jan. 2 that Russia may be preparing a provocation as part of its efforts to disrupt the U.S.-mediated peace talks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Venezuelan leader is currently being shipped to New York together with his wife to face charges of a “narco-terrorism conspiracy.” Trump had previously confirmed that US forces carried out large-scale overnight airstrikes on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and taken Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores captive. Both will “soon face the full wrath of American justice,” according to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello Rondon has told the country's troops to “trust the leadership,” while Foreign Minister Yvan Gil has accused Washington of seeking to gain control of the Latin American nation's natural resources. Footage showing attacks in two other parts of the country has also been geolocated. In a statement, Moscow has condemned the US “aggression,” called for “immediate clarification” on Maduro's whereabouts and lamented that “ideological hostility has triumphed over businesslike pragmatism.” American Senator Mike Lee announced on his personal X account that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had told him that Washington does not foresee any further military operations at this time and that the Venezuelan president will stand trial in the US. Multiple Western countries have expressed “concern” and claimed they are monitoring developments with their diplomatic teams in the Venezuelan capital. The press conference is over now, but we will continue to recap some of Trump's key quotes. Trump says he and his administration have not spoken with exiled Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado since the capture of Maduro. So we were prepared to do a second wave,” Trump has said. ❗️ ‘US Ready to Stage Second & Much Larger Attack on Venezuela if Needed' – Trump ‘We assumed a second wave would be necessary but now it is probably not.' Trump has claimed Maduro was trying to “get into a safe place” during the US capture operation. Acevedo confirmed that the Venezuelan authorities have no information about the whereabouts of President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and has demanded “proof of life” from Washington. Trump has made a comment on Colombian President Gustavo Petro's reaction to Maduro's capture, saying that the latter is “making cocaine,” which is being sent to the US, so Petro “does have to watch his ass.” @POTUS on Colombian President Gustavo Petro: "He's making cocaine. They're sending it into the United States — so he does have to watch his ass." “I understand she was just sworn in, but she was jsut picked by Maduro, So Marco [US Secretary of State Rubio] is working on that directly. He's just had a conversation with her and we think she's ready to do what we think is necessary to essentially make Venezuela great again,” he added. Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado, however, is “willing to do what's necessary.” When asked about US presence in Venezuela and what he means by “running the country,” Trump said he was “designating people” and “talking to people” about it. These actions violate the UN charter, infringe upon Venezuela's sovereignty, endanger millions of people and threaten stability in the region, Gil stressed. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has imposed a state of emergency over the US attack, the Latin American nation's foreign minister, Yvan Gil, has said in a statement. “The entire country must activate to defeat this imperialist aggression,” he said. "The objective of this attack is none other than to seize the strategic resources of Venezuela, particularly its oil and minerals... The US Embassy in Caracas has issued a Level 4 notice to American citizens, saying: “Do not travel to Venezuela for any reason.” US President Donald Trump held a national security meeting at Mar-a-Lago before striking Venezuela, The New York Times has reported. At least 11 sites in the country were attacked, he said. Footage from Caracas has captured an explosion rocking the Cuartel de la Montana, the resting place of Hugo Chavez, who served as president of Venezuela between 2002 and his death in 2013. “Our Zone Of Peace is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote on X. 🚨 BREAKING: Reports of U.S. Army CH-67G Chinook Special Operations helicopters seen flying over Caracas, Venezuela during suspected U.S. airstrikesAt least TWELVE explosions appear to have occurred throughout the capital city.These Chinooks are believed to be from the Army's… pic.twitter.com/K3qwNejK2q The US Senate Armed Services Committee had not been notified by the White House about any military action against Venezuela, CNN has reported, citing an informed source. He added that while the US has the world's most powerful military, it would struggle to maintain a presence in Venezuela or impose a puppet government, which he said Washington had been attempting to do for decades. ”We have been preparing for this, and we are ready to defend Venezuela from any gringos that try to put boots on the ground,” he said.</p>
