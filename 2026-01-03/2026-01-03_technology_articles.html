                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gigabyte is capitalizing on the resurgence in demand for AM4. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Gigabyte is capitalizing on the ongoing resurgence in demand for AM4 motherboards as DDR5 RAM prices continue to rise. Spotted by TechPowerUp, the board maker has released four brand new boards, two on the A520 chipset and two on the B550 chipset, featuring a mix of Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX variants. Most of the four boards are new iterations of existing models sporting minor upgrades to make them more modern, such as the addition of ARGB lighting or WiFi support. The board also comes with an 8-phase VRM power delivery system, PCIe 4.0 support, dual NVMe PCIe 4.0 slots, 2.5Gb Ethernet, dual HDMI ports, and USB 3.2 Gen 2 support. This variant is a revision upgrade over the Aorus B550I Pro AX 1.3 with no changes according to the spec sheet. The board features two DDR4 slots and PCIe 4.0 support via a single M.2 connector. Other than that, the two boards are seemingly identical. The board features six USB ports in the rear, two DDR4 slots, and a single M.2 slot running at PCIe 3.0 speeds. Gigabyte's focus back on AM4 is more evidence that buyers are flocking back to AMD's almost 10-year-old socket to build new systems as everyone weathers the storm of skyrocketing DDR5 consumer memory prices. AM4 is the only AMD socket that supports DDR4 memory. Despite DDR4 memory production having mostly ceased already, DDR5 memory prices have shot up so quickly that they have overtaken average DDR4 pricing, even at DDR4's elevated prices (from lack of production). We really started to see consumers shift their focus to AM4 in mid-December, when Ryzen 7 5800X3D prices on eBay skyrocketed above Ryzen 7 9800X3D prices. Even AMD's old Zen 2-based Ryzen 5 3600 is in the list, ranking as Amazon's 6th most popular CPU sold. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At around 2 am local time in Caracas, Venezuela, US helicopters flew overhead while explosions resounded below. A few hours later, US president Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife had been “captured and flown out of the Country.” US attorney general Pam Bondi followed with a post on X that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York and would “soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” It has been a stunning series of events, with unknown repercussions for the global world order. WIRED asked leading chatbots ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini the same question a little before 9 am ET. We also asked AI search platform Perplexity, which advertises “accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question.” (While Perplexity Pro users have access to a wide range of third-party AI models, the default, free search experience routes users to different models based on a variety of factors.) “I don't have any information about the United States invading Venezuela or capturing Nicolás Maduro. This hasn't happened as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2025,” it responded. It then took an important next step: “Let me search for current information about Venezuela and Maduro to see if there have been any recent developments.” Instead, it emphatically refuted that Maduro had been captured at all. "What's likely going on is a mix-up with real events that are often described in dramatic or misleading ways online. “The premise of your question is not supported by credible reporting or official records: there has been no invasion of Venezuela by the United States that resulted in capturing Nicolás Maduro,” it responded. If you're seeing sensational claims, they likely originate from misinformation or hypothetical scenarios rather than factual events.” “Perplexity never claims to be 100 percent accurate, but we do claim to be the only AI company focused on building more accurate AI,” says Perplexity spokesperson Beejoli Shah. OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ChatGPT 5.1's “knowledge cutoff”—the point at which it no longer has new training data to draw from—is September 30, 2024. (Its more advanced model, ChatGPT 5.2, extends that cutoff to August 31, 2025.) Gemini 3 models have a knowledge cutoff of January 2025 as well but unsurprisingly tap into Google search for queries requiring more up-to-date information. And Perplexity is only as good as the model it's tapping into—although it's again unclear which one that was in this case. “Pure LLMs are inevitably stuck in the past, tied to when they are trained, and deeply limited in their inherent abilities to reason, search the web, ‘think' critically, etc.,” says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and author of Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Ensure That AI Works for Us. The good news, at least, is that people don't seem to be relying on AI as a primary news source quite yet. According to a survey from the Pew Research Center released in October, 9 percent of Americans say they get their news sometimes or often from AI chatbots, and 75 percent said they never get news that way. But as chatbots become more ingrained in people's lives, remembering that they're likely to be stuck in the past will be paramount to navigating interactions with them. And it's always worth noting how confidently wrong a chatbot can be—a trait that's not limited to breaking news.

The company says the SKU was priced incorrectly, and that it was never in stock to begin with, despite showing a pre-order button to buyers. Moreover, Corsair clarifies that it doesn't sell memory based on pre-orders at the moment, so this was entirely an oversight. Customers affected by this will be fully refunded and issued a compensatory coupon on top. According to reports online, that was initially a 15% storewide discount that was (mistakenly, again) set to expire on October 31, 2025, so Corsair later added a blanket 40% off for future RAM orders as well. NOTICE: DRAM Cancellations - Webstore Pricing ErrorOn January 1, our webstore mistakenly listed an out-of-stock memory kit - DOMINATOR TITANIUM RGB 48GB (2x24GB) DDR5 6400MT/s CL36 (SKU: CMP48GX5M2B6400C36) at an incorrect price. Complaints started popping up on Corsair's official subreddit, where the mods made matters worse by turning off comments and deleting certain posts. While the community backlash has been scathing, there have been some divisive comments, wondering how this is unfair, so it's important to highlight what actually went wrong. You'll find anecdotes in the comment threads saying that stores like Micro Center will simply let you keep the incorrectly-priced item, since it was never your mistake. Instead, by cancelling those orders, Corsair created a PR nightmare for itself. The funny bit is that just a few hours before this fiasco unfolded, the company had cancelled an order for a prebuilt PC worth $3,500, only to raise its price by $800 afterward. The community, therefore, was already on high alert, so for Corsair to pull off something like this was quite brave, for lack of a better term.

Some of you might still point to rising DRAM prices, and while that's a fair assumption, the issue isn't jacking up prices after these orders; it's that the brand outright cancelled them all. Corsair doesn't sell memory to AI data centers; its entire business is consumer-facing, so it lives and dies on reputation, which has now been tainted.

Senior_Ball_9068 said on the post, “I believe that they cancelled my order exactly because they raised the price.” This is a massive $700 price hike, especially at a time when memory prices are hitting record highs, leading to significant disappointment for users. Thankfully, a Community Captain took notice and messaged the user to get their order number and get to the bottom of things. But we'll be getting OP taken care of!” This is a commendable move by Corsair, especially given that the OP wasn't at fault. And while we're unsure whether they reached out to Corsair customer service to fix the issue, it seems their Reddit post gained a lot of traction, catching the company's attention. The Redditor ordered the Corsair Vengeance a5100 gaming PC, which comes with an AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, 32GB (2x16GB) of DDR5-6400, and a 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD. While many enthusiasts will not pay the $380 premium that Corsair charges for its pre-built PC, the Redditor said that they prefer that because they “never had the experience of building a PC myself” and that they did not want to “break…something up in the process.” And even though others say that it's easy to learn building one from scratch, it's probably something that the OP doesn't want to risk, and that they're willing to pay extra for the privilege of not having to think which parts to order, worry about putting it together, and the peace of mind of warranty coverage for the entire PC.

Deep-tech giant YPlasma is preparing to announce a new solid-state cooling solution for laptops at CES 2026. This new cooler design uses "Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma actuators" to generate airflow without any moving components. According to YPlasma's literature review of the technology: "Wind is generated by ionizing a thin layer of ambient gas adjacent to a dielectric surface..." YPlasma's coolers are taking advantage of corona discharge, an electrohydrodynamic phenomenon, to generate wind using electricity. The solid-state nature of this cooler design also enabled YPlasma to make it incredibly tinny. YPlasma claims that others have explored ionic cooling using corona discharge, but it has made strides in making it safe for consumer use. A big part of this is the use of a dielectric barrier to limit harmful ozone byproducts from being exposed to the surrounding environment. If this cooling design sounds at all familiar, Frore Systems developed the world's first solid-state cooler a few years back and has since seen its cooler designs implemented in small-form-factor PCs and laptops. Solid-state cooling is a new, growing category of cooler designs that can cool electronics without any moving parts, providing super-quiet operation and low energy consumption in incredibly small form factors. But instead of using plasma, the AirJet uses ultrasonic frequencies to generate airflow. YPlasma has not released any precise statistics on the cooling capabilities of its new solid-state laptop cooler, but it's likely to be as competitive as Frore System's solid-state AirJet coolers, based on YPlasma's claim that its cooling tech will be an effective solution for power-hungry AI servers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If old sci-fi shows are anything to go by, we're all using our computers wrong. We're still typing with our fingers, like cave people, instead of talking out loud the way the future was supposed to be. Have you ever seen Picard touch a keyboard? And it's odd because our computers are all capable of turning speech into text by default. In recent years AI models like Nvidia's Parakeet and OpenAI's Whisper, both open source, have made great strides in turning human voices into text. Both excel at correctly adding things like punctuation and capitalization, and you can run them right on your computer. Using these models is the closest I've felt to recording a captain's log—it just works. They're both a little complicated to set up. This is a dead-simple, totally free application that can set up either of these models on your computer and give you a keyboard shortcut to use it. It was created by CJ Pais after he broke his finger, rendering him unable to type. He wanted a totally free, and radically simple, way to use existing AI speech-to-text tools. To get started simply download Handy—there are versions offered for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The default, Parakeet V3, is a great place to start—I didn't feel the need to try out other models after using it. I've been using this to write the article today, and an impressive thing is I don't even have to turn my music off—the models are good at filtering it out. I don't know if that would work in all environments, granted, but my music was pretty loud, and it worked well. I even tried speaking a few sentences in French and Spanish—it worked (and, I imagine, would work even better if my pronunciation weren't horrible). Honestly, for most people, this is all you need to do—download the application, choose a model, and use it whenever you'd otherwise be typing something. You can pick a custom keyboard shortcut, and you can decide to simply press that shortcut instead of pressing and holding it. You can also choose which microphone you want to use and whether there should be audio feedback at the beginning and end of recording. You can also add custom words, useful if you regularly say a name or word the model seems to constantly mis-transcribe. And, because it's completely free, it also doesn't bother you about things like upgrading, which is a nice change of pace in the world of AI-based technology. If you're at all curious about talking instead of typing, I can't recommend Handy enough. But if I ever hurt my hand in any way, I'm going to be very thankful this tool exists.

Samsung's QD-OLED technology has gone head-to-head against LG's WOLED with one distinct advantage: better color volume. As a side effect, they employ unconventional subpixel layouts, which make QD-OLEDs suffer from inferior text clarity. Fortunately, Samsung Display is finally addressing this at CES 2026. The V-Stripe refers to the subpixels being arranged vertically, like on a typical LCD, which Windows' font engine is most comfortable with. For years, QD-OLEDs have relied on triangular subpixel arrangements, leading to poor text clarity and fringing visible at the edges. Then, whole pixels are aligned horizontally next to each other. This should significantly reduce text fringing and improve clarity at even lower resolutions. The Reddit post above sheds more light on this new panel, courtesy of a hands-on article from para.de that's since been deleted. Even before this, the issue had been greatly alleviated by brute-forcing pixel density. Still, the problem was never truly eliminated from the root, and Samsung's 34-inch ultrawide panels, in particular, had been stuck on older tech that lacked these improvements. They're not 4K or 5K-class panels like some other QD-OLED displays, so the upgrade matters most here. "By leveraging QD-OLED's top emission structure, which offers brightness advantages, along with improvements in organic material efficiency and design optimization, we were able to mass-produce a high-performance monitor display that integrates four key features: the 'V-Stripe' pixel structure, an ultra-wide aspect ratio, a high refresh rate, and enhanced brightness."

Samsung Display has also achieved 1,300 nits of peak brightness for the first time on a QD-OLED panel, and monitors using it will be certified for HDR True Black 500, meaning 500 nits of peak brightness across 100% of the panel. This new panel will debut at CES with options from a range of brands, including Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI, who've been supplied these panels since December 2025.

Unitary executive theory = plenary powers, e.g., they're a king in all but name surrounded by political loyalists with their hands on every lever of power that matters.

And it doesn't mean that was a primary or even proximate goal for the people who called the shots. All of whom would want their country to democratise. Whether blowing up the capital and kidnapping their dictator causes that to happen is questionable. (On the other hand, there seems to be zero effort–again!–towards an after-the-bombs plan.

Had he gone to war and won, he would have taken care of a huge problem for us. I for one would have been extremely grateful. Now it looks like he's going to get his oil without any fighting whatsoever. They can't have free and fair elections when the US is literally holding their president hostage. And dictatorships like Saudi Arabia are just fine apparently. You are ok with Trump invading a neighbour country, kidnapping a person while accepting some civilian casualties?I wonder what you would think if Canada would invade the USA and kidnapping Trump and other criminals.This strike was not sanctioned by Venezuela. They are sovereign and they have the right to deal with their affairs in their own way. The fact that you want to celebrate this says a lot about your attitude towards sovereignty , due process and human life.
