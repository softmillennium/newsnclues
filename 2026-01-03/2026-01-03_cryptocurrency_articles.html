                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital art fades, while gaming NFTs thrive through real utility and play-to-own adoption. The NFT space is currently facing a harsh reality check. However, investors are jumping ship and sales revenue has been down. This decline in NFT sales revenue is a 25% increase from the previous year. It also shows that creators are still pumping out content at an incredible pace despite the lack of demand from buyers. This is a heavy decline from the $8.9 billion recorded in 2024. Even worse, the average price of an NFT has also tumbled from $124 to roughly $96. This data now shows the NFT market as one that is “oversupplied and under-demanded”, and gone are the days when Bored Ape NFTs sold for millions of dollars. Investors who once bought these assets for their rarity are now finding it nearly impossible to find a secondary buyer. People are no longer willing to pay high premiums for static images that offer no functional use, and according to data from CryptoSlam, the number of unique purchasers per month has remained low for most of the past year. This is a clear sign that the “hype” buyers have left the building, and are leaving behind a mountain of 1.34 billion unsold tokens. While digital art is gathering dust, NFTs in the gaming space are moving faster than ever. The global NFT gaming market was valued at roughly $6.1 billion last year. This “utility” (or use case) is what keeps the market alive. They are buying them to use, and this creates a cycle of demand that does not rely on purely speculative hype. Major platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden have also recognised this trend and are moving away from being “art galleries” to “gaming hubs”. Related Reading: NFT Market Outlook: Why Utility May Shape The Next Growth Phase Games like Axie Infinity allowed players to make a living, but these models collapsed when token prices fell. This year, the industry has so far moved toward “Play-to-Own” (P2O). In this model, the focus is on fun first, and the NFTs are a reward for engagement, rather than a financial obligation. This simple change has brought back the players and companies like Mythical Inc. and Splinterlands have built massive communities of tech-savvy gamers who value digital ownership. They are not looking for a quick profit, and are looking for a deeper connection to the games they love.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's central bank has issued a firm warning to policymakers: central bank digital currencies should take precedence over stablecoins as countries modernize their payment systems. In its December Financial Stability Report, the Reserve Bank of India framed CBDCs as the only digital money capable of preserving the “singleness of money” – a principle it views as foundational to trust, settlement finality, and financial stability. While stablecoins may offer speed and programmability, the RBI believes they introduce new systemic risks that could surface sharply during periods of market turmoil. According to the report, privately issued stablecoins can create parallel monetary systems that operate outside direct sovereign control. The RBI cautioned that jurisdictions must carefully evaluate how stablecoins interact with their domestic financial systems before allowing them to scale. Unlike central bank money, stablecoins depend on issuer credibility, reserve management, and legal clarity – variables that may fracture under pressure. India's government has signaled openness to exploring stablecoin regulation in its Economic Survey for 2025–2026. As the country's monetary authority, the RBI is expected to play a decisive role in shaping how digital assets are treated – particularly where they intersect with payments, capital flows, and monetary policy transmission. More News: Japan's SBI and Startale Team Up to Build a Fully Compliant Yen Stablecoin for Global Use Dozens of other countries remain in pilot or research phases, underscoring how complex and politically sensitive CBDC implementation can be. According to DeFiLlama, total stablecoin market capitalization climbed sharply through 2025, reflecting growing use in cross-border payments and on-chain finance – even as regulators debate their long-term role.

Aside from contentions on the legality and practicality of use, some viewers have also raised concerns about its environmental impact. In the video, TikTok creator Hasan Minhaj (@hasanminhaj) shared a segment of his interview with Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman — who offered a blunt assessment of digital currencies: "There is essentially no legitimate use for crypto, and nobody is using it for anything legitimate." Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman thinks crypto is a cult He further supposes that angry rebuttals to his statement would likely be because the crypto community is a cult. They argued that crypto has legitimate uses in countries with unstable banking systems and is useful for global transfers. They've also countered that fiat currency is used more for crime than crypto. Still, more people are wary of crypto, even comparing it to MLM or Ponzi schemes. And, beyond the issue of real-world usefulness, its environmental impact is harder to ignore. An analysis by the International Energy Agency showed that crypto mining, along with data centers and AI, used almost 2% of the world's electricity in 2022. As the demand for these technologies increases, the IEA forecasts this energy consumption to double by 2026 — requiring enough extra electricity to power an entire country. Kelvin is the Apple of space heaters, designed for energy efficiency and maximum comfort. It's completely silent and intelligently controlled, with setup taking just 5 minutes. Built from premium materials like aluminum and glass, Kelvin works beautifully as a full-home heating system or as the perfect solution for that one room that never feels warm enough. Newer proof-of-stake blockchains, for instance, can be powered by clean electricity, use far less energy, and produce less air pollution, as shown in the CCRI Crypto Sustainability Metrics. The posted video is less about settling the crypto question and more about revealing just how divided people are over what this technology is really for and what it's costing the planet. "And it's bad for the environment," one viewer commented. And prone to hacking, which makes you need more computing power, making it even worse of an energy suck," commented another.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee's BitMine has locked up nearly $1.6 billion of its Ethereum treasury in staking contracts in just one week, positioning the firm as a major network validator. The move further shifts BitMine from a passive ETH holder as it prepares for a major expansion of its authorized share count. The corporate holder deposited an additional 82,560 ETH into staking protocols on January 2, according to blockchain data tracked by Lookonchain. However, the maneuver coincides with a sweeping proposal to restructure the company's capital base to fund what management describes as an Ethereum "supercycle." In a January 2 post on X, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee requested approval to increase the company's authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. He notes that a 50 billion share ceiling provides BitMine with an enormous runway to conduct At-The-Market (ATM) equity offerings. Nonetheless, Lee outlined scenarios in which ETH could reach $250,000, driven by Wall Street's tokenization trends. "We believe Ethereum is the future of finance. A supercycle drive by Wall Street re-engineering on the blockchain. BlackRock's Larry Fink said tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum," Lee said. At those valuations, BitMine argues its implied share price could reach $5,000, necessitating splits of up to 100-for-1 to maintain retail accessibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But why did it happen, and could they ever make a comeback? At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. NFTs, on its most basic level, is the ownership of a digital piece of work, such as art or music. They could include memes or even actual pieces of art. Advocates promised that they would revolutionize art patronage while making millions of ordinary people filthy rich in a matter of months. Sotheby's and Christies sold NFTs for millions of dollars apiece. Jimmy Fallon hyped ‘Bored Apes' on The Tonight Show. Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Louis Vuitton, YouTube, and the University of California-Berkeley all got stuck in. Exactly what NFTs were, or how they worked, was often lost in the mania. Yet within a year, the NFT market had dramatically collapsed, taking many people's money and hopes with it. Estimated trading volumes dropped from $4 billion to around $800 million, and research suggests that 95 percent of NFTs are now worthless. Today, the highest price anyone has offered for that $1.8 million robot samurai NFT in the past 12 months is just 0.0554 Ether, equivalent to $2,852 as of December 17. On March 11, 2021, the venerable British auction house Christies announced that it had sold its first ever NFT for a staggering $69 million. In theory, he was now one of the three most valuable living artists on Earth. You'll notice, though, that I didn't say anything about Beeple actually selling an artwork. And this distinction is key to understanding why NFTs went so wrong. For centuries, the art world has struggled to maintain reliable records of ownership in the face of war, disaster and forgery. And in May 2014, two men at a New York City hackathon — artist Kevin McCoy and tech entrepreneur Anil Dash — attempted to make their own modest contribution by harnessing a nascent digital technology called blockchains. Each new entry is verified by a network of computers that check each other's work, wielding unbreakable encryption to resist tampering. That's how cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Bitcoin, can operate without any input from banks or governments. It's also how NFTs were meant to help verify art ownership. "The idea behind NFTs was, and is, profound," wrote Anil Dash in 2021. The idea was to create a unique digital certificate of art ownership that could always be traced back all the way to its original creator. Selling these certificates could give digital artists a new way to fund their art, and collectors a new way to buy in. Others quickly expanded the idea, coining the term "non-fungible token" in 2017 to distinguish these certificates from, say, a Bitcoin (which is interchangeable with any other Bitcoin). But the new NFT industry — which Dash was not part of, and has repeatedly denounced — never solved some basic problems with the concept. Eden's stunt was simple and easy to fix. Wouldn't you need some kind of trusted institution to make and maintain that link? As Eden pointed out at the time: “There's no way to permanently attach a digital certificate to a physical work of art... it's almost as if we can't just throw technology at the social problem of trust.” Another question: Does buying an NFT actually come with any rights over the artwork itself? Also, who's going to police fraud and impersonation? Who will protect consumers from account hacks, given that blockchain transactions (unlike bank transfers) are irreversible? As money and enthusiasm began to pour into NFTs in the wake of Covid-19, major marketplaces largely just shrugged and fell back on "buyer beware." Artist verification remained weak; many NFTs conferred no rights; and all too many NFT advocates chose relentless hype over caution. They just had hyperlinks, which often went dead within a year or two. "Nothing went the way it was supposed to," wrote Dash in 2021, likening the whole affair to an exploitative "gold rush." Meanwhile, famed (and famously expensive) British conceptual artist Damien Hirst created NFTs for thousands of his paintings, then burned the originals. In 2022, as predicted by so many critics, the NFT market began to crash. In April, an NFT of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet — which had fetched $2.9 million the previous March — went on sale again, but the highest bid was $280. As of Dec. 17, 2025, the highest recent offer for either is around $2,800. Then there's Logan Paul, who promised that his forthcoming NFT-based video game CryptoZoo would let you earn money just by playing it. Some of the biggest NFT "whales" — often crypto entrepreneurs — seem to be doing fine, as are those that merely rode the dragon while it was in flight. "We were very much about getting in and getting out within 24 hours," prolific NFT trader Collin Li told The Australian Financial Review in July. In September, Christies admitted defeat and closed its digital art department. As for Anil Dash, he never took a financial stake in NFTs, but the mess still follows him. “My son mockingly calls me ‘NFT guy' because he knows it's the most horrible epithet I could ever be saddled with,” he said on Bluesky in 2023: Even so, there are people who still carry a torch. Sewell of Melbourne, Australia, told the Review that they remain about $250,000 down, but continue to make and buy NFTs because they believe the long-term future is bright. Disney's official tie-in NFTs sell at respectable prices, as do the NBA's. That suggests NFTs can have their uses, as long as someone is actually policing them — although it's a fair cry from the futuristic vision of “decentralized” digital items free from corporate control that some NFT boosters promised. "I think everything's working out the right way,” longtime NFT magnate Roham Gharegozlou told Fast Company. "There were speculative excesses within the industry, but I think that also was a stress test for everything to come."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTCUSD dropped below $90,000 on Saturday as crypto markets reacted to the US military action in Venezuela. Bitcoin attempts to hold recent gains as the US mounts an attack on Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Traders remain optimistic about the outlook for BTC price action if certain levels hold. Gold starts to flag on low timeframes as Bitcoin's gains tap 5% since Christmas. Data from TradingView showed BTC price action reversing after highs near $90,940 on Bitstamp. News that the US had launched airstrikes in the Venezuelan capital Caracas were followed by an announcement from President Donald Trump on Truth Social in which he said that Venezuela's President had been captured and “flown out of the country.” With traditional markets closed, BTCUSD attempted to preserve some early-year gains ahead of futures returning Sunday. “We're seeing some short-term selling pressure due to the ongoing US action against Venezuela, but I remain bullish in the near term,” analytics account @Wealthmanager reacted in a post on X. Crypto analyst Lennaert Snyder agreed that much hinged on the return of TradFi next week. “There's a lot of geopolitical tension and next week the big players will return. So we'll probably see more volatility on Bitcoin after the weekend,” he told X followers. Bulls also looked to Bitcoin's relatively strong performance against gold over the New Year period. After reaching new all-time highs of $4,551 per ounce on Dec. 26, XAU/USD fell by up to 6% before steadying. As Cointelegraph reported, gold finished 2025 as the year's best-performing major asset, with Bitcoin conversely bringing up the rear despite its own all-time highs in October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canton Network has positioned itself as the primary blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance institutions. Wall Street's adoption of blockchain technology appears to be materializing through private, institutional-grade networks rather than public alternatives. The firm deployed its Distributed Ledger Repo platform on Canton Network in 2023. This platform now processes over $280 billion in daily repo market volumes. The DLR platform enables instantaneous settlement of financial collateral between banking institutions. Banks can track lending activities, bond ownership, and cash settlements in real time. Traditional settlement processes often require multiple days to complete transactions. Canton's infrastructure reduces this timeline to seconds through atomic capabilities. Industry observers note that tokenized assets represent legally binding economic claims. These digital representations mirror traditional financial instruments in economic value. Public blockchains cannot offer the confidentiality that traditional finance demands. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation received SEC approval to tokenize US Treasuries. This regulatory clearance enables tokenization of Depository Trust Company assets. Goldman Sachs built its bond tokenization platform GS DAP on Canton Network. The Calypso system serves over 95 percent of major banking institutions. Banks now manage tokenized collateral within existing risk management software. Additional participants include Bank of America, Santander, Tradeweb, DRW, and Citadel. These institutions utilize Canton for real-time collateral operations and 24/7 market access. The network facilitates settlement of tokenized treasuries against stablecoin instruments. Traditional settlement systems cannot match this operational efficiency and speed. Digital Asset Holdings raised over $450 million to develop Canton Network. Strategic investors include Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, and Citadel. Circle and other blockchain firms also participated in funding rounds. These investors actively use the network rather than functioning as passive providers. Canton succeeded where previous attempts failed by offering neutral infrastructure. Analysts suggest 2026 could mark institutional blockchain adoption reaching critical mass.
