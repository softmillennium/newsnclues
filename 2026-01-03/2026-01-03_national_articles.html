President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military carried out a "large-scale strike" in Venezuela early Saturday morning and took Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife into custody. President Donald Trump announced that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife have been captured and flown out of the country after the U.S. carried out a "large scale strike." The CIA carried out a strike in late December against a dock area inside Venezuela that U.S. officials said was used by drug cartels to load narcotics onto boats. After Saturday's early-morning operation, Venezuela's vice president has demanded proof of life. President Donald Trump released photos Saturday afternoon showing himself and senior members of his cabinet monitoring the early-morning U.S. military operation in Venezuela from Mar-a-Lago. The images, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, show Trump seated at a long table alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, with aides and security personnel standing nearby. Computer screens and communications equipment appear visible in several shots. The photos were taken in the early hours of Saturday morning as U.S. forces carried out what he described as a “large-scale strike” in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The images offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at Trump and his national security team tracking the operation in real time from Florida. As Americans awoke to the news of U.S. military strikes on Venezuela, and the capture and extraction of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, questions are being asked if Maduro was betrayed by someone from his secretive inner circle. That inner circle includes Diosdado Cabello, who currently holds the role of minister of interior, justice, and peace, is widely believed to be as powerful as Maduro. Another member of that inner circle is Vladimir Padrino, the longstanding head of the nation's Armed Forces, who wields enormous power. Both Cabello and Padrino quickly condemned U.S. actions, but their responses so far have rung hollow. "He repeated decades-old Hugo Chavez talking points, stating, "Venezuela rejects with all its strength the presence of these foreign troops which have only brought death, pain and destruction. This invasion represents the greatest tragedy that the country has suffered, which is motivated by an insatiable greed for our strategic resources." Chevron has operated in Venezuela for roughly a century (Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Chevron, the only remaining U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela , said it continues to run its limited operations in “full compliance” with all applicable laws following the predawn capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. “We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. Chevron has maintained a constrained presence in the country through joint ventures with the state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), after other U.S. energy firms exited amid nationalization efforts, sanctions and political instability. President Donald Trump said U.S. energy companies could play a central role in rebuilding the country's oil sector. He added that the United States continues to enforce its embargo on Venezuelan oil. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. would run Venezuela should cause alarm among Americans. Trump during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago told reporters that following strikes on Venezuela's capital Caracas, and the subsequent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday that the U.S. would be running the country. “We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said. But Schumer noted that moving ahead with the strikes and “without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless.” “The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela,” Schumer said. “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans,” he continued. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump both weighed in on why Congress wasn't notified of the strikes — Rubio warned it could have endangered Operation Absolute Resolve while Trump charged that lawmakers leak information. Schumer demanded that the administration brief lawmakers on its objective in Venezuela immediately, and what plan Trump had to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster “that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another." A reporter asked Trump whether Petro should be worried following the U.S. operation in Venezuela in which dictator Nicolás Maduro was captured. So he does have to watch his a--," Trump said. Petro posted a lengthy condemnation of the U.S. operation in Venezuela, claiming it was carried out in violation of the United Nations charter, an argument made by other foreign leaders. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio President Donald Trump offered a simple answer as to why lawmakers weren't notified ahead of Operation Absolute Resolve: Congress leaks. Several lawmakers are furious that they were not notified ahead of the surprise strikes, and subsequent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Saturday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago told reporters that lawmakers weren't notified ahead of time out of concern that it could endanger the operation, but were called right after. He noted that “this is not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on; it was a trigger-based mission in which conditions had to be met night after night.” “We watched and monitored that for a number of days,” Rubio said. “So, it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days. “This would not be good if they leaked, General, I think it would have been maybe a very different result,” he continued. "The embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the U.S. had "overwhelming evidence" against Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. It's both horrible and breathtaking that something like this could have been allowed to take place." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused the Trump administration of running a smokescreen to hide the real reason that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured Saturday. President Donald Trump's pardon last year of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández of a drug trafficking conviction was already a sticking point for several congressional Democrats and some Republicans, but Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues have since argued that it's a point of hypocrisy by the administration in the wake of Maduro's extraction. “And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. "As everyone knows, the oil business in Venezuela has been a bust. They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping and what could have taken place," Trump said. President Donald Trump said at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago that the United States will temporarily run Venezuela after the capture of Nicolás Maduro. "We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition," Trump said from his Palm Beach, Fla., residence. "So we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in. So we are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. And it has to be judicious because that's what we're all about. We want peace, liberty and justice for the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country. President Donald Trump shared an image of Venezuela dictator Nicolás Maduro aboard the U.S.S. The duo are on their way to New York where they will stand trial for criminal charges. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., backed President Donald Trump's decision to arrest Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife amid partisan praise and backlash for the early Saturday operation. “Today's military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives,” Johnson said in a statement on X. “Nicolas Maduro is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans after years of trafficking illegal drugs and violent cartel members into our country — crimes for which he's been properly indicted in U.S. courts and an arrest warrant duly issued — and today he learned what accountability looks like,” he continued. Trump confirmed that Maduro and his wife were captured after strikes and taken from the country after strikes in Venezuela's capital Caracas. The speaker said the president's move “will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country.” And the speaker noted that lawmakers would soon be clued in on what happened over the weekend.“The Trump Administration is working to schedule briefings for Members as Congress returns to Washington next week,” Johnson said. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned U.S. action in Venezuela, saying that it was carried out in violation of the United Nations Charter. In a statement, the Mexican government called for "respect for international law" after the U.S. carried out strikes on Venezuela overnight and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres was "deeply alarmed" after the U.S. carried out strikes in Venezuela and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the Secretary-General, said in a statement to Fox News. "Independently of the situation in Venezuela, these developments constitute a dangerous precedent. He's deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected," Dujarric said. The U.N. Security Council (UNSC) could possibly hold an emergency meeting on Saturday following the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Fox News has learned. Reports indicate that Venezuela could have demanded the meeting. President Donald Trump told "Fox & Friends Weekend" that Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and his wife were taken by helicopter to the U.S.S. The two were captured during an operation on Saturday morning in Caracas. Fox News host Griff Jenkins asked Trump , "Before we let you go, though, can you tell us where Maduro and his wife are right this second?" Well, they'll be heading to New York," Trump said. Griffin interjected, "were they taken to a ship first?" The helicopters took them out, and they went by helicopter on a nice flight. They killed a lot of people to maintain power. Earlier on Saturday, Trump confirmed on Truth Social that the U.S. carried out strikes in Caracas and captured both Maduro and his wife. Fox News has learned that Maduro could make an appearance in federal court in New York, where he was indicted years ago, as soon as Monday. Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) condemned U.S. strikes on Venezuela, saying that the U.S. carried out "an act of armed aggression" that "gives rise to deep concern [and] warrants condemnation." In a longer statement, Russia's MFA called for the prevention of further escalation and urged the U.S. and Venezuela "to focus on finding a solution through dialogue." The Kremlin added that "Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it proclaimed itself in 2014." Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 during the Biden administration. President Donald Trump spoke with "Fox & Friends Weekend" on Saturday morning just hours after the U.S. hit Venezuela and captured its leader Nicolás Maduro. There's nobody else could have done anything like it," Trump said of the historic operation. When asked about critics who have emerged in the hours since the strikes, Trump brushed it off, saying that they were "weak, stupid people." Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro could make an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan as soon as this coming Monday, Fox News is told. The timing could change at this stage, but his appearance will happen "likely Monday," Fox News learned. President Donald Trump said the U.S. carried out a strike on Venezuela early Saturday and captured Maduro and his wife, who have been flown out of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated that Maduro and his wife had already been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Vice President JD Vance stood by President Donald Trump's decision to carry out strikes in Venezuela and to capture dictator Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says," Vance wrote on X. "Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation," he added. World leaders were sharply divided Saturday after the United States launched a large-scale strike on Venezuela and President Donald Trump announced that the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, had been captured and flown out of the country. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez condemned what he called a "criminal attack," writing on X that, "Our zone of peace is being brutally assaulted." Communist Cuba is a supporter of the Maduro government and has been a longtime adversary of the United States. Meanwhile, President Javier Milei of Argentina, a close ally of Trump, praised the news by sharing a previous video of him denouncing Maduro's "narco-terrorist" regime as a regional threat and urging Latin American leaders to back U.S. pressure to end it. Days before he was captured by U.S. forces, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said that his government was open to negotiating an agreement with the U.S. aimed at fighting drug trafficking. He called on the countries to "start talking seriously, with data in hand." "The U.S. government knows, because we've told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready," he said. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba and serves on the House Armed Services Committee, praised the Trump administration for striking Venezuela and capturing Nicolás Maduro. "President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country and the world are safer for it," Gimenez wrote on X. "It's a big day in Florida, where the majority of Venezuelan, Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles reside. This is the community I represent & we are overwhelmed with emotion and hope," Gimenez added. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed Saturday that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores will face the "full wrath of American justice" following their capture by U.S. forces in Venezuela and extraction from the country. In an X post, Bondi reiterated that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York. "On behalf of the entire U.S. DOJ, I would like to thank President Trump for having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American People, and a huge thank you to our brave military who conducted the incredible and highly successful mission to capture these two alleged international narco traffickers," she added. According to the State Department's website, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York in 2020 for narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also reiterated on X that Maduro "was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism." "Nicolas Maduro wasn't just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation," Cotton wrote. The senator added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Maduro would "face justice for his crimes against our citizens." Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reportedly made a statement on television and radio condemning the U.S.'s "grave military aggression" against his country. “This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela,” Maduro reportedly said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reposted a reminder that he long asserted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was not the legitimate president of the country. "Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States," Rubio wrote in a post on X in July that he reposted following Maduro's capture. President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the U.S. carried out overnight strikes in Venezuela and that Maduro had been "captured and flown out of the country." Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez demanded in audio played on state TV that the U.S. provide "proof of life" for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. "We demand that President Donald Trump's government provide immediate proof of life for President Maduro and the First Lady," Rodriguez said, according to Reuters. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said on Saturday that he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio after the U.S. carried out A major strike inside Venezuela. Lee said Rubio told him the actions carried out in Venezuela were to protect U.S. personnel executing an arrest warrant for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. However, after speaking with Rubio, Lee said he believed that "this action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack." The U.S. military carried out a "large-scale strike" in Venezuela early Saturday morning and took Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife into custody, President Donald Trump confirmed. Trump said the operation was conducted with U.S. law enforcement and added that a news conference will take place at Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. on Saturday. At least seven explosions could be heard in Venezuela's capital city of Caracas early Saturday morning, according to The Associated Press, and low-flying aircraft were seen flying over Caracas at about 2 a.m. local time.

President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and would tap Venezuelan's vast oil reserves to sell “large amounts” to other countries. Trump said the U.S. planned to run Venezuela until a transition of power can take place. “We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago news conference where he boasted that this “extremely successful operation should serve as warning to anyone who would threaten American sovereignty or endanger American lives.” The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro, who last appeared on state television Friday while meeting with a delegation of Chinese officials in Caracas. Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on “narco-terrorism” conspiracy charges, but the Justice Department released a new indictment Saturday of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores that described the regime as a “corrupt, illegitimate government” fueled by a drug trafficking operation that flooded the U.S with cocaine. Trump posted on his Truth Social account a photo that he said showed Maduro in custody, including blindfolded and in a sweatsuit. Smoke raises at La Carlota airport after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026. Early Saturday, multiple explosions rang out and low-flying aircraft swept through the Venezuelan capital. Maduro's government accused the United States of attacking civilian and military installations, calling it an “imperialist attack” and urging citizens to take to the streets. Some Venezuelan civilians and members of the military were killed, said Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, without giving a number.

Video obtained from Caracas and an unidentified coastal city showed tracers and smoke clouding the landscape as repeated muted explosions illuminated the night sky. Other footage showed cars passing on a highway as blasts illuminated the hills behind them. Smoke was seen rising from the hangar of a military base in Caracas, while another military installation in the capital was without power. Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Maduro and Flores were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured. Under Venezuelan law, Rodríguez would take over from Maduro. There was no confirmation that had happened, though she did issue a statement after the strike, demanding proof of life for Maduro and his wife. Last week, the CIA was behind a drone strike at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels — the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September. Maduro has decried the U.S. military operations as a thinly veiled effort to oust him from power. Venezuela's ruling party has held power since 1999, when Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez took office, promising to uplift poor people and later to implement a self-described socialist revolution. His 2018 reelection was widely considered a sham because the main opposition parties were banned from participating. In a demonstration of how polarizing a figure Maduro is, people variously took to the streets to deplore his capture and celebrate it.

Scared, like everyone,” said Caracas resident Noris Prada, who sat on an empty avenue looking down at his phone. “Venezuelans woke up scared, many families couldn't sleep.” In the Chilean capital of Santiago, people waved Venezuelan flags and banging pots and pans as vehicles passed by honking at them. The Armed Services committees in both houses of Congress, which have jurisdiction over military matters, have not been notified by the administration of any actions, according to a person familiar with the matter and granted anonymity to discuss it. Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he had seen no evidence that would justify Trump striking Venezuela without approval from Congress and demanded an immediate briefing by the administration on “its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision.” Men watch smoke rising from a dock after explosions were heard at La Guaira port, Venezuela, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026.

Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado called Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro the head of a 'criminal structure' on 'Fox & Friends Weekend' in November 2025. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado issued an open call for a transfer of power Saturday, urging the military to abandon Nicolás Maduro's government and recognize opposition-backed candidate Edmundo González as president after the U.S. said Maduro had been captured. Machado's statement came hours after President Donald Trump announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro following what he described as "large-scale" military strikes targeting the Venezuelan government. Trump said Maduro and his wife were flown out of the country, a move that would mark the most direct U.S. military action against a Latin American head of state in decades. "The hour of freedom has arrived," wrote in a post on X. Those of us who risked everything for democracy on July 28th. Those of us who elected Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate President of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who comprise it." It remained unclear Saturday whether senior commanders have shifted allegiance or whether the opposition has secured control of state institutions. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado issued an open call for a transfer of power Saturday, urging the military to abandon Nicolás Maduro's government and recognize opposition-backed candidate Edmundo González as president after the U.S. said Maduro had been captured. Machado also called on Venezuelans inside the country to remain "vigilant, active and organized," signaling that further instructions would be communicated through official opposition channels. Machado and González have repeatedly argued that the July 28 presidential election was stolen, pointing to an opposition-run parallel vote count that they say shows González won by a wide margin. Machado called on Venezuela's opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia to be recognized as the president. Venezuela's electoral authorities, which are controlled by Maduro allies, declared him the winner with just under 52% of the vote, compared with roughly 43% for González. The government has rejected allegations of fraud. The opposition, however, says it collected and published tally sheets from polling stations nationwide showing González received about two-thirds of the vote, compared with roughly 30% for Maduro — a claim cited by several foreign governments that declined to recognize the official results. Machado's statement came hours after President Donald Trump announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro following what he described as "large-scale" military strikes targeting the Venezuelan government. Machado won the opposition's primary by a landslide before being barred from running by Maduro's government, forcing the coalition to rally behind González as a substitute candidate. Throughout the campaign, González publicly acknowledged Machado as the movement's leader, with Machado continuing to direct strategy, messaging and voter mobilization efforts.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the increase in sports betting and the concerns around betting scandals on ‘Special Report.' Former MLB All-Star Lenny Dykstra faces drug charges following a traffic stop by Pennsylvania State Police on New Year's Day. Pike County is about 25 miles east of Scranton, where Dykstra lives. Former MLB player Lenny Dykstra, charged with threats against an Uber driver, rejects a plea offer before Union County Superior Court Judge Joseph Donahue. Lawyer Michael Brucki stands next to him. Police noted that charges were filed against Dykstra, though there was no specification on what drugs were allegedly found. Dykstra's lawyer, Matthew Blit, said in a statement to The Associated Press that he believes these charges will be "swiftly absolved" as the vehicle did not belong to the ex-ballplayer. Dykstra was also not accused of being under the influence of a substance at the scene, per Blit. He was sentenced to more than six months after being found guilty of hiding baseball gloves and other items from his days in MLB. Dykstra also served a three-year sentence for pleading no contest to Grand Theft Auto and providing a false financial statement, claiming he owed more than $31 million while only having $50,000 in assets. His prison sentences ran concurrent with each other. Lenny Dykstra #4 of the Philadelphia Phillies looks on from the dugout against the San Francisco Giants during an Major League Baseball game circa 1993 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California. Finally, in 2019, Dykstra dealt with numerous legal problems, including pleading guilty on behalf of his company, Titan Equity Group, to illegally renting out rooms in a New Jersey home he owned. In the same year, Dykstra had drug and terrorist threat charges dropped following an altercation with an Uber driver. Police said at the time they found cocaine, MDMA and marijuana among Dykstra's belongings, though his lawyer claimed the incident to be "overblown." Dykstra was a three-time All-Star during his 12-year MLB career, which began with the New York Mets and ended with the Philadelphia Phillies. Lenny Dykstra attends the 69th Annual  Artists and Writers Softball Game at Herrick Park on Aug. 19, 2017 in East Hampton, New York. All three of Dykstra's All-Star seasons came in Philadelphia, where he was traded to from New York during the 1989 season. Dykstra finished second in MVP voting during the 1993 season after leading the National League with 194 hits, 143 runs and 129 walks while slashing .305/.420/.382 with 44 doubles and 66 RBI.

Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt discusses the legality of U.S. forces' capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and what lies ahead for the Venezuelan people. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reportedly made a statement on television and radio early Saturday as the U.S. strikes against his country unfolded, describing them as an "attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela." The remarks came before President Donald Trump announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were "captured and flown out of the country" following a "large scale strike" carried out by the U.S. military. Attorney General Pam Bondi later said Maduro and Flores were indicted on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy. In comments aired on state television and radio, Maduro alleged that U.S. forces attacked civilian and military sites in Venezuela's capital of Caracas, as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to The Miami Herald. "This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela," Maduro reportedly said as he stood alongside military and government officials. "It is an attempt to impose a colonial war and force political change by violence." Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, right, meets with Qi Xiaoqi, Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping, in Caracas, Venezuela, on Jan. 2, 2026. The U.S. has been carrying out a military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in recent months. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro addresses supporters during a rally marking the anniversary of the 19th-century Battle of Santa Ines in Caracas, Venezuela, on Dec. 10, 2025. Maduro's government cast the U.S. strikes on Saturday as part of a larger American effort to seize Venezuela's oil and mineral reserves, according to The Miami Herald. The newspaper reported that state TV broadcasted images of Venezuelan soldiers deploying to strategic infrastructure and officials holding emergency meetings. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro addresses members of the armed forces, Bolivarian Militia, police, and civilians during a rally against a possible escalation of U.S. actions toward the country, at Fort Tiuna military base in Caracas, Venezuela, on Nov. 25, 2025. As part of Maduro's response, he also signed a decree that declared a nationwide state of "external disturbance," which gives his government sweeping powers during emergencies, including mobilizing security forces and limiting certain civil liberties, The Miami Herald added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican lawmakers are praising President Donald Trump for his capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while Democrats are raising questions about the legality of the U.S. special forces operation on foreign soil. “I just spoke to @SecRubio, who confirmed that Maduro is in U.S. custody and will face justice for his crimes against our citizens,” Cotton wrote. Nicolas Maduro wasn't just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation. That's why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. “After voting No in December, Republicans in Congress must now join Democrats to grab hold the steering wheel of Venezuela policy to prevent this capture from spiraling into a blood for oil war,” Auchincloss wrote. “I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. But Wasserman Schultz warned that “cutting off the head of a snake is fruitless if it just regrows” before encouraging Venezuelans “to seat their true, democratically elected president, Edmundo González.” “I'll demand answers as to why Congress and the American people were bypassed in this effort,” she wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The flames of Le Constellation touched far too many young people on New Year's Eve. In the days since the blaze, locals told CNN they were lost in the what ifs of that night: last-minute changes of plans, choosing to celebrate outside the crowded bar or with family instead of friends. “It should've been us”; “I was supposed to go too”; “My siblings were there the night before,” locals told us in the days after the fire. Now, those who were texting with presumed victims just hours before the disaster are glued to their phones: locked in a desperate wait for any information about friends who simply don't reply any more. In a bar popular with teenagers, there's a growing realisation realization in Crans-Montana that many of the dead are some of the youngest in this community of locals and holidaymakers. For their friends – children themselves – the events of that night, beamed around social networks via horrifying videos of fiery panic, are all they talk about. “I feel like even if we want to turn the page it's impossible,” she said, “The subject comes around and around.” Friday morning, as journalists and mourners gathered before Le Constellation, one scene captured the raw emotion still coursing through this small community. A father, his face soaked with tears, crumpled to his knees as he neared the bar. After a desperate scrabble for information, through two dark nights and a difficult day, he still didn't know if his son's body may lie in Le Constellation, his brother told CNN. According to Swiss officials, a handful of patients in hospital from the fire have still not yet been identified. “I mean, there's probably no chance” he's alive, she told CNN after nearly two full days of no news of his fate. She asked to remain anonymous out of respect for her family. For Leonor Marques, 17, who is still waiting on news of two friends she knew were at Le Constellation on Wednesday night, not knowing their fate is the most difficult. Amid the tragedy, she said she had to take took some comfort in knowing that two of her friends were in medically induced comas in a Lausanne hospital. Surgical resident Amandine Chavanon, 25, holidaying in Crans-Montana was woken by her mother after her teenage brother called them from outside Le Constellation. Rushing to the scene to help, she spent hours triaging badly burned victims, offering life-saving aid alongside first responders and passersby. Focused on treating patients on the floor of the bank where she was inserting IV drips and calming burned survivors, identifying them wasn't their priority. Stumbling out of the bar, she said many of the young revellers, “didn't really know what's happening.” Working a New Year's Eve nightshift at a nearby hospital, doctor friends recounted to Chavanon having to turn away distraught parents looking for their children as they struggled to deal with the influx of patients. As pictures emerged from the last moments in Le Constellation before the fire took hold, revellers can be seen dancing beneath a shower of sparks, flying out of champagne bottles lifted inches from the ceiling, coated in insulation foam. In video shot likely moments later, young people dance, laugh and film the flames as a young man bats in vain at the flames with a towel. With authorities directing their ongoing investigation at the role of the sparklers, testimony from survivors and those that rushed to help is beginning to fill in the picture of that fateful night. Paolo Campolo, a local resident being hailed for pulling revellers out of the burning bar, said that he had to force a rear door of the bar to free people trapped inside. Multiple teenagers CNN spoke to following the fire, who said they had visited Le Constellation many times, said and that a rear exit to the bar was usually locked. “Everything was done according to the rules,” Jacques Moretti he said. CNN previously reached out to both Moretti and co-owner Jessica Anne Jeanne Moretti through their businesses. Processing this disaster is not yet on people's minds. On Thursday evening, a father walked past the shrouded fences that now mark Le Constellation, his toddler perched on his shoulders. “What happened there?” she asked him, his face contorting as he searched for his reply, the weight of the tragedy too much to distil.</p>

President Donald Trump is addressing the United States's overnight strikes on Venezuela during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

The press briefing is set to begin at 11 a.m. on Saturday morning. 

MADURO ‘CAPTURED' AND TAKEN OUT OF VENEZUELA AFTER US MILITARY OPERATION IN CARACAS: TRUMP

The U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife during the special operation, according to Trump, who said in his first television interview following the strikes that the U.S. would be “making the decision” about who should lead the country next.

“We'll be involved in it very much. And we want to do liberty for the people. We want to, you know, have a great relationship. I think the people of Venezuela are very, very happy because they love the United States. You know, they were run by, essentially, a dictatorship,” Trump said during an appearance on Fox and Friends.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The ability to actually change your life is a very modern kind of progress. Here how to make it real in 2026. The gyms are suddenly crowded; the freshly bought journals are pristine; and suddenly, everyone you know is trying to learn Italian like they're about to become a deep-cover spy in Tuscany. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. Or, at least, it is for a few days. January 9, the second Friday of the month this year, is colloquially known as “Quitter's Day,” because it's the date nearly half of all people abandon their New Year's resolutions. It's enough to make you wonder why we bother in the first place. But the New Year is one of the few moments when our culture collectively agrees that it's normal to try to change. Even today, not everyone has that freedom, and no one has it equally, but for a huge slice of the people reading this story, our range of plausible life trajectories is far wider than it was for the vast bulk of human history, when life paths were far more limited and largely fixed at birth. “Get in shape.” “Be healthier.” “Write more.” Those aren't actions; they're umbrella identities with disputed borders, which means every day trying to live up to them in all their vague glory becomes an enervating negotiation. Exactly what shape are you trying to get into, and how many edges can it have? Ten minutes of meditation, two pages of journaling, one lap around the park, one email to that friend you haven't seen in too long. Here's a quick test: If you can't describe your habit in one sentence that includes the all-important words when and where, it's not ready yet. If this feels like lowering your standards, that's okay. What you're trying to do is lower the threshold for action, so you can build up from a solid foundation. 1), and you can engineer the “prompt” by tying it to a stable cue. Pick an anchor that's mechanical and reliable — coffee brewing, shower ending, laptop opening — not something fuzzy like “after dinner,” which changes shape depending on how chaotic your day is. What's the biggest difference between disciplined and undisciplined people? What psychologists call implementation intentions — “If X happens, then I will do Y” — can help reinforce habits because they essentially act as pre-decisions. Instead of relying on non-renewable willpower (see tip No. 2), you decide in advance what you'll do when a reliable cue appears — or just as important, if a reliable problem pops up. The point here is to limit the pressure you're putting on your future self — who, after all, is the poor guy who has to fulfill all these resolutions — by planning ahead for what could go wrong. A goal that lives only in your head is easy to renegotiate at 11:47 pm. Two simple ways to resist that temptation are feedback and accountability. Self-monitoring shows up again and again as a core component of successful behavior change programs, with research demonstrating that more frequent tracking is consistently associated with better outcomes. This does not mean you have to become a quantified-self maximalist, though admittedly, I'm writing as someone who gets three separate sleep scores each night. But you do need a way to make the desired behavior visible. Pick one metric you can record in under 30 seconds: But, the real secret sauce of accountability is when you add in additional eyes. No need to respond.” (Just don't send this text at 11:47 pm.) This is the modern, low-touch version of a very old technology to encourage good habits: regular meetings and structured belonging. Let's end by going to the other side of the resolution spectrum: the big stuff — new career direction, a move to a different city, a spiritual shift. The common mistake is treating such massive changes as a binary, irreversible decision, which can cause you to freeze under the uncertainty. Instead of thinking you have no choice but to stay or go, run a pilot — a time-boxed, reversible experiment that lets you try the change at a smaller scale before you reorganize your whole life around it. What does this path actually feel like on a Tuesday? The point of all this is to make change less moralistic and more mechanical. If you're lucky enough to have some real freedom — the ability to choose new habits, new skills, maybe even a new path — that is itself a kind of progress worth recognizing. This New Year can just be the one where you cash in that psychological coupon gifted by many centuries of progress and build the kind of change that lasts through Quitter's Day and well beyond.

By 8 a.m., the DJ is pumping out hypnotic bass beats for an enthusiastic crowd of revelers who are jumping in unison in the clear, bright light of day, with nothing but caffeine to fuel their booze-free rave. New York-based outfit Daybreaker and Morning Gloryville in London have been throwing these kinds of raves for more than a decade. While living and working in cities like Miami and Los Angeles as a French DJ and music producer, Alexis Duvivier, better known as Aazar, said one of the things he missed most about home was French boulangeries, or bakeries. So when it came time to celebrate the release of his single “Diva” in 2019, Duvivier, 36, wanted to create a free event for his fans, merging his two passions — music and baked goods. He hosted his first early evening rave at The French Bastards in the 11th arrondissement, which had opened a year earlier and quickly distinguished itself from other bakeries for its irreverent and innovative menu. As Aazar spun for the crowds against a backdrop of baguettes, trays of free pastries were distributed to the revelers, making for fun, unusual visuals on social media. This year, clips of DJs Bob Sinclair and Peggy Gou playing for excited crowds also went viral, making The French Bastards one of the most unlikely rave hot spots in the French capital. “I didn't choose a bakery because I was looking for an unusual location, but because for me it represents France and represents what I love,” said Duvivier, who also hosts events across Europe as Bakery Session. However, in the years since, the movement has grown bigger than Duvivier's initial intent, circling the globe and gaining momentum, as it reflects shifting global trends and responds to a set of unmet needs. “In Korea, there's a lot of competition and mental illness in society,” says Park, the Seoul Morning Coffee Club (SMCC) founder. While South Korea is not unique in dealing with the issue of deteriorating mental health, burnout and a loneliness epidemic in this fragmented, digital age, suffering is particularly acute in this country. In a country notorious for its hyper-competitive, status-centered social structure, work-life balance in South Korea can be difficult to manage, with long work hours and a cutthroat job market. But in recent years, younger generations have been increasingly rejecting the status quo, prioritizing their wellness and seeking community in offline events like those organized by the Seoul Morning Coffee Club (the group also hosts morning runs, book clubs and coffee chats) that allow them to blow off steam and boost their mental health. “Compared to other countries, a lot of Korean people are very self-conscious,” says Park Jihyun, who also volunteers as a coffee chat host. “But the coffee rave lets you be yourself and helps introverts and those who are self-conscious grow out of their shell.” While Seoul is known for its thrumming nightlife, the raves also cater to an underserved demographic in the city: morning people. And within this group, many tend to lead healthy, booze-free lifestyles, which can be isolating in a drinking culture where professional and personal relationships are often forged over a night of heavy drinking. For British content creator Freya Hawksley, 23, who has been living in Seoul for the past five years, the event is a win-win, both as a morning person and non-drinker. Seoul raves are also safe spaces: wholesome, family-friendly and multi-generational raves with babies and tots bopping to EDM alongside older adults. “As a woman, I feel so much safer,” she added. Hawksley was invited to the launch event as a friend of the organizers but has since returned on her own. It's a similar story in London, where DJs Manpal Bhullar (Mezz B), 32, and Vishal Kamle (Chndra), 31, brought sober, daytime raves to coffee shops earlier this year. “I'm at that age where I don't want to be out until the early morning, drinking and clubbing,” Kamle says. “It's built around us in a way, reflecting our era.” It's a surprising admission for the duo, who are used to playing late-night clubs as Lost in Kaydnce. But the founders of Coffee Gen say that London nightlife has changed over the years, becoming too commercialized, impersonal and prohibitively expensive. That disillusionment is shared by many young Britons. According to a 2025 consumer report from Night Time Industries Association UK published in February, 61% of the 2,000 respondents aged 18-30 reported going out less frequently in the last year, citing financial pressures, safety concerns and transportation barriers. Matthew Campoli, co-founder of The Coffee Party in Toronto, also points out that the new genre of sober raves has succeeded in shaking up a stale and stagnant nightlife scene that lost part of its luster after the pandemic. “I think there's a need for genuine connection again. Social anxieties have developed and routines were crushed, and a lot of people started to prioritize themselves during that time which is why interests have shifted.” For Franklin Vaz, 33, the arrival of sober coffee raves in Toronto earlier this year aligned with his own lifestyle changes, as he had decided to quit alcohol altogether. When one of his DJ friends who was spinning at a Coffee Party event told him about the gathering, Vaz jumped at the idea of joining like-minded people. While waiting to get his drink, however, Vaz became instantly smitten by the “radiant” face of a woman who was also waiting in line and struck up conversation. Turned out that both were avid runners and led clean lifestyles: two days later, they went on their first date where they ran the distance of a half marathon, 13 miles, together. So it's pushed me to be the best version of myself too.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump wants to tamp down on public debates about his health. The oldest president to assume office has been dogged by questions about recent doctors' visits, bruises on his hands and whether he's fallen asleep during public events. Trump dismissed these concerns in an apparently impromptu interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, in which he blamed the visible bruises on a high daily dose of aspirin — more than his doctors recommend — and said he has plenty of energy. The president, who for years criticized former President Joe Biden's age and cognitive health, followed up Friday with a Truth Social post saying he had aced his “third straight” cognitive test. But the disclosures have done little to quell reemerging scrutiny of his health. In fact, here are five questions his most recent health disclosures have raised. He is the latest in a line of personal physicians who have praised Trump's physical health and cognition. When Trump entered his first term, he kept on Dr. Ronny Jackson, who had served as President Barack Obama's personal physician and grew to be one of Trump's close personal advisers after a glowing news conference about the then-45th president's “incredible genes.” Jackson stepped down from his White House role in March 2018 when Trump nominated him to lead the Veterans Affairs Department. He now serves in the House of Representatives as a Republican from Texas. Jackson was followed by Dr. Sean Conley, a Navy emergency physician who in 2019 said that Trump was “in very good health” and that he expected the president “will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.” During the Covid-19 pandemic, Conley prescribed hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that had gained popularity among conservatives as an alternative — though unproven— therapy to aid against infection from the virus, as a preventive measure for Trump. The White House physicians were preceded by Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump's longtime personal physician in New York City. During his first presidential campaign, Bornstein proclaimed in an effusive letter that Trump “will be healthiest individual ever elected” president. After the election, he said Trump officials raided his office for the president's personal medical records, an account disputed by administration officials who said it was a routine handover of his private records. The president said he takes a higher dose of aspirin than recommended by his doctors because “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.” He blamed that high dose for the visible bruises on his hands in recent months. Aspirin used to be widely prescribed as a preventative for cardiovascular disease, but that has shifted. In 2019, medical experts advised against routine aspirin use unless a person has a heart condition or other health risks, citing the heightened risk of internal bleeding. When they do recommend preventive aspirin, doctors typically advise an 81 milligram dose, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. People who take full-dose aspirin are more prone to having GI bleeding, especially if they have ulcers and things like that,” Farah said. It is a common condition, particularly as people age, and can be worsened by lack of physical activity. In some cases, aspirin may also be used to help treat the condition. In a statement to CNN, Barbabella asserted that “President Trump's medical evaluations and laboratory results continue to show excellent metabolic health, and have revealed his cardiovascular health puts him 14 years younger than his age.” The president had told reporters that it was an MRI — a lengthier, more intensive scan focused on soft tissue — and was part of his routine physical. However, Trump told the Journal that he had a CT scan. A cardiovascular CT scan is typically used to estimate long-term heart attack risk or rule out significant blockages, said Cherian, the Chicago-based internal medicine physician. “Bottom line, CT scans don't ‘prove' your heart is safe, but they can refine risk, guide prevention, reassure when normal and escalate care when abnormal,” Cherian told CNN in an email. Trump has been adamant for years that presidential and vice presidential candidates should undergo “cognitive assessments.” The president renewed this call Friday in a Truth Social post declaring that he had scored “100%” on his third cognitive test. “I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination,” he wrote. It is not clear what test he was referring to in his post, and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment. He took the test again in April 2025, reportedly scoring 30 out of 30. According to Cherian, “a normal or high score means no obvious cognitive impairment was detected,” he said. Trump “has nothing to hide, unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, who hid from the press and lied about his clear physical and mental decline,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The president also told the Journal that he gets little sleep, finds most exercise boring and has not made changes to his diet, which has favored fast food such as McDonald's burgers and Filet-O-Fish. Trump attributes his health to “very good genetics.” But experts say this is just one piece of the puzzle, particularly as people age. “If we were honest and open about this in a more explicit way, we might actually be able to solve the problem of the American health crisis.” That message is the crux of the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Freeman pointed out. Kennedy “is trying his best to move the needle on nutrition, but it seems like the president doesn't seem to resonate with any of those things,” Freeman said. “It's a very interesting time where politics and health are crossing in ways that you never anticipate.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. military “captured” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after a special forces military operation in Caracas, President Donald Trump announced. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow,” he said in a post on Truth Social. The operation is unprecedented in modern history, and marks the first time a head of state has been taken captive by a rival nation in an opening special forces operation. Rodríguez will face even worse legitimacy issues than Maduro, however, and pressure from the democratic opposition is sure to increase. He didn't address the apparent abduction of Maduro. Trump provided further details of the operation in a brief phone interview with the New York Times. Trump began ratcheting up pressure against Maduro shortly after taking office, putting a $50 million bounty on his head. Maduro was charged with widespread corruption, running a narcoterrorist group, and drug trafficking. Maduro's fate in the U.S. is another matter. He may face charges in a U.S. court of law, given the allegations against him. His arrest is guaranteed to draw widespread outrage not just from Maduro's allies, including Russia, Iran, and China, but from other countries concerned with diplomatic norms as well. Videos of explosions hitting major military and government targets were posted across social media beginning at around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday. Simultaneously, videos showed helicopters of various types hovering over the city. The operation lasted around one hour, with explosions reported from around 2 a.m. local time to 3 a.m. local time. The U.S. attempted a similar operation in 1989 to capture Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega as part of Operation Just Cause. U.S. special operations soldiers, including Delta Force, raided several hideouts hoping to capture the drug trafficker, but came up empty-handed. This is a breaking news story and has been updated.</p>

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) It turns out, love may benefit from a little less labor. Whillans studies the “tradeoffs people make between time and money.” “When you spend money to save time — hiring an accountant, a babysitter, a cleaner — you feel more control over your life,” she said. She advises couples to take a “time audit” — examining how they spend their hours and what small changes could reclaim even a few moments. Whillans' team tracked busy, dual-income couples — partners working full-time who often report feeling time-starved — and found consistent patterns. In one six-week diary study, couples who made “time-saving purchases” on a given day were happier and more satisfied with their relationships. “Think of that half hour not as an opportunity to send more emails, but as a chance to spend time with your partner.” Targol Hasankhani, a Chicago-based marriage and family therapist, stressed that while outsourcing domestic labor can ease daily stress, it doesn't replace communication. “If conflict around chores is rooted in something deeper — like inequity or not feeling heard — hiring a cleaner won't solve that,” she said. Couples must dig deeper to address problems with many layers. “It opens up time and space, but couples still have to know how to show up for each other in that space,” Hasankhani said. Casey Mulligan Walsh, 71, a former speech pathologist and author in upstate New York, said the best part about hiring a housecleaner once a week was that it freed up time for her and her husband to spend together. “My favorite day of the week was coming home to a clean house,” she said. “We'd go get coffee together instead of arguing about who should vacuum.” Getting started on delegating household tasks isn't easy for some couples, Whillans said. For one Colorado couple, outsourcing started as an act of love. “When I started dating, my now-husband noticed how hard I was working — at my job, at home and as a single mom,” said Melissa Jones, a 45-year-old teacher in Pueblo. “After that, I kept it up on my own for years. When my husband and I moved in together, we decided to continue.” In Miami, Elizabeth Willard, 59, runs The Pickled Beet, a culinary service preparing customized meals. “Most of the people I cook for are trying to invest in their health but don't have the time,” she said, noting that families often juggle mixed dietary needs. Her clients, often families with children and two working parents, are “not fighting over what's for dinner.</p>

(AP Photo/Marc Levy) Communities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources. In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. But as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests. “Because that's where it's literally going, is in my backyard.” A growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more. Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he'd worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people's yards. Data Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development. Between April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. “I've been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I'd guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I've ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition. In Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions. Losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Lawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.” Even with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact. “You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. Still, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers. '” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers. Developers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat. In Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city's environmental review was adequate. They say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it. Rebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm. She found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle. “I don't think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Wicked” composer Stephen Schwartz says he will not appear at the Kennedy Center after its board voted to attach President Donald Trump's name to the venue — becoming the latest artist to push back against the president's takeover of Washington's most iconic performing arts center. The Oscar and Grammy-award winning composer said in a statement, “The Kennedy Center was founded to be an apolitical home for artists of all nationalities and all ideologies. It is no longer apolitical, and appearing there has become an ideological statement. The center's website had listed Schwartz as appearing in a gala with the Washington National Opera in May, and included a link to buy tickets to the performance, but it was removed from the website Friday afternoon. “He was never signed and I've never had a single conversation on him since arriving,” Grenell said in a post on X, calling reports of Schwartz's cancelation “totally bogus.” A spokesman for Schwartz said the composer and a person associated with the Washington National Opera had been in communication about his “possible participation” in a May gala, and they had last spoken in February 2025. “Having not heard anything further after that point, he assumed—incorrectly, as it turns out—that the event was no longer moving forward,” the spokesman, Michael Cole, said in an email to CNN. Cole added that Schwartz had only learned Thursday night that the event was still scheduled. The Kennedy Center opened in 1971, designated by Congress as a living memorial to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. But a stream of artists have canceled their appearances since Trump purged the center's existing board and installed a slate of loyalists to oversee the center last year. Since then, the center has cut staff and reevaluated its programming. The New York City-based dance company Doug Varone and Dancers is among those who cancelled their upcoming performances. The company's director, Doug Varone, appearing on CNN's “Erin Burnett OutFront” on Friday said the decision to cancel was unanimous — despite the financial hit from lost revenue. “I can't imagine any artist wanting to step through those doors right now with his name on that building.” The decision by artists to bow out of scheduled appearances prompted threats of legal action from the Kennedy Center against some of the artists. But it's unclear whether anybody looking to challenge the renaming would have legal standing to do so, experts previously told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casey Dawson, of Park City, Utah, right, and Ethan Cepuran, of Glen Ellyn, lllinois, left, compete in the men's 5,000 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials for long track speed skating at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. MILWAUKEE (AP) — Four years after showing up late for the Beijing Olympics and missing one of his races because of a case of COVID-19, U.S. long track speedskater Casey Dawson is enjoying what he jokingly terms his “villain arc,” peaking at the right time ahead of the Milan Cortina Games. Dawson secured a spot for next month in the men's 5,000 meters — an event he was forced to skip in 2022 while sick — by winning at that distance at the U.S. Olympic trials in 6 minutes, 12.857 seconds on Friday night. “I actually got COVID two or three weeks before going to the competition. Tested positive for 50 straight tests,” said Dawson, a 25-year-old from Park City, Utah. “Couldn't go over to the Games. Showed up 12 hours before my 1,500 meters. But this time around, I'm just looking forward to getting there smoothly and just getting a little bit of redemption.” And then, with a chuckle, Dawson added: “It's kind of fun to have, like, my villain arc, I would call it. Just coming back and having some fun.” Ethan Cepuran was about 6 1/2 seconds back Friday, finishing next in 6:19.335. Dawson already had secured the lone U.S. place for Milan in the men's 10,000 — a race not being contested at these trials — and also will be part of the trio for men's team pursuit at the Olympics. As of now, the United States does not have a berth in Milan for that distance, but one of its athletes could end up in the field if another country relinquishes an opening. “It's hard to wait,” said Myers, a 21-year-old from Lino Lakes, Minnesota. The U.S. Olympic roster for long track won't become official until the four-day trials at the Pettit National Ice Center wrap up on Monday. One element that could come into play is that the Americans are allowed to bring a maximum of eight men and six women to these Winter Games. The 21-year-old from Kewaskum, a town about 40 miles north of Milwaukee, is not just competing at home this week; he's racing at the same rink where he first began taking lessons as a kid. At both the 2023 and 2024 world championships, Stolz earned titles in each of the 500, 1,000 and 1,500 meters. He's already pre-qualified for the Olympics based on performances at those three distances. All he really needs to do to lock down berths on the squad for the Feb. 6-22 Milan Cortina Games is show up at the starting line this week.</p>
