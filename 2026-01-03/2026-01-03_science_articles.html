                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Archaeologists discovered clues to a fire in Guatemala from between 733 and 881 AD that they say represents a key turning point in Maya rule—a very public turning point. “Rather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we view it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself and the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.” The new leadership regime welcomed a non-royal leader called Papmalil, and there is little in the written record indicating how he came to power. The study's authors, led by Christina Halperin at the University of Montreal, state that Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of prosperity. That new era may have had a dramatic beginning. Included with the bodies were 1,470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads, plaques, and mosaics, along with large blades—all representing a “single burning event.” The quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate they came from a royal tomb, likely belonging to multiple individuals. The authors state that the event “appears to have bene an act of desecration: it was dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no effort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the tomb blocks deposited on top of them as construction fill.” It all likely made for a “dramatic public affair” meant to be charged with emotion. “It could dramatically mark,” they wrote, “the dismantling of an ancient regime.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research shows that time-restricted eating does not lead to measurable improvements in metabolic or cardiovascular health when calorie intake remains unchanged. These findings come from the ChronoFast study led by Prof. Olga Ramich and were published in Science Translational Medicine. The approach has become popular as a simple strategy to support weight management and metabolic health. Animal studies show that TRE can protect rodents from diet-related obesity and metabolic problems. Despite its popularity, past research on TRE has produced mixed results. Many studies have not been able to determine whether observed health improvements came from shorter eating windows, unintentional calorie reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, most earlier trials did not carefully track calorie intake or control for other factors that could influence metabolic outcomes. The goal was to test whether an eight-hour eating window could improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic markers when calorie intake was kept constant. The study used a randomized crossover design and included 31 women with overweight or obesity. Throughout both phases, participants ate nearly identical meals with the same calorie and nutrient content (isocaloric). Continuous glucose monitoring tracked blood sugar levels over 24 hours while food intake was recorded in detail. Human biology follows internally generated rhythms that roughly align with the length of a day, which is why they are known as circadian clocks (Latin: circa and dia). These rhythms help regulate nearly every physiological process, including sleep and metabolism. Almost all cells in the body contain their own internal clock, which can be influenced by light, physical activity, and food timing. To measure individual circadian phases, Prof. Dr. Achim Kramer developed the BodyTime assay. The ChronoFast study used this method and confirmed that eating schedules can shift internal clocks in humans. Despite expectations based on earlier research, the ChronoFast study found no clinically meaningful changes in insulin sensitivity, blood sugar, blood fats, or inflammatory markers after the two-week interventions. "Our results suggest that the health benefits observed in earlier studies were likely due to unintended calorie reduction, rather than the shortened eating period itself," explains Ramich. While metabolic measures remained largely unchanged, the timing of meals did affect circadian rhythms. "The timing of food intake acts as a cue for our biological rhythms -- similar to light," says first author Beeke Peters. Future research will need to explore whether combining time-restricted eating with reduced calorie intake produces stronger benefits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers are testing a new oral medication called zoliflodacin that could offer a simpler way to treat gonorrhea, especially strains that no longer respond well to existing antibiotics. In a late-stage phase 3 clinical trial published in The Lancet, scientists found that a single dose of this pill worked just as well as the current standard treatment used today. Phase 3 trials are the final and largest testing stage before a drug can be approved. In this case, the results suggest zoliflodacin may be ready to become a real-world option. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems, including infertility. One of the biggest challenges in treating gonorrhea is antibiotic resistance. Over time, bacteria can adapt and survive drugs that once killed them. This approach works, but it requires access to injections and careful medical supervision. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either zoliflodacin or the standard two-drug treatment. More than 90 percent of genital infections were cured with the single-dose pill. Approval would allow the drug to be prescribed more widely. It could simplify care, support community-led treatment programs, reduce reliance on injections, and help slow the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhea.

The positive effect of exercise on the immune system is widely acknowledged, but the molecular response of immune cells to exercise remains largely unknown. Here, we perform mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at a depth of >6000 proteins. Comparing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), matched for time and workload, we identify versatile changes in the proteomic makeup of PBMCs and reveal profound alterations, related to effector function and immune cell activation pathways within one hour following exercise. These changes are more pronounced after HIIE compared to MICE and occur despite identical immune cell mobilization patterns between the two exercise conditions. We further identify an immunoproteomic signature that effectively predicts cardiorespiratory fitness, thus allowing insights into potential exercise-triggered adaptations and immunological health benefits that are mediated by exercise. This study provides a reliable data resource that expands our knowledge on how exercise modulates the immune system, and delivers biological evidence supporting the WHO 2020 guidelines, which highlight exercise intensity as a relevant factor to maintain health.
